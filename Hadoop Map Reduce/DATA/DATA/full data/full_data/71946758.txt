71946758	a modern cinderella  or the little old shoe  and other stories   by  louisa may alcott     contents    a modern cinderella or the little old shoe   debbys debut   brothers   nellys hospital     a modern cinderella  or  the little old shoe   how it was lost  among green new england hills stood an ancient house manygabled mossyroofed and quaintly built but picturesque and pleasant to the eye for a brook ran babbling through the orchard that encompassed it about a gardenplat stretched upward to the whispering birches on the slope and patriarchal elms stood sentinel upon the lawn as they had stood almost a century ago when the revolution rolled that way and found them young  one summer morning when the air was full of country sounds of mowers in the meadow blackbirds by the brook and the low of kine upon the hillside the old house wore its cheeriest aspect and a certain humble history began  nan  yes di  and a head brownlocked blueeyed softfeatured looked in at the open door in answer to the call  just bring me the third volume of wilhelm meister theres a dear its hardly worth while to rouse such a restless ghost as i when im once fairly laid  as she spoke di pulled up her black braids thumped the pillow of the couch where she was lying and with eager eyes went down the last page of her book  nan  yes laura replied the girl coming back with the third volume for the literary cormorant who took it with a nod still too content upon the confessions of a fair saint to remember the failings of a certain plain sinner  dont forget the italian cream for dinner i depend upon it for its the only thing fit for me this hot weather  and laura the cool blonde disposed the folds of her white gown more gracefully about her and touched up the eyebrow of the minerva she was drawing  little daughter  yes father  let me have plenty of clean collars in my bag for i must go at once and some of you bring me a glass of cider in about an houri shall be in the lower garden  the old man went away into his imaginary paradise and nan into that domestic purgatory on a summer daythe kitchen  there were vines about the windows sunshine on the floor and order everywhere but it was haunted by a cookingstove that family altar whence such varied incense rises to appease the appetite of household gods before which such dire incantations are pronounced to ease the wrath and woe of the priestess of the fire and about which often linger saddest memories of wasted temper time and toil  nan was tired having risen with the birdshurried having many cares those happy little housewives never knowand disappointed in a hope that hourly dwindled peaked and pined she was too young to make the anxious lines upon her forehead seem at home there too patient to be burdened with the labor others should have shared too light of heart to be pent up  when earth and sky were keeping a blithe holiday but she was one of that meek sisterhood who thinking humbly of themselves believe they are honored by being spent in the service of less conscientious souls whose careless thanks seem quite reward enough  to and fro she went silent and diligent giving the grace of willingness to every humble or distasteful task the day had brought her but some malignant sprite seemed to have taken possession of her kingdom for rebellion broke out everywhere the kettles would boil over most obstreperouslythe mutton refused to cook with the meek alacrity to be expected from the nature of a sheepthe stove with unnecessary warmth of temper would glow like a fiery furnacethe irons would scorchthe linens would dryand spirits would fail though patience never  nan tugged on growing hotter and wearier more hurried and more hopeless till at last the crisis came for in one fell moment she tore her gown burnt her hand and smutched the collar she was preparing to finish in the most unexceptionable style  then if she had been a nervous woman she would have scolded being a gentle girl she only lifted up her voice and wept  behold she watereth her linen with salt tears and bewaileth herself because of much tribulation but lo help cometh from afar a strong man bringeth lettuce wherewith to stay her plucketh berries to comfort her withal and clasheth cymbals that she may dance for joy  the voice came from the porch and with her hope fulfilled nan looked up to greet john lord the housefriend who stood there with a basket on his arm and as she saw his honest eyes kind lips and helpful hands the girl thought this plain young man the comeliest most welcome sight she had beheld that day  how good of you to come through all this heat and not to laugh at my despair she said looking up like a grateful child as she led him in  i only obeyed orders nan for a certain dear old lady had a motherly presentiment that you had got into a domestic whirlpool and sent me as a sort of lifepreserver so i took the basket of consolation and came to fold my feet upon the carpet of contentment in the tent of friendship  as he spoke john gave his own gift in his mothers name and bestowed himself in the wide windowseat where morningglories nodded at him and the old butternut sent pleasant shadows dancing to and fro  his advent like that of orpheus in hades seemed to soothe all unpropitious powers with a sudden spell the fire began to slacken the kettles began to lull the meat began to cook the irons began to cool the clothes began to behave the spirits began to rise and the collar was finished off with most triumphant success  john watched the change and though a lord of creation abased himself to take compassion on the weaker vessel and was seized with a great desire to lighten the homely tasks that tried her strength of body and soul  he took a comprehensive glance about the room then extracting a dish from he closet proceeded to imbrue his hands in the strawberries blood  oh  john you neednt do that i shall have time when ive turned the meat made the pudding and done these things  see im getting on finely nowyoure a judge of such matters isnt that nice  as she spoke nan offered the polished absurdity for inspection with innocent pride  oh that i were a collar to sit upon that hand sighed johnadding argumentatively  as to the berry question i might answer it with a gem from dr watts relative to satan and idle hands but will merely say that as a matter of public safety youd better leave me alone for such is the destructiveness of my nature that i shall certainly eat something hurtful break something valuable or sit upon something crushable unless you let me concentrate my energies by knocking on these young fellows hats and preparing them for their doom  looking at the matter in a charitable light nan consented and went cheerfully on with her work wondering how she could have thought ironing an infliction and been so ungrateful for the blessings of her lot  wheres sally asked john looking vainly for the functionary who usually pervaded that region like a domestic policewoman a terror to cats dogs and men  she has gone to her cousins funeral and wont be back till monday there seems to be a great fatality among her relations for one dies or comes to grief in some way about once a month but i dont blame poor sally for wanting to get away from this place now and then  i think i could find it in my heart to murder an imaginary friend or two if i had to stay here long  and nan laughed so blithely it was a pleasure to hear her  wheres di asked john seized with a most unmasculine curiosity all at once  she is in germany with wilhelm meister but though lost to sight to memory clear for i was just thinking as i did her things how clever she is to like all kinds of books that i dont understand at all and to write things that make me cry with pride and delight  yes shes a talented dear though she hardly knows a needle from a crowbar and will make herself one great blot some of these days when the divine afflatus descends upon her im afraid  and nan rubbed away with sisterly zeal at dis forlorn hose and inky pockethandkerchiefs  where is laura proceeded the inquisitor  well i might say that she was in italy for she is copying some fine thing of raphaels or michael angelos or some great creatures or other and she looks so picturesque in her pretty gown sitting before her easel that its really a sight to behold and ive peeped two or three times to see how she gets on  and nan bestirred herself to prepare the dish wherewith her picturesque sister desired to prolong her artistic existence  where is your father john asked again checking off each answer with a nod and a little frown  he is down in the garden deep in some plan about melons the beginning of which seems to consist in stamping the first proposition in euclid all over the bed and then poking a few seeds into the middle of each  why bless the dear man  i forgot it was time for the cider wouldnt you like to take it to him john hed love to consult you and the lane is so cool it does ones heart good to look at it  john glanced from the steamy kitchen to the shadowy path and answered with a sudden assumption of immense industry  i couldnt possibly go nanive so much on my hands  youll have to do it yourself  mr robert of lincoln has something for your private ear and the lane is so cool it will do ones heart good to see you in it  give my regards to your father and in the words of little mabels mother with slight variation    tell the dear old body   this day i cannot run   for the pots are boiling over   and the mutton isnt done  i will but please john go in to the girls and be comfortable for i dont like to leave you here said nan  you insinuate that i should pick at the pudding or invade the cream do you  ungrateful girl leave me and with melodramatic sternness john extinguished her in his broadbrimmed hat and offered the glass like a poisoned goblet  nan took it and went smiling away  but the lane might have been the desert of sahara for all she knew of it and she would have passed her father as unconcernedly as if he had been an appletree had he not called out  stand and deliver little woman  she obeyed the venerable highwayman and followed him to and fro listening to his plans and directions with a mute attention that quite won his heart  that hoppole is really an ornament now nan this sagebed needs weedingthats good work for you girls and now i think of it youd better water the lettuce in the cool of the evening after im gone  to all of which remarks nan gave her assent the hoppole took the likeness of a tall figure she had seen in the porch the sagebed curiously enough suggested a strawberry ditto the lettuce vividly reminded her of certain vegetable productions a basket had brought and the bobolink only sung in his cheeriest voice go home go home he is there  she found johnhe having made a freemason of himself by assuming her little apronmeditating over the partially spread table lost in amaze at its desolate appearance one half its proper paraphernalia having been forgotten and the other half put on awry  nan laughed till the tears ran over her cheeks and john was gratified at the efficacy of his treatment for her face had brought a whole harvest of sunshine from the garden and all her cares seemed to have been lost in the windings of the lane  nan are you in hysterics cried di appearing book in hand john you absurd man what are you doing  im helpin the maid of all work please marm and john dropped a curtsy with his limited apron  di looked ruffled for the merry words were a covert reproach and with her usual energy of manner and freedom of speech she tossed wilhelm out of the window exclaiming irefully  thats always the way im never where i ought to be and never think of anything till its too late but its all goethes fault  what does he write books full of smart phillinas and interesting meisters for  how can i be expected to remember that sallys away and people must eat when im hearing the harper and little mignon john how dare you come here and do my work instead of shaking me and telling me to do it myself  take that toasted child away and fan her like a chinese mandarin while i dish up this dreadful dinner  john and nan fled like chaff before the wind while di full of remorseful zeal charged at the kettles and wrenched off the potatoes jackets as if she were revengefully pulling her own hair laura had a vague intention of going to assist but getting lost among the lights and shadows of minervas helmet forgot to appear till dinner had been evoked from chaos and peace was restored  at three oclock di performed the coronation ceremony with her fathers best hat laura retied his oldfashioned neckcloth and arranged his white locks with an eye to saintly effect nan appeared with a beautifully written sermon and suspicious inkstains on the fingers that slipped it into his pocket john attached himself to the bag and the patriarch was escorted to the door of his tent with the triumphal procession which usually attended his outgoings and incomings  having kissed the female portion of his tribe he ascended the venerable chariot which received him with audible lamentation as its rheumatic joints swayed to and fro  goodbye my dears i shall be back early on monday morning so take care of yourselves and be sure you all go and hear mr emerboy preach tomorrow  my regards to your mother john  come solon  but solon merely cocked one ear and remained a fixed fact for long experience had induced the philosophic beast to take for his motto the yankee maxim be sure youre right then go ahead he knew things were not right therefore he did not go ahead  oh by the way girls dont forget to pay tommy mullein for bringing up the cow he expects it tonight  and di dont sit up till daylight nor let laura stay out in the dew  now i believe im off come solon  but solon only cocked the other ear gently agitated his mortified tail as premonitory symptoms of departure and never stirred a hoof being well aware that it always took three comes to make a go  bless me ive forgotten my spectacles they are probably shut up in that volume of herbert on my table  very awkward to find myself without them ten miles away  thank you john  dont neglect to water the lettuce nan and dont overwork yourself my little martha come  at this juncture solon suddenly went off like mrs gamp in a sort of walking swoon apparently deaf and blind to all mundane matters except the refreshments awaiting him ten miles away and the benign old pastor disappeared humming hebron to the creaking accompaniment of the bulgy chaise  laura retired to take her siesta nan made a small carbonaro of herself by sharpening her sisters crayons and di as a sort of penance for past sins tried her patience over a piece of knitting in which she soon originated a somewhat remarkable pattern by dropping every third stitch and seaming ad libitum  if john bad been a gentlemanly creature with refined tastes he would have elevated his feet and made a nuisance of himself by indulging in a weed but being only an uncultivated youth with a rustic regard for pure air and womankind in general he kept his head uppermost and talked like a man instead of smoking like a chimney  it will probably be six months before i sit here again tangling your threads and maltreating your needles nan  how glad you must feel to hear it he said looking up from a thoughtful examination of the hardworking little citizens of the industrial community settled in nans workbasket  no im very sorry for i like to see you coming and going as you used to years ago and i miss you very much when you are gone john answered truthful nan whittling away in a sadly wasteful manner as her thoughts flew back to the happy times when a little lad rode a little lass in a big wheelbarrow and never spilt his loadwhen two brown heads bobbed daily side by side to school and the favorite play was babes in the wood with di for a somewhat peckish robin to cover the small martyrs with any vegetable substance that lay at hand nan sighed as she thought of these things and john regarded the battered thimble on his fingertip with increased benignity of aspect as he heard the sound  when are you going to make your fortune john and get out of that disagreeable hardware concern demanded di pausing after an exciting round and looking almost as much exhausted as if it had been a veritable pugilistic encounter  i intend to make it by plunging still deeper into that disagreeable hardware concern for next year if the world keeps rolling and john lord is alive he will become a partner and thenand then  the color sprang up into the young mans cheek his eyes looked out with a sudden shine and his hand seemed involuntarily to close as if he saw and seized some invisible delight  what will happen then john asked nan with a wondering glance  ill tell you in a year nan wait till then and johns strong hand unclosed as if the desired good were not to be his yet  di looked at him with a knittingneedle stuck into her hair saying like a sarcastic unicorn  i really thought you had a soul above pots and kettles but i see you havent and i beg your pardon for the injustice i have done you  not a whit disturbed john smiled as if at some mighty pleasant fancy of his own as he replied  thank you di and as a further proof of the utter depravity of my nature let me tell you that i have the greatest possible respect for those articles of ironmongery  some of the happiest hours of my life have been spent in their society some of my pleasantest associations are connected with them some of my best lessons have come to me among them and when my fortune is made i intend to show my gratitude by taking three flatirons rampant for my coat of arms  nan laughed merrily as she looked at the burns on her hand but di elevated the most prominent feature of her brown countenance and sighed despondingly  dear dear what a disappointing world this is i no sooner build a nice castle in spain and settle a smart young knight therein than down it comes about my ears and the ungrateful youth who might fight dragons if he chose insists on quenching his energies in a saucepan and making a saint lawrence of himself by wasting his life on a series of gridirons  ah if i were only a man i would do something better than that and prove that heroes are not all dead yet but instead of that im only a woman and must sit rasping my temper with absurdities like this and di wrestled with her knitting as if it were fate and she were paying off the grudge she owed it  john leaned toward her saying with a look that made his plain face handsome  di my father began the world as i begin it and left it the richer for the useful years he spent hereas i hope i may leave it some halfcentury hence  his memory makes that dingy shop a pleasant place to me for there he made an honest name led an honest life and bequeathed to me his reverence for honest work  that is a sort of hardware di that no rust can corrupt and which will always prove a better fortune than any your knights can achieve with sword and shield i think i am not quite a clod or quite without some aspirations above moneygetting for i sincerely desire that courage that makes daily life heroic by selfdenial and cheerfulness of heart i am eager to conquer my own rebellious nature and earn the confidence of innocent and upright souls i have a great ambition to become as good a man and leave as good a memory behind me as old john lord  di winked violently and seamed five times in perfect silence but quiet nan had the gift of knowing when to speak and by a timely word saved her sister from a thundershower and her stocking from destruction  john have you seen philip since you wrote about your last meeting with him  the question was for john but the soothing tone was for di who gratefully accepted it and perked up again with speed  yes and i meant to have told you about it answered john plunging into the subject at once  i saw him a few days before i came home and found him more disconsolate than ever just ready to go to the devil as he forcibly expressed himself i consoled the poor lad as well as i could telling him his wisest plan was to defer his proposed expedition and go on as steadily as he had begunthereby proving the injustice of your fathers prediction concerning his want of perseverance and the sincerity of his affection  i told him the change in lauras health and spirits was silently working in his favor and that a few more months of persistent endeavor would conquer your fathers prejudice against him and make him a stronger man for the trial and the pain  i read him bits about laura from your own and dis letters and he went away at last as patient as jacob ready to serve another seven years for his beloved rachel  god bless you for it john cried a fervent voice and looking up they saw the cold listless laura transformed into a tender girl all aglow with love and longing as she dropped her mask and showed a living countenance eloquent with the first passion and softened by the first grief of her life  john rose involuntarily in the presence of an innocent nature whose sorrow needed no interpreter to him  the girl read sympathy in his brotherly regard and found comfort in the friendly voice that asked half playfully half seriously  shall i tell him that he is not forgotten even for an apollo that laura the artist has not conquered laura the woman and predict that the good daughter will yet prove the happy wife  with a gesture full of energy laura tore her minerva from top to bottom while two great tears rolled down the cheeks grown wan with hope deferred  tell him i believe all things hope all things and that i never can forget  nan went to her and held her fast leaving the prints of two loving but grimy hands upon her shoulders di looked on approvingly for though stonyhearted regarding the cause she fully appreciated the effect and john turning to the window received the commendations of a robin swaying on an elmbough with sunshine on its ruddy breast  the clock struck five and john declared that he must go for being an oldfashioned soul he fancied that his mother had a better right to his last hour than any younger woman in the landalways remembering that she was a widow and he her only son  nan ran away to wash her hands and came back with the appearance of one who had washed her face also and so she had but there was a difference in the water  play im your father girls and remember that it will be six months before that john will trouble you again  with which preface the young man kissed his former playfellows as heartily as the boy had been wont to do when stern parents banished him to distant schools and three little maids bemoaned his fate  but times were changed now for di grew alarmingly rigid during the ceremony laura received the salute like a graceful queen and nan returned it with heart and eyes and tender lips making such an improvement on the childish fashion of the thing that john was moved to support his paternal character by softly echoing her fathers wordstake care of yourself my little martha  then they all streamed after him along the gardenpath with the endless messages and warnings girls are so prone to give and the young man with a great softness at his heart went away as many another john has gone feeling better for the companionship of innocent maidenhood and stronger to wrestle with temptation to wait and hope and work  lets throw a shoe after him for luck as dear old mrs  gummage did after david and the willin barkis quick nan you always have old shoes on toss one and shout good luck cried di with one of her eccentric inspirations  nan tore off her shoe and threw it far along the dusty road with a sudden longing to become that auspicious article of apparel that the omen might not fail  looking backward from the hilltop john answered the meek shout cheerily and took in the group with a lingering glance laura in the shadow of the elms di perched on the fence and nan leaning far over the gate with her hand above her eyes and the sunshine touching her brown hair with gold  he waved his hat and turned away but the music seemed to die out of the blackbirds song and in all the summer landscape his eyes saw nothing but the little figure at the gate  bless and save us heres a flock of people coming my hair is in a toss and nans without her shoe run fly girls or the philistines will be upon us cried di tumbling off her perch in sudden alarm  three agitated young ladies with flying draperies and countenances of mingled mirth and dismay might have been seen precipitating themselves into a respectable mansion with unbecoming haste but the squirrels were the only witnesses of this vision of sudden flight and being used to groundandlofty tumbling didnt mind it  when the pedestrians passed the door was decorously closed and no one visible but a young man who snatched something out of the road and marched away again whistling with more vigor of tone than accuracy of tune only that and nothing more    how it was found  summer ripened into autumn and something fairer than    sweetpeas and mignonette   in annies garden grew  her nature was the counterpart of the hillside grove where as a child she had read her fairy tales and now as a woman turned the first pages of a more wondrous legend still lifted above the manygabled roof yet not cut off from the echo of human speech the little grove seemed a green sanctuary fringed about with violets and full of summer melody and bloom  gentle creatures haunted it and there was none to make afraid woodpigeons cooed and crickets chirped their shrill roundelays anemones and ladyferns looked up from the moss that kissed the wanderers feet warm airs were all afloat full of vernal odors for the grateful sense silvery birches shimmered like spirits of the wood larches gave their green tassels to the wind and pines made airy music sweet and solemn as they stood looking heavenward through veils of summer sunshine or shrouds of wintry snow  nan never felt alone now in this charmed wood for when she came into its precincts once so full of solitude all things seemed to wear one shape familiar eyes looked at her from the violets in the grass familiar words sounded in the whisper of the leaves grew conscious that an unseen influence filled the air with new delights and touched earth and sky with a beauty never seen before  slowly these mayflowers budded in her maiden heart rosily they bloomed and silently they waited till some lover of such lowly herbs should catch their fresh aroma should brush away the fallen leaves and lift them to the sun  though the eldest of the three she had long been overtopped by the more aspiring maids  but though she meekly yielded the reins of government whenever they chose to drive they were soon restored to her again for di fell into literature and laura into love  thus engrossed these two forgot many duties which even bluestockings and inamoratos are expected to perform and slowly all the homely humdrum cares that housewives know became nans daily life and she accepted it without a thought of discontent  noiseless and cheerful as the sunshine she went to and fro doing the tasks that mothers do but without a mothers sweet reward holding fast the numberless slight threads that bind a household tenderly together and making each day a beautiful success  di being tired of running riding climbing and boating decided at last to let her body rest and put her equally active mind through what classical collegians term a course of sprouts  having undertaken to read and know everything she devoted herself to the task with great energy going from sue to swedenborg with perfect impartiality and having different authors as children have sundry distempers being fractious while they lasted but all the better for them when once over  carlyle appeared like scarletfever and raged violently for a time for being anything but a passive bucket di became prophetic with mahomet belligerent with cromwell and made the french revolution a veritable reign of terror to her family  goethe and schiller alternated like fever and ague mephistopheles became her hero joan of arc her model and she turned her black eyes red over egmont and wallenstein a mild attack of emerson followed during which she was lost in a fog and her sisters rejoiced inwardly when she emerged informing them that    the sphinx was drowsy   her wings were furled  poor di was floundering slowly to her proper place but she splashed up a good deal of foam by getting out of her depth and rather exhausted herself by trying to drink the ocean dry  laura after the midsummer nights dream that often comes to girls of seventeen woke up to find that youth and love were no match for age and common sense  philip had been flying about the world like a thistledown for fiveandtwenty years generoushearted frank and kind but with never an idea of the serious side of life in his handsome head  great therefore were the wrath and dismay of the enamored thistledown when the father of his love mildly objected to seeing her begin the world in a balloon with a very tender but very inexperienced aeronaut for a guide  laura is too young to play house yet and you are too unstable to assume the part of lord and master philip  go and prove that you have prudence patience energy and enterprise and i will give you my girlbut not before i must seem cruel that i may be truly kind believe this and let a little pain lead you to great happiness or show you where you would have made a bitter blunder  the lovers listened owned the truth of the old mans words bewailed their fate and yieldedlaura for love of her father philip for love of her he went away to build a firm foundation for his castle in the air and laura retired into an invisible convent where she cast off the world and regarded her sympathizing sisters through a grate of superior knowledge and unsharable grief like a devout nun she worshipped st philip and firmly believed in his miraculous powers she fancied that her woes set her apart from common cares and slowly fell into a dreamy state professing no interest in any mundane matter but the art that first attracted philip crayons breadcrusts and gray paper became glorified in lauras eyes and her one pleasure was to sit pale and still before her easel day after day filling her portfolios with the faces he had once admired her sisters observed that every bacchus piping faun or dying gladiator bore some likeness to a comely countenance that heathen god or hero never owned and seeing this they privately rejoiced that she had found such solace for her grief  mrs lords keen eye had read a certain newly written page in her sons hearthis first chapter of that romance begun in paradise whose interest never flags whose beauty never fades whose end can never come till love lies dead with womanly skill she divined the secret with motherly discretion she counselled patience and her son accepted her advice feeling that like many a healthful herb its worth lay in its bitterness  love like a man john not like a boy and learn to know yourself before you take a womans happiness into your keeping  you and nan have known each other all your lives yet till this last visit you never thought you loved her more than any other childish friend  it is too soon to say the words so often spoken hastilyso hard to be recalled go back to your work dear for another year think of nan in the light of this new hope compare her with comelier gayer girls and by absence prove the truth of your belief   then if distance only makes her dearer if time only strengthens your affection and no doubt of your own worthiness disturbs you come back and offer her what any woman should be glad to takemy boys true heart  john smiled at the motherly pride of her words but answered with a wistful look  it seems very long to wait mother  if i could just ask her for a word of hope i could be very patient then  ah my dear better bear one year of impatience now than a lifetime of regret hereafter nan is happy why disturb her by a word which will bring the tender cares and troubles that come soon enough to such conscientious creatures as herself if she loves you time will prove it therefore let the new affection spring and ripen as your early friendship has done and it will be all the stronger for a summers growth  philip was rash and has to bear his trial now and laura shares it with him be more generous john make your trial bear your doubts alone and give nan the happiness without the pain  promise me this dearpromise me to hope and wait  the young mans eye kindled and in his heart there rose a better chivalry a truer valor than any dis knights had ever known  ill try mother was all he said but she was satisfied for john seldom tried in vain  oh girls how splendid you are  it does my heart good to see my handsome sisters in their best array cried nan one mild october night as she put the last touches to certain airy raiment fashioned by her own skilful hands and then fell back to survey the grand effect  di and laura were preparing to assist at an event of the season and nan with her own locks fallen on her shoulders for want of sundry combs promoted to her sisters heads and her dress in unwonted disorder for lack of the many pins extracted in exciting crises of the toilet hovered like an affectionate bee about two very fullblown flowers  laura looks like a cool undine with the ivywreaths in her shining hair and di has illuminated herself to such an extent with those scarlet leaves that i dont know what great creature she resembles most said nan beaming with sisterly admiration  like juno zenobia and cleopatra simmered into one with a touch of xantippe by way of spice but to my eye the finest woman of the three is the dishevelled young person embracing the bedpost for she stays at home herself and gives her time and taste to making homely people finewhich is a waste of good material and an imposition on the public  as di spoke both the fashionplates looked affectionately at the graygowned figure but being works of art they were obliged to nip their feelings in the bud and reserve their caresses till they returned to common life  put on your bonnet and well leave you at mrs lords on our way  it will do you good nan and perhaps there may be news from john added di as she bore down upon the door like a manofwar under full sail  or from philip sighed laura with a wistful look  whereupon nan persuaded herself that her strong inclination to sit down was owing to want of exercise and the heaviness of her eyelids a freak of imagination so speedily smoothing her ruffled plumage she ran down to tell her father of the new arrangement  go my dear by all means i shall be writing and you will be lonely if you stay  but i must see my girls for i caught glimpses of certain surprising phantoms flitting by the door  nan led the way and the two pyramids revolved before him with the rapidity of layfigures much to the good mans edification for with his fatherly pleasure there was mingled much mild wonderment at the amplitude of array  yes i see my geese are really swans though there is such a cloud between us that i feel a long way off and hardly know them  but this little daughter is always available always my cricket on the hearth  as he spoke her father drew nan closer kissed her tranquil face and smiled content  well if ever i see picters i see em now and i declare to goodness its as interestin as playactin every bit  miss di with all them boughs in her head looks like the queen of sheby when she went avisitin whatshisname and if miss laura aint as sweet as a lallybarster figger i should like to know what is  in her enthusiasm sally gambolled about the girls flourishing her milkpan like a modern miriam about to sound her timbrel for excess of joy  laughing merrily the two mont blancs bestowed themselves in the family ark nan hopped up beside patrick and solon roused from his lawful slumbers morosely trundled them away but looking backward with a last goodnight nan saw her father still standing at the door with smiling countenance and the moonlight falling like a benediction on his silver hair  betsey shall go up the hill with you my dear and heres a basket of eggs for your father  give him my love and be sure you let me know the next time he is poorly mrs lord said when her guest rose to depart after an hour of pleasant chat  but nan never got the gift for to her great dismay her hostess dropped the basket with a crash and flew across the room to meet a tall shape pausing in the shadow of the door  there was no need to ask who the newcomer was for even in his mothers arms john looked over her shoulder with an eager nod to nan who stood among the ruins with never a sign of weariness in her face nor the memory of a care at her heartfor they all went out when john came in  now tell us how and why and when you came take off your coat my dear  and here are the old slippers  why didnt you let us know you were coming so soon  how have you been and what makes you so late tonight  betsey you neednt put on your bonnet  andoh my dear boy have you been to supper yet  mrs lord was a quiet soul and her flood of questions was purred softly in her sons ear for being a woman she must talk and being a mother must pet the one delight of her life and make a little festival when the lord of the manor came home a whole drove of fatted calves were metaphorically killed and a banquet appeared with speed  john was not one of those romantic heroes who can go through three volumes of hairbreadth escapes without the faintest hint of that blessed institution dinner therefore like lady letherbridge he partook copiously of everything while the two women beamed over each mouthful with an interest that enhanced its flavor and urged upon him cold meat and cheese pickles and pie as if dyspepsia and nightmare were among the lost arts  then he opened his budget of news and fed them  i was coming next month according to custom but philip fell upon and so tempted me that i was driven to sacrifice myself to the cause of friendship and up we came tonight  he would not let me come here till we had seen your father nan for the poor lad was pining for laura and hoped his good behavior for the past year would satisfy his judge and secure his recall  we had a fine talk with your father and upon my life philip seemed to have received the gift of tongues for he made a most eloquent plea which ive stored away for future use i assure you  the dear old gentleman was very kind told phil he was satisfied with the success of his probation that he should see laura when he liked and if all went well should receive his reward in the spring it must be a delightful sensation to know you have made a fellowcreature as happy as those words made phil tonight  john paused and looked musingly at the matronly teapot as if he saw a wondrous future in its shine  nan twinkled off the drops that rose at the thought of lauras joy and said with grateful warmth  you say nothing of your own share in the making of that happiness john but we know it for philip has told laura in his letters all that you have been to him and i am sure there was other eloquence beside his own before father granted all you say he has  oh john i thank you very much for this  mrs lord beamed a whole midsummer of delight upon her son as she saw the pleasure these words gave him though he answered simply  i only tried to be a brother to him nan for he has been most kind to me  yes i said my little say tonight and gave my testimony in behalf of the prisoner at the bar a most merciful judge pronounced his sentence and he rushed straight to mrs leighs to tell laura the blissful news just imagine the scene when he appears and how di will open her wicked eyes and enjoy the spectacle of the dishevelled lover the brideelects tears the stir and the romance of the thing shell cry over it tonight and caricature it tomorrow  and john led the laugh at the picture he had conjured up to turn the thoughts of dis dangerous sister from himself  at ten nan retired into the depths of her old bonnet with a far different face from the one she brought out of it and john resuming his hat mounted guard  dont stay late remember john and in mrs lords voice there was a warning tone that her son interpreted aright  ill not forget mother  and he kept his word for though philips happiness floated temptingly before him and the little figure at his side had never seemed so dear he ignored the bland winds the tender night and set a seal upon his lips thinking manfully within himself i see many signs of promise in her happy face but i will wait and hope a little longer for her sake  where is father sally asked nan as that functionary appeared blinking owlishly but utterly repudiating the idea of sleep  he went down the garding miss when the gentlemen cleared bein a little flustered by the goins on  shall i fetch him in asked sally as irreverently as if her master were a bag of meal  no we will go ourselves and slowly the two paced down the leafstrewn walk  fields of yellow grain were waving on the hillside and sere corn blades rustled in the wind from the orchard came the scent of ripening fruit and all the gardenplots lay ready to yield up their humble offerings to their masters hand  but in the silence of the night a greater reaper had passed by gathering in the harvest of a righteous life and leaving only tender memories for the gleaners who had come so late  the old man sat in the shadow of the tree his own hands planted its fruit boughs shone ruddily and its leaves still whispered the low lullaby that hushed him to his rest  how fast he sleeps poor father i should have come before and made it pleasant for him  as she spoke nan lifted up the head bent down upon his breast and kissed his pallid cheek  oh john this is not sleep  yes dear the happiest he will ever know  for a moment the shadows flickered over three white faces and the silence deepened solemnly then john reverently bore the pale shape in and nan dropped down beside it saying with a rain of grateful tears  he kissed me when i went and said a last goodnight  for an hour steps went to and fro about her many voices whispered near her and skilful hands touched the beloved clay she held so fast but one by one the busy feet passed out one by one the voices died away and human skill proved vain  then mrs lord drew the orphan to the shelter of her arms soothing her with the mute solace of that motherly embrace  nan nan heres philip come and see the happy call reechoed through the house and nan sprang up as if her time for grief were past  i must tell them oh my poor girls how will they bear itthey have known so little sorrow  but there was no need for her to speak other lips had spared her the hard task  for as she stirred to meet them a sharp cry rent the air steps rang upon the stairs and two wildeyed creatures came into the hush of that familiar room for the first time meeting with no welcome from their fathers voice  with one impulse di and laura fled to nan and the sisters clung together in a silent embrace more eloquent than words john took his mother by the hand and led her from the room closing the door upon the sacredness of grief  yes we are poorer than we thought but when everything is settled we shall get on very well  we can let a part of this great house and live quietly together until spring then laura will be married and di can go on their travels with them as philip wishes her to do  we shall be cared for so never fear for us john  nan said this as her friend parted from her a week later after the saddest holiday he had ever known  and what becomes of you nan he asked watching the patient eyes that smiled when others would have wept  i shall stay in the dear old house for no other place would seem like home to me  i shall find some little child to love and care for and be quite happy till the girls come back and want me  john nodded wisely as he listened and went away prophesying within himself  she shall find something more than a child to love and god willing shall be very happy till the girls come home andcannot have her  nans plan was carried into effect  slowly the divided waters closed again and the three fell back into their old life  but the touch of sorrow drew them closer and though invisible a beloved presence still moved among them a familiar voice still spoke to them in the silence of their softened hearts  thus the soil was made ready and in the depth of winter the good seed was sown was watered with many tears and soon sprang up green with a promise of a harvest for their after years  di and laura consoled themselves with their favorite employments unconscious that nan was growing paler thinner and more silent as the weeks went by till one day she dropped quietly before them and it suddenly became manifest that she was utterly worn out with many cares and the secret suffering of a tender heart bereft of the paternal love which had been its strength and stay  im only tired dear girls  dont be troubled for i shall be up tomorrow she said cheerily as she looked into the anxious faces bending over her  but the weariness was of many months growth and it was weeks before that tomorrow came  laura installed herself as nurse and her devotion was repaid fourfold for sitting at her sisters bedside she learned a finer art than that she had left  her eye grew clear to see the beauty of a selfdenying life and in the depths of nans meek nature she found the strong sweet virtues that made her what she was  then remembering that these womanly attributes were a brides best dowry laura gave herself to their attainment that she might become to another household the blessing nan had been to her own and turning from the worship of the goddess beauty she gave her hand to that humbler and more human teacher dutylearning her lessons with a willing heart for philips sake  di corked her inkstand locked her bookcase and went at housework as if it were a fivebarred gate of course she missed the leap but scrambled bravely through and appeared much sobered by the exercise sally had departed to sit under a vine and figtree of her own so di had undisputed sway but if dishpans and dusters had tongues direful would have been the history of that crusade against frost and fire indolence and inexperience but they were dumb and di scorned to complain though her struggles were pathetic to behold and her sisters went through a series of messes equal to a course of prince benreddins peppery tarts reality turned romance out of doors for unlike her favorite heroines in satin and tears or helmet and shield di met her fate in a big checked apron and dustcap wonderful to see yet she wielded her broom as stoutly as moll pitcher shouldered her gun and marched to her daily martyrdom in the kitchen with as heroic a heart as the maid of orleans took to her stake  mind won the victory over matter in the end and di was better all her days for the tribulations and the triumphs of that time for she drowned her idle fancies in her washtub made burntofferings of selfishness and pride and learned the worth of selfdenial as she sang with happy voice among the pots and kettles of her conquered realm  nan thought of john and in the stillness of her sleepless nights prayed heaven to keep him safe and make her worthy to receive and strong enough to bear the blessedness or pain of love  snow fell without and keen winds howled among the leafless elms but herbs of grace were blooming beautifully in the sunshine of sincere endeavor and this dreariest season proved the most fruitful of the year for love taught laura labor chastened di and patience fitted nan for the blessing of her life  nature that stillest yet most diligent of housewives began at last that spring cleaning which she makes so pleasant that none find the heart to grumble as they do when other matrons set their premises adust  her handmaids wind and rain and sun swept washed and garnished busily green carpets were unrolled appleboughs were hung with draperies of bloom and dandelions pet nurslings of the year came out to play upon the sward  from the south returned that opera troupe whose manager is never in despair whose tenor never sulks whose prima donna never fails and in the orchard bona fide matinees were held to which buttercups and clovers crowded in their prettiest spring hats and verdant young blades twinkled their dewy lorgnettes as they bowed and made way for the floral belles  may was bidding june goodmorrow and the roses were just dreaming that it was almost time to wake when john came again into the quiet room which now seemed the eden that contained his eve of course there was a jubilee but something seemed to have befallen the whole group for never had they appeared in such odd frames of mind  john was restless and wore an excited look most unlike his usual serenity of aspect  nan the cheerful had fallen into a well of silence and was not to be extracted by any hydraulic power though she smiled like the june sky over her head  dis peculiarities were out in full force and she looked as if she would go off like a torpedo at a touch but through all her moods there was a halftriumphant halfremorseful expression in the glance she fixed on john  and laura once so silent now sang like a blackbird as she flitted to and fro but her fitful song was always philip my king  john felt that there had come a change upon the three and silently divined whose unconscious influence had wrought the miracle  the embargo was off his tongue and he was in a fever to ask that question which brings a flutter to the stoutest heart but though the man had come the hour had not  so by way of steadying his nerves he paced the room pausing often to take notes of his companions and each pause seemed to increase his wonder and content  he looked at nan  she was in her usual place the rigid little chair she loved because it once was large enough to hold a curlyheaded playmate and herself  the old workbasket was at her side and the battered thimble busily at work but her lips wore a smile they had never worn before the color of the unblown roses touched her cheek and her downcast eyes were full of light  he looked at di  the inevitable book was on her knee but its leaves were uncut the strongminded knob of hair still asserted its supremacy aloft upon her head and the triangular jacket still adorned her shoulders in defiance of all fashions past present or to come but the expression of her brown countenance had grown softer her tongue had found a curb and in her hand lay a card with potts kettel  co inscribed thereon which she regarded with never a scornful word for the co  he looked at laura  she was before her easel as of old but the pale nun had given place to a blooming girl who sang at her work which was no prim pallas but a clytie turning her human face to meet the sun  john what are you thinking of  he stirred as if dis voice had disturbed his fancy at some pleasant pastime but answered with his usual sincerity  i was thinking of a certain dear old fairy tale called cinderella  oh said di and her oh was a most impressive monosyllable  i see the meaning of your smile now and though the application of the story is not very complimentary to all parties concerned it is very just and very true  she paused a moment then went on with softened voice and earnest mien  you think i am a blind and selfish creature so i am but not so blind and selfish as i have been for many tears have cleared my eyes and much sincere regret has made me humbler than i was i have found a better book than any fathers library can give me and i have read it with a love and admiration that grew stronger as i turned the leaves henceforth i take it for my guide and gospel and looking back upon the selfish and neglectful past can only say heaven bless your dear heart nan  laura echoed dis last words for with eyes as full of tenderness she looked down upon the sister she had lately learned to know saying warmly  yes heaven bless your dear heart nan i never can forget all you have been to me and when i am far away with philip there will always be one countenance more beautiful to me than any pictured face i may discover there will be one place more dear to me than rome  the face will be yours nan always so patient always so serene and the dearer place will be this home of ours which you have made so pleasant to me all these years by kindnesses as numberless and noiseless as the drops of dew  dear girls what have i ever done that you should love me so cried nan with happy wonderment as the tall heads black and golden bent to meet the lowly brown one and her sisters mute lips answered her  then laura looked up saying playfully  here are the good and wicked sisterswhere shall we find the prince  there cried di pointing to john and then her secret went off like a rocket for with her old impetuosity she said  i have found you out john and am ashamed to look you in the face remembering the past girls you know when father died john sent us money which he said mr owen had long owed us and had paid at last it was a kind lie john and a generous thing to do for we needed it but never would have taken it as a gift  i know you meant that we should never find this out but yesterday i met mr owen returning from the west and when i thanked him for a piece of justice we had not expected of him he gruffly told me he had never paid the debt never meant to pay it for it was outlawed and we could not claim a farthing  john i have laughed at you thought you stupid treated you unkindly but i know you now and never shall forget the lesson you have taught me  i am proud as lucifer but i ask you to forgive me and i seal my real repentance soand so  with tragic countenance di rushed across the room threw both arms about the astonished young mans neck and dropped an energetic kiss upon his cheek  there was a momentary silence for di finally illustrated her strongminded theories by crying like the weakest of her sex  laura with the ruling passion strong in death still tried to draw but broke her pet crayon and endowed her clytie with a supplementary orb owing to the dimness of her own  and nan sat with drooping eyes that shone upon her work thinking with tender pridethey know him now and love him for his generous heart  di spoke first rallying to her colors though a little daunted by her loss of selfcontrol  dont laugh johni couldnt help it and dont think im not sincere for i ami am and i will prove it by growing good enough to be your friend  that debt must all be paid and i shall do it for ill turn my books and pen to some account and write stories full of clear old souls like you and nan and some one i know will like and buy them though they are not works of shakespeare ive thought of this before have felt i had the power in me now i have the motive and now ill do it  if di had proposed to translate the koran or build a new saint pauls there would have been many chances of success for once moved her will like a batteringram would knock down the obstacles her wits could not surmount  john believed in her most heartily and showed it as he answered looking into her resolute face  i know you will and yet make us very proud of our chaos di  let the money lie and when you have a fortune ill claim it with enormous interest but believe me i feel already doubly repaid by the esteem so generously confessed so cordially bestowed and can only say as we used to years agonow lets forgive and so forget  but proud di would not let him add to her obligation even by returning her impetuous salute she slipped away and shaking off the last drops answered with a curious mixture of old freedom and new respect  no more sentiment please john  we know each other now and when i find a friend i never let him go  we have smoked the pipe of peace so let us go back to our wigwams and bury the feud  where were we when i lost my head and what were we talking about  cinderella and the prince  as she spoke johns eye kindled and turning he looked down at nan who sat diligently ornamenting with microscopic stitches a great patch going on the wrong side out  yesso we were and now taking pussy for the godmother the characters of the story are well personatedall but the slipper said di laughing as she thought of the many times they had played it together years ago  a sudden movement stirred johns frame a sudden purpose shone in his countenance and a sudden change befell his voice as he said producing from some hidingplace a little wornout shoe  i can supply the slipperwho will try it first  dis black eyes opened wide as they fell on the familiar object then her romanceloving nature saw the whole plot of that drama which needs but two to act it a great delight flushed up into her face as she promptly took her cue saying  no need for us to try it laura for it wouldnt fit us if our feet were as small as chinese dolls our parts are played out therefore exeunt wicked sisters to the music of the weddingbells  and pouncing upon the dismayed artist she swept her out and closed the door with a triumphant bang  john went to nan and dropping on his knee as reverently as the herald of the fairy tale he asked still smiling but with lips grown tremulous  will cinderella try the little shoe andif it fitsgo with the prince  but nan only covered up her face weeping happy tears while all the weary work strayed down upon the floor as if it knew her holiday had come  john drew the hidden face still closer and while she listened to his eager words nan heard the beating of the strong mans heart and knew it spoke the truth  nan i promised mother to be silent till i was sure i loved you whollysure that the knowledge would give no pain when i should tell it as i am trying to tell it now  this little shoe has been mv comforter through this long year and i have kept it as other lovers keep their fairer favors it has been a talisman more eloquent to me than flower or ring for when i saw how worn it was i always thought of the willing feet that came and went for others comfort all day long when i saw the little bow you tied i always thought of the hands so diligent in serving any one who knew a want or felt a pain and when i recalled the gentle creature who had worn it last i always saw her patient tender and devoutand tried to grow more worthy of her that i might one day dare to ask if she would walk beside me all my life and be my angel in the house will you dear  believe me you shall never know a weariness or grief i have the power to shield you from  then nan as simple in her love as in her life laid her arms about his neck her happy face against his own and answered softly  oh john i never can be sad or tired any more    debbys debut  on a cheery june day mrs penelope carroll and her niece debby wilder were whizzing along on their way to a certain gay wateringplace both in the best of humors with each other and all the world beside  aunt pen was concocting sundry mild romances and laying harmless plots for the pursuance of her favorite pastime matchmaking for she had invited her pretty relative to join her summer jaunt ostensibly that the girl might see a little of fashionable life but the good lady secretly proposed to herself to take her to the beach and get her a rich husband very much as she would have proposed to take her to broadway and get her a new bonnet for both articles she considered necessary but somewhat difficult for a poor girl to obtain  debby was slowly getting her poise after the excitement of a first visit to new york for ten days of bustle had introduced the young philosopher to a new existence and the workingday world seemed to have vanished when she made her last pat of butter in the dairy at home  for an hour she sat thinking over the goodfortune which had befallen her and the comforts of this life which she had suddenly acquired debby was a true girl with all a girls love of ease and pleasure it must not be set down against her that she surveyed her pretty travellingsuit with much complacency rejoicing inwardly that she could use her hands without exposing fractured gloves that her bonnet was of the newest mode needing no veil to hide a faded ribbon or a last years shape that her dress swept the ground with fashionable untidiness and her boots were guiltless of a patchthat she was the possessor of a mine of wealth in two of the eight trunks belonging to her aunt that she was travelling like any lady of the land with man and maidservant at her command and that she was leaving work and care behind her for a month or two of novelty and rest  when these agreeable facts were fully realized and aunt pen had fallen asleep behind her veil debby took out a book and indulged in her favorite luxury soon forgetting past present and future in the inimitable history of martin chuzzlewit the sun blazed the cars rattled children cried ladies nodded gentlemen longed for the solace of prohibited cigars and newspapers were converted into sunshades nightcaps and fans but debby read on unconscious of all about her even of the pair of eves that watched her from the opposite corner of the car  a gentleman with a frank strongfeatured face sat therein and amused himself by scanning with thoughtful gaze the countenances of his fellowtravellers  stout aunt pen dignified even in her sleep was a model of deportment to the rising generation but the student of human nature found a more attractive subject in her companion the girl with an appleblossom face and merry brown eyes who sat smiling into her book never heeding that her bonnet was awry and the wind taking unwarrantable liberties with her ribbons and her hair  innocent debby turned her pages unaware that her fate sat opposite in the likeness of a serious blackbearded gentleman who watched the smiles rippling from her lips to her eyes with an interest that deepened as the minutes passed  if his paper had been full of anything but bronchial troches and spaldings prepared glue he would have found more profitable employment but it wasnt and with the usual readiness of idle souls he fell into evil ways and permitted curiosity that feminine sin to enter in and take possession of his manly mind a great desire seized him to discover what book his pretty neighbor but a cover hid the name and he was too distant to catch it on the fluttering leaves presently a stout emeraldislander with her wardrobe oozing out of sundry paper parcels vacated the seat behind the two ladies and it was soon quietly occupied by the individual for whom satan was finding such indecorous employment  peeping round the little gray bonnet past a brown braid and a fresh cheek the young mans eye fell upon the words the girl was reading and forgot to look away again  books were the desire of his life but an honorable purpose and an indomitable will kept him steady at his ledgers till he could feel that he had earned the right to read  like wine to many another was an open page to his he read a line and longing for more took a hasty sip from his neighbors cup forgetting that it was a strangers also  down the page went the two pairs of eyes and the merriment from debbys seemed to light up the sombre ones behind her with a sudden shine that softened the whole face and made it very winning  no wonder they twinkled for elijah pogram spoke and mrs hominy the mother of the modern gracchi in the classical blue cap and the red cotton pockethandkerchief came down the room in a procession of one a low laugh startled debby though it was smothered like the babes in the tower and turning she beheld the trespasser scarlet with confusion and sobered with a tardy sense of his transgression debby was not a starched young lady of the prune and prism school but a frank freehearted little body quick to read the sincerity of others and to take looks and words at their real value  dickens was her idol and for his sake she could have forgiven a greater offence than this  the strangers contrite countenance and respectful apology won her goodwill at once and with a finer courtesy than any aunt pen would have taught she smilingly bowed her pardon and taking another book from her basket opened it saying pleasantly  here is the first volume if you like it sir  i can recommend it as an invaluable consolation for the discomforts of a summer days journey and it is heartily at your service  as much surprised as gratified the gentleman accepted the book and retired behind it with the sudden discovery that wrongdoing has its compensation in the pleasurable sensation of being forgiven stolen delights are well known to be specially saccharine and much as this pardoned sinner loved books it seemed to him that the interest of the story flagged and that the enjoyment of reading was much enhanced by the proximity of a gray bonnet and a girlish profile but dickens soon proved more powerful than debby and she was forgotten till pausing to turn a leaf the young man met her shy glance as she asked with the pleased expression of a child who has shared an apple with a playmate  is it good  oh veryand the man looked as honestly grateful for the book as the boy would have done for the apple  only five words in the conversation but aunt pen woke as if the watchful spirit of propriety had roused her to pluck her charge from the precipice on which she stood  dora im astonished at you speaking to strangers in that free manner is a most unladylike thing  how came you to forget what i have told you over and over again about a proper reserve the energetic whisper reached the gentlemans ear and he expected to be annihilated with a look when his offence was revealed but he was spared that ordeal for the young voice answered softly  dont faint aunt pen i only did as id be done by for i had two books and the poor man looked so hungry for something to read that i couldnt resist sharing my goodies he will see that im a countrified little thing in spite of my fine feathers and wont be shocked at my want of rigidity and frigidity so dont look dismal and ill be prim and proper all the rest of the wayif i dont forget it  i wonder who he is may belong to some of our first families and in that case it might be worth while to exert ourselves you know did you learn his name dora whispered the elder lady  debby shook her head and murmured hushbut aunt pen had heard of matches being made in cars as well as in heaven and as an experienced general it became her to reconnoitre when one of the enemy approached her camp slightly altering her position she darted an allcomprehensive glance at the invader who seemed entirely absorbed for not an eyelash stirred during the scrutiny it lasted but an instant yet in that instant he was weighed and found wanting for that experienced eye detected that his cravat was two inches wider than fashion ordained that his coat was not of the latest style that his gloves were mended and his handkerchief neither cambric nor silk that was enough and sentence was passed forthwithsome respectable clerk goodlooking but poor and not at all the thing for dora and aunt pen turned to adjust a voluminous green veil over her nieces bonnet to shield it from the dust dear which process also shielded the face within from the eye of man  a curious smile half mirthful half melancholy passed over their neighbors lips but his peace of mind seemed undisturbed and he remained buried in his book till they reached  at dusk  as he returned it he offered his services in procuring a carriage or attending to luggage but mrs carroll with much dignity of aspect informed him that her servants would attend to those matters and bowing gravely he vanished into the night  as they rolled away to the hotel debby was wild to run down to the beach whence came the solemn music of the sea making the twilight beautiful  but aunt pen was too tired to do anything but sup in her own apartment and go early to bed and debby might as soon have proposed to walk up the great pyramid as to make her first appearance without that sage matron to mount guard over her so she resigned herself to pie and patience and fell asleep wishing it were tomorrow  at five a m a nightcapped head appeared at one of the myriad windows of the  hotel and remained there as if fascinated by the miracle of sunrise over the sea  under her simplicity of character and girlish merriment debby possessed a devout spirit and a nature full of the real poetry of life two gifts that gave her dawning womanhood its sweetest charm and made her what she was as she looked out that summer dawn upon the royal marriage of the ocean and the sun all petty hopes and longings faded out of sight and her young face grew luminous with thoughts too deep for words  her day was happier for that silent hour her life richer for the aspirations that uplifted her like beautiful strong angels and left a blessing when they went  the smile of the june sky touched her lips the morning red seemed to linger on her cheek and in her eye arose a light kindled by the shimmer of that broad sea of gold for nature rewarded her young votary well and gave her beauty when she offered love  how long she leaned there debby did not know steps from below roused her from her reverie and led her back into the world again  smiling at herself she stole to bed and lay wrapped in waking dreams as changeful as the shadows dancing on her chamberwall  the advent of her aunts maid victorine some two hours later was the signal to be up and doing and she meekly resigned herself into the hands of that functionary who appeared to regard her in the light of an animated pincushion as she performed the toiletceremonies with an absorbed aspect which impressed her subject with a sense of the solemnity of the occasion  now mademoiselle regard yourself and pronounce that you are ravishing victorine said at length folding her hands with a sigh of satisfaction as she fell back in an attitude of serene triumph  debby obeyed and inspected herself with great interest and some astonishment for there was a sweeping amplitude of array about the young lady whom she beheld in the muchbefrilled gown and embroidered skirts which somewhat alarmed her as to the navigation of a vessel with such a spread of sail while a curious sensation of being somebody else pervaded her from the crown of her head with its shining coils of hair to the soles of the french slippers whose energies seemed to have been devoted to the production of marvellous rosettes  yes i look very nice thank you and yet i feel like a doll helpless and fine and fancy i was more of a woman in my fresh gingham with a knot of clovers in my hair than i am now  aunt pen was very kind to get me all these pretty things but im afraid my mother would look horrified to see me in such a high state of flounce externally and so little room to breath internally  your mamma would not flatter me mademoiselle but come now to madame she is waiting to behold you and i have yet her toilet to make  and with a pitying shrug victorine followed debby to her aunts room  charming really elegant cried that lady emerging from her towel with a rubicund visage  drop that braid half an inch lower and pull the worked end of her handkerchief out of the righthand pocket vic  there now dora dont run about and get rumpled but sit quietly down and practice repose till i am ready  debby obeyed and sat mute with the air of a child in its sundaybest on a weekday pleased with the novelty but somewhat oppressed with the responsibility of such unaccustomed splendor and utterly unable to connect any ideas of repose with tight shoes and skirts in a rampant state of starch   well you see i bet on lady gay against cockadoodle and if youll believe mehullo theres mrs carroll and deuse take me if she hasnt got a girl with her  look seguinand joe leavenworth a man of the world aged twenty paused in his account of an exciting race to make the announcement  mr seguin his friend and mentor as much his senior in worldly wickedness as in years tore himself from his breakfast long enough to survey the newcomers and then returned to it saying briefly  the old lady is worth cultivatinggives good suppers and thanks you for eating them the girl is well got up but has no style and blushes like a milkmaid  better fight shy of her joe  do you think so  well now i rather fancy that kind of thing  shes new you see and i get on with that sort of girl the best for the old ones are so deused knowing that a fellow has no chance of aby the lord harry shes eating bread and milk  young leavenworth whisked his glass into his eye and mr seguin put down his roll to behold the phenomenon  poor debby her first step had been a wrong one  all great minds have their weak points  aunt pens was her breakfast and the peace of her entire day depended upon the success of that meal therefore being down rather late the worthy lady concentrated her energies upon the achievement of a copious repast and trusting to former lessons left debby to her own resources for a few fatal moments after the flutter occasioned by being scooped into her seat by a severenosed waiter debby had only courage enough left to refuse tea and coffee and accept milk  that being done she took the first familiar viand that appeared and congratulated herself upon being able to get her usual breakfast with returning composure she looked about her and began to  enjoy the buzz of voices the clatter of knives and forks and the long lines of faces all intent upon the business of the hour but her peace was of short duration pausing for a fresh relay of toast aunt pen glanced toward her niece with the comfortable conviction that her appearance was highly creditable and her dismay can be imagined when she beheld that young lady placidly devouring a great cup of brownbread and milk before the eyes of the assembled multitude  the poor lady choked in her coffee and between her gasps whispered irefully behind her napkin  for heavens sake dora put away that mess the ellenboroughs are directly opposite watching everything you do  eat that omelet or anything respectable unless you want me to die of mortification  debby dropped her spoon and hastily helping herself from the dish her aunt pushed toward her consumed the leathery compound with as much grace as she could assume though unable to repress a laugh at aunt pens disturbed countenance there was a slight lull in the clatter and the blithe sound caused several heads to turn toward the quarter whence it came for it was as unexpected and pleasant a sound as a bobolinks song in a cage of shrillvoiced canaries  shes a jolly little thing and powerful pretty so deuse take me if i dont make up to the old lady and find out who the girl is  ive been introduced to mrs carroll at our house but i suppose she wont remember me till i remind her  the deuse declining to accept of his repeated offers probably because there was still too much honor and honesty in the boy young leavenworth sought out mrs carroll on the piazza as she and debby were strolling there an hour later  joe leavenworth my dear from one of our first familiesvery wealthyfine matchpray be civilsmooth your hair hold back your shoulders and put down your parasol murmured aunt pen as the gentleman approached with as much pleasure in his countenance as it was consistent with manly dignity to express upon meeting two of the inferior race  my niece miss dora wilder  this is her first season at the beach and we must endeavor to make it pleasant for her or she will be getting homesick and running away to mamma said aunt pen in her societytone after she had returned his greeting and perpetrated a polite fiction by declaring that she remembered him perfectly for he was the image of his father  mr leavenworth brought the heels of his varnished boots together with a click and executed the latest bow imported then stuck his glass in his eye and stared till it fell out the glass not the eye upon which he fell into step with them remarking  i shall be most happy to show the lions they are deused tame ones so you neednt be alarmed miss wilder  debby was goodnatured enough to laugh and elated with that success he proceeded to pour forth his stores of wit and learning in true collegian style quite unconscious that the jolly little thing was looking him through and through with the smiling eyes that were producing such pleasurable sensations under the mosaic studs  they strolled toward the beach and meeting an old acquaintance aunt pen fell behind and beamed upon the young pair as if her prophetic eye even at this early stage beheld them walking altarward in a proper state of blond white vest and bridal awkwardness  can you skip a stone mr leavenworth asked debby possessed with a mischievous desire to shock the piece of elegance at her side  eh whats that he inquired with his head on one side like an inquisitive robin  debby repeated her question and illustrated it by sending a stone skimming over the water in the most scientific manner  mr joe was painfully aware that this was not at all the thing that his sisters never did so and that seguin would laugh confoundedly if he caught him at it but debby looked so irresistibly fresh and pretty under her roselined parasol that he was moved to confess that he had done such a thing and to sacrifice his gloves by poking in the sand that he might indulge in a like unfashionable pastime  youll be at the hop tonight i hope miss wilder he observed introducing a topic suited to a young ladys mental capacity  yes indeed for dancing is one of the joys of my life next to husking and making hay and debby polked a few steps along the beach much to the edification of a pair of old gentlemen serenely taking their first constitutional  making what cried mr joe poking after her  hay ah that is the pleasantest fun in the worldand better exercise my mother says for soul and body than dancing till dawn in crowded rooms with everything in a state of unnatural excitement  if one wants real merriment let him go into a newmown field where all the air is full of summer odors where wildflowers nod along the walls where blackbirds make finer music than any band and sun and wind and cheery voices do their part while windrows rise and great loads go rumbling through the lanes with merry brown faces atop  yes much as i like dancing it is not to be compared with that for in the one case we shut out the lovely world and in the other we become a part of it till by its magic labor turns to poetry and we harvest something better than dried buttercups and grass  as she spoke debby looked up expecting to meet a glance of disapproval but something in the simple earnestness of her manner had recalled certain boyish pleasures as innocent as they were hearty which now contrasted very favorably with the later pastimes in which fast horses and that lower class of animals fast men bore so large a part  mr joe thoughtfully punched five holes in the sand and for a moment debby liked the expression of his face then the old listlessness returned and looking up he said with an air of ennui that was half sad half ludicrous in one so young and so generously endowed with youth health and the good gifts of this life  i used to fancy that sort of thing years ago but im afraid i should find it a little slow now though you describe it in such an inviting manner that i would be tempted to try it if a haycock came in my way for upon my life its deused heavy work loafing about at these wateringplaces all summer  between ourselves theres a deal of humbug about this kind of life as you will find when youve tried it as long as i have  yes i begin to think so already but perhaps you can give me a few friendly words of warning from the stones of your experience that i may be spared the pain of saying what so many lookgrandma the world is hollow my doll is stuffed with sawdust and i should like to go into a convent if you please  debbys eyes were dancing with merriment but they were demurely downcast and her voice was perfectly serious  the milk of human kindness had been slightly curdled for mr joe by sundry collegetribulations and having been suspended he very naturally vibrated between the inborn jollity of his temperament and the bitterness occasioned by his wrongs  he had lost at billiards the night before had been hurried at breakfast had mislaid his cigarcase and splashed his boots consequently the darker mood prevailed that morning and when his counsel was asked he gave it like one who bad known the heaviest trials of this piljin projiss of a wale  theres no justice in the world no chance for us young people to enjoy ourselves without some penalty to pay some drawback to worry us like these confounded allrounders even here where all seems free and easy theres no end of gossips and spies who tattle and watch till you feel as if you lived in a lantern every one for himself and the devil take the hindmost thats the principle they go on and you have to keep your wits about you in the most exhausting manner or you are done for before you know it  ive seen a good deal of this sort of thing and hope youll get on better than some do when its known that you are the rich mrs carrolls niece though you dont need that fact to enhance your charmsupon my life you dont  debby laughed behind her parasol at this burst of candor but her independent nature prompted her to make a fair beginning in spite of aunt pens polite fictions and wellmeant plans  thank you for your warning but i dont apprehend much annoyance of that kind she said demurely  do you know i think if young ladies were truthfully labelled when they went into society it would be a charming fashion and save a world of trouble something in this stylearabella marabout aged nineteen fortune 100000 temper warranted laura eaudecologne aged twentyeight fortune 30000 temper slightly damaged deborah wilder aged eighteen fortune one pair of hands one head indifferently well filled one heart not in the market temper decided and no expectations there you see that would do away with much of the humbug you lament and we poor souls would know at once whether we were sought for our fortunes or ourselves and that would be so comfortable  mr leavenworth turned away with a convicted sort of expression as she spoke and making a spyglass of his hand seemed to be watching something out at sea with absorbing interest  he had been guilty of a strong desire to discover whether debby was an heiress but had not expected to be so entirely satisfied on that important subject and was dimly conscious that a keen eye had seen his anxiety and a quick wit devised a means of setting it at rest forever  somewhat disconcerted he suddenly changed the conversation and like many another distressed creature took to the water saying briskly  bytheby miss wilder as ive engaged to do the honors shall i have the pleasure of bathing with you when the fun begins  as you are fond of haymaking i suppose you intend to pay your respects to the old gentleman with the threepronged pitchfork  yes aunt pen means to put me through a course of salt water and any instructions in the art of navigation will be gratefully received for i never saw the ocean before and labor under a firm conviction that once in i never shall come out again till i am brought like mr mantilini a damp moist unpleasant body  as debby spoke mrs carroll hove in sight coming down before the wind with all sails set and signals of distress visible long before she dropped anchor and came alongside  the devoted woman had been strolling slowly for the girls sake though oppressed with a mournful certainty that her most prominent feature was fast becoming a fine coppercolor yet she had sustained herself like a spartan matron till it suddenly occurred to her that her charge might be suffering a like    seachange   into something rich and strange  her fears however were groundless for debby met her without a freckle looking all the better for her walk and though her feet were wet with chasing the waves and her pretty gown the worse for salt water aunt pen never chid her for the destruction of her raiment nor uttered a warning word against an unladylike exuberance of spirits but replied to her inquiry most graciously  certainly my love we shall bathe at eleven and there will be just time to get victorine and our dresses so run on to the house and i will join you as soon as i have finished what i am saying to mrs earlthen added in a stageaside as she put a fallen lock off the girls forehead you are doing beautifully  he is evidently struck make yourself interesting and dont burn your nose i beg of you  debbys bright face clouded over and she walked on with so much stateliness that her escort wondered what the deuse the old lady had done to her and exerted himself to the utmost to recall her merry mood but with indifferent success   now i begin to feel more like myself for this is getting back to first principles though i fancy i look like the little old woman who fell asleep on the kings highway and woke up with abbreviated drapery and you look funnier still aunt pen said debby as she tied on her pagodahat and followed mrs carroll who walked out of her dressingroom an animated bale of blue cloth surmounted by a gigantic sunbonnet  mr leavenworth was in waiting and so like a blondheaded lobster in his scarlet suit that debby could hardly keep her countenance as they joined the groups of bathers gathering along the breezy shore  for an hour each day the actors and actresses who played their different roles at the  hotel with such precision and success put off their masks and dared to be themselves  the ocean wrought the change for it took old and young into its arms and for a little while they played like children in their mothers lap  no falsehood could withstand its rough sincerity for the waves washed paint and powder from worn faces and left a fresh bloom there  no ailment could entirely resist its vigorous cure for every wind brought healing on its wings endowing many a meagre life with another year of health  no gloomy spirit could refuse to listen to its lullaby and the spray baptized it with the subtile benediction of a cheerier mood  no rank held place there for the democratic sea toppled down the greatest statesman in the land and dashed over the bald pate of a millionnaire with the same whitecrested wave that stranded a poor parson on the beach and filled a fierce reformers mouth with brine  no fashion ruled but that which is as old as edenthe beautiful fashion of simplicity  belles dropped their affectations with their hoops and ran about the shore blithehearted girls again young men forgot their vices and their follies and were not ashamed of the real courage strength and skill they had tried to leave behind them with their boyish plays  old men gathered shells with the little cupids dancing on the sand and were better for that innocent companionship and young mothers never looked so beautiful as when they rocked their babies on the bosom of the sea  debby vaguely felt this charm and yielding to it splashed and sang like any beachbird while aunt pen bobbed placidly up and down in a retired corner and mr leavenworth swam to and fro expressing his firm belief in mermaids sirens and the rest of the aquatic sisterhood whose warbling no manly ear can resist  miss wilder you must learn to swim  ive taught quantities of young ladies and shall be delighted to launch the dora if youll accept me as a pilot  stop a bit ill get a lifepreserver and leaving debby to flirt with the waves the scarlet youth departed like a flame of fire  a dismal shriek interrupted his pupils play and looking up she saw her aunt beckoning wildly with one hand while she was groping in the water with the other debby ran to her alarmed at her tragic expression and mrs carroll drawing the girls face into the privacy of her big bonnet whispered one awful word adding distractedly  dive for them oh dive for them i shall be perfectly helpless if they are lost  i cant dive aunt pen but there is a man let us ask him said debby as a black head appeared to windward  but mrs carrolls nerves had received a shock and gathering up her dripping garments she fled precipitately along the shore and vanished into her dressingroom  debbys keen sense of the ludicrous got the better of her respect and peal after peal of laughter broke from her lips till a splash behind her put an end to her merriment and turning she found that this friend in need was her acquaintance of the day before  the gentleman seemed pausing for permission to approach with much the appearance of a sagacious newfoundland wistful and wet  oh im very glad its you sir was debbys cordial greeting as she shook a drop off the end of her nose and nodded smiling  the newcomer immediately beamed upon her like an amiable triton saying as they turned shoreward  our first interview opened with a laugh on my side and our second with one on yours  i accept the fact as a good omen  your friend seemed in trouble allow me to atone for my past misdemeanors by offering my services now  but first let me introduce myself and as i believe in the fitness of things let me present you with an appropriate card and stooping the young man wrote frank evan on the hard sand at debbys feet  the girl liked his manner and entering into the spirit of the thing swept as grand a curtsy as her limited drapery would allow saying merrily  i am debby wilder or dora as aunt prefers to call me and instead of laughing i ought to be four feet under water looking for something we have lost but i cant dive and my distress is dreadful as you see  what have you lost  i will look for it and bring it back in spite of the kelpies if it is a human possibility replied mr evan pushing his wet locks out of his eyes and regarding the ocean with a determined aspect  debby leaned toward him whispering with solemn countenance  it is a set of teeth sir  mr evan was more a man of deeds than words therefore he disappeared at once with a mighty splash and after repeated divings and much laughter appeared bearing the chief ornament of mrs penelope carrolls comely countenance  debby looked very pretty and grateful as she returned her thanks and mr  evan was guilty of a secret wish that all the worthy ladys features were at the bottom of the sea that he might have the satisfaction of restoring them to her attractive niece but curbing this unnatural desire he bowed saying gravely  tell your aunt if you please that this little accident will remain a dead secret so far as i am concerned and i am very glad to have been of service at such a critical moment  whereupon mr evan marched again into the briny deep and debby trotted away to her aunt whom she found a clammy heap of blue flannel and despair mrs carrolls temper was ruffled and though she joyfully rattled in her teeth she said somewhat testily when debbys story was done  now that man will have a sort of claim on us and we must be civil whoever he is dear dear i wish it had been joe leavenworth instead evani dont remember any of our first families with connections of that name and i dislike to be under obligations to a person of that sort for theres no knowing how far he may presume so pray be careful dora  i think you are very ungrateful aunt pen and if mr evan should happen to be poor it does not become me to turn up my nose at him for im nothing but a makebelieve myself just now i dont wish to go down upon my knees to him but i do intend to be as kind to him as i should to that conceited leavenworth boy yes kinder even for poor people value such things more as i know very well  mrs carroll instantly recovered her temper changed the subject and privately resolved to confine her prejudices to her own bosom as they seemed to have an aggravating effect upon the youthful person whom she had set her heart on disposing of to the best advantage  debby took her swimminglesson with much success and would have achieved her dinner with composure if whiteaproned gentlemen had not effectually taken away her appetite by whisking billsoffare into her hands and awaiting her orders with a fatherly interest which induced them to congregate mysterious dishes before her and blandly rectify her frequent mistakes she survived the ordeal however and at four pm went to drive with that leavenworth boy in the finest turnout  could produce  aunt pen then came off guard and with a sigh of satisfaction subsided into a peaceful doze still murmuring even in her sleep  propinquity my love propinquity works wonders    aunt pen are you a modest woman asked the young crusader against established absurdities as she came into the presencechamber that evening ready for the hop  bless the child what does she mean cried mrs carroll with a start that twitched her backhair out of victorines hands  would you like to have a daughter of yours go to a party looking as i look continued her niece spreading her airy dress and standing very erect before her astonished relative  why of course i should and be proud to own such a charming creature regarding the slender white shape with much approbationadding with a smile as she met the girls eye  ah i see the difficulty now you are disturbed because there is not a bit of lace over these pretty shoulders of yours  now dont be absurd dora the dress is perfectly proper or madame tiphany never would have sent it home it is the fashion child and many a girl with such a figure would go twice as decolletee and think nothing of it i assure you  debby shook her head with an energy that set the pink heatherbells atremble in her hair and her color deepened beautifully as she said with reproachful eyes  aunt pen i think there is a better fashion in every young girls heart than any madame tiphany can teach  i am very grateful for all you have done for me but i cannot go into public in such an undress as this my mother would never allow it and father never forgive it please dont ask me to for indeed i cannot do it even for you  debby looked so pathetic that both mistress and maid broke into a laugh which somewhat reassured the young lady who allowed her determined features to relax into a smile as she said  now aunt pen you want me to look pretty and be a credit to you but how would you like to see my face the color of those geraniums all the evening  why dora you are out of your mind to ask such a thing when you know its the desire of my life to keep your color down and make you look more delicate said her aunt alarmed at the fearful prospect of a peonyfaced protegee  well i should be anything but that if i wore this gown in its present waistless condition so here is a remedy which will prevent such a calamity and ease my mind  as she spoke debby tied on her little blonde fichu with a gesture which left nothing more to be said  victorine scolded and clasped her hands but mrs carroll fearing to push her authority too far made a virtue of necessity saying resignedly  have your own way dora but in return oblige me by being agreeable to such persons as i may introduce to you and some day when i ask a favor remember how much i hope to do for you and grant it cheerfully  indeed i will aunt pen if it is anything i can do without disobeying mothers notions as you call them  ask me to wear an orangecolored gown or dance with the plainest poorest man in the room and ill do it for there never was a kinder aunt than mine in all the world cried debby eager to atone for her seeming wilfulness and really grateful for her escape from what seemed to her benighted mind a very imminent peril  like a cloverblossom in a vase of camellias little debby looked that night among the dashing or languid women who surrounded her for she possessed the charm they had lostthe freshness of her youth innocent gayety sat smiling in her eyes healthful roses bloomed upon her cheek and maiden modesty crowned her like a garland she was the creature that she seemed and yielding to the influence of the hour danced to the music of her own blithe heart many felt the spell whose secret they had lost the power to divine and watched the girlish figure as if it were a symbol of their early aspirations dawning freshly from the dimness of their past more than one old man thought again of some little maid whose love made his boyish days a pleasant memory to him now more than one smiling fop felt the emptiness of his smooth speech when the truthful eyes looked up into his own and more than one pale woman sighed regretfully with herself i too was a happyhearted creature once  that mr evan does not seem very anxious to claim our acquaintance after all and i think better of him on that account  has he spoken to you tonight dora asked mrs carroll as debby dropped down beside her after a splendid polka  no maam he only bowed  you see some people are not so presuming as other people thought they were for we are not the most attractive beings on the planet therefore a gentleman can be polite and then forget us without breaking any of the ten commandments  dont be offended with him yet for he may prove to be some great creature with a finer pedigree than any of your first families mr leavenworth as you know everybody perhaps you can relieve aunt pens mind by telling her something about the tall brown man standing behind the lady with salmoncolored hair  mr joe who was fanning the top of debbys head with the best intentions in life took a survey and answered readily  why thats frank evan  i know him and a deused good fellow he isthough he dont belong to our set you know  indeed pray tell us something about him mr leavenworth  we met in the cars and he did us a favor or two  who and what is the man asked mrs carroll relenting at once toward a person who was favorably spoken of by one who did belong to her set  well let me see began mr joe whose narrative powers were not great he is a bookkeeper in my uncle josh lorings importing concern and a powerful smart man they say  theres some kind of clever story about his fathers leaving a load of debts and franks working a deused number of years till they were paid  good of him wasnt it then just as he was going to take things easier and enjoy life a bit his mother died and that rather knocked him up you see  he fell sick and came to grief generally uncle josh said so he was ordered off to get righted and here he is looking like a tombstone ive a regard for frank for he took care of me through the smallpox a year ago and i dont forget things of that sort so if you wish to be introduced mrs carroll ill trot him out with pleasure and make a proud man of him  mrs carroll glanced at debby and as that young lady was regarding mr joe with a friendly aspect owing to the warmth of his words she graciously assented and the youth departed on his errand  mr evan went through the ceremony with a calmness wonderful to behold considering the position of one lady and the charms of the other and soon glided into the conversation with the ease of a most accomplished courtier  now i must tear myself away for im engaged to that stout miss bandoline for this dance shes a friend of my sisters and i must do the civil you know powerful slow work it is too but i pity the poor soulupon my life i do and mr joe assumed the air of a martyr  debby looked up with a wicked smile in her eyes as she said  ah that sounds very amiable here but in five minutes youll be murmuring in miss bandolines earmive been pining to come to you this half hour but i was obliged to take out that miss wilder you seecountrified little thing enough but not badlooking and has a rich aunt so ive done my duty to her but deuse take me if i can stand it any longer  mr evan joined in debbys merriment but mr joe was so appalled at the sudden attack that he could only stammer a remonstrance and beat a hasty retreat wondering how on earth she came to know that his favorite style of making himself agreeable to one young lady was by decrying another  dora my love that is very rude and deuse is not a proper expression for a womans lips pray restrain your lively tongue for strangers may not understand that it is nothing but the sprightliness of your disposition which sometimes runs away with you  it was only a quotation and i thought you would admire anything mr leavenworth said aunt pen replied debby demurely  mrs carroll trod on her foot and abruptly changed the conversation by saying with an appearance of deep interest  mr evan you are doubtless connected with the malcoms of georgia for they i believe are descended from the ancient evans of scotland they are a very wealthy and aristocratic family and i remember seeing their coatofarms once three bannocks and a thistle  mr evan had been standing before them with a composure which impressed mrs carroll with a belief in his gentle blood for she remembered her own fussy plebeian husband whose fortune had never been able to purchase him the manners of a gentleman  mr evan only grew a little more erect as he replied with an untroubled mien  i cannot claim relationship with the malcoms of georgia or the evans of scotland i believe madam  my father was a farmer my grandfather a blacksmith and beyond that my ancestors may have been streetsweepers for anything i know but whatever they were i fancy they were honest men for that has always been our boast though like president jacksons our coatofarms is nothing but a pair of shirtsleeves  from debbys eyes there shot a bright glance of admiration for the young man who could look two comely women in the face and serenely own that he was poor  mrs carroll tried to appear at ease and gliding out of personalities expatiated on the comfort of living in a land where fame and fortune were attainable by all who chose to earn them and the contempt she felt for those who had no sympathy with the humbler classes no interest in the welfare of the race and many more moral reflections as new and original as the multiplicationtable or the westminster catechism to all of which mr evan listened with polite deference though there was something in the keen intelligence of his eye that made debby blush for shallow aunt pen and rejoice when the good lady got out of her depth and seized upon a new subject as a drowning mariner would a hencoop  dora mr ellenborough is coming this way you have danced with him but once and he is a very desirable partner so pray accept if he asks you said mrs carroll watching a faroff individual who seemed steering his zigzag course toward them  i never intend to dance with mr ellenborough again so please dont urge me aunt pen and debby knit her brows with a somewhat irate expression  my love you astonish me  he is a most agreeable and accomplished young manspent three years in paris moves in the first circles and is considered an ornament to fashionable society  what can be your objection dora cried mrs carroll looking as alarmed as if her niece had suddenly announced her belief in the koran  one of his accomplishments consists in drinking champagne till he is not a desirable partner for any young lady with a prejudice in favor of decency  his moving in circles is just what i complain of and if he is an ornament i prefer my society undecorated  aunt pen i cannot make the nice distinctions you would have me and a sot in broadcloth is as odious as one in rags forgive me but i cannot dance with that silverlabelled decanter again  debby was a genuine little piece of womanhood and though she tried to speak lightly her color deepened as she remembered looks that had wounded her like insults and her indignant eyes silenced the excuses rising to her aunts lips  mrs carroll began to rue the hour she ever undertook the guidance of sister deborahs headstrong child and for an instant heartily wished she had left her to bloom unseen in the shadow of the parsonage but she concealed her annoyance still hoping to overcome the girls absurd resolve by saying mildly  as you please dear but if you refuse mr ellenborough you will be obliged to sit through the dance which is your favorite you know  debbys countenance fell for she had forgotten that and the lancers was to her the crowning rapture of the night  she paused a moment and aunt pen brightened but debby made her little sacrifice to principle as heroically as many a greater one had been made and with a wistful look down the long room answered steadily though her foot kept time to the first strains as she spoke  then i will sit aunt pen for that is preferable to staggering about the room with a partner who has no idea of the laws of gravitation  shall i have the honor of averting either calamity said mr evan coming to the rescue with a devotion beautiful to see for dancing was nearly a lost art with him and the lancers to a novice is equal to a second labyrinth of crete  oh thank you cried debby tumbling fan bouquet and handkerchief into mrs carrolls lap with a look of relief that repaid him fourfold for the trials he was about to undergo  they went merrily away together leaving aunt pen to wish that it was according to the laws of etiquette to rap officious gentlemen over the knuckles when they introduce their fingers into private pies without permission from the chief cook  how the dance went debby hardly knew for the conversation fell upon books and in the interest of her favorite theme she found even the grand square an impertinent interruption while her own deficiences became almost as great as her partners yet when the music ended with a flourish and her last curtsy was successfully achieved she longed to begin all over again and secretly regretted that she was engaged four deep  how do you like our new acquaintance dora asked aunt pen following joe leavenworth with her eye as the yellowhaired laddie whirled by with the ponderous miss flora  very much and im glad we met as we did for it makes things free and easy and that is so agreeable in this ceremonious place replied debby looking in quite an opposite direction  well im delighted to hear you say so dear for i was afraid you had taken a dislike to him and he is really a very charming young man just the sort of person to make a pleasant companion for a few weeks these little friendships are part of the summers amusement and do no harm so smile away dora and enjoy yourself while you may  yes aunt i certainly will and all the more because i have found a sensible soul to talk to do you know he is very witty and well informed though he says he never had much time for selfcultivation but i think trouble makes people wise and he seems to have had a good deal though he leaves it for others to tell of  i am glad you are willing i should know him for i shall enjoy talking about my pet heroes with him as a relief from the silly chatter i must keep up most of the time  mrs carroll was a woman of one idea and though a slightly puzzled expression appeared in her face she listened approvingly and answered with a gracious smile  of course i should not object to your knowing such a person my love but id no idea joe leavenworth was a literary man or had known much trouble except his fathers death and his sister clementinas runawaymarriage with her drawingmaster  debby opened her brown eyes very wide and hastily picked at the down on her fan but had no time to correct her aunts mistake for the real subject of her commendations appeared at that moment and mrs caroll was immediately absorbed in the consumption of a large pink ice  that girl is what i call a surpriseparty now remarked mr joe confidentially to his cigar as he pulled off his coat and stuck his feet up in the privacy of his own apartment she looks as mild as strawberries and cream till you come to the complimentary then she turns on a fellow with that deused satirical look of hers and makes him feel like a fool  ill try the moral dodge tomorrow and see what effect that will have for she is mighty taking and i must amuse myself somehow you know  how many years will it take to change that freshhearted little girl into a fashionable belle i wonder thought frank evan as he climbed the four flights that led to his skyparlor  what a curious world this is mused debby with her nightcap in her hand  the right seems odd and rude the wrong respectable and easy and this sort of life a merrygoround with no higher aim than pleasure  well i have made my declaration of independence and aunt pen must be ready for a revolution if she taxes me too heavily  as she leaned her hot cheek on her arm debbys eye fell on the quaint little cap made by the motherly hands that never were tired of working for her  she touched it tenderly and loves simple magic swept the gathering shadows from her face and left it clear again as her thoughts flew home like birds into the shelter of their nest  good night mother ill face temptation steadily ill try to take life cheerily and do nothing that shall make your dear face a reproach when it looks into my own again  then debby said her prayers like any pious child and lay down to dream of pulling buttercups with baby bess and singing in the twilight on her fathers knee    the history of debbys first day might serve as a sample of most that followed as week after week went by with varying pleasures and increasing interest to more than one young debutante  mrs carroll did her best but debby was too simple for a belle too honest for a flirt too independent for a fine lady she would be nothing but her sturdy little self open as daylight gay as a lark and blunt as any puritan  poor aunt pen was in despair till she observed that the girl often took with the very peculiarities which she was lamenting this somewhat consoled her and she tried to make the best of the pretty bit of homespun which would not and could not become velvet or brocade  seguin ellenborough  co looked with lordly scorn upon her as a worm blind to their attractions  miss macrimsy and her set quizzed her unmercifully behind her back after being worsted in several passages of arms and more than one successful mamma condoled with aunt pen upon the terribly defective education of her charge till that stout matron could have found it in her heart to tweak off their caps and walk on them like the irascible betsey trotwood  but debby had a circle of admirers who loved her with a sincerity few summer queens could boast for they were real friends won by gentle arts and retained by the gracious sweetness of her nature  moonfaced babies crowed and clapped their chubby hands when she passed by their wickerthrones storyloving children clustered round her knee and never were denied pale invalids found wildflowers on their pillows and forlorn papas forgot the state of the moneymarket when she sang for them the homely airs their daughters had no time to learn  certain plain young ladies poured their woes into her friendly ear and were comforted several smart sophomores fell into a state of chronic stammer blush and adoration when she took a motherly interest in their affairs and a melancholy old frenchman blessed her with the enthusiasm of his nation because she put a posy in the buttonhole of his rusty coat and never failed to smile and bow as he passed by  yet debby was no edgworth heroine preternaturally prudent wise and untemptable she had a fine crop of piques vanities and dislikes growing up under this new style of cultivation she loved admiration enjoyed her purple and fine linen hid newborn envy disappointed hope and wounded pride behind a smiling face and often thought with a sigh of the humdrum duties that awaited her at home  but under the airs and graces aunt pen cherished with such sedulous care under the flounces and furbelows victorine daily adjusted with groans under the polish which she acquired with feminine ease the girls heart still beat steadfast and strong and conscience kept watch and ward that no traitor should enter in to surprise the citadel which motherlove had tried to garrison so well  in pursuance of his sage resolve  mr joe tried the moral dodge as he elegantly expressed it and failing in that followed it up with the tragic religious negligent and devoted ditto but acting was not his forte so debby routed him in all and at last when he was at his wits end for an idea she suggested one and completed her victory by saying pleasantly  you took me behind the curtain too soon and now the pastediamonds and cottonvelvet dont impose upon me a bit  just be your natural self and we shall get on nicely mr leavenworth  the novelty of the proposal struck his fancy and after a few relapses it was carried into effect and thenceforth with debby he became the simple goodhumored lad nature designed him to be and as a proof of it soon fell very sincerely in love  frank evan seated in the parquet of society surveyed the dresscircle with much the same expression that debby had seen during aunt pens oration but he soon neglected that amusement to watch several actors in the drama going on before his eyes while a strong desire to perform a part therein slowly took possession of his mind  debby always had a look of welcome when he came always treated him with the kindness of a generous woman who has had an opportunity to forgive and always watched the serious solitary man with a great compassion for his loss a growing admiration for his upright life more than once the beachbirds saw two figures pacing the sands at sunrise with the peace of early day upon their faces and the light of a kindred mood shining in their eyes  more than once the friendly ocean made a third in the pleasant conversation and its low undertone came and went between the mellow bass and silvery treble of the human voices with a melody that lent another charm to interviews which soon grew wondrous sweet to man and maid  aunt pen seldom saw the twain together seldom spoke of evan and debby held her peace for when she planned to make her innocent confessions she found that what seemed much to her was nothing to another ear  and scarcely worth the telling so unconscious as yet whither the green path led she went on her way leading two lives one rich and earnest hoarded deep within herself the other frivolous and gay for all the world to criticize  but those venerable spinsters the fates took the matter into their own hands and soon got the better of those shortsighted matrons mesdames grundy and carroll for long before they knew it frank and debby had begun to read together a book greater than dickens ever wrote and when they had come to the fairest part of the sweet story adam first told eve they looked for the name upon the titlepage and found that it was love  fight weeks came and wenteight wonderfully happy weeks to debby and her friend for propinquity had worked more wonders than poor mrs carroll knew as the only one she saw or guessed was the utter captivation of joe leavenworth he had become himself to such an extent that a change of identity would have been a relief for the object of his adoration showed no signs of relenting and he began to fear that as debby said her heart was not in the market she was always friendly but never made those interesting betrayals of regard which are so encouraging to youthful gentlemen who fain would climb yet fear to fall she never blushed when he pressed her hand never fainted or grew pale when he appeared with a smashed trottingwagon and black eye and actually slept through a serenade that would have won any other womans soul out of her body with its despairing quavers matters were getting desperate for horses lost their charms flowing bowls palled upon his lips ruffled shirtbosoms no longer delighted him and hops possessed no soothing power to allay the anguish of his mind  mr seguin after unavailing ridicule and pity took compassion on him and from his large experience suggested a remedy just as he was departing for a more congenial sphere  now dont be an idiot joe but if you want to keep your hand in and go through a regular chapter of flirtation just right about face and devote yourself to some one else  nothing like jealousy to teach womankind their own minds and a touch of it will bring little wilder round in a jiffy  try it my boy and good luck to youwith which christian advice mr seguin slapped his pupil on the shoulder and disappeared like a modern mephistopheles in a cloud of cigarsmoke  im glad hes gone for in my present state of mind hes not up to my mark at all  ill try his plan though and flirt with clara west shes engaged so it wont damage her affections her lover isnt here so it wont disturb his and by jove  i must do something for i cant stand this suspense  debby was infinitely relieved by this new move and infinitely amused as she guessed the motive that prompted it but the more contented she seemed the more violently mr joe flirted with her rival till at last weakminded miss clara began to think her absent george the most undesirable of lovers and to mourn that she ever said yes to a merchants clerk when she might have said it to a merchants son aunt pen watched and approved this stratagem hoped for the best results and believed the day won when debby grew pale and silent and followed with her eyes the young couple who were playing battledore and shuttlecock with each others hearts as if she took some interest in the game but aunt pen clashed her cymbals too soon for debbys trouble had a better source than jealousy and in the silence of the sleepless nights that stole her bloom she was taking counsel of her own full heart and resolving to serve another woman as she would herself be served in a like peril though etiquette was outraged and the customs of polite society turned upside down    look aunt pen what lovely shells and moss ive got such a splendid scramble over the rocks as ive had with mrs duncans boys it seemed so like home to run and sing with a troop of topsyturvy children that it did me good and i wish you had all been there to see cried debby running into the drawingroom one day where mrs carroll and a circle of ladies sat enjoying a dish of highly flavored scandal as they exercised their eyesight over fancywork  my dear dora spare my nerves and if you have any regard for the proprieties of life dont go romping in the sun with a parcel of noisy boys  if you could see what an object you are i think you would try to imitate miss clara who is always a model of elegant repose  miss west primmed up her lips and settled a fold in her ninth flounce as mrs carroll spoke while the whole group fixed their eyes with dignified disapproval on the invader of their refined society  debby had come like a fresh wind into a sultry room but no one welcomed the healthful visitant no one saw a pleasant picture in the brightfaced girl with windtossed hair and rustic hat heaped with moss and manytinted shells they only saw that her gown was wet her gloves forgotten and her scarf trailing at her waist in a manner no wellbred lady could approve  the sunshine faded out of debbys face and there was a touch of bitterness in her tone as she glanced at the circle of fashionplates saying with an earnestness which caused miss west to open her pale eyes to their widest extent  aunt pen dont freeze me yetdont take away my faith in simple things but let me be a child a little longerlet me play and sing and keep my spirit blithe among the dandelions and the robins while i can for trouble comes soon enough and all my life will be the richer and the better for a happy youth  mrs carroll had nothing at hand to offer in reply to this appeal and four ladies dropped their work to stare but frank evan looked in from the piazza saying as he beckoned like a boy  ill play with you miss dora come and make sand pies upon the shore please let her mrs carroll well be very good and not wet our pinafores or feet  without waiting for permission debby poured her treasures into the lap of a certain lame freddy and went away to a kind of play she had never known before  quiet as a chidden child she walked beside her companion who looked down at the little figure longing to take it on his knee and call the sunshine back again  that he dared not do but accident the lovers friend performed the work and did him a good turn beside  the old frenchman was slowly approaching when a frolicsome wind whisked off his hat and sent it skimming along the beach  in spite of her late lecture away went debby and caught the truant chapeau just as a wave was hurrying up to claim it this restored her cheerfulness and when she returned she was herself again  a thousand thanks but does mademoiselle remember the forfeit i might demand to add to the favor she has already done me asked the gallant old gentleman as debby took the hat off her own head and presented it with a martial salute  ah i had forgotten that but you may claim text missing in original copy do something more to give you pleasure and debby looked up into the withered face which had grown familiar to her with kind eyes full of pity and respect  her manner touched the old man very much he bent his gray head before her saying gratefully  my child i am not good enough to salute these blooming checks but i shall pray the virgin to reward you for the compassion you bestow on the poor exile and i shall keep your memory very green through all my life  he kissed her hand as if it were a queens and went on his way thinking of the little daughter whose death left him childless in a foreign land  debby softly began to sing oh come unto the yellow sands but stopped in the middle of a line to say  shall i tell you why i did what aunt pen would call a very unladylike and improper thing mr evans  if you will be so kind and her companion looked delighted at the confidence about to be reposed in him  somewhere across this great wide sea i hope i have a brother debby said with softened voice and a wistful look into the dim horizon five years ago he left us and we have never heard from him since except to know that he landed safely in australia  people tell us he is dead but i believe he will yet come home and so i love to help and pity any man who needs it rich or poor young or old hoping that as i do by them some tenderhearted woman far away will do by brother will  as debby spoke across frank evans face there passed the look that seldom comes but once to any young mans countenance for suddenly the moment dawned when love asserted its supremacy and putting pride doubt and fear underneath its feet ruled the strong heart royally and bent it to its will  debbys thoughts had floated across the sea but they came swiftly back when her companion spoke again steadily and slow but with a subtile change in tone and manner which arrested them at once  miss dora if you should meet a man who had known a laborious youth a solitary manhood who had no sweet domestic ties to make home beautiful and keep his nature warm who longed most ardently to be so blessed and made it the aim of his life to grow more worthy the good gift should it ever comeif you should learn that you possessed the power to make this fellowcreatures happiness could you find it in your gentle heart to take compassion on him for the love of brother will  debby was silent wondering why heart and nerves and brain were stirred by such a sudden thrill why she dared not look up and why when she desired so much to speak she could only answer in a voice that sounded strange to her own ears  i cannot tell  still steadily and slow with strong emotion deepening and softening his voice the lover at her side went on  will you ask yourself this question in some quiet hour  for such a man has lived in the sunshine of your presence for eight happy weeks and now when his holiday is done he finds that the old solitude will be more sorrowful than ever unless he can discover whether his summer dream will change into a beautiful reality  miss dora i have very little to offer you a faithful heart to cherish you a strong arm to work for you an honest name to give into your keepingthese are all but if they have any worth in your eyes they are most truly yours forever  debby was steadying her voice to reply when a troop of bathers came shouting down the bank and she took flight into her dressingroom there to sit staring at the wall till the advent of aunt pen forced her to resume the business of the hour by assuming her aquatic attire and stealing shyly down into the surf  frank evan still pacing in the footprints they had lately made watched the lithe figure tripping to and fro and as he looked murmured to himself the last line of a ballad debby sometimes sang    dance light for my heart it lies under your feet love  presently a great wave swept debby up and stranded her very near him much to her confusion and his satisfaction shaking the spray out of her eyes she was hurrying away when frank said  you will trip miss dora let me tie these strings for you and suiting the action to the word he knelt down and began to fasten the cords of her bathing shoe  debby stood looking down at the tall head bent before her with a curious sense of wonder that a look from her could make a strong man flush and pale as he had done and she was trying to concoct some friendly speech when frank still fumbling at the knots said very earnestly and low  forgive me if i am selfish in pressing for an answer but i must go tomorrow and a single word will change my whole future for the better or the worse  wont you speak it dora  if they had been alone debby would have put her arms about his neck and said it with all her heart but she had a presentiment that she should cry if her love found vent and here forty pairs of eyes were on them and salt water seemed superfluous  besides debby had not breathed the air of coquetry so long without a touch of the infection and the love of power that lies dormant in the meekest womans breast suddenly awoke and tempted her  if you catch me before i reach that rock perhaps i will say yes was her unexpected answer and before her lover caught her meaning she was floating leisurely away  frank was not in bathingcostume and debby never dreamed that he would take her at her word but she did not know the man she had to deal with for taking no second thought he flung hat and coat away and dashed into the sea  this gave a serious aspect to debbys foolish jest  a feeling of dismay seized her when she saw a resolute face dividing the waves behind her and thought of the rash challenge she had given but she had a spirit of her own and had profited well by mr joes instructions so she drew a long breath and swam as if for life instead of love evan was incumbered by his clothing and debby had much the start of him but like a second leander he hoped to win his hero and lending every muscle to the work gained rapidly upon the little hat which was his beacon through the foam  debby heard the deep breathing drawing nearer and nearer as her pursuers strong arms cleft the water and sent it rippling past her lips something like terror took possession of her for the strength seemed going out of her limbs and the rock appeared to recede before her but the unconquerable blood of the pilgrims was in her veins and nil desperandum her motto so setting her teeth she muttered defiantly  ill not be beaten if i go to the bottom  a great splashing arose and when evan recovered the use of his eyes the pagodahat had taken a sudden turn and seemed making for the farthest point of the goal i am sure of her now thought frank and like a gallant seagod he bore down upon his prize clutching it with a shout of triumph  but the hat was empty and like a mocking echo came debbys laugh as she climbed exhausted to a cranny in the rock  a very neat thing by jove deuse take me if you ant an honor to your teacher and a terror to the foe miss wilder cried mr joe as he came up from a solitary cruise and dropped anchor at her side here bring along the hat evan im going to crown the victor with appropriate whatdyecallems he continued pulling a handful of seaweed that looked like wellboiled greens  frank came up smiling but his lips were white and in his eye a look debby could not meet so being full of remorse she naturally assumed an air of gayety and began to sing the merriest air she knew merely because she longed to throw herself upon the stones and cry violently  it was most as exciting as a regatta and you pulled well evan but you had too much ballast aboard and miss wilder ran up false colors just in time to save her ship  what was the wager asked the lively joseph complacently surveying his marine millinery which would have scandalized a fashionable mermaid  only a trifle answered debby knotting up her braids with a revengeful jerk  its taken the wind out of your sails i fancy evan for you look immensely byronic with the starch minus in your collar and your hair in a poetic toss  come ill try a race with you and miss wilder will dance all the evening with the winner  bless the man whats he doing down there  burying sunfish hey  frank had been sitting below them on a narrow strip of sand absently piling up a little mound that bore some likeness to a grave  as his companion spoke he looked at it and a sudden flush of feeling swept across his face as he replied  no only a dead hope  deuse take it yes a good many of that sort of craft founder in these waters as i know to my sorrow and sighing tragically  mr joe turned to help debby from her perch but she had glided silently into the sea and was gone  for the next four hours the poor girl suffered the sharpest pain she had ever known for now she clearly saw the strait her folly had betrayed her into frank evan was a proud man and would not ask her love again believing she had tacitly refused it and how could she tell him that she had trifled with the heart she wholly loved and longed to make her own  she could not confide in aunt pen for that worldly lady would have no sympathy to bestow she longed for her mother but there was no time to write for frank was going on the morrowmight even then be gone and as this fear came over her she covered up her face and wished that she were dead  poor debby her last mistake was sadder than her first and she was reaping a bitter harvest from her summers sowing  she sat and thought till her cheeks burned and her temples throbbed but she dared not ease her pain with tears  the gong sounded like a judgmentday trump of doom and she trembled at the idea of confronting many eyes with such a telltale face but she could not stay behind for aunt pen must know the cause she tried to play her hard part well but wherever she looked some fresh anxiety appeared as if every fault and folly of those months had blossomed suddenly within the hour she saw frank evan more sombre and more solitary than when she met him first and cried regretfully within herself how could i so forget the truth i owed himshe saw clara west watching with eager eyes for the coming of young leavenworth and sighedthis is the fruit of my wicked vanity she saw aunt pen regarded her with an anxious face and longed to say forgive me for i have not been sincere at last as her trouble grew she resolved to go away and have a quiet thinka remedy which had served her in many a lesser perplexity so stealing out she went to a grove of cedars usually deserted at that hour  but in ten minutes joe leavenworth appeared at the door of the summer house and looking in said with a wellacted start of pleasure and surprise  beg pardon i thought there was no one here my dear miss wilder you look contemplative but i fancy it wouldnt do to ask the subject of your meditations would it  he paused with such an evident intention of remaining that debby resolved to make use of the moment and ease her conscience of one care that burdened it therefore she answered his question with her usual directness  my meditations were partly about you  mr joe was guilty of the weakness of blushing violently and looking immensely gratified but his rapture was of short duration for debby went on very earnestly  i believe i am going to do what you may consider a very impertinent thing but i would rather be unmannerly than unjust to others or untrue to my own sense of right  mr leavenworth if you were an older man i should not dare to say this to you but i have brothers of my own and remembering how many unkind things they do for want of thought i venture to remind you that a womans heart is a perilous plaything and too tender to be used for a selfish purpose or an hours pleasure  i know this kind of amusement is not considered wrong but it is wrong and i cannot shut my eyes to the fact or sit silent while another woman is allowed to deceive herself and wound the heart that trusts her oh if you love your own sisters be generous be just and do not destroy that poor girls happiness but go away before your sport becomes a bitter pain to her  joe leavenworth had stood staring at debby with a troubled countenance feeling as if all the misdemeanors of his life were about to be paraded before him but as he listened to her plea the womanly spirit that prompted it appealed more loudly than her words and in his really generous heart he felt regret for what had never seemed a fault before shallow as he was nature was stronger than education and he admired and accepted what many a wiser worldlier man would have resented with anger or contempt  he loved debby with all his little might he meant to tell her so and graciously present his fortune and himself for her acceptance but now when the moment came the wellturned speech he had prepared vanished from his memory and with the better eloquence of feeling he blundered out his passion like a very boy  miss dora i never meant to make trouble between clara and her lover upon my soul i didnt and wish seguin had not put the notion into my head since it has given you pain  i only tried to pique you into showing some regret when i neglected you but you didnt and then i got desperate and didnt care what became of any one oh dora if you knew how much i loved you i am sure youd forgive it and let me prove my repentance by giving up everything that you dislike i mean what i say upon my life i do and ill keep my word if you will only let me hope  if debby had wanted a proof of her love for frank evan she might have found it in the fact that she had words enough at her command now and no difficulty in being sisterly pitiful toward her second suitor  please get up she said for mr joe feeling very humble and very earnest had gone down upon his knees and sat there entirely regardless of his personal appearance  he obeyed and debby stood looking up at him with her kindest aspect as she said more tenderly than she had ever spoken to him before  thank you for the affection you offer me but i cannot accept it for i have nothing to give you in return but the friendliest regard the most sincere goodwill  i know you will forgive me and do for your own sake the good things you would have done for mine that i may add to my esteem a real respect for one who has been very kind to me  ill tryindeed i will miss dora though it will be powerful hard without yourself for a help and a reward  poor joe choked a little but called up an unexpected manliness and added stoutly  dont think i shall be offended at your speaking so or saying no to menot a bit its all right and im much obliged to you  i might have known you couldnt care for such a fellow as i am and dont blame you for nobody in the world is good enough for you  ill go away at once ill try to keep my promise and i hope youll be very happy all your life  he shook debbys bands heartily and hurried down the steps but at the bottom paused and looked back debby stood upon the threshold with sunshine dancing on her winsome face and kind words trembling on her lips for the moment it seemed impossible to part and with an impetuous gesture he cried to her  oh dora let me stay and try to win you for everything is possible to love and i never knew how dear you were to me till now  there were sudden tears in the young mans eyes the flush of a genuine emotion on his cheek the tremor of an ardent longing in his voice and for the first time a very true affection strengthened his whole countenance  debbys heart was full of penitence she had given so much pain to more than one that she longed to atone for itlonged to do some very friendly thing and soothe some trouble such as she herself had known  she looked into the eager face uplifted to her own and thought of will then stooped and touched her lovers forehead with the lips that softly whispered no  if she had cared for him she never would have done it poor joe knew that and murmuring an incoherent thank you he rushed away feeling very much as he remembered to have felt when his baby sister died and he wept his grief away upon his mothers neck  he began his preparations for departure at once in a burst of virtuous energy quite refreshing to behold thinking within himself as he flung his cigarcase into the grate kicked a billiardball into a corner and suppressed his favorite allusion to the devil  this is a new sort of thing to me but i can bear it and upon my life i think i feel the better for it already  and so he did for though he was no augustine to turn in an hour from worldly hopes and climb to sainthood through long years of inward strife yet in aftertimes no one knew how many false steps had been saved how many small sins repented of through the power of the memory that far away a generous woman waited to respect him and in his secret soul he owned that one of the best moments of his life was that in which little debby wilder whispered no and kissed him  as he passed from sight the girl leaned her head upon her hand thinking sorrowfully to herself  what right had i to censure him when my own actions are so far from true  i have done a wicked thing and as an honest girl i should undo it if i can  i have broken through the rules of a false propriety for claras sake can i not do as much for franks  i will ill find him if i search the houseand tell him all though i never dare to look him in the face again and aunt pen sends me home tomorrow  full of zeal and courage debby caught up her hat and ran down the steps but as she saw frank evan coming up the path a sudden panic fell upon her and she could only stand mutely waiting his approach  it is asserted that love is blind and on the strength of that popular delusion novel heroes and heroines go blundering through three volumes of despair with the plain truth directly under their absurd noses but in real life this theory is not supported for to a living man the countenance of a loving woman is more eloquent than any language more trustworthy than a world of proverbs more beautiful than the sweetest lovelay ever sung  frank looked at debby and all her heart stood up in her eyes as she stretched her hands to him though her lips only whispered very low  forgive me and let me say the yes i should have said so long ago  had she required any assurance of her lovers truth or any reward for her own she would have found it in the change that dawned so swiftly in his face smoothing the lines upon his forehead lighting the gloom of his eye stirring his firm lips with a sudden tremor and making his touch as soft as it was strong  for a moment both stood very still while debbys tears streamed down like summer rain then frank drew her into the green shadow of the grove and its peace soothed her like a mothers voice till she looked up smiling with a shy delight her glance had never known before  the slant sunbeams dropped a benediction on their heads the robins peeped and the cedars whispered but no rumor of what further passed ever went beyond the precincts of the wood for such hours are sacred and nature guards the first blossoms of a human love as tenderly as she nurses mayflowers underneath the leaves    mrs carroll had retired to her bed with a nervous headache leaving debby to the watch and ward of friendly mrs earle who performed her office finely by letting her charge entirely alone in her dreams aunt pen was just imbibing a copious draught of champagne at the weddingbreakfast of her niece mrs joseph leavenworth when she was roused by the bride elect who passed through the room with a lamp and a shawl in her hand  what time is it and where are you going dear she asked dozily wondering if the carriage for the weddingtour was at the door so soon  its only nine and i am going for a sail aunt pen  as debby spoke the light flashed full into her face and a sudden thought into mrs carrolls mind  she rose up from her pillow looking as stately in her nightcap as maria theresa is said to have done in like unassuming headgear  something has happened dora  what have you done  what have you said  i insist upon knowing immediately she demanded with somewhat startling brevity  i have said no to mr leavenworth and yes to mr evan and i should like to go home tomorrow if you please was the equally concise reply  mrs carroll fell flat in her bed and lay there stiff and rigid as morlena kenwigs  debby gently drew the curtains and stole away leaving aunt pens wrath to effervesce before morning  the moon was hanging luminous and large on the horizons edge sending shafts of light before her till the melancholy ocean seemed to smile and along that shining pathway happy debby and her lover floated into that new world where all things seem divine    the brothers  doctor franck came in as i sat sewing up the rents in an old shirt that tom might go tidily to his grave  new shirts were needed for the living and there was no wife or mother to dress him handsome when he went to meet the lord as one woman said describing the fine funeral she had pinched herself to give her son  miss dane im in a quandary began the doctor with that expression of countenance which says as plainly as words i want to ask a favor but i wish youd save me the trouble  can i help you out of it  faith  i dont like to propose it but you certainly can if you please  then give it a name i beg  you see a reb has just been brought in crazy with typhoid a bad case every way a drunken rascally little captain somebody took the trouble to capture but whom nobody wants to take the trouble to cure  the wards are full the ladies worked to death and willing to be for our own boys but rather slow to risk their lives for a reb now youve had the fever you like queer patients your mate will see to your ward for a while and i will find you a good attendant  the fellow wont last long i fancy but he cant die without some sort of care you know ive put him in the fourth story of the west wing away from the rest it is airy quiet and comfortable there im on that ward and will do my best for you in every way now then will you go  of course i will out of perversity if not common charity for some of these people think that because im an abolitionist i am also a heathen and i should rather like to show them that though i cannot quite love my enemies i am willing to take care of them  very good i thought youd go and speaking of abolition reminds me that you can have a contraband for servant if you like it is that fine mulatto fellow who was found burying his rebel master after the fight and being badly cut over the head our boys brought him along will you have him  by all meansfor ill stand to my guns on that point as on the other these black boys are far more faithful and handy than some of the white scamps given me to serve instead of being served by but is this man well enough  yes for that sort of work and i think youll like him  he must have been a handsome fellow before he got his face slashed not much darker than myself his masters son i dare say and the white blood makes him rather high and haughty about some things  he was in a bad way when he came in but vowed hed die in the street rather than turn in with the black fellows below so i put him up in the west wing to be out of the way and hes seen to the captain all the morning when can you go up  as soon as tom is laid out skinner moved haywood washed marble dressed charley rubbed downs taken up upham laid down and the whole forty fed  we both laughed though the doctor was on his way to the deadhouse and i held a shroud on my lap  but in a hospital one learns that cheerfulness is ones salvation for in an atmosphere of suffering and death heaviness of heart would soon paralyze usefulness of hand if the blessed gift of smiles had been denied us  in an hour i took possession of my new charge finding a dissipatedlooking boy of nineteen or twenty raving in the solitary little room with no one near him but the contraband in the room adjoining feeling decidedly more interest in the black man than in the white yet remembering the doctors hint of his being high and haughty i glanced furtively at him as i scattered chloride of lime about the room to purify the air and settled matters to suit myself i had seen many contrabands but never one so attractive as this  all colored men are called boys even if their heads are white this boy was fiveandtwenty at least stronglimbed and manly and had the look of one who never had been cowed by abuse or worn with oppressive labor he sat on his bed doing nothing no book no pipe no pen or paper anywhere appeared yet anything less indolent or listless than his attitude and expression i never saw  erect he sat with a hand on either knee and eyes fixed on the bare wall opposite so rapt in some absorbing thought as to be unconscious of my presence though the door stood wide open and my movements were by no means noiseless  his face was half averted but i instantly approved the doctors taste for the profile which i saw possessed all the attributes of comeliness belonging to his mixed race he was more quadroon than mulatto with saxon features spanish complexion darkened by exposure color in lips and cheek waving hair and an eye full of the passionate melancholy which in such men always seems to utter a mute protest against the broken law that doomed them at their birth  what could he be thinking of the sick boy cursed and raved i rustled to and fro steps passed the door bells rang and the steady rumble of armywagons came up from the street still he never stirred  i had seen colored people in what they call the black sulks when for days they neither smiled nor spoke and scarcely ate  but this was something more than that for the man was not dully brooding over some small grievancehe seemed to see an allabsorbing fact or fancy recorded on the wall which was a blank to me i wondered if it were some deep wrong or sorrow kept alive by memory and impotent regret if he mourned for the dead master to whom he had been faithful to the end or if the liberty now his were robbed of half its sweetness by the knowledge that some one near and dear to him still languished in the hell from which he had escaped  my heart quite warmed to him at that idea i wanted to know and comfort him and following the impulse of the moment i went in and touched him on the shoulder  in an instant the man vanished and the slave appeared  freedom was too new a boon to have wrought its blessed changes yet and as he started up with his hand at his temple and an obsequious yes maam any romance that had gathered round him fled away leaving the saddest of all sad facts in living guise before me  not only did the manhood seem to die out of him but the comeliness that first attracted me for as he turned i saw the ghastly wound that had laid open cheek and forehead being partly healed it was no longer bandaged but held together with strips of that transparent plaster which i never see without a shiver and swift recollections of scenes with which it is associated in my mind part of his black hair had been shorn away and one eye was nearly closed pain so distorted and the cruel sabrecut so marred that portion of his face that when i saw it i felt as if a fine medal had been suddenly reversed showing me a far more striking type of human suffering and wrong than michel angelos bronze prisoner by one of those inexplicable processes that often teach us how little we understand ourselves my purpose was suddenly changed and though i went in to offer comfort as a friend i merely gave an order as a mistress  will you open these windows this man needs more air  he obeyed at once and as he slowly urged up the unruly sash the handsome profile was again turned toward me and again i was possessed by my first impression so strongly that i involuntarily said  thank you sir  perhaps it was fancy but i thought that in the look of mingled surprise and something like reproach which he gave me there was also a trace of grateful pleasure but he said in that tone of spiritless humility these poor souls learn so soon  i aint a white man maam im a contraband  yes i know it but a contraband is a free man and i heartily congratulate you  he liked that his face shone he squared his shoulders lifted his head and looked me full in the eye with a brisk  thank ye maam anything more to do fer yer  doctor franck thought you would help me with this man as there are many patients and few nurses or attendants  have you had the fever  no maam  they should have thought of that when they put him here wounds and fevers should not be together ill try to get you moved  he laughed a sudden laughif he had been a white man i should have called it scornful as he was a few shades darker than myself i suppose it must be considered an insolent or at least an unmannerly one  it dont matter maam id rather be up here with the fever than down with those niggers and there aint no other place fer me  poor fellow that was true  no ward in all the hospital would take him in to lie side by side with the most miserable white wreck there  like the bat in aesops fable he belonged to neither race and the pride of one the helplessness of the other kept him hovering alone in the twilight a great sin has brought to overshadow the whole land  you shall stay then for i would far rather have you than any lazy jack  but are you well and strong enough  i guess ill do maam  he spoke with a passive sort of acquiescenceas if it did not much matter if he were not able and no one would particularly rejoice if he were  yes i think you will  by what name shall i call you  bob maam  every woman has her pet whim one of mine was to teach the men selfrespect by treating them respectfully  tom dick and harry would pass when lads rejoiced in those familiar abbreviations but to address men often old enough to be my father in that style did not suit my oldfashioned ideas of propriety  this bob would never do i should have found it as easy to call the chaplain gus as my tragicallooking contraband by a title so strongly associated with the tail of a kite  what is your other name i asked i like to call my attendants by their last names rather than by their first  ive got no other maam we have our masters names or do without mines dead and i wont have anything of his about me  well ill call you robert then and you may fill this pitcher for me if you will be so kind  he went but through all the tame obedience years of servitude had taught him i could see that the proud spirit his father gave him was not yet subdued for the look and gesture with which he repudiated his masters name were a more effective declaration of independence than any fourthofjuly orator could have prepared  we spent a curious week together  robert seldom left his room except upon my errands and i was a prisoner all day often all night by the bedside of the rebel  the fever burned itself rapidly away for there seemed little vitality to feed it in the feeble frame of this old young man whose life had been none of the most righteous judging from the revelations made by his unconscious lips since more than once robert authoritatively silenced him when my gentler bushings were of no avail and blasphemous wanderings or ribald campsongs made my cheeks burn and roberts face assume an aspect of disgust  the captain was a gentleman in the worlds eye but the contraband was the gentleman in minei was a fanatic and that accounts for such depravity of taste i hope i never asked robert of himself feeling that somewhere there was a spot still too sore to bear the lightest touch but from his language manner and intelligence i inferred that his color had procured for him the few advantages within the reach of a quickwitted kindly treated slave  silent grave and thoughtful but most serviceable was my contraband glad of the books i brought him faithful in the performance of the duties i assigned to him grateful for the friendliness i could not but feel and show toward him  often i longed to ask what purpose was so visibly altering his aspect with such daily deepening gloom  but i never dared and no one else had either time or desire to pry into the past of this specimen of one branch of the chivalrous ffvs  on the seventh night dr franck suggested that it would be well for some one besides the general watchman of the ward to be with the captain as it might be his last  although the greater part of the two preceding nights had been spent there of course i offered to remainfor there is a strange fascination in these scenes which renders one careless of fatigue and unconscious of fear until the crisis is passed  give him water as long as he can drink and if he drops into a natural sleep it may save him ill look in at midnight when some change will probably take place nothing but sleep or a miracle will keep him now good night  away went the doctor and devouring a whole mouthful of grapes i lowered the lamp wet the captains head and sat down on a hard stool to begin my watch  the captain lay with his hot haggard face turned toward me filling the air with his poisonous breath and feebly muttering with lips and tongue so parched that the sanest speech would have been difficult to understand robert was stretched on his bed in the inner room the door of which stood ajar that a fresh draught from his open window might carry the feverfumes away through mine  i could just see a long dark figure with the lighter outline of a face and having little else to do just then i fell to thinking of this curious contraband who evidently prized his freedom highly yet seemed in no haste to enjoy it doctor franck had offered to send him on to safer quarters but he had said no thank yer sir not yet and then had gone away to fall into one of those black moods of his which began to disturb me because i had no power to lighten them  as i sat listening to the clocks from the steeples all about us i amused myself with planning roberts future as i often did my own and had dealt out to him a generous hand of trumps wherewith to play this game of life which hitherto had gone so cruelly against him when a harsh choked voice called  lucy  it was the captain and some new terror seemed to have gifted him with momentary strength  yes heres lucy i answered hoping that by following the fancy i might quiet himfor his face was damp with the clammy moisture and his frame shaken with the nervous tremor that so often precedes death his dull eye fixed upon me dilating with a bewildered look of incredulity and wrath till he broke out fiercely  thats a lie shes deadand sos bob damn him  finding speech a failure i began to sing the quiet tune that had often soothed delirium like this but hardly had the line    see gentle patience smile on pain  passed my lips when he clutched me by the wrist whispering like one in mortal fear  hush she used to sing that way to bob but she never would to me i swore id whip the devil out of her and i did but you know before she cut her throat she said shed haunt me and there she is  he pointed behind me with an aspect of such pale dismay that i involuntarily glanced over my shoulder and started as if i had seen a veritable ghost for peering from the gloom of that inner room i saw a shadowy face with dark hair all about it and a glimpse of scarlet at the throat an instant showed me that it was only robert leaning from his bedsfoot wrapped in a gray armyblanket with his red shirt just visible above it and his long hair disordered by sleep  but what a strange expression was on his face  the unmarred side was toward me fixed and motionless as when i first observed itless absorbed now but more intent  his eye glittered his lips were apart like one who listened with every sense and his whole aspect reminded me of a hound to which some wind had brought the scent of unsuspected prey  do you know him robert  does he mean you  lord no maam they all own half a dozen bobs but hearin my name woke me thats all  he spoke quite naturally and lay down again while i returned to my charge thinking that this paroxysm was probably his last  but by another hour i perceived a hopeful change for the tremor had subsided the cold dew was gone his breathing was more regular and sleep the healer had descended to save or take him gently away doctor franck looked in at midnight bade me keep all cool and quiet and not fail to administer a certain draught as soon as the captain woke very much relieved i laid my head on my arms uncomfortably folded on the little table and fancied i was about to perform one of the feats which practice renders possiblesleeping with one eye open as we say a halfandhalf doze for all senses sleep but that of hearing the faintest murmur sigh or motion will break it and give one back ones wits much brightened by the permission to stand at ease on this night the experiment was a failure for previous vigils confinement and much care had rendered naps a dangerous indulgence having roused half a dozen times in an hour to find all quiet i dropped my heavy head on my arms and drowsily resolving to look up again in fifteen minutes fell fast asleep  the striking of a deepvoiced clock woke me with a start  that is one thought i but to my dismay two more strokes followed and in remorseful haste i sprang up to see what harm my long oblivion had done  a strong hand put me back into my seat and held me there  it was robert  the instant my eye met his my heart began to beat and all along my nerves tingled that electric flash which foretells a danger that we cannot see  he was very pale his mouth grim and both eyes full of sombre firefor even the wounded one was open now all the more sinister for the deep scar above and below  but his touch was steady his voice quiet as he said  sit still maam i wont hurt yer nor even scare yer if i can help it but yer waked too soon  let me go robertthe captain is stirringi must give him something  no maam yer cant stir an inch  look here  holding me with one hand with the other he took up the glass in which i had left the draught and showed me it was empty  has he taken it i asked more and more bewildered  i flung it out o winder maam hell have to do without  but why robert why did you do it  because i hate him  impossible to doubt the truth of that his whole face showed it as he spoke through his set teeth and launched a fiery glance at the unconscious captain  i could only hold my breath and stare blankly at him wondering what mad act was coming next  i suppose i shook and turned white as women have a foolish habit of doing when sudden danger daunts them for robert released my arm sat down upon the bedside just in front of me and said with the ominous quietude that made me cold to see and hear  dont yer be frightened maam dont try to run away fer the doors locked an the key in my pocket dont yer cry out fer yerd have to scream a long while with my hand on yer mouth before yer was heard be still an ill tell yer what im goin to do  lord help us he has taken the fever in some sudden violent way and is out of his head  i must humor him till some one comes in pursuance of which swift determination i tried to say quite composedly  i will be still and hear you but open the window  why did you shut it  im sorry i cant do it maam but yerd jump out or call if i did an im not ready yet i shut it to make yer sleep an heat would do it quickern anything else i could do  the captain moved and feebly muttered water instinctively i rose to give it to him but the heavy hand came down upon my shoulder and in the same decided tone robert said  the water went with the physic let him call  do let me go to him hell die without care  i mean he shalldont yer interfere if yer please maam  in spite of his quiet tone and respectful manner i saw murder in his eyes and turned faint with fear yet the fear excited me and hardly knowing what i did i seized the hands that had seized me crying  no no you shall not kill him it is base to hurt a helpless man why do you hate him he is not your master  hes my brother  i felt that answer from head to foot and seemed to fathom what was coming with a prescience vague but unmistakable  one appeal was left to me and i made it  robert tell me what it means do not commit a crime and make me accessory to itthere is a better way of righting wrong than by violencelet me help you find it  my voice trembled as i spoke and i heard the frightened flutter of my heart so did he and if any little act of mine had ever won affection or respect from him the memory of it served me then  he looked down and seemed to put some question to himself whatever it was the answer was in my favor for when his eyes rose again they were gloomy but not desperate  i will tell you maam but mind this makes no difference the boy is mine  ill give the lord a chance to take him fust if he dont i shall  oh no remember he is your brother  an unwise speech i felt it as it passed my lips for a black frown gathered on roberts face and his strong hands closed with an ugly sort of grip but he did not touch the poor soul gasping there before him and seemed content to let the slow suffocation of that stifling room end his frail life  im not like to forget that maam when ive been thinkin of it all this week  i knew him when they fetched him in an would a done it long fore this but i wanted to ask where lucy was he knowshe told tonightan now hes done for  who is lucy i asked hurriedly intent on keeping his mind busy with any thought but murder  with one of the swift transitions of a mixed temperament like this at my question roberts deep eyes filled the clenched hands were spread before his face and all i heard were the broken words  my wifehe took her  in that instant every thought of fear was swallowed up in burning indignation for the wrong and a perfect passion of pity for the desperate man so tempted to avenge an injury for which there seemed no redress but this he was no longer slave or contraband no drop of black blood marred him in my sight but an infinite compassion yearned to save to help to comfort him words seemed so powerless i offered none only put my hand on his poor head wounded homeless bowed down with grief for which i had no cure and softly smoothed the long neglected hair pitifully wondering the while where was the wife who must have loved this tenderhearted man so well  the captain moaned again and faintly whispered air but i never stirred  god forgive me just then i hated him as only a woman thinking of a sister womans wrong could hate  robert looked up his eyes were dry again his mouth grim  i saw that said tell me more and he didfor sympathy is a gift the poorest may give the proudest stoop to receive  yer see maam his fatheri might say ours if i warnt ashamed of both of emhis father died two years ago an left us all to marster nedthats him here eighteen then   he always hated me i looked so like old marster he dontonly the light skin an hair  old marster was kind to all of us me specially an bought lucy off the next plantation down there in south carlina when he found i liked her  i married her all i could maam it warnt much but we was true to one another till marster ned come home a year after an made hell fer both of us he sent my old mother to be used up in his rice swamp in georgy he found me with my pretty lucy an though young miss cried an i prayed to him on my knees an lucy run away he wouldnt have no mercy he brought her back antook her maam  oh what did you do i cried hot with helpless pain and passion  how the mans outraged heart sent the blood flaming up into his face and deepened the tones of his impetuous voice as he stretched his arm across the bed saying with a terribly expressive gesture  i half murdered him an tonight ill finish  yes yesbut go on now what came next  he gave me a look that showed no white man could have felt a deeper degradation in remembering and confessing these last acts of brotherly oppression  they whipped me till i couldnt stand an then they sold me further south yer thought i was a white man oncelook here  with a sudden wrench he tore the shirt from neck to waist and on his strong brown shoulders showed me furrows deeply ploughed wounds which though healed were ghastlier to me than any in that house  i could not speak to him and with the pathetic dignity a great grief lends the humblest sufferer he ended his brief tragedy by simply saying  thats all  maam  ive never seen her since an now i never shall in this worldmaybe not in t other  but robert why think her dead  the captain was wandering when he said those sad things perhaps he will retract them when he is sane dont despair dont give up yet  no maam i guess hes right she was too proud to bear that long its like her to kill herself  i told her to if there was no other way an she always minded me lucy did  my poor girl  oh it warnt right no by god it warnt  as the memory of this bitter wrong this double bereavement burned in his sore heart the devil that lurks in every strong mans blood leaped up he put his hand upon his brothers throat and watching the white face before him muttered low between his teeth  im lettin him go too easy theres no pain in this we ant even yet  i wish he knew me marster ned its bob wheres lucy  from the captains lips there came a long faint sigh and nothing but a flutter of the eyelids showed that he still lived  a strange stillness filled the room as the elder brother held the youngers life suspended in his hand while wavering between a dim hope and a deadly hate  in the whirl of thoughts that went on in my brain only one was clear enough to act upon  i must prevent murder if i couldbut how  what could i do up there alone locked in with a dying man and a lunaticfor any mind yielded utterly to any unrighteous impulse is mad while the impulse rules it strength i had not nor much courage neither time nor wit for stratagem and chance only could bring me help before it was too late  but one weapon i possesseda tongueoften a womans best defence and sympathy stronger than fear gave me power to use it  what i said heaven only knows but surely heaven helped me words burned on my lips tears streamed from my eyes and some good angel prompted me to use the one name that had power to arrest my hearers hand and touch his heart for at that moment i heartily believed that lucy lived and this earnest faith roused in him a like belief  he listened with the lowering look of one in whom brute instinct was sovereign for the timea look that makes the noblest countenance base he was but a mana poor untaught outcast outraged man  life had few joys for him the world offered him no honors no success no home no love  what future would this crime mar and why should he deny himself that sweet yet bitter morsel called revenge  how many white men with all new englands freedom culture christianity would not have felt as he felt then should i have reproached him for a human anguish a human longing for redress all now left him from the ruin of his few poor hopes  who had taught him that selfcontrol selfsacrifice are attributes that make men masters of the earth and lift them nearer heaven  should i have urged the beauty of forgiveness the duty of devout submission he had no religion for he was no saintly uncle tom and slaverys black shadow seemed to darken all the world to him and shut out god  should i have warned him of penalties of judgments and the potency of law  what did he know of justice or the mercy that should temper that stern virtue when every law human and divine had been broken on his hearthstone should i have tried to touch him by appeals to filial duty to brotherly love how had his appeals been answered what memories had father and brother stored up in his heart to plead for either now  noall these influences these associations would have proved worse than useless had i been calm enough to try them  i was not but instinct subtler than reason showed me the one safe clue by which to lead this troubled soul from the labyrinth in which it groped and nearly fell when i paused breathless robert turned to me asking as if human assurances could strengthen his faith in divine omnipotence  do you believe if i let marster ned live the lord will give me back my lucy  as surely as there is a lord you will find her here or in the beautiful hereafter where there is no black or white no master and no slave  he took his hand from his brothers throat lifted his eyes from my face to the wintry sky beyond as if searching for that blessed country happier even than the happy north  alas it was the darkest hour before the dawnthere was no star above no light below but the pale glimmer of the lamp that showed the brother who had made him desolate  like a blind man who believes there is a sun yet cannot see it he shook his head let his arms drop nervously upon his knees and sat there dumbly asking that question which many a soul whose faith is firmer fixed than his has asked in hours less dark than this  where is god i saw the tide had turned and strenuously tried to keep this rudderless lifeboat from slipping back into the whirlpool wherein it had been so nearly lost  i have listened to you robert now hear me and heed what i say because my heart is full of pity for you full of hope for your future and a desire to help you now  i want you to go away from here from the temptation of this place and the sad thoughts that haunt it  you have conquered yourself once and i honor you for it because the harder the battle the more glorious the victory but it is safer to put a greater distance between you and this man  i will write you letters give you money and send you to good old massachusetts to begin your new life a freemanyes and a happy man for when the captain is himself again i will learn where lucy is and move heaven and earth to find and give her back to you  will you do this robert  slowly very slowly the answer came for the purpose of a week perhaps a year was hard to relinquish in an hour  yes maam i will  good now you are the man i thought you and ill work for you with all my heart  you need sleep my poor fellow go and try to forget the captain is still alive and as yet you are spared the sin  no dont look there ill care for him come robert for lucys sake  thank heaven for the immortality of love for when all other means of salvation failed a spark of this vital fire softened the mans iron will until a womans hand could bend it  he let me take from him the key let me draw him gently away and lead him to the solitude which now was the most healing balm i could bestow  once in his little room he fell down on his bed and lay there as if spent with the sharpest conflict of his life i slipped the bolt across his door and unlocked my own flung up the window steadied myself with a breath of air then rushed to doctor franck he came and till dawn we worked together saving one brothers life and taking earnest thought how best to secure the others liberty  when the sun came up as blithely as if it shone only upon happy homes the doctor went to robert  for an hour i heard the murmur of their voices once i caught the sound of heavy sobs and for a time a reverent hush as if in the silence that good man were ministering to soul as well as sense  when he departed he took robert with him pausing to tell me he should get him off as soon as possible but not before we met again  nothing more was seen of them all day another surgeon came to see the captain and another attendant came to fill the empty place  i tried to rest but could not with the thought of poor lucy tugging at my heart and was soon back at my post again anxiously hoping that my contraband had not been too hastily spirited away just as night fell there came a tap and opening i saw robert literally clothed and in his right mind the doctor had replaced the ragged suit with tidy garments and no trace of that tempestuous night remained but deeper lines upon the forehead and the docile look of a repentant child  he did not cross the threshold did not offer me his handonly took off his cap saying with a traitorous falter in his voice  god bless you maam  im goin  i put out both my hands and held his fast  goodbye robert keep up good heart and when i come home to massachusetts well meet in a happier place than this  are you quite ready quite comfortable for your journey  yes maam yes the doctors fixed everything im goin with a friend of his my papers are all right an im as happy as i can be till i find  he stopped there then went on with a glance into the room  im glad i didnt do it an i thank yer maam fer hinderin methank yer hearty but im afraid i hate him jest the same  of course he did and so did i for these faulty hearts of ours cannot turn perfect in a night but need frost and fire wind and rain to ripen and make them ready for the great harvesthome wishing to divert his mind i put my poor mite into his hand and remembering the magic of a certain little book i gave him mine on whose dark cover whitely shone the virgin mother and the child the grand history of whose life the book contained  the money went into roberts pocket with a grateful murmur the book into his bosom with a long took and a tremulous  i never saw my baby maam  i broke down then and though my eyes were too dim to see i felt the touch of lips upon my hands heard the sound of departing feet and knew my contraband was gone  when one feels an intense dislike the less one says about the subject of it the better therefore i shall merely record that the captain livedin time was exchanged and that whoever the other party was i am convinced the government got the best of the bargain  but long before this occurred i had fulfilled my promise to robert for as soon as my patient recovered strength of memory enough to make his answer trustworthy i asked without any circumlocution  captain fairfax where is lucy  and too feeble to be angry surprised or insincere he straightway answered  dead miss dane  and she killed herself when you sold bob  how the devil did you know that he muttered with an expression halfremorseful halfamazed but i was satisfied and said no more  of course this went to robert waiting far away there in a lonely homewaiting working hoping for his lucy  it almost broke my heart to do it but delay was weak deceit was wicked so i sent the heavy tidings and very soon the answer cameonly three lines but i felt that the sustaining power of the mans life was gone  i thought id never see her any more im glad to know shes out of trouble  i thank yer maam an if they let us ill fight fer yer till im killed which i hope will be fore long  six months later he had his wish and kept his word  every one knows the story of the attack on fort wagner but we should not tire yet of recalling how our fiftyfourth spent with three sleepless nights a days fast and a march under the july sun stormed the fort as night fell facing death in many shapes following their brave leaders through a fiery rain of shot and shell fighting valiantly for god and governor andrewhow the regiment that went into action seven hundred strong came out having had nearly half its number captured killed or wounded leaving their young commander to be buried like a chief of earlier times with his bodyguard around him faithful to the death surely the insult turns to honor and the wide grave needs no monument but the heroism that consecrates it in our sight surely the hearts that held him nearest see through their tears a noble victory in the seeming sad defeat and surely gods benediction was bestowed when this loyal soul answered as death called the roll lord here i am with the brothers thou hast given me  the future must show how well that fight was fought for though fort wagner still defies us public prejudice is down and through the cannon smoke of that black night the manhood of the colored race shines before many eyes that would not see rings in many ears that would not hear wins many hearts that would not hitherto believe  when the news came that we were needed there was none so glad as i to leave teaching contrabands the new work i had taken up and go to nurse our boys as my dusky flock so proudly called the wounded of the fiftyfourth feeling more satisfaction as i assumed my big apron and turned up my cuffs than if dressing for the presidents levee i fell to work on board the hospitalship in hiltonhead harbor  the scene was most familiar and yet strange for only dark faces looked up at me from the pallets so thickly laid along the floor and i missed the sharp accent of my yankee boys in the slower softer voices calling cheerily to one another or answering my questions with a stout well never give it up maam till the last rebs dead or if our peoples free we can afford to die  passing from bed to bed intent on making one pair of hands do the work of three at least i gradually washed fed and bandaged my way down the long line of sable heroes and coming to the very last found that he was my contraband so old so worn so deathly weak and wan i never should have known him but for the deep scar on his cheek  that side lay uppermost and caught my eye at once but even then i doubted such an awful change had come upon him when turning to the ticket just above his head i saw the name robert dane that both assured and touched me for remembering that he had no name i knew that he had taken mine  i longed for him to speak to me to tell how he had fared since i lost sight of him and let me perform some little service for him in return for many he had done for me but he seemed asleep and as i stood reliving that strange night again a bright lad who lay next him softly waving an old fan across both beds looked up and said  i guess you know him maam  you are right  do you  as much as any one was able to maam  why do you say was as if the man were dead and gone  i spose because i know hell have to go hes got a bad jab in the breast an is bleedin inside the doctor says he dont suffer any only gets weaker n weaker every minute  ive been fannin him this long while an hes talked a little but he dont know me now so hes most gone i guess  there was so much sorrow and affection in the boys face that i remembered something and asked with redoubled interest  are you the one that brought him off  i was told about a boy who nearly lost his life in saving that of his mate  i dare say the young fellow blushed as any modest lad might have done i could not see it but i heard the chuckle of satisfaction that escaped him as he glanced from his shattered arm and bandaged side to the pale figure opposite  lord maam thats nothin we boys always stan by one another an i warnt goin to leave him to be tormented any more by them cussed rebs  hes been a slave once though he dont look half so much like it as me an was born in boston  he did not for the speaker was as black as the ace of spadesbeing a sturdy specimen the knave of clubs would perhaps be a fitter representativebut the dark freeman looked at the white slave with the pitiful yet puzzled expression i have so often seen on the faces of our wisest men when this tangled question of slavery presents itself asking to be cut or patiently undone  tell me what you know of this man for even if he were awake he is too weak to talk  i never saw him till i joined the regiment an no one peared to have got much out of him  he was a shutup sort of feller an didnt seem to care for anything but gettin at the rebs  some say he was the fust man of us that enlisted i know he fretted till we were off an when we pitched into old wagner he fought like the devil  were you with him when he was wounded how was it  yes maam  there was somethin queer about it for he peared to know the chap that killed him an the chap knew him  i dont dare to ask but i rather guess one owned the other some timefor when they clinched the chap sung out bob an dane marster ned then they went at it  i sat down suddenly for the old anger and compassion struggled in my heart and i both longed and feared to hear what was to follow  you see when the colonellord keep an send him back to usit ant certain yet  you know maam though its two days ago we lost himwell when the colonel shouted rush on boys rush on dane tore away as if he was goin to take the fort alone i was next him an kept close as we went through the ditch an up the wall hi warnt that a rusher and the boy flung up his well arm with a whoop as if the mere memory of that stirring moment came over him in a gust of irrepressible excitement  were you afraid i saidasking the question women often put and receiving the answer they seldom fail to get  no maamemphasis on the maami never thought of anything but the damn rebs that scalp slash an cut our ears off when they git us  i was bound to let daylight into one of em at least an i did  hope he liked it  it is evident that you did and i dont blame you in the least  now go on about robert for i should be at work  he was one of the fust up i was just behind an though the whole thing happened in a minute i remember how it was for all i was yellin an knockin round like mad  just where we were some sort of an officer was wavin his sword an cheerin on his men dane saw him by a big flash that come by he flung away his gun give a leap an went at that feller as if he was jeff beauregard an lee all in one i scrabbled after as quick as i could but was only up in time to see him git the sword straight through him an drop into the ditch  you neednt ask what i did next maam for i dont quite know myself all i m clear about is that i managed somehow to pitch that reb into the fort as dead as moses git hold of dane an bring him off  poor old feller we said we went in to live or die he said he went in to die an he s done it  i had been intently watching the excited speaker but as he regretfully added those last words i turned again and roberts eyes met minethose melancholy eyes so full of an intelligence that proved he had heard remembered and reflected with that preternatural power which often outlives all other faculties he knew me yet gave no greeting was glad to see a womans face yet had no smile wherewith to welcome it felt that he was dying yet uttered no farewell  he was too far across the river to return or linger now departing thought strength breath were spent in one grateful look one murmur of submission to the last pang he could ever feel  his lips moved and bending to them a whisper chilled my cheek as it shaped the broken words  i would have done itbut it s better soim satisfied  ah well he might befor as he turned his face from the shadow of the life that was the sunshine of the life to be touched it with a beautiful content and in the drawing of a breath my contraband found wife and home eternal liberty and god    nellys hospital  nelly sat beside her mother picking lint but while her fingers flew her eyes often looked wistfully out into the meadow golden with buttercups and bright with sunshine  presently she said rather bashfully but very earnestly mamma i want to tell you a little plan ive made if youll please not laugh  i think i can safely promise that my dear said her mother putting down her work that she might listen quite respectfully  nelly looked pleased and went on confidingly  since brother will came home with his lame foot and ive helped you tend him ive heard a great deal about hospitals and liked it very much today i said i wanted to go and be a nurse like aunt mercy but will laughed and told me id better begin by nursing sick birds and butterflies and pussies before i tried to take care of men  i did not like to be made fun of but ive been thinking that it would be very pleasant to have a little hospital all my own and be a nurse in it because if i took pains so many pretty creatures might be made well perhaps  could i mamma  her mother wanted to smile at the idea but did not for nelly looked up with her heart and eyes so full of tender compassion both for the unknown men for whom her little hands had done their best and for the smaller sufferers nearer home that she stroked the shining head and answered readily yes nelly it will be a proper charity for such a young samaritan and you may learn much if you are in earnest  you must study how to feed and nurse your little patients else your pity will do no good and your hospital become a prison  i will help you and tony shall be your surgeon  o mamma how good you always are to me indeed i am in truly earnest i will learn i will be kind and may i go now and begin  you may but tell me first where will you have your hospital  in my room mamma it is so snug and sunny and i never should forget it there said nelly  you must not forget it anywhere  i think that plan will not do  how would you like to find caterpillars walking in your bed to hear sick pussies mewing in the night to have beetles clinging to your clothes or see mice bugs and birds tumbling downstairs whenever the door was open said her mother  nelly laughed at that thought a minute then clapped her hands and cried let us have the old summerhouse  my doves only use the upper part and it would be so like frank in the storybook please say yes again mamma  her mother did say yes and snatching up her hat nelly ran to find tony the gardeners son a pleasant lad of twelve who was nellys favorite playmate tony pronounced the plan a jolly one and leaving his work followed his young mistress to the summerhouse for she could not wait one minute  what must we do first she asked as they stood looking in at the dusty room full of garden tools bags of seeds old flowerpots and wateringcans  clear out the rubbish miss answered tony  here it goes then and nelly began bundling everything out in such haste that she broke two flowerpots scattered all the squashseeds and brought a pile of rakes and hoes clattering down about her ears  just wait a bit and let me take the lead miss  you hand me things ill pile em in the barrow and wheel em off to the barn then it will save time and be finished up tidy  nelly did as he advised and very soon nothing but dust remained  what next she asked not knowing in the least  ill sweep up while you see if polly can come and scrub the room out it ought to be done before you stay here let alone the patients  so it had said nelly looking very wise all of a sudden will says the wardsthat means the rooms tonyare scrubbed every day or two and kept very clean and well ventisomethingi cant say it but it means having a plenty of air come in  i can clean windows while polly mops and then we shall soon be done away she ran feeling very busy and important polly came and very soon the room looked like another place the four latticed windows were set wide open so the sunshine came dancing through the vines that grew outside and curious roses peeped in to see what frolic was afoot  the walls shone white again for not a spider dared to stay the wide seat which encircled the room was dustless nowthe floor as nice as willing hands could make it and the south wind blew away all musty odors with its fragrant breath  how fine it looks cried nelly dancing on the doorstep lest a footprint should mar the still damp floor  id almost like to fall sick for the sake of staying here said tony admiringly  now what sort of beds are you going to have miss  i suppose it wont do to put butterflies and toads and worms into beds like the real soldiers where will was answered nelly looking anxious  tony could hardly help shouting at the idea but rather than trouble his little mistress he said very soberly im afraid they wouldnt lay easy not being used to it  tucking up a butterfly would about kill him the worms would be apt to get lost among the bedclothes and the toads would tumble out the first thing  i shall have to ask mamma about it  what will you do while im gone said nelly unwilling that a moment should be lost  ill make frames for nettings to the windows else the doves will come in and eat up the sick people  i think they will know that it is a hospital and be too kind to hurt or frighten their neighbors began nelly but as she spoke a plump white dove walked in looked about with its redringed eyes and quietly pecked up a tiny bug that had just ventured out from the crack where it had taken refuge when the deluge came  yes we must have the nettings  ill ask mamma for some lace said nelly when she saw that and taking her pet dove on her shoulder told it about her hospital as she went toward the house for loving all little creatures as she did it grieved her to have any harm befall even the least or plainest of them she had a sweet childfancy that her playmates understood her language as she did theirs and that birds flowers animals and insects felt for her the same affection which she felt for them love always makes friends and nothing seemed to fear the gentle child but welcomed her like a little sun who shone alike on all and never suffered an eclipse  she was gone some time and when she came back her mind was full of new plans one hand full of rushes the other of books while over her head floated the lace and a bright green ribbon hung across her arm  mamma says that the best beds will be little baskets boxes cages and any sort of thing that suits the patients for each will need different care and food and medicine i have not baskets enough so as i cannot have pretty white beds i am going to braid pretty green nests for my patients and while i do it mamma thought youd read to me the pages she has marked so that we may begin right  yes miss i like that  but what is the ribbon for asked tony  o thats for you  will says that if you are to be an army surgeon you must have a green band on your arm so i got this to tie on when we play hospital  tony let her decorate the sleeve of his gray jacket and when the nettings were done the welcome books were opened and enjoyed it was a happy time sitting in the sunshine with leaves pleasantly astir all about them doves cooing overhead and flowers sweetly gossiping together through the summer afternoon  nelly wove her smooth green rushes  tony pored over his pages and both found something better than fairy legends in the family histories of insects birds and beasts all manner of wonders appeared and were explained to them till nelly felt as if a new world had been given her so full of beauty interest and pleasure that she never could be tired of studying it many of these things were not strange to tony because born among plants he had grown up with them as if they were brothers and sisters and the sturdy brownfaced boy had learned many lessons which no poet or philosopher could have taught him unless he had become as childlike a s himself and studied from the same great book  when the baskets were done the marked pages all read and the sun began to draw his rosy curtains round him before smiling good night nelly ranged the green beds round the room tony put in the screens and the hospital was ready the little nurse was so excited that she could hardly eat her supper and directly afterwards ran up to tell will how well she had succeeded with the first part of her enterprise now brother will was a brave young officer who had fought stoutly and done his duty like a man  but when lying weak and wounded at home the cheerful courage which had led him safely through many dangers seemed to have deserted him and he was often gloomy sad or fretful because he longed to be at his post again and time passed very slowly this troubled his mother and made nelly wonder why he found lying in a pleasant room so much harder than fighting battles or making weary marches anything that interested and amused him was very welcome and when nelly climbing on the arm of his sofa told her plans mishaps and successes he laughed out more heartily than he had done for many a day and his thin face began to twinkle with fun as it used to do so long ago  that pleased nelly and she chatted like any affectionate little magpie till will was really interested for when one is ill small things amuse  do you expect your patients to come to you nelly he asked  no i shall go and look for them i often see poor things suffering in the garden and the wood and always feel as if they ought to be taken care of as people are  you wont like to carry insane bugs lame toads and convulsive kittens in your hands and they would not stay on a stretcher if you had one you should have an ambulance and be a branch of the sanitary commission said will  nelly had often heard the words but did not quite understand what they meant  so will told her of that great neverfailing charity to which thousands owe their lives and the child listened with lips apart eyes often full and so much love and admiration in her heart that she could find no words in which to tell it  when her brother paused she said earnestly yes i will be a sanitary this little cart of mine shall be my amblance and ill never let my waterbarrels go empty never drive too fast or be rough with my poor passengers like some of the men you tell about  does this look like an ambulance will  not a bit but it shall if you and mamma like to help me  i want four long bits of cane a square of white cloth some pieces of thin wood and the gumpot said will sitting up to examine the little cart feeling like a boy again as he took out his knife and began to whittle upstairs and downstairs ran nelly till all necessary materials were collected and almost breathlessly she watched her brother arch the canes over the cart cover them with the cloth and fit an upper shelf of small compartments each lined with cottonwool to serve as beds for wounded insects lest they should hurt one another or jostle out  the lower part was left free for any larger creatures which nelly might find  among her toys she had a tiny cask which only needed a peg to be watertight this was filled and fitted in before because as the small sufferers needed no seats there was no place for it behind and as nelly was both horse and driver it was more convenient in front  on each side of it stood a box of stores in one were minute rollers as bandages are called a few bottles not yet filled and a wee dolls jar of coldcream because nelly could not feel that her outfit was complete without a medicinechest the other box was full of crumbs bits of sugar birdseed and grains of wheat and corn lest any famished stranger should die for want of food before she got it home  then mamma painted us san com in bright letters on the cover and nelly received her charitable plaything with a long sigh of satisfaction  nine oclock already  bless me what a short evening this has been exclaimed will as nelly came to give him her goodnight kiss  and such a happy one she answered  thank you very very much dear will  i only wish my little amblance was big enough for you to go inid so like to give you the first ride  nothing i should like better if it were possible though ive a prejudice against ambulances in general  but as i cannot ride ill try and hop out to your hospital tomorrow and see how you get onwhich was a great deal for captain will to say because he had been too listless to leave his sofa for several days  that promise sent nelly happily away to bed only stopping to pop her head out of the window to see if it was likely to be a fair day tomorrow and to tell tony about the new plan as he passed below  where shall you go to look for your first load of sick folks miss he asked  all round the garden first then through the grove and home across the brook  do you think i can find any patients so said nelly  i know you will  good night miss and tony walked away with a merry look on his face that nelly would not have understood if she had seen it  up rose the sun bright and early and up rose nurse nelly almost as early and as bright  breakfast was taken in a great hurry and before the dew was off the grass this branch of the s c was all astir papa mamma big brother and baby sister men and maids all looked out to see the funny little ambulance depart and nowhere in all the summer fields was there a happier child than nelly as she went smiling down the garden path where tall flowers kissed her as she passed and every blithe bird seemed singing a good speed  how i wonder what i shall find first she thought looking sharply on all sides as she went crickets chirped grasshoppers leaped ants worked busily at their subterranean houses spiders spun shining webs from twig to twig bees were coming for their bags of gold and butterflies had just begun their holiday  a large white one alighted on the top of the ambulance walked over the inscription as if spelling it letter by letter then floated away from flower to flower like one carrying the good news far and wide  now every one will know about the hospital and be glad to see me coming thought nelly and indeed it seemed so for just then a blackbird sitting on a garden wall burst out with a song full of musical joy nellys kitten came running after to stare at the wagon and rub her soft side against it a brighteyed toad looked out from his cool bower among the lilyleaves and at that minute nelly found her first patient  in one of the dewy cobwebs hanging from a shrub near by sat a fat black and yellow spider watching a fly whose delicate wings were just caught in the net  the poor fly buzzed pitifully and struggled so hard that the whole web shook but the more he struggled the more he entangled himself and the fierce spider was preparing to descend that it might weave a shroud about its prey when a little finger broke the threads and lifted the fly safely into the palm of a hand where he lay faintly humming his thanks  nelly had heard much about contrabands knew who they were and was very much interested in them so when she freed the poor black fly she played he was her contraband and felt glad that her first patient was one that needed help so much  carefully brushing away as much of the web as she could she left small pompey as she named him to free his own legs lest her clumsy fingers should hurt him then she laid him in one of the soft beds with a grain or two of sugar if he needed refreshment and bade him rest and recover from his fright remembering that he was at liberty to fly away whenever he liked because she had no wish to male a slave of him  feeling very happy over this new friend nelly went on singing softly as she walked and presently she found a pretty caterpillar dressed in brown fur although the day was warm he lay so still she thought him dead till he rolled himself into a ball as she touched him  i think you are either faint from the heat of this thick coat of yours or that you are going to make a cocoon of yourself mr fuzz said nelly  now i want to see you turn into a butterfly so i shall take you and if get lively again i will let you go i shall play that you have given out on a march as the soldiers sometimes do and been left behind for the sanitary people to see to  in went sulky mr fuzz and on trundled the ambulance till a golden green rosebeetle was discovered lying on his back kicking as if in a fit  dear me what shall i do for him thought nelly he acts as baby did when she was so ill and mamma put her in a warm bath  i havent got my little tub here or any hot water and im afraid the beetle would not like it if i had  perhaps he has pain in his stomach ill turn him over and pat his back as nurse does babys when she cries for pain like that  she set the beetle on his legs and did her best to comfort him but he was evidently in great distress for he could not walk and instead of lifting his emerald overcoat and spreading the wings that lay underneath be turned over again and kicked more violently than before  not knowing what to do  nelly put him into one of her soft nests for tony to cure if possible  she found no more patients in the garden except a dead bee which she wrapped in a leaf and took home to bury  when she came to the grove it was so green and cool she longed to sit and listen to the whisper of the pines and watch the larchtassels wave in the wind  but recollecting her charitable errand she went rustling along the pleasant path till she came to another patient over which she stood considering several minutes before she could decide whether it was best to take it to her hospital because it was a little gray snake with bruised tail  she knew it would not hurt her yet she was afraid of it she thought it pretty yet could not like it she pitied its pain yet shrunk from helping it for it had a fiery eye and a keep quivering tongue that looked as if longing to bite  he is a rebel i wonder if i ought to be good to him thought nelly watching the reptile writhe with pain  will said there were sick rebels in his hospital and one was very kind to him  it says too in my little book love your enemies i think snakes are mine but i guess ill try and love him because god made him  some boy will kill him if i leave him here and then perhaps his mother will be very sad about it  come poor worm i wish to help you so be patient and dont frighten me  then nelly laid her little handkerchief on the ground and with a stick gently lifted the wounded snake upon it and folding it together laid it in the ambulance she was thoughtful after that and so busy puzzling her young head about the duty of loving those who hate us and being kind to those who are disagreeable or unkind that she went through the rest of the wood quite forgetful of her work  a soft queek queek made her look up and listen the sound came from the long meadowgrass and bending it carefully back she found a halffledged bird with one wing trailing on the ground and its eyes dim with pain or hunger  you darling thing did you fall out of your nest and hurt your wing cried nelly looking up into the single tree that stood near by  no nest was to be seen no parent birds hovered overhead and little robin could only tell its troubles in that mournful queek queek queek  nelly ran to get both her chests and sitting down beside the bird tried to feed it to her joy it ate crumb after crumb as if it were half starved and soon fluttered nearer a confiding fearlessness that made her very proud soon baby robin seemed quite comfortable his eye brightened he queeked no more and but for the drooping wing would have been himself again  with one of her bandages nelly bound both wings closely to his sides for fear he should hurt himself by trying to fly and though he seemed amazed at her proceedings he behaved very well only staring at her and ruffling up his few feathers in a funny way that made her laugh then she had to discover some way of accommodating her two larger patients so that neither should hurt nor alarm the other  a bright thought came to her after much pondering carefully lifting the handkerchief she pinned the two ends to the roof of the cart and there swung little forkedtongue while rob lay easily below  by this time nelly began to wonder how it happened that she found so many more injured things than ever before  but it never entered her innocent head that tony had searched the wood and meadow before she was up and laid most of these creatures ready to her hands that she might not be disappointed  she had not yet lost her faith in fairies so she fancied they too belonged to her small sisterhood and presently it did really seem impossible to doubt that the good folk had been at work  coming to the bridge that crossed the brook she stopped a moment to watch the water ripple over the bright pebbles the ferns bend down to drink and the funny tadpoles frolic in quieter nooks where the sun shone and the dragonflies swung among the rushes  when nelly turned to go on her blue eyes opened wide and the handle of the ambulance dropped with a noise that caused a stout frog to skip into the water heels over head directly in the middle of the bridge was a pretty green tent made of two tall burdock leaves the stems were stuck into cracks between the boards the tips were pinned together with a thorn and one great buttercup nodded in the doorway like a sleepy sentinel nelly stared and smiled listened and looked about on every side nothing was seen but the quiet meadow and the shady grove nothing was heard but the babble of the brook and the cheery music of the bobolinks  yes said nelly softly to herself that is a fairy tent and in it i may find a baby elf sick with whoopingcough or scarletfever  how splendid it would be only i could never nurse such a dainty thing  stooping eagerly she peeped over the buttercups drowsy head and saw what seemed a tiny cock of hay she had no time to feel disappointed for the haycock began to stir and looking nearer she beheld two silvery gray mites who wagged wee tails and stretched themselves as if they had just waked up  nelly knew that they were young fieldmice and rejoiced over them feeling rather relieved that no fairy had appeared though she still believed them to have had a hand in the matter  i shall call the mice my babes in the wood because they are lost and covered up with leaves said nelly as she laid them in her snuggest bed where they nestled close together and fell fast asleep again  being very anxious to get home that she might tell her adventures and show how great was the need of a sanitary commission in that region nelly marched proudly up the avenue and having displayed her load hurried to the hospital where another applicant was waiting for her on the step of the door lay a large turtle with one claw gone and on his back was pasted a bit of paper with his namecommodore waddle usn nelly knew this was a joke of wills but welcomed the ancient mariner and called tony to help her get him in  all that morning they were very busy settling the newcomers for both people and books had to be consulted before they could decide what diet and treatment was best for each  the winged contraband had taken nelly at her word and flown away on the journey home  little rob was put in a large cage where he could use his legs yet not injure his lame wing  forkedtongue lay under a wire cover on sprigs of fennel for the gardener said that snakes were fond of it the babes in the wood were put to bed in one of the rush baskets under a cottonwool coverlet greenback the beetle found ease for his unknown aches in the warm heart of a rose where he sunned himself all day the commodore was made happy in a tub of water grass and stones and mr fuzz was put in a wellventilated glass box to decide whether he would be a cocoon or not  tony had not been idle while his mistress was away and he showed her the hospital garden he had made close by in which were cabbage nettle and mignonette plants for the butterflies flowering herbs for the bees chickweed and hemp for the birds catnip for the pussies and plenty of room left for whatever other patients might need  in the afternoon while nelly did her task at lintpicking talking busily to will as she worked and interesting him in her affairs tony cleared a pretty spot in the grove for the buryingground and made ready some small bits of slate on which to write the names of those who died  he did not have it ready an hour too soon for at sunset two little graves were needed and nurse nelly shed tender tears for her first losses as she laid the motherless mice in one smooth hollow and the graycoated rebel in the other she had learned to care for him already and when she found him dead was very glad she had been kind to him hoping that he knew it and died happier in her hospital than all alone in the shadowy wood  the rest of nellys patients prospered and of the many added afterward few died because of tonys skilful treatment and her own faithful care every morning when the day proved fair the little ambulance went out upon its charitable errand every afternoon nelly worked for the human sufferers whom she loved and every evening brother will read aloud to her from useful books showed her wonders with his microscope or prescribed remedies for the patients whom he soon knew by name and took much interest in  it was nellys holiday but though she studied no lessons she learned much and unconsciously made her pretty play both an example and a rebuke for others  at first it seemed a childish pastime and people laughed  but there was something in the familiar words sanitary hospital and ambulance that made them pleasant sounds to many ears  as reports of nellys work went through the neighborhood other children came to see and copy her design rough lads looked ashamed when in her wards they found harmless creatures hurt by them and going out they said among themselves we wont stone birds chase butterflies and drown the girls little cats any more though we wont tell them so and most of the lads kept their word so well that people said there never had been so many birds before as all that summer haunted wood and field tenderhearted playmates brought their pets to be cured even busy farmers bad a friendly word for the small charity which reminded them so sweetly of the great one which should never be forgotten lonely mothers sometimes looked out with wet eyes as the little ambulance went by recalling thoughts or absent sons who might be journeying painfully to some faroff hospital where brave women waited to tend them with hands as willing hearts as tender as those the gentle child gave to her selfappointed task  at home the charm worked also  no more idle days for nelly or fretful ones for will because the little sister would not neglect the helpless creatures so dependent upon her and the big brother was ashamed to complain after watching the patience of these lesser sufferers and merrily said he would try to bear his own wound as quietly and bravely as the commodore bore his  nelly never knew how much good she had done captain will till he went away again in the early autumn  then he thanked her for it and though she cried for joy and sorrow she never forgot it because he left something behind him which always pleasantly reminded her of the double success her little hospital had won  when will was gone and she had prayed softly in her heart that god would keep him safe and bring him home again she dried her tears and went away to find comfort in the place where he had spent so many happy hours with her  she had not been there before that day and when she reached the door she stood quite still and wanted very much to cry again far something beautiful had happened  she had often asked will for a motto for her hospital and he had promised to find her one  she thought he had forgotten it but even in the hurry of that busy day he had found time to do more than keep his word while nelly sat indoors lovingly brightening the tarnished buttons on the blue coat that had seen so many battles  above the roof where the doves cooed in the sun now rustled a white flag with the golden sc shining on it as the wind tossed it to and fro  below on the smooth panel of the door a skilful pencil had drawn two arching ferns in whose soft shadow poised upon a mushroom stood a little figure of nurse nelly and underneath it another of dr tony bottling medicine with spectacles upon his nose  both hands of the miniature nelly were outstretched as if beckoning to a train of insects birds and beasts which was so long that it not only circled round the lower rim of this fine sketch but dwindled in the distance to mere dots and lines  such merry conceits as one found there  a mouse bringing the tail it had lost in some cruel trap a dorbug with a shade over its eyes an invalid butterfly carried in a tiny litter by longlegged spiders a fat frog with gouty feet hopping upon crutches jenny wren sobbing in a nice handkerchief as she brought dear dead cock robin to be restored to life  rabbits lambs cats calves and turtles all came trooping up to be healed by the benevolent little maid who welcomed them so heartily  nelly laughed at these comical mites till the tears ran down her cheeks and thought she never could be tired of looking at them  but presently she saw four lines clearly printed underneath her picture and her childish face grew sweetly serious as she read the words of a great poet which will had made both compliment and motto    he prayeth best who loveth best   all things both great and small   for the dear god who loveth us   he made and loveth all
