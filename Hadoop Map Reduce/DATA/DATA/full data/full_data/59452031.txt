59452031	the  poetical works  of  alexander pope    with memoir critical dissertation and explanatory notes  by the  rev george gilfillan    vol ii  mdccclvi     the genius and poetry of pope   few poets during their lifetime have been at once so much admired and so much abused as pope some writers destined to oblivion in afterages have been loaded with laurels in their own time while others on whom fame was one day to wait like a menial have gone to the grave neglected if not decried and depreciated but it was the fate of pope to combine in his single experience the extremes of detraction and flatteryto have the sunshine of applause and the hailstorm of calumny mingled on his living head while over his dead body as over the body of patroclus there has raged a critical controversy involving not merely his character as a man but his claims as a poet for this unquestionably there are some subordinate reasons popes religious creed his political connexions his easy circumstances his popularity with the upper classes as well as his testy temper and malicious disposition all tended to rouse against him while he lived a personal as well as public hostility altogether irrespective of the mere merit or demerit of his poetry we cannot bear a papist to be our principal bard said one class no tory for our translator of homer cried the zealous whigs poets should be poor and pope is independent growled grub street the ancients could not endure that a poet should build an house but this varlet has dug a grotto and established a clandestine connexion between parnassus and the temple of plutus pope said others is handinglove with lords oxford and bolingbroke and it was never so seen before in any genuine child of genius he is a little ugly insect cried another class can such a misbegotten brat be a favourite with the beautiful apollo he is as venomous and spiteful as he is small never was so much of the essence of devil packed into such a tiny compass said another set and this to be sure is englands great poet besides these personal objections there were others of a more solid character while all admitted the exquisite polish and terse language of popes compositions many felt that they were too artificialthat they were often imitativethat they seldom displayed those qualities of original thought and sublime enthusiasm which had formed the chief characteristics of englands best bards and were slow to rank the author of eloisa and abelard with the creator of hamlet othello and lear the author of the rape of the lock with the author of paradise lost the author of the pastorals with the author of the faery queen and the author of the imitations of horace with the author of the canterbury tales on the one hand popes ardent friends erred in classing him with or above these great old writers and on the other his enemies were thus provoked to thrust him too far down in the scale and to deny him genius altogether since his death his fame has continued to vibrate between extremes lord byron and lord carlisle the latter in a lecture delivered in leeds in december 1850 and published afterwards have placed him ridiculously high while wordsworth coleridge and bowles have underrated him it shall be our endeavour in our succeeding remarks to steer a middle course between the parties  lord carlisle commenced his able and eloquent prelection by deploring the fact that pope had sunk in estimation and yet a few sentences after he told us that the commissioners of the fine arts selected pope along with chaucer shakspeare spenser milton and dryden to fill the six vacant places in the new palace of westminster this does not substantiate the assertion that pope has sunk in estimation had he sunk to any great extent the commissioners would not have dared to put his name and statue beside those of the acknowledged masters of english poetry but apart from this we do think that lord carlisle has exaggerated the decline and fall of the empire of pope he is still with the exception perhaps of cowper the most popular poet of the eighteenth century his essay on man and his eloisa and abelard are probably in every good library public and private in great britain can we say as much of chaucer and spenser passages and lines of his poetry are stamped on the memory of all welleducated men more pointed sayings of pope are afloat than of any english poet except shakspeare and young indeed if frequency of quotation be the principal proof of popularity pope with shakspeare young and spenser is one of the four most popular of english poets in america too lord carlisle found he tells us the most cultivated and literary portion of that great community warmly imbued with an admiration of pope  what more would or at least should his lordship desire pope is by his own showing a great favourite with many wherever the english language is spoken and that too a century after his death and there are few critics who would refuse to subscribe on the whole lord carlisles enumeration of the poets qualities his terse and mottolike linesthe elaborate gloss of his mockheroic veinthe tenderness of his pathosthe point and polished strength of his satirethe force and vraisemblance of his descriptions of characterthe delicacy and refinement of his compliments each of which says hazlitt is as good as an house or estateand the heights of moral grandeur into which he can at times soar whenever he has manly indignation or warmhearted patriotism or highminded scorn to express if lord carlisles object then was to elevate pope to the rank of a classic it was a superfluous task if it was to justify the commissioners in placing him on a level with chaucer shakspeare spenser and milton our remarks will show that we think it as vain as superfluous  in endeavouring to fix the rank of a poet there are we think the following elements to be analysedhis original geniushis kind and degree of culturehis purposehis special facultiesthe works he has writtenand the amount of impression he has made on and impulse he has given to his own age and the world in other words what were his native powers and what has he done for by and with them  now that pope possessed genius and genius of a high order we strenuously maintain but whether this amounted to creative power the highest quality of the poet is a very different question in native imagination that eyesight of the soul which sees in the rose a richer red in the sky a deeper azure in the sea a more dazzling foam in the stars a softer and more spiritual gold and in the sky a more dread magnificence than nature ever gave them that beholds the ideal always shining through and above the real and that lights the poet on to form within a new and more gorgeous nature the fresh creation of his own inspired mind pope was not only inferior to chaucer shakspeare spenser and milton but to young thomson collins burns wordsworth keats shelley byron coleridge and many other poets his native faculty indeed seems rather fine than powerfulrather timid than daring and resembles rather the petal of a rose peeping out into the summer air which seems scarce warm enough for its shrinking loveliness than the feather of the wing of a great eagle dipping into the night tempest which raves around the inaccessible rock of his birthplace he was not eminently original in his thinking in proof of this many of those fine sentiments which pope has thrown into such perfect shape and to which he has given such dazzling burnish are found by watson see the adventurer in pascal and others shakspeares wisdom on the other hand can be traced to shakspeares brain and no further although he has borrowed the plots of his plays who lent chaucer his pictures fresh as dewdrops from the womb of the morning spensers allegories are as native to him as his dreams and if milton has now and then carried off a load which belonged to another it was a load which only a giants arm could lift and which he added to a caravan of priceless wealth the native inheritance of his own genius  the highest rank of poets descend on their sublime subjects like uriel descending alongst his sunbeam on the mountain tops another order with care and effort and circumspection often with  labour dire and weary woe  reach noble heights and there wave their hats and dance in astonishment at their own perseverance and success so it is with pope in his peroration to the dunciad and in many other of the serious and really eloquent passages of his works they are eloquent brilliant in composition faultless but the intense selfconsciousness of their author and their visible elaboration prevent them from seeming or being great of pope you say he smells of the midnight lamp of dante boys cried out on the street lo the man that was in hell with the very first class of poets artificial objects become natural the rod becomes a serpent with pope natural objects become artificial the serpent becomes a rod wordsworth makes a spade poetical pope would have made skiddaw little better than a mass of prose  let us hear hazlitt pope saw nature only dressed by art he judged of beauty by fashion he sought for truth in the opinions of the world he judged the feelings of others by his own the capacious soul of shakspeare had an intuitive and mighty sympathy with whatever could enter into the heart of man in all possible circumstances pope had an exact knowledge of all that he himself loved or hated wished or wanted milton has winged his daring flight from heaven to earth through chaos and old night popes muse never wandered in safety but from his library to his grotto or from his grotto into his library back again his mind dwelt with greater pleasure on his own garden than on the garden of eden he could describe the faultless wholelength mirror that reflected his own person better than the smooth surface of the lake that reflects the face of heaven a piece of cut glass or pair of pastebuckles with more brilliancy and effect than a thousand dewdrops glittering in the sun he would be more delighted with a patent lamp than with the pale reflex of cynthias brow that fills the sky with the soft silent lustre that trembles through the cottage window and cheers the mariner on the lonely wave he was the poet of personality and polished life that which was nearest to him was the greatest his mind was the antithesis of strength and grandeur its power was the power of indifference he had none of the enthusiasm of poetry he was in poetry what the sceptic is in religion in his smooth and polished verse we meet with no prodigies of nature but with miracles of wit the thunders of his pen are whispered flatteries its forked lightnings pointed sarcasms for the gnarled oak he gives us the soft myrtle for rocks and seas and mountains artificial grassplots gravelwalks and tinkling rills for earthquakes and tempests the breaking of a flowerpot or the fall of a china jar for the tug and war of the elements or the deadly strife of the passions  calm contemplation and poetic ease  yet within this retired and narrow circle how much and that how exquisite was contained what discrimination what wit what delicacy what fancy what lurking spleen what elegance of thought what pampered refinement of sentiment  a great deal of discussion took place during the famous controversy about pope between bowles and byron on the questionswhat objects are and are not fitted for poetic purposes and whether natural or artificial objects be better suited for the treatment of the poet in our life of bowles we promised and shall now proceed to attempt a short review of the question then at issue and which on both sides was pled with such ingenuity ardour and eloquence  the question professedly that of the province slides away into what is the nature of poetry the object of poetry is we think to show the infinite through the finiteto reveal the ideal in the realit seeks by clustering analogies and associations around objects to give them a beautiful or sublime or interesting or terrible aspect which is not entirely their own now as all objects in comparison with the infinite are finite and all realities in comparison with the ideal are little it follows that between artificial and natural objects as fitted for poetic purposes there is no immense disparity and that both are capable of poetic treatment both accordingly have become subservient to high poetic effect and even the preponderance whatever it be on the part of natural objects has sometimes been equalised by the power of genius and artificial things have often been made to wring the heart or awaken the fancy as much or more than the other class think for instance of the words in lear  prithee undo this button thank you sir  what more contemptibly artificial than a button and yet beating in the wind of the hysterical passion which is tearing the heart of the poor dying king what a powerful index of misery it becomes and its undoing as the sign of the end of the tragedy and the letting forth of the great injured soul has melted many to tears when lady macbeth exclaims in that terrible crisis  give me the daggers  who feels not that although a dagger be only an artificial thing no natural or supernatural thing not the flaming sword of the cherubim itself could seem in the circumstances more fearfully sublime what action more artificial than dancing and yet how grand it seems in fords heroine who continues to dance on till the ball is finished while the news of death and death and death of friend brother husband are successively recounted to herand then herself expires there seems no comparison between a diamond and a star and yet a shakspeare or a schiller could so describe the trembling of a diamond on the brow say of belshazzar when the apparition of the writing on the wall disturbed his impious feast that it would seem more ideal and more magnificent than a star trembling on the hand of god when newly created or trembling on the verge of everlasting darkness when its hour had come a slipper seems a very commonplace object but how interesting the veritable slipper of empedocles who flung himself into etna whose slipper was disgorged by the volcano and as a link connecting the seen with the unseen the grassy earth with the burning entrails of the eternal furnace became intensely imaginative a feather in a cap even though it were an eagles seems from its position an object sufficiently artificial but how affecting the black plume of ravenswood floating on the waves which had engulphed the proud head that once bore it and which old caleb took up dried and placed in his bosom  nor are we sure that there are any objects so small or vulgar but what genius could extract poetry from them in popes hands indeed the clouded cane and the amber snuffbox of sir plume assume no ideal aspect but in shakspeares it might have been different and the highest order of genius like true catholicity of faith counts nothing common or unclean what poetry burns has gathered up even in poosie nancys which had been lying unsuspected at the feet of beggars prostitutes and pickpockets what powerful imagination there is in crabbes descriptions of poorhouses prisons and asylums and in wordsworths old cumberland beggar who although he lived and died in the eye of nature was clothed in rags and had the vulgar mendicant mealbag slung over his shoulders what pathos scott extracts from that black bitch of a boat which mucklebackit in the frenzy of his grief accuses for the loss of his son which of the lower animals less poetical or coarser than a swine and yet shakspeare introduces such a creature with great effect in macbeth in that weird dialogue of the witches  where hast thou been sister killing swine  and goethe makes it ideal by mingling it with the mad revelry of the walpurgis night  an able sow with old baubo upon her is worthy of glory and worthy of honour  the whole truth on this vexed question may perhaps be summed up in the following propositions1st no object natural or artificial is per se out of the province of imagination 2d there is no infinite gulf between natural and artificial objects or between the higher and lower degrees of either as subjects for the idealising power of poetry 3d ere any object natural or artificial become poetical it must be subjected more or less to the transfiguring power of imagination and 4th some objects in nature and some in art need less of this transforming magic than others and are thus intrinsically although not immeasurably superior in adaptation to the purposes of poetry  the great point after all is what eye beholds objects whether natural or artificial is it a poetical eye or not for given a poets eye then it matters little on what object that eye be fixed it becomes poetical where there is intrinsic poetryas in mountains the sea the sky the starsit comes rushing out to the silent spell of genius where there is lessas in artificial objects or the poorer productions of naturethe mind of the poet must exert itself tenfold and shed on it its own wealth and glory now pope we fear wanted almost entirely this true second sight take for instance the lock in the famous rape what fancy humour wit eloquence he brings to play around it but he never touches it even en passant with a ray of poetry you never could dream of intertwining it with  the tangles of neaeras hair  far less with the golden tresses and wanton ringlets of our primeval parent in the garden of eden shakspeare on the other hand would have made it a dropping from the shorn sun or a mad moonbeam gone astray or a tress fallen from the hair of the star venus as she gazed too intently at her own image in the calm evening sea nor will pope leave the lock entire in its beautiful smallness he must apply a microscope to it and stake his fame on idealising its subdivided single hairs the sylphs are created by combining the agility of ariel with the lively impertinence of the inhabitants of lilliput yet with what ease elegance and lingering love does he draw his petty pucks till though too tiny for touch they become palpable to vision on the whole had not the tempest and the midsummer nights dream existed before the rape of the lock the machinery in it would have proclaimed pope a man of creative imagination as it is it proves wonderful activity of fancy shakspeares delicate creations are touched again without crumbling at the touch clad in new down fed on a fresh supply of honeydew and sent out on minor but aerial errandsalthough after all we prefer puck and arielnot to speak of those delectable personages cobweb peaseblossom and mustardseed ariels oak in our poets hands becomes a vialknotty entrails are exchanged for a bodkins eyethe fine dew of the still vexed bermoothes is degraded into an essence pomatum takes the place of poetry the enchanted lock of an enchanted isle and the transformation of original imagination into ingenious fancy is completed before your eyes let the admirers of pope like the worshippers of cæsar of old beg a hair of him for memory for certainly he is more at home among hairs and curls than in any field where he has chosen to exercise his powers  about pope originally there was a small trivial and stinted something which did not promise even the greatness he actually attained we do not allude merely to his small stature remembering that the ninepin napoleon overthrew half the thrones in europe but he possessed sana mens in sano copore an erect figure and was every inch a man although his inches were few while in pope both bodily and mentally there lay a crooked waspish and petty nature his form too faithfully reflected his character he was never from the beginning to the close of his life a great broad genial being there was an unhealthy taint which partly enfeebled and partly corrupted him his selfwill his ambition his pariah position as belonging to the roman catholic faith the feebleness of his constitution the uncertainty of his real creed and one or two other circumstances we do not choose to name combined to create a lifelong ulcer in his heart and temper against which the vigour of his mind the enthusiasm of his literary tastes and the warmth of his heart struggled with much difficulty he had not in short the basis of a truly great poet either in imagination or in nature nor with all his incredible industry tact and talent did he ever rise into the seventh heaven of invention a splendid sylph let us call hima giant angel he was not  his culture like his genius was rather elegant than profound he lived in an age when a knowledge of the classics with a tincture of the metaphysics of the schools was thought a good average stock of learning although it was the age too of such mighty scholars as bentley clarke and warlburton pope seems to have glanced over a great variety of subjects with a rapid rechercé eye not examined any one with a quiet deep longing lingering exhaustive look he was no literary behemoth trusting that he could draw up jordan into his mouth he became thus neither an illinformed writer like goldsmith whose ingenuity must make up for his ignorance nor one of those doctorum vatum those learned poets such as dante milton and coleridge whose works alone according at least to buchanan are to obtain the rare and regal palm of immortality  sola doctorum monumenta vatum nesciunt fati imperium severi sola contemnunt phlegethonta et orci           jura superbi  that his philosophy was empirical is proved by his essay on man which notwithstanding all its brilliant rhetoric is the shallow version of a shallow system of naturalism and one may accommodate to him the wellknown saying of lyndhurst about lord brougham who would have made a capital chancellor if he had had only a little law so pope was very well qualified to have translated homer barring his ignorance of greek but every page of his writings proves a wide and diversified knowledgea knowledge too which he has perfectly under controlwhich he can make to go a great wayand by which with admirable skill he can subserve alike his moral and literary purpose but the question now ariseswhat was his purpose was it worthy of his powers was it high holy and faithfully pursued no poet we venture to say can be great without a great purpose purpose is the edge and point of character it is the stamp and superscription of genius it is the direction on the letter of talent character without it is blunt and torpid talent without it is a letter which undirected goes nowhere genius without it is bullion sluggish splendid and uncirculating now popes purpose seems on the whole dim and uncertain he is indifferent to destruction and careless about conserving he is neither an infidel nor a christian no whig but no very ardent tory either he seems to wish to support morality but his support is stumbling and precarious although on the other hand notwithstanding his frequent coarseness of language and looseness of allusion he exhibits no desire to overturn or undermine it his bursts of moral feeling are very beautiful such as that containing the noble lines  vice is undone if she forgets her earth and stoops from angels to the dregs of birth but tis the fall degrades her to a whore let greatness own her and shes mean no more her birth her beauty crowds and courts confess chaste matrons praise her and grave bishops bless in golden chains the willing world she draws and hers the gospel is and hers the laws mounts the tribunal lifts her scarlet head and sees pale virtue carted in her stead  but they are brief seem the result of momentary moods rather than the spray of a strong steady current and he soon turns from them to the expression of his petty chagrins and personal animosities in satire he has not the indomitable pace and deepmouthed bellow of a juvenal pursuing his object like a bloodhound he resembles more a halfangry halfplayful terrier to obtain a terse and musical expression for his thought is his artistic purpose but that of his mind and moral nature is not so apparent in his poetry indeed we are tempted at times to class him with his own sylphs in this respect as well as in the elegance and swiftness of his genius they neither belonged to heaven nor hell but vibrated between in graceful gyrations they laughed at and toyed with all thingsnever rising to dangerous heights never sinking into profound abyssesfancying a lock a universe and a universe only a larger lockdancing like evening ephemeræ in the sunbeam which was to be their sepulchre and shutting their tiny eyes to all the solemn responsibilities grave uncertainties and mysterious destinies of human nature and so too often did their poet  popes special faculties are easily seen and may be briefly enumerated destitute of the highest imagination and perhaps of constructive powerhe has produced many brilliant parts and many little but no large wholeshe is otherwise prodigally endowed he has a keen strong clear intellect which if it seldom reaches sublimity never fails to eliminate sense he has wit of a polished and vigorous kindless easy indeed than addisons the very curl of whose lip was crucifixion to his foe this wit when exasperated into satire is very formidable for like addisons it does its work with little noise pope whispers poetic perditionhe deals in drops of concentrated bitternesshe stabs with a poisoned bodkinhe touches his enemies into stone with the light and playful finger of a fairyand his more elaborate invectives glitter all over with the polish of profound malignity his knowledge of human nature particularly of womans heart is great but seems more the result of impish eavesdropping than of that thorough and genial insight which sympathy produces he has listened at the keyhole not by any open sesame entered the chamber he has rather painted manners than men his power of simulating passion is great but the passion must in general be mingled with unnatural elements ere he can realise itthe game must be putrid ere he can enjoy its flavour he has no humour at least in his poetry it is too much of an unconscious outflow and partakes too much of the genial and the human nature for him his fancy is lively and copious but its poetical products often resemble the forced fruits of a hothouse rather than those of a natural soil and climate his description of sporus lauded by byron as a piece of imagination is exceedingly artificial and farfetched in its figuresa mere mass of smoked gumflowers compare for fancy the speeches of mercutio in romeo and juliet the rape of the lock if we would see the difference between a spontaneous and artificial outpouring of images between a fancy as free as fervid and one lashing itself into productiveness his power of describing natural objects is far from firstrate he enumerates instead of describing he omits nothing in the scene except the one thing needfulthe bright poetical gleam or haze which ought to have been there there is the grass but not the splendourthe flower but not the glory in depicting character it is very different his likenesses of men and women so far as manners external features and the contrasts produced by the accidents of circumstances and the mutation of affairs are inimitable his power of complimenting is superior even to that of louis xiv he picks out the one best quality in a man sets it in gold and presents it as if he were conferring instead of describing a noble gift  would you be blest despise low joys low gains disdain whatever cornbury disdains be virtuous and be happy for your pains  popes language seems as if it were laboriously formed by himself for his peculiar shape of mind habits of thought and style of poetry compared to all english before him popes english is a new although a lesser language he has so cut down shorn and trimmed the broad old oak of shakspeares speech that it seems another tree altogether everything is so terse so clear so pointed so elaborately easy so monotonously brilliant that you must pause to remember these are the very copulatives diphthongs and adjectives of hooker milton and jeremy taylor the change at first is pleasant and has been generally popular but those who know and love our early authors soon miss their deep organtones their gnarled strength their intricate but intense sweetness their varied and voluminous music their linked chains of lightning and feel the difference between the fabricator of clever lines and sparkling sentences and the former of great passages and works in keeping with his style is his versification the incessant tinkling of a sheepbellsweet small monotonousproducing perfectlymelodious single lines but no grand interwoven swells and wellproportioned masses of harmony pope says hazlitt has turned pegasus into a rockinghorse the noble gallop of drydens verse is exchanged for a quick trot and there is not even a point of comparison between his sweet singsong and the wavy snowlike spiritlike motion of miltons loftier passages or the gliding pausing fitful riverlike progress of shakspeares verse or the fretted fury and torrentrapture of brave old chapman in his translation of homer or the rich longdrawnout slowswimming now softlanguishing and now fullgushing melody of spensers faery queenyet within his own sphere pope was as scott calls him a deacon of his craft he aimed at and secured correctness and elegance his part is not the highest but in it he approaches absolute perfection and with all his monotony of manner and versification he is one of the most interesting of writers and many find a greater luxury in reading his pages than those of any other poet he is the facile princeps of those poetical writers who have written for and are so singularly appreciated by the fastidiousthat class who are more staggered by faults than delighted with beauties  our glance at his individual works must be brief and cursory his ode to solitude is the most simple and natural thing he ever wrote and in it he seems to say to nature vale longum vale his pastorals have an unnatural and luscious sweetness he has sugared his milk it is not as it ought to be warm from the cow and fresh as the clover how different his rural life from the rude rough pictures of theocritus and the delightfully true and genial pages of the gentle shepherd his windsor forest is an elegant accumulation of sweet sonnets and pleasant images but the freshness of the dew is not resting on every bud and blade no shadowy forms are seen retiring amidst the glades of the forest no uriels seem descending on the sudden slips of afternoon sunshine which pierce athwart the green or brown masses of foliage and you cannot say of his descriptions that  visions as poetic eyes avow hang on each leaf and cling to every bough  shelley studied the scenery of his fine poem alastor in the same shades with pope but he had like jonathan of old touched his lips with a rod dipped in poetic honey and his eyes were enlightened to see sights of beauty and mystery which to the other are denied keats could have comprised all the poetry of windsor forest into one sonnet or line indeed has he not done so where describing his soul following the note of the nightingale into the far depths of the woods where she is pouring out her heart in song he says  and with thee fade away into the forest dim  the essay on criticism is rather a wonderful intellectual and artistic feat than a true poem it is astonishing as the work of a boy of nineteen and contains a unique collection of clever and sparkling sentences displaying the highest powers of acuteness and assimilation if not much profound and original insight or genius this poem suggests the wish that more of our critics would write in verse the music might lessen the malice and set off the commonplace to advantage so that if there were no reason there might be at least rhyme his lines to the memory of an unfortunate lady are too elaborate and artificial for the theme it is a tale of intrigue murder and suicide set to a musical snuffbox his rape of the lock we have already characterised it is an iliad in a nutshell an epic of lilliput where all the proportions are accurately observed and where the finishing is so exact and admirable that you fancy the author to have had microscopic eyes it contains certainly the most elegant and brilliant badinage the most graceful raillery the most finished nonsense and one of the most exquisitelymanaged machineries in the language his eloisa and abelard a poem beautiful and almost unequalled in execution is ill chosen in subject he compels you indeed to weep but you blame and trample on your tears after they are shed pope in this poem as shelley in the cenci has tried to extract beauty from moral deformity and to glorify putrefaction but who can long love to gaze at worms however well painted or will be disposed to pardon the monstrous choice of a dead or demon bride for the splendour of her weddinggarment the passion of the eloisa and that of the cenci were both indeed facts but many facts should be veiled statues in the temple of truth to do however both pope and shelley justice they touch their painful and shocking themes with extreme delicacy dryden well remarks campbell would have given but a coarse draught of eloisas passion popes epistles satires imitations c contain much of the most spirited sense and elegant sarcasm in literature the portraits of villars and atticus will occur to every reader as masterpieces in power although we deem the latter grossly unjust to a good and great man his homer is rather an adaptation than a translationfar less a transfusion of the grecian bard pope does not indeed clothe the old blind rhapsodist with a bagwig and sword but he does all short of this to make him a fine modern gentleman scott we think could have best rendered homer in his balladrhyme chapman is chapman but he is not homer pope is pope and hobbes is hobbes and sotheby is sotheby and cowper is cowper each doing his best to render homer but none of them is the grand old greek whose lines are all simple and plain as brands but like brands pointed on their edges with fire  the essay on man ought to have been called an epigram on man or better still should have been propounded as a riddle to which the word man was to supply the solution but an antithesis epigram or riddle on man of 1300 lines is rather long it seems so especially as there is no real or new light cast in it on mans nature or destiny we refer our readers to the notes of dr crolys edition for a running commentary of confutation to the essay on man distinguished by solid and unanswerable acuteness of argument but such an eloquent and ingenious puzzle as it is it might have issued from the workbasket of titania herself it is another evidence of popes greatness in trifles how he would have shone in fabricating the staves of the ark or the fringes of the tabernacle  the dunciad is in many respects the ablest the most elaborate and the most characteristic of popes poems in embalming insignificance and impaling folly he seems to have found at last his most congenial work with what apparently sovereign contempt masterly ease artistic calm and judicial gravity does he set about it and once his museum of dunces is completed with what dignitythe little tyrant that he wasdoes he march through it and with what complacency does he point to his slain and dried dunces and say behold the work of my hands it never seems to have occurred to him that his poem was destined to be an everlasting memorial not only of his enemies but of the annoyance he had met from themat once of his strength in crushing and his weakness in feeling their attacks and in showing their mummies for money  that pope deserves on the whole the name of poet we are willing as aforesaid to concede but he was the most artificial of true poets he had in him a real though limited vein but did not trust sufficiently to it and at once weakened and strengthened it by his peculiar kind of cultivation he weakened it as a faculty but strengthened it as an art he lessened its inward force but increased the elegance and facility of its outward expression what he might have attained had he left his study and trim gardens and visited the alps snowdon or the grampianshad he studied boileau less and dante milton or the bible morewe cannot tell but he certainly in this case would have left works greater if not more graceful behind him and if he had pleased his own taste and that of his age less he might have more effectually touched the chord of the heart of all future time by his poetry as it is his works resemble rather the london colosseum than westminster abbey they are exquisite imitations of nature but we never can apply to them the words of the poet  oer englands abbeys bends the sky as on its friends with kindred eye for nature gladly gave them place adopted them into her race and granted them an equal date with andes and with ararat  read and admired pope must always beif not for his poetry and passion yet for his elegance wit satiric force fidelity as a painter of artificial life and the clear pellucid english but his deficiency in the creative faculty a deficiency very marked in two of his most lauded poems we have not specified his messiah and temple of fame both eloquent imitations his lack of profound thought the general poverty of his natural pictures there are some fine ones in eloisa and abelard the coarse and bitter element often intermingled with his satire the monotonous glitter of his verse and the want of profound purpose in his writings combine to class him below the first file of poets and vain are all attempts such as those of byron and lord carlisle to alter the general verdict it is very difficult after a time either to raise or depress an acknowledged classic and pope must come if he has not come already to a peculiarly defined and strictly apportioned place on the shelf he was unquestionably the poet of his age but his age was far from being one of a lofty order it was a low languid artificial and lazily sceptical age it loved to be tickled and pope tickled it with the finger of a master it liked to be lulled at other times into halfslumber and the soft and even monotonies of popes pastorals and windsor forest effected this end it loved to be suspended in a state of semidoubt swung to and fro in agreeable equipoise and the essay on man was precisely such a swing it was fond of a mixture of strong english sense with french graces and charms of manner and pope supplied it it was fond of keen yet artfully managed satire and pope furnished it in abundance it loved nothing that threatened greatly to disturb its equanimity or overmuch to excite or arouse it and there was little of this in pope had he been a really great poet of the old homer or dante breed he would have outshot his age till he dwindled in the distance but in lieu of immediate fame and of elaborate lectures in the next century to bolster it unduly up all generations would have risen and called him blessed  we had intended some remarks on pope as a prosewriter and as a correspondent but want of space has compelled us to confine ourselves to his poetry     contents  moral essays

moral essays   the essay on man was intended to have been comprised in four books  the first of which the author has given us under that title in four epistles  the second was to have consisted of the same number1 of the extent and limits of human reason 2 of those arts and sciences and of the parts of them which are useful and therefore attainable together with those which are unuseful and therefore unattainable 3 of the nature ends use and application of the different capacities of men 4 of the use of learning of the science of the world and of wit concluding with a satire against the misapplication of them illustrated by pictures characters and examples  the third book regarded civil regimen or the science of politics in which the several forms of a republic were to have been examined and explained together with the several modes of religious worship as far forth as they affect society between which the author always supposed there was the most interesting relation and closest connexion so that this part would have treated of civil and religious society in their full extent  the fourth and last book concerned private ethics or practical morality considered in all the circumstances orders professions and stations of human life  the scheme of all this had been maturely digested and communicated to the lord bolingbroke dr swift and one or two more and was intended for the only work of his riper years but was partly through ill health partly through discouragements from the depravity of the times and partly on prudential and other considerations interrupted postponed and lastly in a manner laid aside  but as this was the authors favourite work which more exactly reflected the image of his strong capacious mind and as we can have but a very imperfect idea of it from the disjecta membra poetae that now remain it may not be amiss to be a little more particular concerning each of these projected books the first as it treats of man in the abstract and considers him in general under every one of his relations becomes the foundation and furnishes out the subjects of the three following so that  the second book takes up again the first and second epistles of the first book and treats of man in his intellectual capacity at large as has been explained above of this only a small part of the conclusion which as we said was to have contained a satire against the misapplication of wit and learning may be found in the fourth book of the dunciad and up and down occasionally in the other three  the third book in like manner reassumes the subject of the third epistle of the first which treats of man in his social political and religious capacity but this part the poet afterwards conceived might be best executed in an epic poem as the action would make it more animated and the fable less invidious in which all the great principles of true and false governments and religions should be chiefly delivered in feigned examples  the fourth and last book pursues the subject of the fourth epistle of the first and treats of ethics or practical morality and would have consisted of many members of which the four following epistles were detached portions the two first on the characters of men and women being the introductory part of this concluding bookwarburton   epistle ito sir richard temple lord cobham

my sense the more my love appears            110 sure twas not much to bid one kind adieu at least to feign was never hard to you farewell my lesbian love you might have said or coldly thus farewell o lesbian maid no tear did you no parting kiss receive nor knew i then how much i was to grieve no lovers gift your sappho could confer and wrongs and woes were all you left with her no charge i gave you and no charge could give but this be mindful of our loves and live          120 now by the nine those powers adored by me and love the god that ever waits on thee when first i heard from whom i

the world proclaim such inconsistent things are love and shame tis thou art all my care and my delight my daily longing and my dream by night oh night more pleasing than the brightest day when fancy gives what absence takes away and dressd in all its visionary charms restores my fair deserter to my arms then round your neck in wanton wreaths i twine then you methinks as fondly circle mine              150 a thousand tender words i hear and speak a thousand melting kisses give and take then fiercer joys i blush to mention these yet while i blush confess how much they please but when with day the sweet delusions fly and all things wake to life and joy but i as if once more forsaken i complain and close my eyes to dream of you again then frantic rise and like some fury rove through lonely plains and through the silent grove    160 as if the silent grove and lonely plains that knew my pleasures could relieve my pains i view the grotto once the scene of love the rocks around the hanging roofs above that charmd me more with native moss oergrown than phrygian marble or the parian stone i find the shades that veild our joys before but phaon gone those shades delight no more here the pressd herbs with bending tops betray where oft entwined in amorous folds we lay             170 i kiss that earth which once was pressd by you and all with tears the withering herbs bedew for thee the fading trees appear to mourn and birds defer their songs till thy return night shades the groves and all in silence lie all but the mournful philomel and i with mournful philomel i join my strain

from my eyes           200 i go ye nymphs those rocks and seas to prove how much i fear but ah how much i love i go ye nymphs where furious love inspires let female fears submit to female fires to rocks and seas i fly from phaons hate and hope from seas and rocks a milder fate ye gentle gales beneath my body blow and softly lay me on the waves below and thou kind love my sinking limbs sustain spread thy soft wings and waft me oer the main       210 nor let a lovers death the guiltless flood profane on phoebus shrine my harp ill then bestow and this inscription shall be placed below here she who sung to him that did inspire sappho to phoebus consecrates her lyre what suits with sappho phoebus suits with thee the gift the giver and the god agree  but why alas relentless youth ah why to distant seas must tender sappho fly thy charms than those may far more powerful be         220 and phoebus self is less a god to me ah canst thou doom me to the rocks and sea oh far more faithless and more hard than they ah canst thou rather see this tender breast dashd on these rocks than to thy bosom pressd this breast which once in vain you liked so well where the loves playd and where the muses dwell alas the muses now no more inspire untuned my lute and silent is my lyre my languid numbers have forgot to flow                 230 and fancy sinks beneath a weight of woe ye lesbian virgins and

fiercely burn the lovers fires gods can no prayers no sighs no numbers move one savage heart or teach it how to love the winds my prayers my sighs my numbers bear the flying winds have lost them all in air oh when alas shall more auspicious gales to these fond eyes restore thy welcome sails if you returnah why these long delays poor sappho dies while careless phaon stays oh launch thy bark nor fear the watery plain          250 venus for thee shall smooth her native main oh launch thy bark secure of prosperous gales cupid for thee shall spread the swelling sails if you will flyyet ah what cause can be too cruel youth that you should fly from me if not from phaon i must hope for ease ah let me seek it from the raging seas to raging seas unpitied ill remove and either cease to live or cease to love    the fable of dryope56  from the ninth book of ovids metamorphoses  she said and for her lost galanthis sighs when the fair consort of her son replies since you a servants ravishd form

and blessd in all those charms that pleased a god succeeded to her arms  a lake there was with shelving banks around whose verdant summit fragrant myrtles crownd these shades unknowing of the fates she sought and to the naiads flowery garlands brought her smiling babe a pleasing charge she pressd within her arms and nourishd at her breast            20 not distant far a watery lotus grows the spring was new and all the verdant boughs adornd with blossoms promised fruits that vie in glowing colours with the tyrian dye of these she croppd to please her infant son and i myself the same rash act had done but lo i saw as near her side i stood the violated blossoms drop with blood upon the tree i cast a frightful look the trembling tree with sudden horror shook             30 lotis the nymph if rural tales be true as from priapus lawless lust she flew forsook her form and fixing here became a flowery plant which still preserves her name  this change unknown astonishd at the sight my trembling sister strove to urge her flight and first the pardon of the nymphs implored and those offended sylvan powers adored but when she backward would have fled she found her stiffening feet were rooted in the ground           40 in vain to free her fastend feet she strove and as she struggles only moves above she feels th encroaching bark around her grow by quick degrees and cover all below surprised at this her trembling hand she heaves to rend her hair her hand is filld with leaves where late was hair the shooting leaves are seen to rise and shade her with a sudden green the child amphissus to her bosom pressd perceived a colder and a harder breast                  50 and found the springs that neer till then denied their milky moisture on a sudden dried i saw unhappy what i now relate and stood the helpless witness of thy fate embraced thy boughs thy rising bark delayd there wishd to grow and mingle shade with shade  behold andraemon and th unhappy sire appear and for their dryope inquire a springing tree for dryope they find and print warm kisses on the panting rind               60 prostrate with tears their kindred plant bedew and close embrace as to the roots they grew the face was all that now remaind of thee no more a woman nor yet quite a tree thy branches hung with humid pearls appear from every leaf distils a trickling tear and straight a voice while yet a voice remains thus through the trembling boughs in sighs complains  if to the wretched any faith be given i swear by all th unpitying powers of heaven           70 no wilful crime this heavy vengeance bred in mutual innocence our lives we led if this be false let these new greens decay let sounding axes lop my limbs away and crackling flames on all my honours prey but from my branching arms this infant bear let some kind nurse supply a mothers care and to his mother let him oft be led sport in her shades and in her shades be fed teach him when first his infant voice shall frame       80 imperfect words and lisp his mothers name to hail this tree and say with weeping eyes within this plant my hapless parent lies and when in youth he seeks the shady woods oh let him fly the crystal lakes and floods nor touch the fatal flowers but warnd by me believe a goddess shrined in every tree my sire my sister and my spouse farewell if in your breasts or love or pity dwell protect your plant nor let my branches feel             90 the browsing cattle or the piercing steel farewell and since i cannot bend to join my lips to yours advance at least to mine my son thy mothers parting kiss receive while yet thy mother has a kiss to give i can no more the creeping rind invades my closing lips and hides my head in shades remove your hands the bark shall soon suffice without their aid

human heat retaind    vertumnus and pomona  from the fourteenth book of ovids metamorphoses  the fair pomona flourishd in his reign of all the virgins of the sylvan train none taught the trees a nobler race to bear or more improved the vegetable care to her the shady grove the flowery field the streams and fountains no delights could yield twas all her joy the ripening fruits to tend and see the boughs with happy burdens bend the hook she bore instead of cynthias spear to lop the growth of the luxuriant year                 10 to decent forms the lawless shoots to bring and teach th obedient branches where to spring now the cleft rind inserted grafts receives and yields an offspring more than nature gives now sliding streams the thirsty plants renew and feed their fibres with

gathering what the bounteous year allows he pulls ripe apples from the bending boughs            40 a soldier now he with his sword appears a fisher next his trembling angle bears each shape he varies

proppd on his staff and stooping as he goes a painted mitre shades his furrowd brows the god in this decrepid form arrayd                    50 the gardens enterd and the fruit surveyd and happy you he thus addressd the maid whose charms as far all other nymphs outshine as other gardens are excelld by thine then kissd the fair his kisses warmer grow than such as women on their sex bestow then placed beside her on the flowery ground beheld the trees with autumns bounty crownd an elm was near to whose embraces led the curling vine her swelling clusters spread           60 he viewd her twining branches with delight and praised the beauty of the pleasing sight  yet this tall elm but for this vine he said had stood neglected and a barren shade and this fair vine but that her arms surround her married elm had crept along the ground ah beauteous maid let this example move your mind averse from all the joys of love deign to be loved and every heart subdue what nymph could eer attract such crowds as you        70 not she whose beauty urged the centaurs arms ulysses queen nor helens fatal charms evn now when silent scorn is all they gain a thousand court you though they court in vain a thousand sylvans demigods and gods that haunt our mountains and our alban woods but if youll prosper mark what i advise whom age and long experience render wise and one whose tender

all forms that may pomona please but what should most excite a mutual flame your rural cares and pleasures are the same to him your orchards early fruits are due a pleasing offering when tis made by you he values these but yet alas complains that still the best and dearest gift remains not the fair fruit that on yon branches glows           100 with that ripe red th autumnal sun bestows nor tasteful herbs that in these gardens rise which the kind soil with milky sap supplies you only you can move the gods desire oh crown so constant and so pure a fire let soft compassion touch your

these years to venture on the fair by him who made the ocean earth and air to please a wife when her occasions call              210 would busy the most vigorous of us all and trust me sir the chastest you can choose will ask observance and exact her dues if what i speak my noble lord offend my tedious sermon here is at an end  tis well tis wondrous well the knight replies most worthy kinsman faith youre mighty wise we sirs are fools and must resign the cause to heathenish authors proverbs and old saws he spoke with scorn and turnd another way            220 what does my friend my dear placebo say  i say quoth he by heaven the mans to blame to slander wives and wedlocks holy name  at this the council rose without delay each in his own opinion went his way with full consent that all disputes appeased the knight should marry when and where he pleased  who now but january exults with joy the charms of wedlock all his soul employ each nymph by turns his wavering mind possessd        230 and reignd the shortlived tyrant of his breast whilst fancy pictured every lively part and each bright image wanderd oer his heart thus in some public forum fixd on high a mirror shows the figures moving by still one by one in swift succession pass the gliding shadows oer the polishd glass this ladys charms the nicest could not blame but vile suspicions had aspersed her fame that was with sense but not with virtue blessd       240 and one had grace that wanted all the rest thus doubting long what nymph he should obey he fixd at last upon the youthful may her faults he knew not love is always blind but every charm revolved within his mind her tender age her form divinely fair her easy motion her attractive air her sweet behaviour her enchanting face her moving softness and majestic grace much in his prudence did our knight rejoice            250 and thought no mortal could dispute his choice once more in haste he summond every friend and told them all their pains were

nuptial pleasures prove so great to match the blessings of the future state those endless joys were ill exchanged for these then clear this doubt and set my mind at ease  this justin heard nor could his spleen control touchd to the quick and tickled at the soul sir knight he cried if this be all you dread heaven put it past your doubt wheneer you wed and to my fervent prayers so far consent               280 that ere the rites are oer you may repent good heaven no doubt the nuptial state approves since it chastises still what best it loves then be not sir abandoned to despair seek and perhaps youll find among the fair one that may do your business to a hair not een in wish your happiness delay but prove the scourge to lash you on your way then to the skies your mounting soul shall go swift as an arrow soaring from the bow                 290 provided still you moderate your joy nor in your pleasures all your might employ let reasons rule your strong desires abate nor please too lavishly

pageantry the proud array the time approachd to church the parties went at once with carnal and devout intent                  310 forth came the priest and bade the obedient wife like sarah or rebecca lead her life then prayd the powers the fruitful bed to bless and made all sure enough with holiness  and now the palace gates are opend wide the guests appear in order side by side and placed in state the bridegroom and the bride the breathing flutes soft notes are heard around and the shrill trumpets mix their silver sound the vaulted roofs with echoing music ring              320 these touch the vocal stops and those the trembling string not thus amphion tuned the warbling lyre nor joab the sounding clarion could inspire nor fierce theodamas whose sprightly strain could swell the soul to rage and fire the martial train  bacchus himself the nuptial feast to grace so poets sing was present on the place and lovely venus goddess of delight shook high her flaming torch in open sight and danced around and smiled on every knight          330 pleased her best servant would his courage try no less in wedlock than in liberty full many an age old hymen had not spied so kind a bridegroom or so bright a bride ye bards renownd among the tuneful throng for gentle lays and joyous nuptial song think not your softest numbers can display the matchless glories of this blissful day the joys are such as far transcend your rage when tender youth has wedded stooping age              340  the beauteous dame sat smiling at the board and darted amorous glances at her lord not hesters self whose charms the hebrews sing eer lookd so lovely on her persian king bright as the rising sun in summers day and fresh and blooming as the month of may the joyful knight surveyd her by his side nor envied paris with his spartan bride still as his mind revolved with vast delight th entrancing raptures of th approaching night       350 restless he sat invoking every power to speed his bliss and haste the happy hour meantime the vigorous dancers beat the ground and songs were sung and flowing bowls went round with odorous spices they perfumed the place and mirth and pleasure shone in every face  damian alone of all the menial train sad in the midst of triumphs sighd for pain damian alone the knights obsequious squire consumed at heart and fed a secret fire               360 his lovely mistress all his soul possessd he lookd he languishd and could take no rest his task performd he sadly went his way fell on his bed and loathd the light of day there let him lie till his relenting dame weep in her turn and waste in equal flame  the weary sun as learnèd poets write forsook th horizon and rolld down the light while glittering stars his absent beams supply and nights dark mantle overspread the sky             370 then rose the guests and as the time required each paid his thanks and decently retired  the foe once gone our knight prepared t undress so keen he was and eager to possess but first thought fit th assistance to receive which grave physicians scruple not to give satyrion near with hot eringoes stood cantharides to fire the lazy blood whose use old bards describe in luscious rhymes and critics learnd explain to modern times            380  by this the sheets were spread the bride undressd the room was sprinkled and the bed was blessd what next ensued beseems not me to say tis sung he labourd till the dawning day then briskly sprung from bed with heart so light as all were nothing he had done by night and sippd his cordial as he sat upright he kissd his balmy spouse with wanton play and feebly sung a lusty roundelay then on the couch his weary limbs he cast              390 for every labour must have rest at last  but anxious cares the pensive squire oppressd sleep fled his eyes and peace forsook his breast the raging flames that in his bosom dwell he wanted art to hide and means to tell yet hoping time th occasion might betray composed a sonnet to the lovely may which writ and folded with the nicest art he wrappd in silk and laid upon his heart  when now the fourth revolving day was run              400 twas june and cancer had received the sun forth from her chamber came the beauteous bride the good old knight moved slowly by her side high mass was sung they feasted in the hall the servants round stood ready at their call the squire alone was absent from the board and much his sickness grieved his worthy lord who prayd his spouse attended with her train to visit damian and divert his pain th obliging dames obeyd with one consent             410 they left the hall and to his lodging went the female tribe surround him as he lay and close beside him sat the gentle may where as she tried his pulse he softly drew a heaving sigh and cast a mournful view then gave his bill and bribed the powers divine with secret vows to favour his design  who studies now but discontented may on her soft couch uneasily she lay                     420 the lumpish husband snored away the night till coughs awaked him near the morning light what then he did ill not presume to tell nor if she thought herself in heaven or hell honest and dull in nuptial bed they lay till the bell tolld and all arose to pray  were it by forceful destiny decreed or did from chance or natures power proceed or that some star with aspect kind to love shed its selectest influence from above whatever was the cause the tender dame                 430 felt the first motions of an infant flame received th impressions of the lovesick squire and wasted in the soft infectious fire  ye fair draw near let mays example move your gentle minds to pity those who love had some fierce tyrant in her stead been found the poor adorer sure had hangd or drownd but she your sexs mirror free from pride was much too meek to prove a homicide  but to my talesome sages have defined                440 pleasure the sovereign bliss of humankind our knight who studied much we may suppose derived his high philosophy from those for like a prince he bore the vast expense of lavish pomp and proud magnificence his house was stately his retinue gay large was his train and gorgeous his array his spacious garden made to yield to none was compassd round with walls of solid stone priapus could not half describe the grace               450 though god of gardens of this charming place a place to tire the rambling wits of france in long descriptions and exceed romance enough to shame the gentlest bard that sings of painted meadows and of purling springs  full in the centre of the flowery ground a crystal fountain spread its streams around the fruitful banks with verdant laurels crownd about this spring if ancient fame say true the dapper elves their moonlight sports pursue         460 their pigmy king and little fairy queen in circling dances gambolld on the green while tuneful sprites a merry concert made and airy music warbled through the shade  hither the noble knight would oft repair his scene of pleasure and peculiar care for this he held it dear and always bore the silver key that lockd the garden door to this sweet place in summers sultry heat he used from noise and business to retreat             470 and here in dalliance spend the livelong day solus cum sola with his sprightly may for whateer work was undischarged abed the duteous knight in this fair garden sped  but ah what mortal lives of bliss secure how short a space our worldly joys endure o fortune fair like all thy treacherous kind but faithless still and wavering as the wind o painted monster formd mankind to cheat with pleasing poison and with soft deceit             480 this rich this amorous venerable knight amidst his ease his solace and delight struck blind by thee resigns his days to grief and calls on death the wretchs last relief  the rage of jealousy then seized his mind for much he feard the faith of womankind his wife not sufferd from his side to stray was captive kept he watchd her night and day abridged her pleasures and confined her sway full oft in tears did hapless may complain             490 and sighd full oft but sighd and wept in vain she lookd on damian with a lovers eye for oh twas fixd she must possess or die nor less impatience vexd her amorous squire wild with delay and burning with desire watchd as she was yet could he not refrain by secret writing to disclose his pain the dame by signs reveald her kind intent till both were conscious what each other meant  ah gentle knight what would thy eyes avail           500 though they could see as far as ships can sail tis better sure when blind deceived to be than be deluded when a man can see  argus himself so cautious and so wise was overwatchd for all his hundred eyes so many an honest husband may tis known who wisely never thinks the case his own  the dame at last by diligence and care procured the key her knight was wont to bear she took the wards in wax before the fire              510 and gave th impression to the trusty squire by means of this some wonder shall appear which in due place and season you may hear well sung sweet ovid in the days of yore what slight is that which love will not explore and pyramus and thisbe plainly show the feats true lovers when they list can do though watchd and captive yet in spite of all they found the art of kissing through a wall  but now no longer from our tale to stray               520 it happd that once upon a summers day our reverend knight was urged to amorous play he raised his spouse ere matinbell was rung and thus his morning canticle he sung  awake my love disclose thy radiant eyes arise my wife my beauteous lady rise hear how the doves with pensive notes complain and in soft murmurs tell the trees their pain the winters past the clouds and tempests fly the sun adorns the fields and brightens all the sky   530 fair without spot whose every charming part my bosom wounds and captivates my heart come and in mutual pleasures lets engage joy of my life and comfort of my age  this heard to damian straight a sign she made to haste before the gentle squire obeyd secret and undescried he took his way and ambushd close behind an arbour lay  it was not long ere january came and hand in hand with him his lovely dame              540 blind as he was not doubting all was sure he turnd the key and made the gate secure  here let us walk he said observed by none conscious of pleasures to the world unknown so may my soul have joy as thou my wife art far the dearest solace of my life and rather would i choose by heaven above to die this instant than to lose thy love reflect what truth was in my passion shown when unendowd i took thee for my own                550 and sought no treasure but thy heart alone old as i am and now deprived of sight whilst thou art faithful to thy own true knight nor age nor blindness rob me of delight each other loss with patience i can bear the loss of thee is what i only fear  consider then my lady and my wife the solid comforts of a virtuous life as first the love of christ himself you gain next your own honour undefiled maintain               560 and lastly that which sure your mind must move my whole estate shall gratify your love make your own terms and ere tomorrows sun displays his light by heaven it shall be done i seal the contract with a holy kiss and will perform by thismy dear and this have comfort spouse nor think thy lord unkind tis love not jealousy that fires my mind for when thy charms my sober thoughts engage and joind to them my own unequal age                  570 from thy dear side i have no power to part such secret transports warm my melting heart for who that once possessd those heavenly charms could live one moment absent from thy arms  he ceased and may with modest grace replied weak was her voice as while she spoke she cried heaven knows with that a tender sigh she drew i have a soul to save as well as you and what no less you to my charge commend my dearest honour will to death defend                 580 to you in holy church i gave my hand and joind my heart in wedlocks sacred band yet after this if you distrust my care then hear my lord and witness what i swear  first may the yawning earth her bosom rend and let me hence to hell alive descend or die the death i dread no less than hell sewd in a sack and plunged into a well ere i my fame by one lewd act disgrace or once renounce the honour of my race                 590 for know sir knight of gentle blood i came i loathe a whore and startle at the name but jealous men on their own crimes reflect and learn from thence their ladies to suspect else why these heedless cautions sir to me these doubts and fears of female constancy this chime still rings in every ladys ear the only strain a wife must hope to hear  thus while she spoke a sidelong glance she cast where damian kneeling worshippd as she passd       600 she saw him watch the motions of her eye and singled out a peartree planted nigh twas charged with fruit that made a goodly show and hung with dangling pears was every bough thither th obsequious squire addressd his pace and climbing in the summit took his place the knight and lady walkd beneath in view where let us leave them and our tale pursue  twas now the season when the glorious sun his heavenly progress through the twins had run        610 and jove exalted his mild influence yields to glad the glebe and paint the flowery fields clear was the day and phoebus rising bright had streakd the azure firmament with light he pierced the glittering clouds with golden streams and warmd the womb of earth with genial beams  it so befell in that fair morning tide the fairies sported on the garden side and in the midst their monarch and his bride so featly trippd the lightfoot ladies round          620 the knights so nimbly oer the greensward bound that scarce they bent the flowers or touchd the ground the dances ended all the fairy train for pinks and daisies searchd the flowery plain while on a bank reclined of rising green thus with a frown the king bespoke his queen  tis too apparent argue what you can the treachery you women use to man a thousand authors have this truth made out and sad experience leaves no room for doubt            630  heaven rest thy spirit noble solomon a wiser monarch never saw the sun all wealth all honours the supreme degree of earthly bliss was well bestowd on thee for sagely hast thou said of all mankind one only just and righteous hope to find but shouldst thou search the spacious world around yet one good woman is not to be found  thus says the king who knew your wickedness the son of sirach testifies no less                    640 so may some wildfire on your bodies fall or some devouring plague consume you all as well you view the lecher in the tree and well this honourable knight you see but since hes blind and old a helpless case his squire shall cuckold him before your face  now by my own dread majesty i swear and by this awful sceptre which i bear no impious wretch shall scape unpunishd long that in my presence offers such a wrong                650 i will this instant undeceive the knight and in the very act restore his sight and set the strumpet here in open view a warning to these ladies and to you and all the faithless sex for ever to be true  and will you so replied the queen indeed now by my mothers soul it is decreed she shall not want an answer at her need for her and for her daughters ill engage and all the sex in each succeeding age                 660 art shall be theirs to varnish an offence and fortify their crimes with confidence nay were they taken in a strict embrace seen with both eyes and piniond on the place all they shall need is to protest and swear breathe a soft sigh and drop a tender tear till their wise husbands gulld by arts like these grow gentle tractable and tame as geese  what though this slanderous jew this solomon calld women fools and knew full many a one           670 the wiser wits of later times declare how constant chaste and virtuous women are witness the martyrs who resignd their breath serene in torments unconcernd in death and witness next what roman authors tell how arria portia and lucretia fell  but since the sacred leaves to all are free and men interpret texts why should not we by this no more was meant than to have shown that sovereign goodness dwells in him alone            680 who only is and is but only one but grant the worst shall women then be weighd by every word that solomon hath said what though this king as ancient story boasts built a fair temple to the lord of hosts he ceased at last his maker to adore and did as much for idol gods or more beware what lavish praises you confer on a rank lecher and idolater whose reign indulgent god says holy writ              690 did but for davids righteous sake permit david the monarch after heavens own mind who loved our sex and honourd all our kind  well im a woman and as such must speak silence would swell me and my heart would break know then i scorn your dull authorities your idle wits and all their learned lies by heaven those authors are our sexs foes whom in our right i must and will oppose  nay quoth the king dear madam be not wroth       700 i yield it up but since i gave my oath that this muchinjured knight again should see it must be donei am a king said he and one whose faith has ever sacred been  and so has mine she saidi am a queen her answer she shall have i undertake and thus an end of all dispute i make try when you list and you shall find my lord it is not in our sex to break our word  we leave them here in this heroic strain               710 and to the knight our story turns again who in the garden with his lovely may sung merrier than the cuckoo or the jay this was his song oh kind and constant be constant and kind ill ever prove to thee  thus singing as he went at last he drew by easy steps to where the peartree grew the longing dame lookd up and spied her love full fairly perchd among the boughs above she stoppd and sighing o good gods she cried     720 what pangs what sudden shoots distend my side oh for that tempting fruit so fresh so green help for the love of heavens immortal queen help dearest lord and save at once the life of thy poor infant and thy longing wife  sore sighd the knight to hear his ladys cry but could not climb and had no servant nigh old as he was and void of eyesight too what could alas a helpless husband do and must i languish then she said and die        730 yet view the lovely fruit before my eye at least kind sir for charitys sweet sake vouchsafe the trunk between your arms to take then from your back i might ascend the tree do you but stoop and leave the rest to me  with all my soul he thus replied again id spend my dearest blood to ease thy pain with that his back against the trunk he bent she seized a twig and up the tree she went  now prove your patience gentle ladies all             740 nor let on me your heavy anger fall tis truth i tell though not in phrase refined though blunt my tale yet honest is my mind what feats the lady in the tree might do i pass as gambols never known to you but sure it was a merrier fit she swore than in her life she ever felt before  in that nice moment lo the wondering knight lookd out and stood restored to sudden sight straight on the tree his eager eyes he bent            750 as one whose thoughts were on his spouse intent but when he saw his bosomwife so dressd his rage was such as cannot be expressd not frantic mothers when their infants die with louder clamours rend the vaulted sky he cried he roard he stormd he tore his hair death hell and furies what dost thou do there  what ails my lord the trembling dame replied i thought your patience had been better tried is this your love ungrateful and unkind               760 this my reward for having cured the blind why was i taught to make my husband see by struggling with a man upon a tree did i for this the power of magic prove unhappy wife whose crime was too much love  if this be struggling by this holy light tis struggling with a vengeance quoth the knight so heaven preserve the sight it has restored as with these eyes i plainly saw thee whored whored by my slaveperfidious wretch may hell         770 as surely seize thee as i saw too well  guard me good angels cried the gentle may pray heaven this magic work the proper way alas my love tis certain could you see you neer had used these killing words to me so help me fates as tis no perfect sight but some faint glimmering of a doubtful light  what i have said quoth he i must maintain for by th immortal powers it seemd too plain  by all those powers some frenzy seized your mind      780 replied the dame are these the thanks i find wretch that i am that eer i was so kind she said a rising sigh expressd her woe the ready tears apace began to flow and as they fell she wiped from either eye the drops for women when they list can cry  the knight was touchd and in his looks appeard signs of remorse while thus his spouse he cheerd madam tis past and my short anger oer come down and vex your tender heart no more           790 excuse me dear if aught amiss was said for on my soul amends shall soon be made let my repentance your forgiveness draw by heaven i swore but what i thought i saw  ah my loved lord twas much unkind she cried on bare suspicion thus to treat your bride but till your sights establishd for a while imperfect objects may your sense beguile thus when from sleep we first our eyes display the balls are wounded with the piercing ray            800 and dusky vapours rise and intercept the day so just recovering from the shades of night your swimming eyes are drunk with sudden light strange phantoms dance around and skim before your sight then sir be cautious nor too rashly deem heaven knows how seldom things are what they seem consult your reason and you soon shall find twas you were jealous not your wife unkind jove neer spoke oracle more true than this none judge so wrong as those who think amiss          810  with that she leapd into her lords embrace with welldissembled virtue in her face he huggd her close and kissd her oer and oer disturbd with doubts and jealousies no more both pleased and blessd renewd their mutual vows a fruitful wife and a believing spouse  thus ends our tale whose moral next to make let all wise husbands hence example take and pray to crown the pleasure of their lives to be so well deluded by their wives                   820     the wife of bath her prologue  from chaucer  behold the woes of matrimonial life and hear with reverence an experienced wife to dearbought wisdom give the credit due and think for once a woman tells you true in all these trials i have borne a part i was myself the scourge that caused the smart for since fifteen in triumph have i led five captive husbands from the church to bed  christ saw a wedding once the scripture says and saw but one tis thought in all his days          10 whence some infer whose conscience is too nice no pious christian ought to marry twice  but let them read and solve me if they can the words addressd to the samaritan five times in lawful wedlock she was joind and sure the certain stint was neer defined  increase and multiply was heavens command and thats a text i clearly understand this too let men their sires and mothers leave and to their dearer wives for ever cleave

take which we like the counsel or our will  i envy not their bliss if he or she think fit to live in perfect chastity pure let them be and free from taint or vice i for a few slight spots am not so nice heaven calls us different ways on these bestows         40 one proper gift another grants to those not every mans obliged to sell his store and give up all his substance to the poor such as are perfect may i cant deny but by your leaves divines so am not i  full many a saint since first the world began lived an unspotted maid in spite of man let such a gods name with fine wheat be fed and

once grown sleek will from her corner run sport with her tail and wanton in the sun she licks her fair round face and frisks abroad to show her fur and to be catterwawd  lo thus my friends i wrought to my desires these three right ancient venerable sires i told em thus you say and thus you do              150 and told em false but jenkin swore twas true i like a dog could bite as well as whine and first complaind wheneer the guilt was mine i taxd them oft with wenching and amours when their weak legs scarce draggd them out of doors and swore the rambles that i took by night were all to spy

you how great is the blessing of a prudent wife                190 who puts a period to domestic strife one of us two must rule and one obey and since in man right reason bears the sway let that frail

young husbands in my riper days though past my bloom not yet decayd was i wanton and wild and chatterd like a pie              210 in countrydances still i bore the bell and sung as sweet as evening

but all that score i paidas how youll say not with my body in a filthy way but i so dressd and danced and drank and dined and viewd a friend with eyes so very kind as stung his heart and made his marrow fry with burning rage and frantic jealousy his soul i hope enjoys eternal glory for here on earth i was his purgatory oft when his shoe the most severely wrung he put on careless airs and sat and sung              240 how sore i galld him only heaven could know and he that felt and i that caused the woe he died when last from pilgrimage i came with other gossips from jerusalem and now lies buried underneath a rood fair to be seen and reard of honest wood a tomb indeed with fewer sculptures graced than that mausolus pious widow placed or where enshrined the great darius lay but cost on

everlasting rest full hearty was his love and i can show the tokens on my ribs in black and blue yet with a knack my heart he could have won while yet the smart was shooting in the bone how quaint an appetite in woman reigns free gifts we scorn and love what costs us pains      260 let men avoid us and on them we leap a glutted market makes provisions cheap  in pure goodwill i took this jovial

most he would conceal to these i made no scruple to reveal oft has he blushd from ear to ear for shame that eer he told a secret to his dame  it so befell in holy time of lent that oft a day i to this gossip went my husband thank my stars was out of town from house to house we rambled up and down             280 this clerk myself and my good neighbour alse to see be seen to tell and gather tales visits to every church we daily paid and marchd in every holy masquerade the stations duly and the vigils kept not much we fasted but scarce ever slept at sermons too i shone in scarlet gay the wasting moth neer spoild my best array the cause was this i wore it every day  twas when fresh may her early blossoms yields         290 this clerk and i were walking in the fields we grew so intimate

letter to the publisher  occasioned by the first correct edition of the dunciad   it is with pleasure i hear that you have procured a correct copy of the dunciad which the many surreptitious ones have rendered so necessary and it is yet with more that i am informed it will be attended with a commentary a work so requisite that i cannot think the author himself would have omitted it had he approved of the first appearance of this poem  such notes as have occurred to me i herewith send you you will oblige me by inserting them amongst those which are or will be transmitted to you by others since not only the authors friends but even strangers appear engaged by humanity to take some care of an orphan of so much genius and spirit which its parent seems to have abandoned from the very beginning and suffered to step into the world naked unguarded and unattended  it was upon reading some of the abusive papers lately published that my great regard to a person whose friendship i esteem as one of the chief honours of my life and a much greater respect to truth than to him or any man living engaged me in inquiries of which the enclosed notes are the fruit  i perceived that most of these authors had been doubtless very wisely the first aggressors they had tried till they were weary what was to be got by railing at each other nobody was either concerned or surprised if this or that scribbler was proved a dunce but every one was curious to read what could be said to prove mr pope one and was ready to pay something for such a discovery a stratagem which would they fairly own it might not only reconcile them to me but screen them from the resentment of their lawful superiors whom they daily abuse only as i charitably hope to get that by them which they cannot get from them  i found this was not all ill success in that had transported them to personal abuse either of himself or what i think he could less forgive of his friends they had called men of virtue and honour bad men long before he had either leisure or inclination to call them bad writers and some had been such old offenders that he had quite forgotten their persons as well as their slanders till they were pleased to revive them  now what had mr pope done before to incense them he had published those works which are in the hands of everybody in which not the least mention is made of any of them and what has he done since he has laughed and written the dunciad what has that said of them a very serious truth which the public had said before that they were dull and what it had no sooner said but they themselves were at great pains to procure or even purchase room in the prints to testify under their hands to the truth of it  i should still have been silent if either i had seen any inclination in my friend to be serious with such accusers or if they had only meddled with his writings since whoever publishes puts himself on his trial by his country but when his moral character was attacked and in a manner from which neither truth nor virtue can secure the most innocent in a manner which though it annihilates the credit of the accusation with the just and impartial yet aggravates very much the guilt of the accusers i mean by authors without names then i thought since the danger was common to all the concern ought to be so and that it was an act of justice to detect the authors not only on this account but as many of them are the same who for several years past have made free with the greatest names in church and state exposed to the world the private misfortunes of families abused all even to women and whose prostituted papers for one or other party in the unhappy divisions of their country have insulted the fallen the friendless the exiled and the dead  besides this which i take to be a public concern i have already confessed i had a private one i am one of that number who have long loved and esteemed mr pope and had often declared it was not his capacity or writings which we ever thought the least valuable part of his character but the honest open and beneficent man that we most esteemed and loved in him now if what these people say were believed i must appear to all my friends either a fool or a knave either imposed on myself or imposing on them so that i am as much interested in the confutation of these calumnies as he is himself  i am no author and consequently not to be suspected either of jealousy or resentment against any of the men of whom scarce one is known to me by sight and as for their writings i have sought them on this one occasion in vain in the closets and libraries of all my acquaintance i had still been in the dark if a gentleman had not procured me i suppose from some of themselves for they are generally much more dangerous friends than enemies the passages i send you i solemnly protest i have added nothing to the malice or absurdity of them which it behoves me to declare since the vouchers themselves will be so soon and so irrecoverably lost you may in some measure prevent it by preserving at least their titles and discovering as far as you can depend on the truth of your information the names of the concealed authors  the first objection i have heard made to the poem is that the persons are too obscure for satire the persons themselves rather than allow the objection would forgive the satire and if one could be tempted to afford it a serious answer were not all assassinates popular insurrections the insolence of the rabble without doors and of domestics within most wrongfully chastised if the meanness of offenders indemnified them from punishment on the contrary obscurity renders them more dangerous as less thought of law can pronounce judgment only on open facts morality alone can pass censure on intentions of mischief so that for secret calumny or the arrow flying in the dark there is no public punishment left but what a good writer inflicts  the next objection is that these sort of authors are poor that might be pleaded as an excuse at the old bailey for lesser crimes than defamation for tis the case of almost all who are tried there but sure it can be none for who will pretend that the robbing another of his reputation supplies the want of it in himself i question not but such authors are poor and heartily wish the objection were removed by any honest livelihood but poverty is here the accident not the subject he who describes malice and villany to be pale and meagre expresses not the least anger against paleness or leanness but against malice and villany the apothecary in romeo and juliet is poor but is he therefore justified in vending poison not but poverty itself becomes a just subject of satire when it is the consequence of vice prodigality or neglect of ones lawful calling for then it increases the public burden fills the streets and highways with robbers and the garrets with clippers coiners and weekly journalists  but admitting that two or three of these offend less in their morals than in their writings must poverty make nonsense sacred if so the fame of bad authors would be much better consulted than that of all the good ones in the world and not one of a hundred had ever been called by his right name  they mistake the whole matter it is not charity to encourage them in the way they follow but to get them out of it for men are not bunglers because they are poor but they are poor because they are bunglers  is it not pleasant enough to hear our authors crying out on the one hand as if their persons and characters were too sacred for satire and the public objecting on the other that they are too mean even for ridicule but whether bread or fame be their end it must be allowed our author by and in this poem has mercifully given them a little of both  there are two or three who by their rank and fortune have no benefit from the former objections supposing them good and these i was sorry to see in such company but if without any provocation two or three gentlemen will fall upon one in an affair wherein his interest and reputation are equally embarked they cannot certainly after they have been content to print themselves his enemies complain of being put into the number of them  others i am told pretend to have been once his friends surely they are their enemies who say so since nothing can be more odious than to treat a friend as they have done but of this i cannot persuade myself when i consider the constant and eternal aversion of all bad writers to a good one  such as claim a merit from being his admirers i would gladly ask if it lays him under a personal obligation at that rate he would be the most obliged humble servant in the world i dare swear for these in particular he never desired them to be his admirers nor promised in return to be theirs that had truly been a sign he was of their acquaintance but would not the malicious world have suspected such an approbation of some motive worse than ignorance in the author of the essay on criticism be it as it will the reasons of their admiration and of his contempt are equally subsisting for his works and theirs are the very same that they were  one therefore of their assertions i believe may be truethat he has a contempt for their writings and there is another which would probably be sooner allowed by himself than by any good judge beside that his own have found too much success with the public but as it cannot consist with his modesty to claim this as justice it lies not on him but entirely on the public to defend its own judgment  there remains what in my opinion might seem a better plea for these people than any they have made use of if obscurity or poverty were to exempt a man from satire much more should folly or dulness which are still more involuntary nay as much so as personal deformity but even this will not help them deformity becomes an object of ridicule when a man sets up for being handsome and so must dulness when he sets up for a wit they are not ridiculed because ridicule in itself is or ought to be a pleasure but because it is just to undeceive and vindicate the honest and unpretending part of mankind from imposition because particular interest ought to yield to general and a great number who are not naturally fools ought never to be made so in complaisance to a few who are accordingly we find that in all ages all vain pretenders were they ever so poor or ever so dull have been constantly the topics of the most candid satirists from the codrus of juvenal to the damon of boileau  having mentioned boileau the greatest poet and most judicious critic of his age and country admirable for his talents and yet perhaps more admirable for his judgment in the proper application of them i cannot help remarking the resemblance betwixt him and our author in qualities fame and fortune in the distinctions shown them by their superiors in the general esteem of their equals and in their extended reputation amongst foreigners in the latter of which ours has met with the better fate as he has had for his translators persons of the most eminent rank and abilities in their respective nations but the resemblance holds in nothing more than in their being equally abused by the ignorant pretenders to poetry of their times of which not the least memory will remain but in their own writings and in the notes made upon them what boileau has done in almost all his poems our author has only in this i dare answer for him he will do it in no more and on this principle of attacking few but who had slandered him he could not have done it at all had he been confined from censuring obscure and worthless persons for scarce any other were his enemies however as the parity is so remarkable i hope it will continue to the last and if ever he shall give us an edition of this poem himself i may see some of them treated as gently on their repentance or better merit as perrault and quinault were at last by boileau  in one point i must be allowed to think the character of our english poet the more amiable he has not been a follower of fortune or success he has lived with the great without flatterybeen a friend to men in power without pensions from whom as he asked so he received no favour but what was done him in his friends as his satires were the more just for being delayed so were his panegyrics bestowed only on such persons as he had familiarly known only for such virtues as he had long observed in them and only at such times as others cease to praise if not begin to calumniate themi mean when out of power or out of fashion a satire therefore on writers so notorious for the contrary practice became no man so well as himself as none it is plain was so little in their friendships or so much in that of those whom they had most abusednamely the greatest and best of all parties let me add a further reason that though engaged in their friendships he never espoused their animosities and can almost singly challenge this honour not to have written a line of any man which through guilt through shame or through fear through variety of fortune or change of interests he was ever unwilling to own  i shall conclude with remarking what a pleasure it must be to every reader of humanity to see all along that our author in his very laughter is not indulging his own illnature but only punishing that of others as to his poem those alone are capable of doing it justice who to use the words of a great writer know how hard it is with regard both to his subject and his manner vetustis dare novitatem obsoletis nitorem obscuris lucem fastiditis gratiami am  your most humble servant  william cleland133 st jamess dec 22 1728    martinus scriblerus his

writers by discouraging the bad nor is it an illnatured thing in relation even to the very persons upon whom the reflections are made it is true it may deprive them a little the sooner of a short

thine own mouth will i judge thee wicked scribbler    testimonies of authors  concerning our poet and his works   m scriblerus lectori s  before we present thee with our exercitations on this most delectable poem drawn from the many volumes of our adversaria on modern authors we shall here according to the laudable usage of editors collect the various judgments of the learned concerning our poet various indeed not only of different authors but of the same author at different seasons nor shall we gather only the testimonies of such eminent wits as would of course descend to posterity and consequently be read without our collection but we shall likewise with incredible labour seek out for divers others which but for this our diligence could never at the distance of a few months appear to the eye of the most curious hereby thou mayst not only receive the delectation of variety but also arrive at a more certain judgment by a grave and circumspect comparison of the witnesses with each other or of each with himself hence also thou wilt be enabled to draw reflections not only of a critical but a moral nature by being let into many particulars of the person as well as genius and of the fortune as well as merit of our author in which if i relate some things of little concern peradventure to thee and some of as little even to him i entreat thee to consider how minutely all true critics and commentators are wont to insist upon such and how material they seem to themselves if to none other forgive me gentle reader if following learned example i ever and anon become tedious allow me to take the same pains to find whether my author were good or bad well or illnatured modest or arrogant as another whether his author was fair or brown short or tall or whether he wore a coat or a cassock  we purposed to begin with his life parentage and education but as to these even his cotemporaries do exceedingly differ one saith134 he was educated at home another135 that he was bred at st omers by jesuits a third136 not at st omers but at oxford a fourth137 that he had no university education at all those who allow him to be bred at home differ as much concerning his tutor one saith138 he was kept by his father on purpose a second139 that he was an itinerant priest a third140 that he was a parson one141 calleth him a secular clergyman of the church of rome another142 a monk as little do they agree about his father whom one143 supposeth like the father of hesiod a tradesman or merchant another144 a husbandman another145 a hatter c nor has an author been wanting to give our poet such a father as apuleius hath to plato jamblichus to pythagoras and divers to homer namely a demon for thus mr gildon146 certain it is that his original is not from adam but the devil and that he wanteth nothing but horns and tail to be the exact resemblance of his infernal father finding therefore such contrariety of opinions and whatever be ours of this sort of generation not being fond to enter into controversy we shall defer writing the life of our poet till authors can determine among themselves what parents or education he had or whether he had any education or parents at all  proceed we to what is more certain his works though not less uncertain the judgments concerning them beginning with his essay on criticism of which hear first the most ancient of critics  mr john dennis  his precepts are false or trivial or both his thoughts are crude and abortive his expressions absurd his numbers harsh and unmusical his rhymes trivial and commoninstead of majesty we have something that is very mean instead of gravity something that is very boyish and instead of perspicuity and lucid order we have but too often obscurity and confusion and in another place what rare numbers are here would not one swear that this youngster had espoused some antiquated muse who had sued out a divorce from some superannuated sinner upon account of impotence and who being poxed by her former spouse has got the gout in her decrepid age which makes her hobble so damnably147  no less peremptory is the censure of our hypercritical historian  mr oldmixon  i dare not say anything of the essay on criticism in verse but if any more curious reader has discovered in it something new which is not in drydens prefaces dedications and his essay on dramatic poetry not to mention the french critics i should be very glad to have the benefit of the discovery148  he is followed as in fame so in judgment by the modest and simpleminded  mr leonard welsted  who out of great respect to our poet not naming him doth yet glance at his essay together with the duke of buckinghams and the criticisms of dryden and of horace which he more openly taxeth as to the numerous treatises essays arts c both in verse and prose that have been written by the moderns on this groundwork they do but hackney the same thoughts over again making them still more trite most of their pieces are nothing but a pert insipid heap of commonplace horace has even in his art of poetry thrown out several things which plainly shew he thought an art of poetry was of no use even while he was writing one149  to all which great authorities we can only oppose that of  mr addison  the art of criticism saith he which was published some months since is a masterpiece in its kind the observations follow one another like those in horaces art of poetry without that methodical regularity which would have been requisite in a prose writer they are some of them uncommon but such as the reader must assent to when he sees them explained with that ease and perspicuity in which they are delivered as for those which are the most known and the most received they are placed in so beautiful a light and illustrated with such apt allusions that they have in them all the graces of novelty and make the reader who was before acquainted with them still more convinced of their truth and solidity and here give me leave to mention what monsieur boileau has so well enlarged upon in the preface to his worksthat wit and fine writing doth not consist so much in advancing things that are new as in giving things that are known an agreeable turn it is impossible for us who live in the latter ages of the world to make observations in criticism morality or any art or science which have not been touched upon by others we have little else left us but to represent the common sense of mankind in more strong more beautiful or more uncommon lights if a reader examines horaces art of poetry he will find but few precepts in it which he may not meet with in aristotle and which were not commonly known by all the poets of the augustan age his way of expressing and applying them not his invention of them is what we are chiefly to admire  longinus in his reflections has given us the same kind of sublime which he observes in the several passages that occasioned them i cannot but take notice that our english author has after the same manner exemplified several of the precepts in the very precepts themselves he then produces some instances of a particular beauty in the numbers and concludes with saying that there are three poems in our tongue of the same nature and each a masterpiece in its kindthe essay on translated verse the essay on the art of poetry and the essay on criticism150  of windsor forest positive is the judgment of the affirmative  mr john dennis  that it is a wretched rhapsody impudently writ in emulation of the coopers hill of sir john denham151 the author of it is obscure is ambiguous is affected is temerarious is barbarous152  but the author of the dispensary  dr garth  in the preface to his poem of claremont differs from this opinion those who have seen these two excellent poems of coopers hill and windsor forestthe one written by sir john denham the other by mr popewill shew a great deal of candour if they approve of this  of the epistle of eloisa we are told by the obscure writer of a poem called sawney that because priors henry and emma charmed the finest tastes our author writ his eloise in opposition to it but forgot innocence and virtue if you take away her tender thoughts and her fierce desires all the rest is of no value in which methinks his judgment resembleth that of a french tailor on a villa and gardens by the thames all this is very fine but take away the river and it is good for nothing  but very contrary hereunto was the opinion of  mr prior  himself saying in his alma  o abelard illfated youth thy tale will justify this truth but well i weet thy cruel wrong adorns a nobler poets song dan pope for thy misfortune grieved with kind concern and skill has weaved a silken web and neer shall fade its colours gently has he laid the mantle oer thy sad distress and venus shall the texture bless153 c  come we now to his translation of the iliad celebrated by numerous pens yet shall it suffice to mention the indefatigable  sir richard blackmore kt  who though otherwise a severe censurer of our author yet styleth this a laudable translation154 that ready writer  mr oldmixon  in his forementioned essay frequently commends the same and the painful  mr lewis theobald  thus extols it the spirit of homer breathes all through this translationi am in doubt whether i should most admire the justness to the original or the force and beauty of the language or the sounding variety of the numbers but when i find all these meet it puts me in mind of what the poet says of one of his heroes that he alone raised and flung with ease a weighty stone that two common men could not lift from the ground just so one single person has performed in this translation what i once despaired to have seen done by the force of several masterly hands155 indeed the same gentleman appears to have changed his sentiment in his essay on the art of sinking in reputation printed in mists journal march 30 1728 where he says thusin order to sink in reputation let him take into his head to descend into homer let the world wonder as it will how the devil he got there and pretend to do him into english so his version denote his neglect of the manner how strange variation we are told in  mists journal june 8  that this translation of the iliad was not in all respects conformable to the fine taste of his friend mr addison insomuch that he employed a younger muse in an undertaking of this kind which he supervised himself whether mr addison did find it conformable to his taste or not best appears from his own testimony the year following its publication in these words  mr addison freeholder no 40  when i consider myself as a british freeholder i am in a particular manner pleased with the labours of those who have improved our language with the translations of old greek and latin authorswe have already most of their historians in our own tongue and what is more for the honour of our language it has been taught to express with elegance the greatest of their poets in each nation the illiterate among our own countrymen may learn to judge from drydens virgil of the most perfect epic performance and those parts of homer which have been published already by mr pope give us reason to think that the iliad will appear in english with as little disadvantage to that immortal poem  as to the rest there is a slight mistake for this younger muse was an elder nor was the gentleman who is a friend of our author employed by mr addison to translate it after him since he saith himself that he did it before156 contrariwise that mr addison engaged our author in this work appeareth by declaration thereof in the preface to the iliad printed some time before his death and by his own letters of october 26 and november 2 1713 where he declares it his opinion that no other person was equal to it  next comes his shakspeare on the stage let him quoth one whom i take to be  mr theobald mists journal june 8 1728  publish such an author as he has least studied and forget to discharge even the dull duty of an editor in this project let him lend the bookseller his name for a competent sum of money to promote the credit of an exorbitant subscription gentle reader be pleased to cast thine eye on the proposal below quoted and on what follows some months after the former assertion in the same journalist of june 8 the bookseller proposed the book by subscription and raised some thousands of pounds for the same i believe the gentleman did not share in the profits of this extravagant subscription  after the iliad he undertook saith  mists journal june 8 1728  the sequel of that work the odyssey and having secured the success by a numerous subscription he employed some underlings to perform what according to his proposals should come from his own hands to which heavy charge we can in truth oppose nothing but the words of  mr popes proposal for the odyssey printed by j watts jan 10 1724  i take this occasion to declare that the subscription for shakspeare belongs wholly to mr tonson and that the benefit of this proposal is not solely for my own use but for that of two of my friends who have assisted me in this work but these very gentlemen are extolled above our poet himself in another of mists journals march 30 1728 saying that he would not advise mr pope to try the experiment again of getting a great part of a book done by assistants lest those extraneous parts should unhappily ascend to the sublime and retard the declension of the whole behold these underlings are become good writers  if any say that before the said proposals were printed the subscription was begun without declaration of such assistance verily those who set it on foot or as their term is secured it to wit the right honourable the lord viscount harcourt were he living would testify and the right honourable the lord bathurst now living doth testify the same is a falsehood  sorry i am that persons professing to be learned or of whatever rank of authors should either falsely tax or be falsely taxed yet let us who are only reporters be impartial in our citations and proceed  mists journal june 8 1728  mr addison raised this author from obscurity obtained him the acquaintance and friendship of the whole body of our nobility and transferred his powerful interests with those great men to this rising bard who frequently levied by that means unusual contributions on the public which surely cannot be if as the author of the dunciad dissected reporteth mr wycherley had before introduced him into a familiar acquaintance with the greatest peers and brightest wits then living  no sooner saith the same journalist was his body lifeless but this author reviving his resentment libelled the memory of his departed friend and what was still more heinous made the scandal public grievous the accusation unknown the accuser the person accused no witness in his own cause the person in whose regard accused dead but if there be living any one nobleman whose friendship yea any one gentleman whose subscription mr addison procured to our author let him stand forth that truth may appear amicus plato amicus socrates sed magis amica veritas in verity the whole story of the libel is a lie witness those persons of integrity who several years before mr addisons decease did see and approve of the said verses in nowise a libel but a friendly rebuke sent privately in our authors own hand to mr addison himself and never made public till after their own journals and curll had printed the same one name alone which i am here authorised to declare will sufficiently evince this truth that of the eight honourable the earl of burlington  next is he taxed with a crime in the opinion of some authors i doubt more heinous than any in morality to wit plagiarism from the inventive and quaintconceited  james moore smith gent  upon reading the third volume of popes miscellanies i found five lines which i thought excellent and happening to praise them a gentleman produced a modern comedy the rival modes published last year where were the same verses to a tittle these gentlemen are undoubtedly the first plagiaries that pretend to make a reputation by stealing from a mans works in his own lifetime and out of a public print157 let us join to this what is written by the author of the rival modes the said mr james moore smith in a letter to our author himself who had informed him a month before that play was acted jan 27 17267 that these verses which he had before given him leave to insert in it would be known for his some copies being got abroad he desires nevertheless that since the lines had been read in his comedy to several mr p would not deprive it of them c surely if we add the testimonies of the lord bolingbroke of the lady to whom the said verses were originally addressed of hugh bethel esq and others who knew them as our authors long before the said gentleman composed his play it is hoped the ingenuous that affect not error will rectify their opinion by the suffrage of so honourable personages  and yet followeth another charge insinuating no less than his enmity both to church and state which could come from no other informer than the said  mr james moore smith  the memoirs of a parish clerk was a very dull and unjust abuse of a person who wrote in defence of our religion and constitution and who has been dead many years158 this seemeth also most untrue it being known to divers that these memoirs were written at the seat of the lord harcourt in oxfordshire before that excellent person bishop burnets death and many years before the appearance of that history of which they are pretended to be an abuse most true it is that mr moore had such a design and was himself the man who pressed dr arbuthnot and mr pope to assist him therein and that he borrowed those memoirs of our author when that history came forth with intent to turn them to such abuse but being able to obtain from our author but one single hint and either changing his mind or having more mind than ability he contented himself to keep the said memoirs and read them as his own to all his acquaintance a noble person there is into whose company mr pope once chanced to introduce him who well remembereth the conversation of mr moore to have turned upon the contempt he had for the work of that reverend prelate and how full he was of a design he declared himself to have of exposing it this noble person is the earl of peterborough  here in truth should we crave pardon of all the foresaid right honourable and worthy personages for having mentioned them in the same page with such weekly riffraff railers and rhymers but that we had their everhonoured commands for the same and that they are introduced not as witnesses in the controversy but as witnesses that cannot be controverted not to dispute but to decide  certain it is that dividing our writers into two classes of such who were acquaintance and of such who were strangers to our author the former are those who speak well and the other those who speak evil of him of the first class the most noble  john duke of buckingham  sums up his character in these lines  and yet so wondrous so sublime a thing as the great iliad scarce could make me sing unless i justly could at once commend a good companion and as firm a friend one moral or a mere wellnatured deed can all desert in sciences exceed159  so also is he deciphered by the honourable  simon harcourt  say wondrous youth what column wilt thou choose what laurelld arch for thy triumphant muse though each great ancient court thee to his shrine though every laurel through the dome be thine go to the good and just an awful train thy souls delight160  recorded in like manner for his virtuous disposition and gentle bearing by the ingenious  mr walter hart  in this apostrophe  oh ever worthy ever crownd with praise blessd in thy life and blessd in all thy lays add that the sisters every thought refine and even thy life be faultless as thy line yet envy still with fiercer rage pursues obscures the virtue and defames the muse a soul like thine in pain in grief resignd views with just scorn the malice of mankind161  the witty and moral satirist  dr edward young  wishing some check to the corruption and evil manners of the times calleth out upon our poet to undertake a task so worthy of his virtue  why slumbers pope who leads the muses train nor hears that virtue which he loves complain162  mr mallet  in his epistle on verbal criticism  whose life severely scannd transcends his lays for wit supreme is but his second praise  mr hammond  that delicate and correct imitator of tibullus in his love elegies elegy xiv  now fired by pope and virtue leave the age in low pursuit of selfundoing wrong and trace the author through his moral page whose blameless life still answers to his song  mr thomson  in his elegant and philosophical poem of the seasons  although not sweeter his own homer sings yet is his life the more endearing song  to the same tune also singeth that learned clerk of suffolk  mr william broome  thus nobly rising in fair virtues cause from thy own life transcribe the unerring laws163  and to close all hear the reverend dean of st patricks  a soul with every virtue fraught by patriots priests and poets taught whose filial piety excels whatever grecian story tells a genius for each business fit whose meanest talent is his wit c  let us now recreate thee by turning to the other side and showing his character drawn by those with whom he never conversed and whose countenances he could not know though turned against him first again commencing with the highvoiced and neverenough quoted  mr john dennis  who in his reflections on the essay on criticism thus describeth him a little affected hypocrite who has nothing in his mouth but candour truth friendship goodnature humanity and magnanimity he is so great a lover of falsehood that whenever he has a mind to calumniate his cotemporaries he brands them with some defect which is just contrary to some good quality for which all their friends and their acquaintance commend them he seems to have a particular pique to people of quality and authors of that rank he must derive his religion from st omers but in the character of mr p and his writings printed by s popping 1716 he saith though he is a professor of the worst religion yet he laughs at it but that nevertheless he is a virulent papist and yet a pillar for the church of england  of both which opinions  mr lewis theobald  seems also to be declaring in mists journal of june 22 1718that if he is not shrewdly abused he made it his practice to cackle to both parties in their own sentiments but as to his pique against people of quality the same journalist doth not agree but saith may 8 1728 he had by some means or other the acquaintance and friendship of the whole body of our nobility  however contradictory this may appear mr dennis and gildon in the character last cited make it all plain by assuring us that he is a creature that reconciles all contradictions he is a beast and a man a whig and a tory a writer at one and the same time of guardians and examiners164 an assertor of liberty and of the dispensing power of kings a jesuitical professor of truth a base and a foul pretender to candour so that upon the whole account we must conclude him either to have been a great hypocrite or a very honest man a terrible imposer upon both parties or very moderate to either  be it as to the judicious reader shall seem good sure it is he is little favoured of certain authors whose wrath is perilous for one declares he ought to have a price set on his head and to be hunted down as a wild beast165 another protests that he does not know what may happen advises him to insure his person says he has bitter enemies and expressly declares it will be well if he escapes with his life166 one desires he would cut his own throat or hang himself167  but pasquin seemed rather inclined it should be done by the government representing him engaged in grievous designs with a lord of parliament then under prosecution168 mr dennis himself hath written to a minister that he is one of the most dangerous persons in this kingdom169 and assureth the public that he is an open and mortal enemy to his country a monster that will one day shew as daring a soul as a mad indian who runs amuck to kill the first christian he meets170 another gives information of treason discovered in his poem171 mr curll boldly supplies an imperfect verse with kings and princesses172 and one matthew concanen yet more impudent publishes at length the two most sacred names in this nation as members of the dunciad173  this is prodigious yet it is almost as strange that in the midst of these invectives his greatest enemies have i know not how borne testimony to some merit in him  mr theobald  in censuring his shakspeare declares he has so great an esteem for mr pope and so high an opinion of his genius and excellencies that notwithstanding he professes a veneration almost rising to idolatry for the writings of this inimitable poet he would be very both even to do him justice at the expense of that other gentlemans character174  mr charles gildon  after having violently attacked him in many pieces at last came to wish from his heart that mr pope would be prevailed upon to give us ovids epistles by his hand for it is certain we see the original of sappho to pliaon with much more life and likeness in his version than in that of sir car scrope and this he adds is the more to be wished because in the english tongue we have scarce anything truly and naturally written upon love175 he also in taxing sir richard blackmore for his heterodox opinions of homer challengeth him to answer what mr pope hath said in his preface to that poet  mr oldmixon  calls him a great master of our tongue declares the purity and perfection of the english language to be found in his homer and saying there are more good verses in drydens virgil than in any other work excepts this of our author only176  the author of a letter to mr cibber  says pope was so good a versifier once that his predecessor mr dryden and his cotemporary mr prior excepted the harmony of his numbers is equal to anybodys and that he had all the merit that a man can have that way177 and  mr thomas cooke  after much blemishing our authors homer crieth out  but in his other works what beauties shine while sweetest music dwells in every line these he admiredon these he stampd his praise and bade them live to brighten future days178  so also one who takes the name of  h stanhope  the maker of certain verses to duncan campbell179 in that poem which is wholly a satire on mr pope confesseth  tis true if finest notes alone could show tuned justly high or regularly low that we should fame to these mere vocals give pope more than we can offer should receive for when some gliding river is his theme his lines run smoother than the smoothest stream c  mists journal june 8 1728  although he says the smooth numbers of the dunciad are all that recommend it nor has it any other merit yet that same paper hath these words the author is allowed to be a perfect master of an easy and elegant versification in all his works we find the most happy turns and natural similes wonderfully short and thick sown  the essay on the dunciad also owns p 25 it is very full of beautiful images but the panegyric which crowns all that can be said on this poem is bestowed by our laureate  mr colley cibber  who grants it to be a better poem of its kind than ever was writ but adds it was a victory over a parcel of poor wretches whom it was almost cowardice to conquera man might as well triumph for having killed so many silly flies that offended him could he have let them alone by this time poor souls they had all been buried in oblivion180 here we see our excellent laureate allows the justice of the satire on every man in it but himself as the great mr dennis did before him  the said  mr dennis and mr gildon  in the most furious of all their works the forecited character p 5 do in concert confess that some men of good understanding value him for his rhymes and p 17 that he has got like mr bayes in the rehearsal that is like mr dryden a notable knack at rhyming and writing smooth verse  of his essay on man numerous were the praises bestowed by his avowed enemies in the imagination that the same was not written by him as it was printed anonymously  thus sang of it even  bezaleel morris  auspicious bard while all admire thy strain all but the selfish ignorant and vain i whom no bribe to servile flattery drew must pay the tribute to thy merit due thy muse sublime significant and clear alike informs the soul and charms the ear c  and  mr leonard welsted  thus wrote181 to the unknown author on the first publication of the said essayi must own after the reception which the vilest and most immoral ribaldry hath lately met with i was surprised to see what i had long despaireda performance deserving the name of a poet such sir is your work it is indeed above all commendation and ought to have been published in an age and country more worthy of it if my testimony be of weight anywhere you are sure to have it in the amplest manner c  thus we see every one of his works hath been extolled by one or other of his most inveterate enemies and to the success of them all they do unanimously give testimony but it is sufficient instar omnium to behold the great critic mr dennis sorely lamenting it even from the essay on criticism to this day of the dunciad a most notorious instance quoth he of the depravity of genius and taste the approbation this essay meets with182 i can safely affirm that i never attacked any of these writings unless they had success infinitely beyond their merit this though an empty has been a popular scribbler the epidemic madness of the times has given him reputation183 if after the cruel treatment so many extraordinary men spencer lord bacon ben jonson milton butler otway and others have received from this country for these last hundred years i should shift the scene and show all that penury changed at once to riot and profuseness and more squandered away upon one object than would have satisfied the greater part of those extraordinary men the reader to whom this one creature should be unknown would fancy him a prodigy of art and nature would believe that all the great qualities of these persons were centred in him alone but if i should venture to assure him that the people of england had made such a choice the reader would either believe me a malicious enemy and slanderer or that the reign of the last queen annes ministry was designed by fate to encourage fools184  but it happens that this our poet never had any place pension or gratuity in any shape from the said glorious queen or any of her ministers all he owed in the whole course of his life to any court was a subscription for his homer of £200 from king george i and £100 from the prince and princess  however lest we imagine our authors success was constant and universal they acquaint us of certain works in a less degree of repute whereof although owned by others yet do they assure us he is the writer of this sort mr dennis185 ascribes to him two farces whose names he does not tell but assures us that there is not one jest in them and an imitation of horace whose title he does not mention but assures us it is much more execrable than all his works186 the daily journal may 11 1728 assures us he is below tom durfey in the drama because as that writer thinks the marriagehater matched and the boarding school are better than the whatdyecallit which is not mr ps but mr gays mr gildon assures us in his new rehearsal p 48 that he was writing a play of the lady jane grey but it afterwards proved to be mr howes we are assured by another he wrote a pamphlet called dr andrew tripe187 which proved to be one dr wagstaffs mr theobald assures us in mist of the 27th april that the treatise of the profound is very dull and that mr pope is the author of it the writer of gulliveriana is of another opinion and says the whole or greatest part of the merit of this treatise must and can only be ascribed to gulliver188 here gentle reader cannot i but smile at the strange blindness and positiveness of men knowing the said treatise to appertain to none other but to me martinus scriblerus we are assured in mist of june 8 that his own plays and farces would better have adorned the dunciad than those of mr theobald for he had neither genius for tragedy nor comedy which whether true or not is not easy to judge inasmuch as he hath attempted neitherunless we will take it for granted with mr cibber that his being once very angry at hearing a friends play abused was an infallible proof the play was his own the said mr cibber thinking it impossible for a man to be much concerned for any but himself now let any man judge saith he by this concern who was the true mother of the child189  but from all that hath been said the discerning reader will collect that it little availed our author to have any candour since when he declared he did not write for others it was not credited as little to have any modesty since when he declined writing in any way himself the presumption of others was imputed to him if he singly enterprised one great work he was taxed of boldness and madness to a prodigy190 if he took assistants in another it was complained of and represented as a great injury to the public191 the loftiest heroics the lowest ballads treatises against the state or church satires on lords and ladies raillery on wits and authors squabbles with booksellers or even full and true accounts of monsters poisons and murders of any hereof was there nothing so good nothing so bad which hath not at one or other season been to him ascribed if it bore no authors name then lay he concealed if it did he fathered it upon that author to be yet better concealed if it resembled any of his styles then was it evident if it did not then disguised he it on set purpose yea even direct oppositions in religion principles and politics have equally been supposed in him inherent surely a most rare and singular character of which let the reader make what he can  doubtless most commentators would hence take occasion to turn all to their authors advantage and from the testimony of his very enemies would affirm that his capacity was boundless as well as his imagination that he was a perfect master of all styles and all arguments and that there was in those times no other writer in any kind of any degree of excellence save he himself but as this is not our own sentiment we shall determine on nothing but leave thee gentle reader to steer thy judgment equally between various opinions and to choose whether thou wilt incline to the testimonies of authors avowed or of authors concealedof those who knew him or of those who knew him not  p                                       martinus scriblerus of the poem  this poem as it celebrateth the most grave and ancient of things chaos night and dulness so is it of the most grave and ancient kind homer saith aristotle was the first who gave the form and saith horace who adapted the measure to heroic poesy but even before this may be rationally presumed from what the ancients have left written was a piece by homer composed of like nature and matter with this of our poet for of epic sort it appeareth to have been yet of matter surely not unpleasant witness what is reported of it by the learned archbishop eustathius in odyss x and accordingly aristotle in his poetic chap iv does further set forth that as the iliad and odyssey gave example to tragedy so did this poem to comedy its first idea  from these authors also it should seem that the hero or chief personage of it was no less obscure and his understanding and sentiments no less quaint and strange if indeed not more so than any of the actors of our poem margites was the name of this personage whom antiquity recordeth to have been dunce the first and surely from what we hear of him not unworthy to be the root of so spreading a tree and so numerous a posterity the poem therefore celebrating him was properly and absolutely a dunciad which though now unhappily lost yet is its nature sufficiently known by the infallible tokens aforesaid and thus it doth appear that the first dunciad was the first epic poem written by homer himself and anterior even to the iliad or odyssey  now forasmuch as our poet had translated those two famous works of homer which are yet left he did conceive it in some sort his duty to imitate that also which was lost and was therefore induced to bestow on it the same form which homers is reported to have had namely that of epic poem with a title also framed after the ancient greek manner to wit that of dunciad  wonderful it is that so few of the moderns have been stimulated to attempt some dunciad since in the opinion of the multitude it might cost less pain and oil than an imitation of the greater epic but possible it is also that on due reflection the maker might find it easier to paint a charlemagne a brute or a godfrey with just pomp and dignity heroic than a margites a codrus or a flecknoe  we shall next declare the occasion and the cause which moved our poet to this particular work he lived in those days when after providence had permitted the invention of printing as a scourge for the sins of the learned paper also became so cheap and printers so numerous that a deluge of authors covered the land whereby not only the peace of the honest unwriting subject was daily molested but unmerciful demands were made of his applause yea of his money by such as would neither earn the one nor deserve the other at the same time the licence of the press was such that it grew dangerous to refuse them either for they would forthwith publish slanders unpunished the authors being anonymous and skulking under the wings of publishers a set of men who never scrupled to vend either calumny or blasphemy as long as the town would call for it  now our author192 living in those times did conceive it an endeavour well worthy an honest satirist to dissuade the dull and punish the wicked the only way that was left in that publicspirited view he laid the plan of this poem as the greatest service he was capable without much hurt or being slain to render his dear country first taking things from their original he considereth the causes creative of such authorsnamely dulness and poverty the one born with them the other contracted by neglect of their proper talents through selfconceit of greater abilities this truth he wrappeth in an allegory193 as the construction of epic poesy requireth and feigns that one of these goddesses had taken up her abode with the other and that they jointly inspired all such writers and such works he proceedeth to show the qualities they bestow on these authors194 and the effects they produce195 then the materials or stock with which they furnish them196 and above all that selfopinion197 which causeth it to seem to themselves vastly greater than it is and is the prime motive of their setting up in this sad and sorry merchandise the great power of these goddesses acting in alliance whereof as the one is the mother of industry so is the other of plodding was to be exemplified in some one great and remarkable action198 and none could be more so than that which our poet hath chosen viz the restoration of the reign of chaos and night by the ministry of dulness their daughter in the removal of her imperial seat from the city to the polite world as the action of the Æneid is the restoration of the empire of troy by the removal of the race from thence to latium but as homer singing only the wrath of achilles yet includes in his poem the whole history of the trojan war in like manner our author hath drawn into this single action the whole history of dulness and her children  a person must next be fixed upon to support this action this phantom in the poets mind must have a name199 he finds it to be  and he becomes of course the hero of the poem  the fable being thus according to the best example one and entire as contained in the proposition the machinery is a continued chain of allegories setting forth the whole power ministry and empire of dulness extended through her subordinate instruments in all her various operations  this is branched into episodes each of which hath its moral apart though all conducive to the main end the crowd assembled in the second book demonstrates the design to be more extensive than to bad poets only and that we may expect other episodes of the patrons encouragers or paymasters of such authors as occasion shall bring them forth and the third book if well considered seemeth to embrace the whole world each of the games relateth to some or other vile class of writers the first concerneth the plagiary to whom he giveth the name of more the second the libellous novelist whom he styleth eliza the third the flattering dedicator the fourth the bawling critic or noisy poet the fifth the dark and dirty partywriter and so of the rest assigning to each some proper name or other such as he could find  as for the characters the public hath already acknowledged how justly they are drawn the manners are so depicted and the sentiments so peculiar to those to whom applied that surely to transfer them to any other or wiser personages would be exceeding difficult and certain it is that every person concerned being consulted apart hath readily owned the resemblance of every portrait his own excepted so mr cibber calls them a parcel of poor wretches so many silly flies but adds our authors wit is remarkably more bare and barren whenever it would fall foul on cibber than upon any other person whatever200  the descriptions are singular the comparisons very quaint the narration various yet of one colour the purity and chastity of diction is so preserved that in the places most suspicious not the words but only the images have been censured and yet are those images no other than have been sanctified by ancient and classical authority though as was the manner of those good times not so curiously wrapped up yea and commented upon by the most grave doctors and approved critics  as it beareth the name of epic it is thereby subjected to such severe indispensable rules as are laid on all neotericsa strict imitation of the ancients insomuch that any deviation accompanied with whatever poetic beauties hath always been censured by the sound critic how exact that imitation hath been in this piece appeareth not only by its general structure but by particular allusions infinite many whereof have escaped both the commentator and poet himself yea divers by his exceeding diligence are so altered and interwoven with the rest that several have already been and more will be by the ignorant abused as altogether and originally his own  in a word the whole poem proveth itself to be the work of our author when his faculties were in full vigour and perfection at that exact time when years have ripened the judgment without diminishing the imagination which by good critics is held to be punctually at forty for at that season it was that virgil finished his georgics and sir richard blackmore at the like age composing his arthurs declared the same to be the very acmè and pitch of life for epic poesythough since he hath altered it to sixty the year in which he published his alfred201 true it is that the talents for criticismnamely smartness quick censure vivacity of remark certainty of asseveration indeed all but acerbityseem rather the gifts of youth than of riper age but it is far otherwise in poetry witness the works of mr rymer and mr dennis who beginning with criticism became afterwards such poets as no age hath paralleled with good reason therefore did our author choose to write his essay on that subject at twenty and reserve for his maturer years this great and wonderful work of the dunciad  p   ricardus aristarchus of the hero of the poem  of the nature of dunciad in general whence derived and on what authority founded as well as of the art and conduct of this our poem in particular the learned and laborious scriblerus hath according to his manner and with tolerable share of judgment dissertated but when he cometh to speak of the person of the hero fitted for such poem in truth he miserably halts and hallucinates for misled by one monsieur bossu a gallic critic he prateth of i cannot tell what phantom of a hero only raised up to support the fable a putrid conceit as if homer and virgil like modern undertakers who first build their house and then seek out for a tenant had contrived the story of a war and a wandering before they once thought either of achilles or Æneas we shall therefore set our good brother and the world also right in this particular by assuring them that in the greater epic the prime intention of the muse is to exalt heroic virtue in order to propagate the love of it among the children of men and consequently that the poets first thought must needs be turned upon a real subject meet for laud and celebration not one whom he is to make but one whom he may find truly illustrious this is the primum mobile of his poetic world whence everything is to receive life and motion for this subject being found he is immediately ordained or rather acknowledged a hero and put upon such action as befitteth the dignity of his character  but the muse ceaseth not here her eagleflight for sometimes satiated with the contemplation of these suns of glory she turneth downward on her wing and darts with joves lightning on the goose and serpent kind for we may apply to the muse in her various moods what an ancient master of wisdom affirmeth of the gods in general si dii non irascuntur impiis et injustis nec pios utique justosque diligunt in rebusenim diversis aut in utramque partem moveri necesse est aut in neutram itaque qui bonos diligit et malos odit et qui malos non odit nec bonos diligit quia et diligere bonos ex odio malorum venit et malos odisse ex bonorum caritate descendit which in our vernacular idiom may be thus interpreted if the gods be not provoked at evil men neither are they delighted with the good and just for contrary objects must either excite contrary affections or no affections at all so that he who loveth good men must at the same time hate the bad and he who hateth not bad men cannot love the good because to love good men proceedeth from an aversion to evil and to hate evil men from a tenderness to the good from this delicacy of the muse arose the little epic more lively and choleric than her elder sister whose bulk and complexion incline her to the phlegmatic and for this some notorious vehicle of vice and folly was sought out to make thereof an example an early instance of which nor could it escape the accurate scriblerus the father of epic poem himself affordeth us from him the practice descended to the greek dramatic poets his offspring who in the composition of their tetralogy or set of four pieces were wont to make the last a satiric tragedy happily one of these ancient dunciads as we may well term it is come down unto us amongst the tragedies of the poet euripides and what doth the reader suppose may be the subject thereof why in truth and it is worthy observation the unequal contention of an old dull debauched buffoon cyclops with the heavendirected favourite of minerva who after having quietly borne all the monsters obscene and impious ribaldry endeth the farce in punishing him with the mark of an indelible brand in his forehead may we not then be excused if for the future we consider the epics of homer virgil and milton together with this our poem as a complete tetralogy in which the last worthily holdeth the place or station of the satiric piece  proceed we therefore in our subject it hath been long and alas for pity still remaineth a question whether the hero of the greater epic should be an honest man or as the french critics express it un honnête homme202 but it never admitted of any doubt but that the hero of the little epic should be just the contrary hence to the advantage of our dunciad we may observe how much juster the moral of that poem must needs be where so important a question is previously decided  but then it is not every knave nor let me add every fool that is a fit subject for a dunciad there must still exist some analogy if not resemblance of qualities between the heroes of the two poems and this in order to admit what neoteric critics call the parody one of the liveliest graces of the little epic thus it being agreed that the constituent qualities of the greater epic hero are wisdom bravery and love from whence springeth heroic virtue it followeth that those of the lesser epic hero should be vanity impudence and debauchery from which happy assemblage resulteth heroic dulness the neverdying subject of this our poem  this being confessed come we now to particulars it is the character of true wisdom to seek its chief support and confidence within itself and to place that support in the resources which proceed from a conscious rectitude of will and are the advantages of vanity when arising to the heroic standard at all short of this selfcomplacence nay are they not in the opinion of the enamoured owner far beyond it let the world will such an one say impute to me what folly or weakness they please but till wisdom can give me something that will make me more heartily happy i am content to be gazed at203 this we see is vanity according to the heroic gauge or measure not that low and ignoble species which pretendeth to virtues we have not but the laudable ambition of being gazed at for glorying in those vices which everybody knows we have the world may ask says he why i make my follies public why not i have passed my time very pleasantly with them204 in short there is no sort of vanity such a hero would scruple but that which might go near to degrade him from his high station in this our dunciadnamely whether it would not be vanity in him to take shame to himself for not being a wise man205  bravery the second attribute of the true hero is courage manifesting itself in every limb while its correspondent virtue in the mock hero is that same courage all collected into the face and as power when drawn together must needs have more force and spirit than when dispersed we generally find this kind of courage in so high and heroic a degree that it insults not only men but gods mezentius is without doubt the bravest character in all the Æneis but how his bravery we know was a high courage of blasphemy and can we say less of this brave mans who having told us that he placed his summum bonum in those follies which he was not content barely to possess but would likewise glory in adds if i am misguided tis natures fault and i follow her206 nor can we be mistaken in making this happy quality a species of courage when we consider those illustrious marks of it which made his face more known as he justly boasteth than most in the kingdom and his language to consist of what we must allow to be the most daring figure of speech that which is taken from the name of god  gentle love the next ingredient in the true heros composition is a mere bird of passage or as shakspeare calls it summerteeming lust and evaporates in the heat of youth doubtless by that refinement it suffers in passing through those certain strainers which our poet somewhere speaketh of but when it is let alone to work upon the lees it acquireth strength by old age and becometh a lasting ornament to the little epic it is true indeed there is one objection to its fitness for such a use for not only the ignorant may think it common but it is admitted to be so even by him who best knoweth its value dont you think argueth he to say only a man has his whore207 ought to go for little or nothing because defendit numerus take the first ten thousand men you meet and i believe you would be no loser if you betted ten to one that every single sinner of them one with another had been guilty of the same frailty208 but here he seemeth not to have done justice to himself the man is sure enough a hero who hath his lady at fourscore how doth his modesty herein lessen the merit of a whole wellspent life not taking to himself the commendation which horace accounted the greatest in a theatrical character of continuing to the very dregs the same he was from the beginning   servetur ad imum qualis ab incepto processerat   but here in justice both to the poet and the hero let us further remark that the calling her his whore implieth she was his own and not his neighbours truly a commendable continence and such as scipio himself must have applauded for how much selfdenial was exerted not to covet his neighbours whore and what disorders must the coveting her have occasioned in that society where according to this political calculator nine in ten of all ages have their concubines  we have now as briefly as we could devise gone through the three constituent qualities of either hero but it is not in any or in all of these that heroism properly or essentially resideth it is a lucky result rather from the collision of these lively qualities against one another thus as from wisdom bravery and love ariseth magnanimity the object of admiration which is the aim of the greater epic so from vanity impudence and debauchery springeth buffoonery the source of ridicule that laughing ornament as he well termeth it209 of the little epic  he is not ashamed god forbid he ever should be ashamed of this character who deemeth that not reason but risibility distinguisheth the human species from the brutal as nature saith this profound philosopher distinguished our species from the mute creation by our risibility her design must have been by that faculty as evidently to raise our happiness as by our os sublime our erected faces to lift the dignity of our form above them210 all this considered how complete a hero must he be as well as how happy a man whose risibility lieth not barely in his muscles as in the common sort but as himself informeth us in his very spirits and whose os sublime is not simply an erect face but a brazen head as should seem by his preferring it to one of iron said to belong to the late king of sweden211  but whatever personal qualities a hero may have the examples of achilles and aeneas show us that all those are of small avail without the constant assistance of the godsfor the subversion and erection of empires have never been adjudged the work of man how greatly soever then we may esteem of his high talents we can hardly conceive his personal prowess alone sufficient to restore the decayed empire of dulness so weighty an achievement must require the particular favour and protection of the greatwho being the natural patrons and supporters of letters as the ancient gods were of troy must first be drawn off and engaged in another interest before the total subversion of them can be accomplished to surmount therefore this last and greatest difficulty we have in this excellent man a professed favourite and intimado of the great and look of what force ancient piety was to draw the gods into the party of aeneas that and much stronger is modern incense to engage the great in the party of dulness  thus have we essayed to portray or shadow out this noble imp of fame but now the impatient reader will be apt to say if so many and various graces go to the making up a hero what mortal shall suffice to bear his character ill hath he read who seeth not in every trace of this picture that individual allaccomplished person in whom these rare virtues and lucky circumstances have agreed to meet and concentre with the strongest lustre and fullest harmony  the good scriblerus indeednay the world itselfmight be imposed on in the late spurious editions by i cant tell what sham hero or phantom but it was not so easy to impose on him whom this egregious error most of all concerned for no sooner had the fourth book laid open the high and swelling scene but he recognised his own heroic acts and when he came to the words  soft on her lap her laureate son reclines  though laureate imply no more than one crowned with laurel as befitteth any associate or consort in empire he loudly resented this indignity to violated majestyindeed not without cause he being there represented as fast asleep so misbeseeming the eye of empire which like that of providence should never doze nor slumber hah saith he fast asleep it seems thats a little too strong pert and dull at least you might have allowed me but as seldom asleep as any fool212 however the injured hero may comfort himself with this reflection that though it be a sleep yet it is not the sleep of death but of immortality here he will live213 at least though not awake and in no worse condition than many an enchanted warrior before him the famous durandarte for instance was like him cast into a long slumber by merlin the british bard and necromancer and his example for submitting to it with a good grace might be of use to our hero for that disastrous knight being sorely pressed or driven to make his answer by several persons of quality only replied with a sighpatience and shuffle the cards214  but now as nothing in this world no not the most sacred or perfect things either of religion or government can escape the sting of envy methinks i already hear these carpers objecting to the clearness of our heros title  it would never say they have been esteemed sufficient to make an hero for the iliad or aeneis that achilles was brave enough to overturn one empire or aeneas pious enough to raise another had they not been goddessborn and princes bred what then did this author mean by erecting a player instead of one of his patrons a person never a hero even on the stage215 to this dignity of colleague in the empire of dulness and achiever of a work that neither old omar attila nor john of leyden could entirely bring to pass  to all this we have as we conceive a sufficient answer from the roman historian fabrum esse suae quemque fortunae that every man is the smith of his own fortune the politic florentine nicholas machiavel goeth still further and affirmeth that a man needeth but to believe himself a hero to be one of the worthiest let him saith he but fancy himself capable of the highest things and he will of course be able to achieve them from this principle it follows that nothing can exceed our heros prowess as nothing ever equalled the greatness of his conceptions hear how he constantly paragons himself at one time to alexander the great and charles xii of sweden for the excess and delicacy of his ambition216 to henry iv of france for honest policy217 to the first brutus for love of liberty218 and to sir robert walpole for good government while in power219 at another time to the godlike socrates for his diversions and amusements220 to horace montaigne and sir william temple for an elegant vanity that maketh them for ever read and admired221 to two lord chancellors for law from whom when confederate against him at the bar he carried away the prize of eloquence222 and to say all in a word to the right reverend the lord bishop of london himself in the art of writing pastoral letters223  nor did his actions fall short of the sublimity of his conceit in his early youth he met the revolution224 face to face in nottingham at a time when his betters contented themselves with following her it was here he got acquainted with old battlearray of whom he hath made so honourable mention in one of his immortal odes but he shone in courts as well as camps he was called up when the nation fell in labour of this revolution225 and was a gossip at her christening with the bishop and the ladies226  as to his birth it is true he pretended no relation either to heathen god or goddess but what is as good he was descended from a maker of both227 and that he did not pass himself on the world for a hero as well by birth as education was his own fault for his lineage he bringeth into his life as an anecdote and is sensible he had it in his power to be thought he was nobodys son at all228 and what is that but coming into the world a hero  but be it the punctilious laws of epic poesy so requiring that a hero of more than mortal birth must needs be had even for this we have a remedy we can easily derive our heros pedigree from a goddess of no small power and authority amongst men and legitimate and install him after the right classical and authentic fashion for like as the ancient sages found a son of mars in a mighty warrior a son of neptune in a skilful seaman a son of phoebus in a harmonious poet so have we here if need be a son of fortune in an artful gamester and who fitter than the offspring of chance to assist in restoring the empire of night and chaos  there is in truth another objection of greater weight namely that this hero still existeth and hath not yet finished his earthly course for if solon said well that no man could be called happy till his death surely much less can any one till then be pronounced a hero this species of men being far more subject than others to the caprices of fortune and humour but to this also we have an answer that will we hope be deemed decisive it cometh from himself who to cut this matter short hath solemnly protested that he will never change or amend  with regard to his vanity he declareth that nothing shall ever part them nature saith he hath amply supplied me in vanitya pleasure which neither the pertness of wit nor the gravity of wisdom will ever persuade me to part with229 our poet had charitably endeavoured to administer a cure to it but he telleth us plainly my superiors perhaps may be mended by him but for my part i own myself incorrigible i look upon my follies as the best part of my fortune230 and with good reason we see to what they have brought him  secondly as to buffoonery is it saith he a time of day for me to leave off these fooleries and set up a new character i can no more put off my follies than my skin i have often tried but they stick too close to me nor am i sure my friends are displeased with them for in this light i afford them frequent matter of mirth c c231 having then so publicly declared himself incorrigible he is become dead in law i mean the law epopoeian and devolveth upon the poet as his property who may take him and deal with him as if he had been dead as long as an old egyptian hero that is to say embowel and embalm him for posterity  nothing therefore we conceive remaineth to hinder his own prophecy of himself from taking immediate effect a rare felicity and what few prophets have had the satisfaction to see alive nor can we conclude better than with that extraordinary one of his which is conceived in these oraculous words my dulness will find somebody to do it right232  tandem phoebus adest morsusque inferre parantem congelat et patulos ut erant indurat hiatus233   by authority  by virtue of the authority in us vested by the act for subjecting poets to the power of a licenser we have revised this piece where finding the style and appellation of king to have been given to a certain pretender pseudopoet or phantom of the name of tibbald and apprehending the same may be deemed in some sort a reflection on majesty or at least an insult on that legal authority which has bestowed on another person the crown of poesy we have ordered the said pretender pseudopoet or phantom utterly to vanish and

invocation as the greater poets are wont when some high and worthy matter is to be sung he shows the goddess coming in her majesty to destroy order and science and to substitute the kingdom of the dull upon earth how she leads captive the sciences and silenceth the muses and what they be who succeed in their stead all her children by a wonderful attraction are drawn about her and bear along with them divers others who promote her empire by connivance weak resistance or discouragement of arts such as halfwits tasteless admirers vain pretenders the flatterers of dunces or the patrons of them all these crowd round her one of them offering to approach her is driven back by a rival but she commends and encourages both the first who speak in form are the geniuses of the schools who assure her of their care to advance her cause by confining youth to words and keeping them out of the way of real knowledge their address and her gracious answer with her charge to them and the universities the universities appear by their proper deputies and assure her that the same method is observed in the progress of education the speech of aristarchus on this subject they are driven off by a band of young gentlemen returned from travel with their tutors one of whom delivers to the goddess in a polite oration an account of the whole conduct and fruits of their travels presenting to her at the same time a young nobleman perfectly accomplished she receives him graciously and indues him with the happy quality of want of shame she sees loitering about her a number of indolent persons abandoning all business and duty and dying with laziness to these approaches the antiquary annius entreating her to make them virtuosos and assign them over to him but mummius another antiquary complaining of his fraudulent proceeding she finds a method to reconcile their difference then enter a troop of people fantastically adorned offering her strange and exotic presents amongst them one stands forth and demands justice on another who had deprived him of one of the greatest curiosities in nature but he justifies himself so well that the goddess gives them both her approbation she recommends to them to find proper employment for the indolents beforementioned in the study of butterflies shells birds nests moss c but with particular caution not to proceed beyond trifles to any useful or extensive views of nature or of the author of nature against the last of these apprehensions she is secured by a hearty address from the minute philosophers and freethinkers one of whom speaks in the name of the rest the youth thus instructed and principled are delivered to her in a body by the hands of silenus and then admitted to taste the cup of the magus her highpriest which causes a total oblivion of all obligations divine civil moral or rational to these her adepts she sends priests attendants and comforters of various kinds confers on them orders and degrees and then dismissing them with a speech confirming to each his privileges and telling what she expects from each concludes with a yawn of extraordinary virtue the progress and effects whereof on all orders of

ipreface  prefixed to the five first imperfect editions of the dunciad in three books printed at dublin and london in octavo and duodecimo 1727  the publisher to the reader  it will be found a true observation though somewhat surprising that when any scandal is vented against a man of the highest distinction and character either in the state or in literature the public in general afford it a most quiet reception and the larger part accept it as favourably as if it were some kindness done to themselves whereas if a known scoundrel or blockhead but chance to be touched upon a whole legion is up in arms and it becomes the common cause of all scribblers booksellers and printers whatsoever  not to search too deeply into the reason hereof i will only observe as a fact that every week for these two months past the town has been persecuted with pamphlets advertisements letters and weekly essays not only against the wit and writings but against the character and person of mr pope and that of all those men who have received pleasure from his works which by modest computation may be about a hundred thousand in these kingdoms of england and ireland not to mention jersey guernsey the orcades those in the new world and foreigners who have translated him into their languages of all this number not a man hath stood up to say one word in his defence  the only exception is the author of the following poem who doubtless had either a better insight into the grounds of this clamour or a better opinion of mr popes integrity joined with a greater personal love for him than any other of his numerous friends and admirers  further that he was in his peculiar intimacy appears from the knowledge he manifests of the most private authors of all the anonymous pieces against him and from his having in this poem attacked no man living who had not before printed or published some scandal against this gentleman  how i came possessed of it is no concern to the reader but it would have been a wrong to him had i detained the publication since those names which are its chief ornaments die off daily so fast as must render it too soon unintelligible if it provoke the author to give us a more perfect edition i have my end  who he is i cannot say and which is a great pity there is certainly nothing in his style and manner of writing which can distinguish or discover him for if it bears any resemblance to that of mr pope tis not improbable but it might be done on purpose with a view to have it pass for his but by the frequency of his allusions to virgil and a laboured not to say affected shortness in imitation of him i should think him more an admirer of the roman poet than of the grecian and in that not of the same taste with his friend  i have been well informed that this work was the labour of full six years of his life and that he wholly retired himself from all the avocations and pleasures of the world to attend diligently to its correction and perfection and six years more he intended to bestow upon it as it should seem by this verse of statius which was cited at the head of his manuscript  oh mihi bissenos multum vigilata per annos duncia  hence also we learn the true title of the poem which with the same certainty as we call that of homer the iliad of virgil the aeneid of camoens the lusiad we may pronounce could have been and can be no other than  the dunciad  it is styled heroic as being doubly so not only with respect to its nature which according to the best rules of the ancients and strictest ideas of the moderns is critically such but also with regard to the heroical disposition and high courage of the writer who dared to stir up such a formidable irritable and implacable race of mortals  there may arise some obscurity in chronology from the names in the poem by the inevitable removal of some authors and insertion of others in their niches for whoever will consider the unity of the whole design will be sensible that the poem was not made for these authors but these authors for the poem i should judge that they were clapped in as they rose fresh and fresh and changed from day to day in like manner as when the old boughs wither we thrust new ones into a chimney  i would not have the reader too much troubled or anxious if he cannot decipher them since when he shall have found them out he will probably know no more of the persons than before  yet we judged it better to preserve them as they are than to change them for fictitious names by which the satire would only be multiplied and applied to many instead of one had the hero for instance been called codrus how many would have affirmed him to have been mr t mr e sir r b c but now all that unjust scandal is saved by calling him by a name which by good luck happens to be that of a real

  iiiadvertisement to the first editionwith notes  in quarto 1729  it will be sufficient to say of this edition that the reader has here a much more correct and complete copy of the dunciad than has hitherto appeared i cannot answer but some mistakes may have slipped into it but a vast number of others will be prevented by the names being now not only set at length but justified by the authorities and reasons given i make no doubt the authors own motive to use real rather than feigned names was his care to preserve the innocent from any false application whereas in the former editions which had no more than the initial letters he was made by keys printed here to hurt the inoffensive and what was worse to abuse his friends by an impression at dublin  the commentary which attends this poem was sent me from several hands and consequently must be unequally written yet will have one advantage over most commentaries that it is not made upon conjectures or at a remote distance of time and the reader cannot but derive one pleasure from the very obscurity of the persons it treats of that it partakes of the nature of a secret which most people love to be let into though the men or the things be ever so inconsiderable or trivial  of the persons it was judged proper to give some account for since it is only in this monument that they must expect to survive and here survive they will as long as the english tongue shall remain such as it was in the reigns of queen anne and king george it seemed but humanity to bestow a word or two upon each just to tell what he was what he writ when he lived and when he died  if a word or two more are added upon the chief offenders it is only as a paper pinned upon the breast to mark the enormities for which they suffered lest the correction only should be remembered and the crime forgotten in some articles it was thought sufficient barely to transcribe from jacob curll and other writers of their own rank who were much better acquainted with them than any of the authors of this comment can pretend to be most of them had drawn each others characters on certain occasions but the few here inserted are all that could be saved from the general destruction of such works  of the part of scriblerus i need say nothing his manner is well enough known and approved by all but those who are too much concerned to be judges  the imitations of the ancients are added to gratify those who either never read or may have forgotten them together with some of the parodies and allusions to the most excellent of the moderns if from the frequency of the former any man think the poem too much a cento our poet will but appear to have done the same thing in jest which boileau did in earnest and upon which vida fracastorius and many of the most eminent latin poets professedly valued themselves   ivadvertisement to the first edition of the fourth book of the dunciad  when printed separately in the year 1742  we apprehend it can be deemed no injury to the author of the three first books of the dunciad that we publish this fourth it was found merely by accident in taking a survey of the library of a late eminent nobleman but in so blotted a condition and in so many detached pieces as plainly showed it to be not only incorrect but unfinished that the author of the three first books had a design to extend and complete his poem in this manner appears from the dissertation prefixed to it where it is said that the design is more extensive and that we may expect other episodes to complete it and from the declaration in the argument to the third book that the accomplishment of the prophecies therein would be the theme hereafter of a greater dunciad but whether or no he be the author of this we declare ourselves ignorant if he be we are no more to be blamed for the publication of it than tucca and varius for that of the last six books of the aeneid though perhaps inferior to the former  if any person be possessed of a more perfect copy of this work or of any other fragments of it and will communicate them to the publisher we shall make the next edition more complete in which we also promise to insert any criticisms that shall be published if at all to the purpose with the names of the authors or any letters sent us though not to the purpose shall yet be printed under the title of epistolae obscurorum virorum which together with some others of the same kind formerly laid by for that end may make no unpleasant addition to the future impressions of this poem   vadvertisement to the complete edition of 1743  i have long had a design of giving some sort of notes on the works of this poet before i had the happiness of his acquaintance i had written a commentary on his essay on man and have since finished another on the essay on criticism there was one already on the dunciad which had met with general approbation but i still thought some additions were wanting of a more serious kind to the humorous notes of scriblerus and even to those written by mr cleland dr arbuthnot and others i had lately the pleasure to pass some months with the author in the country where i prevailed upon him to do what i had long desired and favour me with his explanation of several passages in his works it happened that just at that juncture was published a ridiculous book against him full of personal reflections which furnished him with a lucky opportunity of improving this poem by giving it the only thing it wanteda more considerable hero he was always sensible of its defect in that particular and owned he had let it pass with the hero it had purely for want of a better not entertaining the least expectation that such an one was reserved for this post as has since obtained the laurel but since that had happened he could no longer deny this justice either to him or the dunciad  and yet i will venture to say there was another motive which had still more weight with our author this person was one who from every folly not to say vice of which another would be ashamed has constantly derived a vanity and therefore was the man in the world who would least be hurt by it  w w   viadvertisement printed in the journals 1730  whereas upon occasion of certain pieces relating to the gentlemen of the dunciad some have been willing to suggest as if they looked upon them as an abuse we can do no less than own it is our opinion that to call these gentlemen bad authors is no sort of abuse but a great truth we cannot alter this opinion without some reason but we promise to do it in respect to every person who thinks it an injury to be represented as no wit or poet provided he procures a certificate of his being really such from any three of his companions in the dunciad or from mr dennis singly who is esteemed equal to any three of the number   viia parallel of the characters of mr dryden and mr pope  as drawn by certain of their contemporaries  mr drydenhis politics religion morals  mr dryden is a mere renegado from monarchy poetry and good sense453a true republican son of monarchical church454a republican atheist455 dryden was from the beginning an greek alloprosallos and i doubt not will continue so to the last456  in the poem called absalom and achitophel are notoriously traduced the king the queen the lords and gentlemen not only their honourable persons exposed but the whole nation and its representatives notoriously libelled it is scandalum magnatum yea of majesty itself457  he looks upon gods gospel as a foolish fable like the pope to whom he is a pitiful purveyor458 his very christianity may be questioned459 he ought to expect more severity than other men as he is most unmerciful in his own reflections on others460 with as good a right as his holiness he sets up for poetical infallibility461  mr dryden only a versifier  his whole libel is all bad matter beautified which is all that can be said of it with good metre462 mr drydens genius did not appear in any thing more than his versification and whether he is to be ennobled for that only is a question463  mr drydens virgil  tonson calls it drydens virgil to show that this is not that virgil so admired in the augustaean age but a virgil of another stamp a silly impertinent nonsensical writer464 none but a bavius a maevius or a bathyllus carped at virgil and none but such unthinking vermin admire his translator465 it is true soft and easy lines might become ovids epistles or art of love but virgil who is all great and majestic c requires strength of lines weight of words and closeness of expressionsnot an ambling muse running on carpetground and shod as lightly as a newmarket racer he has numberless faults in his authors meaning and in propriety of expression466  mr dryden understood no greek nor latin  mr dryden was once i have heard at westminster school dr bushby would have whipped him for so childish a paraphrase467 the meanest pedant in england would whip a lubber of twelve for construing so absurdly468 the translator is mad every line betrays his stupidity469 the faults are innumerable and convince me that mr dryden did not or would not understand his author470 this shows how fit mr d may be to translate homer a mistake in a single letter might fall on the printer well enough but greek eichor for greek ichor must be the error of the author nor had he art enough to correct it at the press471 mr dryden writes for the court ladies he writes for the ladies and not for use472  the translator puts in a little burlesque now and then into virgil for a ragout to his cheated subscribers473  mr dryden tricked his subscribers  i wonder that any man who could not but be conscious of his own unfitness for it should go to amuse the learned world with such an undertaking a man ought to value his reputation more than money and not to hope that those who can read for themselves will be imposed upon merely by a partially and unseasonably celebrated name474 poetis quidlibei audendi shall be mr drydens motto though it should extend to picking of pockets475  names bestowed on mr dryden  an apea crafty ape dressed up in a gaudy gownwhips put into an apes paw to play pranks withnone but apish and papish brats will heed him476  an assa camel will take upon him no more burden than is sufficient for his strength but there is another beast that crouches under all477  a frogpoet squab endued with poet maros spirit an ugly croaking kind of vermin which would swell to the bulk of an ox478  a cowarda clinias or a damaetas or a man of mr drydens own courage479  a knavemr dryden has heard of paul the knave of jesus christ and if i mistake not ive read somewhere of john dryden servant to his majesty480  a foolhad he not been such a selfconceited fool481some great poets are positive blockheads482  a thingso little a thing as mr dryden483   mr popehis politics religion morals  mr pope is an open and mortal enemy to his country and the commonwealth of learning484 some call him a popish whig which is directly inconsistent485 pope as a papist must be a tory and highflyer486 he is both a whig and tory487  he hath made it his custom to cackle to more than one party in their own sentiments488  in his miscellanies the persons abused arethe king the queen his late majesty both houses of parliament the privy council the bench of bishops the established church the present ministry c to make sense of some passages they must be construed into royal scandal489  he is a popish rhymester bred up with a contempt of the sacred writings490 his religion allows him to destroy heretics not only with his pen but with fire and sword and such were all those unhappy wits whom he sacrificed to his accursed popish principles491 it deserved vengeance to suggest that mr pope had less infallibility than his namesake at rome492  mr pope only a versifier  the smooth numbers of the dunciad are all that recommend it nor has it any other merit493 it must be owned that he hath got a notable knack of rhyming and writing smooth verse494  mr popes homer  the homer which lintot prints does not talk like homer but like pope and he who translated him one would swear had a hill in tipperary for his parnassus and a puddle in some bog for his hippocrene495 he has no admirers among those that can distinguish discern and judge496 he hath a knack at smooth verse but without either genius or good sense or any tolerable knowledge of english the qualities which distinguish homer are the beauties of his diction and the harmony of his versification but this little author who is so much in vogue has neither sense in his thoughts nor english in his expressions497  mr pope understood no greek  he hath undertaken to translate homer from the greek of which he knows not one word into english of which he understands as little498 i wonder how this gentleman would look should it be discovered that he has not translated ten verses together in any book of homer with justice to the poet and yet he dares reproach his fellowwriters with not understanding greek499 he has stuck so little to his original as to have his knowledge in greek called in question500 i should be glad to know which it is of all homers excellencies which has so delighted the ladies and the gentlemen who judge like ladies501  but he has a notable talent at burlesque his genius slides so naturally into it that he hath burlesqued homer without designing it502  mr pope tricked his subscribers  tis indeed somewhat bold and almost prodigious for a single man to undertake such a work but tis too late to dissuade by demonstrating the madness of the project the subscribers expectations have been raised in proportion to what their pockets have been drained of503 pope has been concerned in jobs and hired out his name to booksellers504  names bestowed on mr pope  an apelet us take the initial letter of his christian name and the initial and final letters of his surname viz a p e and they give you the same idea of an ape as his face505 c  an assit is my duty to pull off the lions skin from this little ass506  a froga squab short gentlemana little creature that like the frog in the fable swells and is angry that it is not allowed to be as big as an ox507  a cowarda lurking waylaying coward508  a knavehe is one whom god and nature have marked for want of common honesty509  a foolgreat fools will be christened by the names of great poets and pope will be called homer510  a thinga little abject thing511     index  of  persons celebrated in

the etymology evidently demands dunce with an e therefore dunceiad with an e that accurate and punctual man of letters the restorer of shakespeare constantly observes the preservation of this very letter e in spelling the name of his beloved author and not like his common careless editors with the omission of one nay sometimes of two es as shakspear which is utterly unpardonable nor is the neglect of a single letter so trivial as to some it may appear the alteration whereof in a learned language is an achievement that brings honour to the critic who advances it and dr bentley will be remembered to posterity for his performances of this sort as long as the world shall have any esteem for the remains of menander and philemontheobald  this is surely a slip in the learned author of the foregoing note there having been since produced by an accurate antiquary an autograph of shakspeare himself whereby it appears that he spelled his own name without the first e and upon this authority it was that those most critical curators of his monument in westminster abbey erased the former wrong reading and restored the true spelling on a new piece of old egyptian granite nor for this only do they deserve our thanks but for exhibiting on the same monument the first specimen of an edition of an author in marble where as may be seen on comparing the tomb with the book in the

the other eye of england is taking care to perpetuate a total new shakspeare at the clarendon pressbentl  it is to be noted that this great critic also has omitted one circumstance which is that the inscription with the name of shakspeare was intended to be placed on the marble scroll to which he points with his hand instead of which it is now placed behind his back and that specimen of an edition is put on the scroll which indeed shakspeare hath great reason to point atanon  though i have as just a value for the letter e as any grammarian living and the same affection for the name of this poem as any critic for that of his author yet cannot it induce me to agree with those who would add yet another e to it and call it the dunceiade which being a french and foreign termination is no way proper to a word entirely english and vernacular one e therefore in this case is right and two es wrong yet upon the whole i shall follow the manuscript and print it without any e at all moved thereto by authority at all times with critics equal if not superior to reason in which method of proceeding i can never enough praise my good friend the exact mr thomas hearne who if any word occur which to him and all mankind is evidently wrong yet keeps he it in the text with due reverence and only remarks in the margin sic ms in like manner we shall not amend this error in the title itself but only note it obiter to evince to the learned that it was not our fault nor any effect of our ignorance or inattentionscriblerus  this poem was written in the year 1726 in the next year an imperfect edition was published at dublin and reprinted at london in twelves another at dublin and another at london in octavo and three others in twelves the same year but there was no perfect edition before that of london in quarto which was attended with notes we are willing to acquaint posterity that this poem was presented to king george the second and his queen by the hands of sir robert walpole on the 12th of march 17289schol vet  it was expressly confessed in the preface to the first edition that this poem was not published by the author himself it was printed originally in a foreign country and what foreign country why one notorious for blunders where finding blanks only instead of proper names these blunderers filled them up at their pleasure  the very hero of the poem hath been mistaken to this hour so that we are obliged to open our notes with a discovery who he really was we learn from the former editor that this piece was presented by the hands of sir robert walpole to king george ii now the author directly tells us his hero is the man                     who brings the smithfield muses to the ear of kings  and it is notorious who was the person on whom this prince conferred the honour of the laurel  it appears as plainly from the apostrophe to the great in the third verse that tibbald could not be the person who was never an author in fashion or caressed by the great whereas this single characteristic is sufficient to point out the true hero who above all other poets of his time was the peculiar delight and chosen companion of the nobility of england and wrote as he himself tells us certain of his works at the earnest desire of persons of quality  lastly the sixth verse affords full proof this poet being the only one who was universally known to have had a son so exactly like him in his poetical theatrical political and moral capacities that it could justly be said of him  still dunce the second reignd like dunce the firstbentl  235 her son who brings c wonderful is the stupidity of all the former critics and commentators on this work it breaks forth at the very first line the author of the critique prefixed to sawney a poem p 5 hath been so dull as to explain the man who brings c not of the hero of the piece but of our poet himself as if he vaunted that kings were to be his readersan honour which though this poem hath had yet knoweth he how to receive it with more modesty  we remit this ignorant to the first lines of the aeneid assuring him that virgil there speaketh not of himself but of aeneas  arma virumque cano

but leave it as we shall in general all such to the reader remarking only that chaos according to hesiods greek theogonia was the progenitor of all the godsscriblerus  240 laborious heavy busy bold c i wonder the learned scriblerus has omitted to advertise the reader at the opening of this poem that dulness here is not to be taken contractedly for mere stupidity but in the enlarged sense of the word for all slowness of apprehension shortness of sight or imperfect sense of things it includes as we see by the poets own words labour industry and some degree of activity and boldnessa ruling principle not inert but turning topsyturvy the understanding and inducing an anarchy or confused state of mind this remark ought to be carried along with the reader throughout the work and without this caution he will be apt to mistake the importance of many of the characters as well as of the design of the poet hence it is that some have complained he chooses too mean a subject and imagined he employs himself like domitian in killing flies whereas those who have the true key will find he sports with nobler quarry and embraces a larger compass or as one saith on a like occasion  will see his

falls tis like the beloved nisus and what homer makes to be the chief of all praises he is favoured of the gods he says but three words and his prayer is heard a goddess conveys it to the seat of jupiter though he loses the prize he gains the victory the great mother herself comforts him she inspires him with expedients she honours him with an immortal present such as achilles receives from
