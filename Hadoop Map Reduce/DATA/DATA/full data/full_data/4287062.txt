4287062	burning daylight   by  jack london     part i    chapter i  it was a quiet night in the shovel  at the bar which ranged along one side of the large chinkedlog room leaned half a dozen men two of whom were discussing the relative merits of sprucetea and limejuice as remedies for scurvy  they argued with an air of depression and with intervals of morose silence the other men scarcely heeded them  in a row against the opposite wall were the gambling games  the craptable was deserted  one lone man was playing at the farotable the rouletteball was not even spinning and the gamekeeper stood by the roaring redhot stove talking with the young darkeyed woman comely of face and figure who was known from juneau to fort yukon as the virgin  three men sat in at studpoker but they played with small chips and without enthusiasm while there were no onlookers  on the floor of the dancingroom which opened out at the rear three couples were waltzing drearily to the strains of a violin and a piano  circle city was not deserted nor was money tight  the miners were in from moseyed creek and the other diggings to the west the summer washing had been good and the mens pouches were heavy with dust and nuggets  the klondike had not yet been discovered nor had the miners of the yukon learned the possibilities of deep digging and woodfiring no work was done in the winter and they made a practice of hibernating in the large camps like circle city during the long arctic night  time was heavy on their hands their pouches were well filled and the only social diversion to be found was in the saloons  yet the shovel was practically deserted and the virgin standing by the stove yawned with uncovered mouth and said to charley bates  if something dont happen soon im gin to bed  whats the matter with the camp anyway  everybody dead  bates did not even trouble to reply but went on moodily rolling a cigarette  dan macdonald pioneer saloonman and gambler on the upper yukon owner and proprietor of the tivoli and all its games wandered forlornly across the great vacant space of floor and joined the two at the stove  anybody dead the virgin asked him  looks like it was the answer  then it must be the whole camp she said with an air of finality and with another yawn  macdonald grinned and nodded and opened his mouth to speak when the front door swung wide and a man appeared in the light  a rush of frost turned to vapor by the heat of the room swirled about him to his knees and poured on across the floor growing thinner and thinner and perishing a dozen feet from the stove taking the wisp broom from its nail inside the door the newcomer brushed the snow from his moccasins and high german socks  he would have appeared a large man had not a huge frenchcanadian stepped up to him from the bar and gripped his hand  hello daylight was his greeting  by gar you good for sore eyes  hello louis when did youall blow in returned the newcomer come up and have a drink and tell us all about bone creek  why doggone youall shake again  wheres that pardner of yours im looking for him  another huge man detached himself from the bar to shake hands olaf henderson and french louis partners together on bone creek were the two largest men in the country and though they were but half a head taller than the newcomer between them he was dwarfed completely  hello olaf youre my meat savvee that said the one called daylight  tomorrows my birthday and im going to put youall on your backsavvee  and you too louis  i can put youall on your back on my birthdaysavvee  come up and drink olaf and ill tell youall about it  the arrival of the newcomer seemed to send a flood of warmth through the place  its burning daylight the virgin cried the first to recognize him as he came into the light  charley bates tight features relaxed at the sight and macdonald went over and joined the three at the bar  with the advent of burning daylight the whole place became suddenly brighter and cheerier the barkeepers were active  voices were raised  somebody laughed  and when the fiddler peering into the front room remarked to the pianist its burning daylight the waltztime perceptibly quickened and the dancers catching the contagion began to whirl about as if they really enjoyed it  it was known to them of old time that nothing languished when burning daylight was around  he turned from the bar and saw the woman by the stove and the eager look of welcome she extended him  hello virgin old girl he called  hello charley  whats the matter with youall  why wear faces like that when coffins cost only three ounces  come up youall and drink  come up you unburied dead and name your poison  come up everybody this is my night and im going to ride it  tomorrow im thirty and then ill be an old man  its the last fling of youth  are youall with me  surge along then  surge along  hold on there davis  he called to the farodealer who had shoved his chair back from the table  im going you one flutter to see whether youall drink with me or weall drink with you  pulling a heavy sack of golddust from his coat pocket he dropped it on the high card  fifty he said  the farodealer slipped two cards  the high card won  he scribbled the amount on a pad and the weigher at the bar balanced fifty dollars worth of dust in the goldscales and poured it into burning daylights sack  the waltz in the back room being finished the three couples followed by the fiddler and the pianist and heading for the bar caught daylights eye  surge along youall he cried  surge along and name it  this is my night and it aint a night that comes frequent  surge up you siwashes and salmoneaters  its my night i tell youall  a blame mangy night charley bates interpolated  youre right my son burning daylight went on gaily  a mangy night but its my night you see  im the mangy old hewolf listen to me howl  and howl he did like a lone gray timber wolf till the virgin thrust her pretty fingers in her ears and shivered  a minute later she was whirled away in his arms to the dancingfloor where along with the other three women and their partners a rollicking virginia reel was soon in progress  men and women danced in moccasins and the place was soon aroar burning daylight the centre of it and the animating spark with quip and jest and rough merriment rousing them out of the slough of despond in which he had found them  the atmosphere of the place changed with his coming  he seemed to fill it with his tremendous vitality  men who entered from the street felt it immediately and in response to their queries the barkeepers nodded at the back room and said comprehensively burning daylights on the tear  and the men who entered remained and kept the barkeepers busy  the gamblers took heart of life and soon the tables were filled the click of chips and whir of the rouletteball rising monotonously and imperiously above the hoarse rumble of mens voices and their oaths and heavy laughs  few men knew elam harnish by any other name than burning daylight the name which had been given him in the early days in the land because of his habit of routing his comrades out of their blankets with the complaint that daylight was burning  of the pioneers in that far arctic wilderness where all men were pioneers he was reckoned among the oldest  men like al mayo and jack mcquestion antedated him but they had entered the land by crossing the rockies from the hudson bay country to the east he however had been the pioneer over the chilcoot and chilcat passes  in the spring of 1883 twelve years before a stripling of eighteen he had crossed over the chilcoot with five comrades  in the fall he had crossed back with one  four had perished by mischance in the bleak uncharted vastness  and for twelve years elam harnish had continued to grope for gold among the shadows of the circle  and no man had groped so obstinately nor so enduringly  he had grown up with the land  he knew no other land  civilization was a dream of some previous life  camps like forty mile and circle city were to him metropolises  and not alone had he grown up with the land for raw as it was he had helped to make it  he had made history and geography and those that followed wrote of his traverses and charted the trails his feet had broken  heroes are seldom given to heroworship but among those of that young land young as he was he was accounted an elder hero  in point of time he was before them  in point of deed he was beyond them  in point of endurance it was acknowledged that he could kill the hardiest of them  furthermore he was accounted a nervy man a square man and a white man  in all lands where life is a hazard lightly played with and lightly flung aside men turn almost automatically to gambling for diversion and relaxation  in the yukon men gambled their lives for gold and those that won gold from the ground gambled for it with one another nor was elam harnish an exception  he was a mans man primarily and the instinct in him to play the game of life was strong  environment had determined what form that game should take  he was born on an iowa farm and his father had emigrated to eastern oregon in which mining country elams boyhood was lived  he had known nothing but hard knocks for big stakes  pluck and endurance counted in the game but the great god chance dealt the cards  honest work for sure but meagre returns did not count  a man played big  he risked everything for everything and anything less than everything meant that he was a loser  so for twelve yukon years elam harnish had been a loser  true on moosehide creek the past summer he had taken out twenty thousand dollars and what was left in the ground was twenty thousand more  but as he himself proclaimed that was no more than getting his ante back  he had anted his life for a dozen years and forty thousand was a small pot for such a stakethe price of a drink and a dance at the tivoli of a winters flutter at circle city and a grubstake for the year to come  the men of the yukon reversed the old maxim till it read hard come easy go  at the end of the reel elam harnish called the house up to drink again  drinks were a dollar apiece gold rated at sixteen dollars an ounce there were thirty in the house that accepted his invitation and between every dance the house was elams guest  this was his night and nobody was to be allowed to pay for anything  not that elam harnish was a drinking man  whiskey meant little to him he was too vital and robust too untroubled in mind and body to incline to the slavery of alcohol  he spent months at a time on trail and river when he drank nothing stronger than coffee while he had gone a year at a time without even coffee but he was gregarious and since the sole social expression of the yukon was the saloon he expressed himself that way  when he was a lad in the mining camps of the west men had always done that  to him it was the proper way for a man to express himself socially  he knew no other way  he was a striking figure of a man despite his garb being similar to that of all the men in the tivoli  softtanned moccasins of moosehide beaded in indian designs covered his feet  his trousers were ordinary overalls his coat was made from a blanket longgauntleted leather mittens lined with wool hung by his side they were connected in the yukon fashion by a leather thong passed around the neck and across the shoulders on his head was a fur cap the earflaps raised and the tyingcords dangling  his face lean and slightly long with the suggestion of hollows under the cheekbones seemed almost indian  the burnt skin and keen dark eyes contributed to this effect though the bronze of the skin and the eyes themselves were essentially those of a white man  he looked older than thirty and yet smoothshaven and without wrinkles he was almost boyish  this impression of age was based on no tangible evidence  it came from the abstracter facts of the man from what he had endured and survived which was far beyond that of ordinary men  he had lived life naked and tensely and something of all this smouldered in his eyes vibrated in his voice and seemed forever awhisper on his lips  the lips themselves were thin and prone to close tightly over the even white teeth  but their harshness was retrieved by the upward curl at the corners of his mouth  this curl gave to him sweetness as the minute puckers at the corners of the eyes gave him laughter  these necessary graces saved him from a nature that was essentially savage and that otherwise would have been cruel and bitter  the nose was lean fullnostrilled and delicate and of a size to fit the face while the high forehead as if to atone for its narrowness was splendidly domed and symmetrical  in line with the indian effect was his hair very straight and very black with a gloss to it that only health could give  burning daylights burning candlelight laughed dan macdonald as an outburst of exclamations and merriment came from the dancers  an he is der boy to do it eh louis said olaf henderson  yes by gar you bet on dat said french louis  dat boy is all gold  and when god almighty washes daylights soul out on the last big slucin day macdonald interrupted why god almightyll have to shovel gravel along with him into the sluiceboxes  dot iss goot olaf henderson muttered regarding the gambler with profound admiration  ver good affirmed french louis  i tink we take a drink on dat one time eh    chapter ii  it was two in the morning when the dancers bent on getting something to eat adjourned the dancing for half an hour  and it was at this moment that jack kearns suggested poker  jack kearns was a big blufffeatured man who along with bettles had made the disastrous attempt to found a post on the headreaches of the koyokuk far inside the arctic circle  after that kearns had fallen back on his posts at forty mile and sixty mile and changed the direction of his ventures by sending out to the states for a small sawmill and a river steamer  the former was even then being sledded across chilcoot pass by indians and dogs and would come down the yukon in the early summer after the icerun  later in the summer when bering sea and the mouth of the yukon cleared of ice the steamer put together at st michaels was to be expected up the river loaded to the guards with supplies  jack kearns suggested poker  french louis dan macdonald and hal campbell who had make a strike on moosehide all three of whom were not dancing because there were not girls enough to go around inclined to the suggestion  they were looking for a fifth man when burning daylight emerged from the rear room the virgin on his arm the train of dancers in his wake  in response to the hail of the pokerplayers he came over to their table in the corner  want you to sit in said campbell  hows your luck  i sure got it tonight burning daylight answered with enthusiasm and at the same time felt the virgin press his arm warningly  she wanted him for the dancing  i sure got my luck with me but id sooner dance  i aint hankerin to take the money away from youall  nobody urged  they took his refusal as final and the virgin was pressing his arm to turn him away in pursuit of the supperseekers when he experienced a change of heart  it was not that he did not want to dance nor that he wanted to hurt her but that insistent pressure on his arm put his free mannature in revolt  the thought in his mind was that he did not want any woman running him  himself a favorite with women nevertheless they did not bulk big with him  they were toys playthings part of the relaxation from the bigger game of life he met women along with the whiskey and gambling and from observation he had found that it was far easier to break away from the drink and the cards than from a woman once the man was properly entangled  he was a slave to himself which was natural in one with a healthy ego but he rebelled in ways either murderous or panicky at being a slave to anybody else  loves sweet servitude was a thing of which he had no comprehension  men he had seen in love impressed him as lunatics and lunacy was a thing he had never considered worth analyzing  but comradeship with men was different from love with women  there was no servitude in comradeship  it was a business proposition a square deal between men who did not pursue each other but who shared the risks of trail and river and mountain in the pursuit of life and treasure  men and women pursued each other and one must needs bend the other to his will or hers  comradeship was different there was no slavery about it and though he a strong man beyond strengths seeming gave far more than he received he gave not something due but in royal largess his gifts of toil or heroic effort falling generously from his hands to pack for days over the galeswept passes or across the mosquitoridden marshes and to pack double the weight his comrade packed did not involve unfairness or compulsion  each did his best that was the business essence of it  some men were stronger than otherstrue but so long as each man did his best it was fair exchange the business spirit was observed and the square deal obtained  but with womenno  women gave little and wanted all  women had apronstrings and were prone to tie them about any man who looked twice in their direction  there was the virgin yawning her head off when he came in and mightily pleased that he asked her to dance  one dance was all very well but because he danced twice and thrice with her and several times more she squeezed his arm when they asked him to sit in at poker  it was the obnoxious apronstring the first of the many compulsions she would exert upon him if he gave in  not that she was not a nice bit of a woman healthy and strapping and good to look upon also a very excellent dancer but that she was a woman with all a womans desire to rope him with her apronstrings and tie him hand and foot for the branding  better poker  besides he liked poker as well as he did dancing  he resisted the pull on his arm by the mere negative mass of him and said  i sort of feel a hankering to give youall a flutter  again came the pull on his arm  she was trying to pass the apronstring around him  for the fraction of an instant he was a savage dominated by the wave of fear and murder that rose up in him for that infinitesimal space of time he was to all purposes a frightened tiger filled with rage and terror at the apprehension of the trap  had he been no more than a savage he would have leapt wildly from the place or else sprung upon her and destroyed her  but in that same instant there stirred in him the generations of discipline by which man had become an inadequate social animal  tact and sympathy strove with him and he smiled with his eyes into the virgins eyes as he said  youall go and get some grub  i aint hungry  and well dance some more by and by  the nights young yet  go to it old girl  he released his arm and thrust her playfully on the shoulder at the same time turning to the pokerplayers  take off the limit and ill go youall  limits the roof said jack kearns  take off the roof  the players glanced at one another and kearns announced the roofs off  elam harnish dropped into the waiting chair started to pull out his goldsack and changed his mind  the virgin pouted a moment then followed in the wake of the other dancers  ill bring you a sandwich daylight she called back over her shoulder  he nodded  she was smiling her forgiveness  he had escaped the apronstring and without hurting her feelings too severely  lets play markers he suggested  chips do everlastingly clutter up the tableif its agreeable to youall  im willing answered hal campbell  let mine run at five hundred  mine too answered harnish while the others stated the values they put on their own markers french louis the most modest issuing his at a hundred dollars each  in alaska at that time there were no rascals and no tinhorn gamblers  games were conducted honestly and men trusted one another a mans word was as good as his gold in the blower  a marker was a flat oblong composition chip worth perhaps a cent  but when a man betted a marker in a game and said it was worth five hundred dollars it was accepted as worth five hundred dollars  whoever won it knew that the man who issued it would redeem it with five hundred dollars worth of dust weighed out on the scales  the markers being of different colors there was no difficulty in identifying the owners also in that early yukon day no one dreamed of playing tablestakes a man was good in a game for all that he possessed no matter where his possessions were or what was their nature  harnish cut and got the deal  at this good augury and while shuffling the deck he called to the barkeepers to set up the drinks for the house  as he dealt the first card to dan macdonald on his left he called out  get down to the ground youall malemutes huskies and siwash purps get down and dig in  tighten up them traces  put your weight into the harness and bust the breastbands  whoopla yow  were off and bound for helen breakfast  and i tell youall clear and plain theres goin to be stiff grades and fast goin tonight before we win to that same lady  and somebodys goin to bumphard  once started it was a quiet game with little or no conversation though all about the players the place was aroar elam harnish had ignited the spark  more and more miners dropped in to the tivoli and remained  when burning daylight went on the tear no man cared to miss it  the dancingfloor was full owing to the shortage of women many of the men tied bandanna handkerchiefs around their arms in token of femininity and danced with other men  all the games were crowded and the voices of the men talking at the long bar and grouped about the stove were accompanied by the steady click of chips and the sharp whir rising and falling of the rouletteball  all the materials of a proper yukon night were at hand and mixing  the luck at the table varied monotonously no big hands being out  as a result high play went on with small hands though no play lasted long  a filled straight belonging to french louis gave him a pot of five thousand against two sets of threes held by campbell and kearns one pot of eight hundred dollars was won by a pair of treys on a showdown  and once harnish called kearns for two thousand dollars on a cold steal  when kearns laid down his hand it showed a bobtail flush while harnishs hand proved that he had had the nerve to call on a pair of tens  but at three in the morning the big combination of hands arrived  it was the moment of moments that men wait weeks for in a poker game the news of it tingled over the tivoli  the onlookers became quiet the men farther away ceased talking and moved over to the table  the players deserted the other games and the dancingfloor was forsaken so that all stood at last fivescore and more in a compact and silent group around the pokertable the high betting had begun before the draw and still the high betting went on with the draw not in sight kearns had dealt and french louis had opened the pot with one markerin his case one hundred dollars  campbell had merely seen it but elam harnish corning next had tossed in five hundred dollars with the remark to macdonald that he was letting him in easy  macdonald glancing again at his hand put in a thousand in markers kearns debating a long time over his hand finally saw  it then cost french louis nine hundred to remain in the game which he contributed after a similar debate  it cost campbell likewise nine hundred to remain and draw cards but to the surprise of all he saw the nine hundred and raised another thousand  youall are on the grade at last harnish remarked as he saw the fifteen hundred and raised a thousand in turn  helen breakfasts sure on top this divide and youall had best look out for bustin harness  me for that same lady accompanied macdonalds markers for two thousand and for an additional thousanddollar raise  it was at this stage that the players sat up and knew beyond peradventure that big hands were out  though their features showed nothing each man was beginning unconsciously to tense each man strove to appear his natural self and each natural self was different  hal campbell affected his customary cautiousness  french louis betrayed interest  macdonald retained his wholesouled benevolence though it seemed to take on a slightly exaggerated tone kearns was coolly dispassionate and noncommittal while elam harnish appeared as quizzical and jocular as ever  eleven thousand dollars were already in the pot and the markers were heaped in a confused pile in the centre of the table  i aint go no more markers kearns remarked plaintively  wed best begin ious  glad youre going to stay was macdonalds cordial response  i aint stayed yet  ive got a thousand in already  hows it stand now  itll cost you three thousand for a look in but nobody will stop you from raising  raisehell  you must think i got a pat like yourself kearns looked at his hand  but ill tell you what ill do mac  ive got a hunch and ill just see that three thousand  he wrote the sum on a slip of paper signed his name and consigned it to the centre of the table  french louis became the focus of all eyes  he fingered his cards nervously for a space  then with a by gar  ah got not one leetle beet hunch he regretfully tossed his hand into the discards  the next moment the hundred and odd pairs of eyes shifted to campbell  i wont hump you jack he said contenting himself with calling the requisite two thousand  the eyes shifted to harnish who scribbled on a piece of paper and shoved it forward  ill just let youall know this aint no sundayschool society of philanthropy he said  i see you jack and i raise you a thousand heres where youall get action on your pat mac  actions what i fatten on and i lift another thousand was macdonalds rejoinder  still got that hunch jack  i still got the hunch  kearns fingered his cards a long time  and ill play it but youve got to know how i stand theres my steamer the bellaworth twenty thousand if shes worth an ounce  theres sixty mile with five thousand in stock on the shelves  and you know i got a sawmill coming in  its at linderman now and the scow is building  am i good  dig in youre sure good was daylights answer  and while were about it i may mention casual that i got twenty thousand in macs safe there and theres twenty thousand more in the ground on moosehide  you know the ground campbell  is they thatall in the dirt  there sure is daylight  how much does it cost now kearns asked  two thousand to see  well sure hump you if youall come in daylight warned him  its an almighty good hunch kearns said adding his slip for two thousand to the growing heap  i can feel her crawlin up and down my back  i aint got a hunch but i got a tolerable likeable hand campbell announced as he slid in his slip but its not a raising hand  mine is daylight paused and wrote  i see that thousand and raise her the same old thousand  the virgin standing behind him then did what a mans best friend was not privileged to do  reaching over daylights shoulder she picked up his hand and read it at the same time shielding the faces of the five cards close to his chest  what she saw were three queens and a pair of eights but nobody guessed what she saw  every players eyes were on her face as she scanned the cards but no sign did she give  her features might have been carved from ice for her expression was precisely the same before during and after  not a muscle quivered nor was there the slightest dilation of a nostril nor the slightest increase of light in the eyes  she laid the hand face down again on the table and slowly the lingering eyes withdrew from her having learned nothing  macdonald smiled benevolently  i see you daylight and i hump this time for two thousand  hows that hunch jack  still acrawling mac  you got me now but that hunch is a ripsnorter persuadin sort of a critter and its my plain duty to ride it  i call for three thousand  and i got another hunch daylights going to call too  he sure is daylight agreed after campbell had thrown up his hand he knows when hes up against it and he plays accordin i see that two thousand and then ill see the draw  in a dead silence save for the low voices of the three players the draw was made  thirtyfour thousand dollars were already in the pot and the play possibly not half over  to the virgins amazement daylight held up his three queens discarding his eights and calling for two cards  and this time not even she dared look at what he had drawn  she knew her limit of control nor did he look  the two new cards lay face down on the table where they had been dealt to him  cards kearns asked of macdonald  got enough was the reply  you can draw if you want to you know kearns warned him  nope thisll do me  kearns himself drew two cards but did not look at them  still harnish let his cards lie  i never bet in the teeth of a pat hand he said slowly looking at the saloonkeeper  youall start her rolling mac  macdonald counted his cards carefully to make double sure it was not a foul hand wrote a sum on a paper slip and slid it into the pot with the simple utterance  five thousand  kearns with every eye upon him looked at his twocard draw counted the other three to dispel any doubt of holding more than five cards and wrote on a betting slip  i see you mac he said and i raise her a little thousand just so as not to keep daylight out  the concentrated gaze shifted to daylight  he likewise examined his draw and counted his five cards  i see that six thousand and i raise her five thousandjust to try and keep you out jack  and i raise you five thousand just to lend a hand at keeping jack out macdonald said in turn  his voice was slightly husky and strained and a nervous twitch in the corner of his mouth followed speech  kearns was pale and those who looked on noted that his hand trembled as he wrote his slip  but his voice was unchanged  i lift her along for five thousand he said  daylight was now the centre  the kerosene lamps above flung high lights from the rash of sweat on his forehead  the bronze of his cheeks was darkened by the accession of blood  his black eyes glittered and his nostrils were distended and eager  they were large nostrils tokening his descent from savage ancestors who had survived by virtue of deep lungs and generous airpassages yet unlike macdonald his voice was firm and customary and unlike kearns his hand did not tremble when he wrote  i call for ten thousand he said  not that im afraid of youall mac  its that hunch of jacks  i hump his hunch for five thousand just the same said macdonald  i had the best hand before the draw and i still guess i got it  mebbe this is a case where a hunch after the draw is bettern the hunch before kearns remarked wherefore duty says lift her jack lift her and so i lift her another five thousand  daylight leaned back in his chair and gazed up at the kerosene lamps while he computed aloud  i was in nine thousand before the draw and i saw and raised eleven thousandthat makes thirty  im only good for ten more  he leaned forward and looked at kearns  so i call that ten thousand  you can raise if you want kearns answered  your dogs are good for five thousand in this game  nary dawg  youall can win my dust and dirt but nary one of my dawgs  i just call  macdonald considered for a long time  no one moved or whispered  not a muscle was relaxed on the part of the onlookers  not the weight of a body shifted from one leg to the other  it was a sacred silence only could be heard the roaring draft of the huge stove and from without muffled by the logwalls the howling of dogs  it was not every night that high stakes were played on the yukon and for that matter this was the highest in the history of the country  the saloonkeeper finally spoke  if anybody else wins theyll have to take a mortgage on the tivoli  the two other players nodded  so i call too  macdonald added his slip for five thousand  not one of them claimed the pot and not one of them called the size of his hand  simultaneously and in silence they faced their cards on the table while a general tiptoeing and craning of necks took place among the onlookers  daylight showed four queens and an ace macdonald four jacks and an ace and kearns four kings and a trey  kearns reached forward with an encircling movement of his arm and drew the pot in to him his arm shaking as he did so  daylight picked the ace from his hand and tossed it over alongside macdonalds ace saying  thats what cheered me along mac  i knowed it was only kings that could beat me and he had them  what did youall have he asked all interest turning to campbell  straight flush of four open at both endsa good drawing hand  you bet you could a made a straight a straight flush or a flush out of it  thats what i thought campbell said sadly  it cost me six thousand before i quit  i wisht youalld drawn daylight laughed  then i wouldnt a caught that fourth queen  now ive got to take billy rawlins mail contract and mush for dyea  whats the size of the killing jack  kearns attempted to count the pot but was too excited  daylight drew it across to him with firm fingers separating and stacking the markers and ious and with clear brain adding the sum  one hundred and twentyseven thousand he announced  youall can sell out now jack and head for home  the winner smiled and nodded but seemed incapable of speech  id shout the drinks macdonald said only the house dont belong to me any more  yes it does kearns replied first wetting his lips with his tongue your notes good for any length of time  but the drinks are on me  name your snakejuice youallthe winner pays daylight called out loudly to all about him at the same time rising from his chair and catching the virgin by the arm  come on for a reel youall dancers the nights young yet and its helen breakfast and the mail contract for me in the morning  here youall rawlins youi hereby do take over that same contract and i start for salt water at nine amsavvee  come on youall  wheres that fiddler    chapter iii  it was daylights night  he was the centre and the head of the revel unquenchably joyous a contagion of fun  he multiplied himself and in so doing multiplied the excitement  no prank he suggested was too wild for his followers and all followed save those that developed into singing imbeciles and fell warbling by the wayside  yet never did trouble intrude  it was known on the yukon that when burning daylight made a night of it wrath and evil were forbidden  on his nights men dared not quarrel  in the younger days such things had happened and then men had known what real wrath was and been manhandled as only burning daylight could manhandle  on his nights men must laugh and be happy or go home  daylight was inexhaustible  in between dances he paid over to kearns the twenty thousand in dust and transferred to him his moosehide claim  likewise he arranged the taking over of billy rawlins mail contract and made his preparations for the start  he despatched a messenger to rout out kama his dogdrivera tananaw indian farwandered from his tribal home in the service of the invading whites  kama entered the tivoli tall lean muscular and furclad the pick of his barbaric race and barbaric still unshaken and unabashed by the revellers that rioted about him while daylight gave his orders um said kama tabling his instructions on his fingers  get um letters from rawlins  load um on sled  grub for selkirkyou think um plenty doggrub stop selkirk  plenty doggrub kama  um bring sled this place nine um clock  bring um snowshoes no bring um tent  mebbe bring um fly  um little

kama muttered with resignation  much cold no care a damn  um ready nine um clock  he turned on his moccasined heel and walked out imperturbable sphinxlike neither giving nor receiving greetings nor looking to right or left  the virgin led daylight away into a corner  look here daylight she said in a low voice youre busted  highern a kite  ive eight thousand in macs safe she began  but daylight interrupted  the apronstring loomed near and he shied like an unbroken colt  it dont matter he said  busted i came into the world busted i go out and ive been busted most of the time since i arrived  come on lets waltz  but listen she urged  my moneys doing nothing  i could lend it to youa grubstake she added hurriedly at sight of the alarm in his face  nobody grubstakes me was the answer  i stake myself and when i make a killing its sure all mine  no thank you old girl  much obliged  ill get my stake by running the mail out and in  daylight she murmured in tender protest  but with a sudden wellassumed ebullition of spirits he drew her toward the dancingfloor and as they swung around and around in a waltz she pondered on the iron heart of the man who held her in his arms and resisted all her wiles  at six the next morning scorching with whiskey yet ever himself he stood at the bar putting every mans hand down  the way of it was that two men faced each other across a corner their right elbows resting on the bar their right hands gripped together while each strove to press the others hand down  man after man came against him but no man put his hand down even olaf henderson and french louis failing despite their hugeness when they contended it was a trick a trained muscular knack he challenged them to another test  look here youall he cried  im going to do two things first weigh my sack and second bet it that after youall have lifted clean from the floor all the sacks of flour youall are able ill put on two more sacks and lift the whole caboodle clean  by gar ah take dat french louis rumbled above the cheers  hold on olaf henderson cried  i ban yust as good as you louis  i yump half that bet  put on the scales daylights sack was found to balance an even four hundred dollars and louis and olaf divided the bet between them fiftypound sacks of flour were brought in from macdonalds cache other men tested their strength first  they straddled on two chairs the flour sacks beneath them on the floor and held together by ropelashings  many of the men were able in this manner to lift four or five hundred pounds while some succeeded with as high as six hundred  then the two giants took a hand tying at seven hundred french louis then added another sack and swung seven hundred and fifty clear  olaf duplicated the performance whereupon both failed to clear eight hundred  again and again they strove their foreheads beaded with sweat their frames crackling with the effort  both were able to shift the weight and to bump it but clear the floor with it they could not  by gar daylight dis tam you mek one beeg meestake french louis said straightening up and stepping down from the chairs only one damn iron man can do dat  one hundred pun moremy frien not ten poun more  the sacks were unlashed but when two sacks were added kearns interfered  only one sack more  two some one cried  two was the bet  they didnt lift that last sack kearns protested  they only lifted seven hundred and fifty  but daylight grandly brushed aside the confusion  whats the good of youall botherin around that way  whats one more sack  if i cant lift three more i sure cant lift two  put em in  he stood upon the chairs squatted and bent his shoulders down till his hands closed on the rope  he shifted his feet slightly tautened his muscles with a tentative pull then relaxed again questing for a perfect adjustment of all the levers of his body  french louis looking on sceptically cried out  pool lak hell daylight  pool lak hell  daylights muscles tautened a second time and this time in earnest until steadily all the energy of his splendid body was applied and quite imperceptibly without jerk or strain the bulky nine hundred pounds rose from the door and swung back and forth pendulum like between his legs  olaf henderson sighed a vast audible sigh  the virgin who had tensed unconsciously till her muscles hurt her relaxed  while french louis murmured reverently  msieu daylight salut  ay am one beeg baby  you are one beeg man  daylight dropped his burden leaped to the floor and headed for the bar  weigh in he cried tossing his sack to the weigher who transferred to it four hundred dollars from the sacks of the two losers  surge up everybody daylight went on  name your snakejuice the winner pays  this is my night he was shouting ten minutes later  im the lone hewolf and ive seen thirty winters  this is my birthday my one day in the year and i can put any man on his back  come on youall  im going to put youall in the snow come on you chechaquos 1 and sourdoughs2 and get your baptism  the rout streamed out of doors all save the barkeepers and the singing bacchuses  some fleeting thought of saving his own dignity entered macdonalds head for he approached daylight with outstretched hand  what  you first daylight laughed clasping the others hand as if in greeting  no no the other hurriedly disclaimed  just congratulations on your birthday  of course you can put me in the snow  what chance have i against a man that lifts nine hundred pounds  macdonald weighed one hundred and eighty pounds and daylight had him gripped solely by his hand yet by a sheer abrupt jerk he took the saloonkeeper off his feet and flung him face downward in the snow  in quick succession seizing the men nearest him he threw half a dozen more  resistance was useless  they flew helterskelter out of his grips landing in all manner of attitudes grotesquely and harmlessly in the soft snow  it soon became difficult in the dim starlight to distinguish between those thrown and those waiting their turn and he began feeling their backs and shoulders determining their status by whether or not he found them powdered with snow  baptized yet became his stereotyped question as he reached out his terrible hands  several score lay down in the snow in a long row while many others knelt in mock humility scooping snow upon their heads and claiming the rite accomplished  but a group of five stood upright backwoodsmen and frontiersmen they eager to contest any mans birthday  graduates of the hardest of manhandling schools veterans of multitudes of roughandtumble battles men of blood and sweat and endurance they nevertheless lacked one thing that daylight possessed in high degreenamely an almost perfect brain and muscular coordination  it was simple in its way and no virtue of his  he had been born with this endowment  his nerves carried messages more quickly than theirs his mental processes culminating in acts of will were quicker than theirs his muscles themselves by some immediacy of chemistry obeyed the messages of his will quicker than theirs  he was so made his muscles were highpower explosives  the levers of his body snapped into play like the jaws of steel traps  and in addition to all this his was that superstrength that is the dower of but one human in millionsa strength depending not on size but on degree a supreme organic excellence residing in the stuff of the muscles themselves  thus so swiftly could he apply a stress that before an opponent could become aware and resist the aim of the stress had been accomplished  in turn so swiftly did he become aware of a stress applied to him that he saved himself by resistance or by delivering a lightning counterstress  it aint no use youall standing there daylight addressed the waiting group  youall might as well get right down and take your baptizing  youall might down me any other day in the year but on my birthday i want youall to know im the best man  is that pat hanrahans mug looking hungry and willing  come on pat  pat hanrahan exbareknuckleprize fighter and roughhouseexpert stepped forth  the two men came against each other in grips and almost before he had exerted himself the irishman found himself in the merciless vise of a halfnelson that buried him head and shoulders in the snow  joe hines exlumberjack came down with an impact equal to a fall from a twostory buildinghis overthrow accomplished by a crossbuttock delivered he claimed before he was ready  there was nothing exhausting in all this to daylight  he did not heave and strain through long minutes  no time practically was occupied his body exploded abruptly and terrifically in one instant and on the next instant was relaxed  thus doc watson the graybearded iron bodied man without a past a fighting terror himself was overthrown in the fraction of a second preceding his own onslaught  as he was in the act of gathering himself for a spring daylight was upon him and with such fearful suddenness as to crush him backward and down  olaf henderson receiving his cue from this attempted to take daylight unaware rushing upon him from one side as he stooped with extended hand to help doc watson up  daylight dropped on his hands and knees receiving in his side olafs knees  olafs momentum carried him clear over the obstruction in a long flying fall  before he could rise daylight had whirled him over on his back and was rubbing his face and ears with snow and shoving handfuls down his neck  ay ban yust as good a man as you ban daylight olaf spluttered as he pulled himself to his feet but by yupiter i ban navver see a grip like that french louis was the last of the five and he had seen enough to make him cautious  he circled and baffled for a full minute before coming to grips and for another full minute they strained and reeled without either winning the advantage  and then just as the contest was becoming interesting daylight effected one of his lightning shifts changing all stresses and leverages and at the same time delivering one of his muscular explosions  french louis resisted till his huge frame crackled and then slowly was forced over and under and downward  the winner pays daylight cried as he sprang to his feet and led the way back into the tivoli  surge along youall this way to the snakeroom  they lined up against the long bar in places two or three deep stamping the frost from their moccasined feet for outside the temperature was sixty below  bettles himself one of the gamest of the oldtimers in deeds and daring ceased from his drunken lay of the sassafras root and titubated over to congratulate daylight  but in the midst of it he felt impelled to make a speech and raised his voice oratorically  i tell you fellers im plum proud to call daylight my friend weve hit the trail together afore now and hes eighteen carat from his moccasins up damn his mangy old hide anyway  he was a shaver when he first hit this country  when you fellers was his age you want dry behind the ears yet  he never was no kid he was born a fullgrown man  an i tell you a man had to be a man in them days  this want no effete civilization like its come to be now  bettles paused long enough to put his arm in a proper bearhug around daylights neck when you an me mushed into the yukon in the good ole days it didnt rain soup and they want no freelunch joints  our camp fires was lit where we killed our game and most of the time we lived on salmontracks and rabbitbelliesaint i right  but at the roar of laughter that greeted his inversion bettles released the bearhug and turned fiercely on them  laugh you mangy shorthorns laugh  but i tell you plain and simple the best of you aint kneehigh fit to tie daylights moccasin strings  aint i right campbell  aint i right mac  daylights one of the old guard one of the real sourdoughs  and in them days they want ary a steamboat or ary a tradingpost and we cusses had to live offen salmonbellies and rabbittracks  he gazed triumphantly around and in the applause that followed arose cries for a speech from daylight  he signified his consent  a chair was brought and he was helped to stand upon it  he was no more sober than the crowd above which he now towereda wild crowd uncouthly garmented every foot moccasined or muclucked3 with mittens dangling from necks and with furry earflaps raised so that they took on the seeming of the winged helmets of the norsemen  daylights black eyes were flashing and the flush of strong drink flooded darkly under the bronze of his cheeks  he was greeted with round on round of affectionate cheers which brought a suspicious moisture to his eyes albeit many of the voices were inarticulate and inebriate  and yet men have so behaved since the world began feasting fighting and carousing whether in the dark cavemouth or by the fire of the squattingplace in the palaces of imperial rome and the rock strongholds of robber barons or in the skyaspiring hotels of modern times and in the boozingkens of sailortown  just so were these men empirebuilders in the arctic light boastful and drunken and clamorous winning surcease for a few wild moments from the grim reality of their heroic toil  modern heroes they and in nowise different from the heroes of old time  well fellows i dont know what to say to youall daylight began lamely striving still to control his whirling brain  i think ill tell youall a story  i had a pardner wunst down in juneau  he come from north caroliney and he used to tell this same story to me  it was down in the mountains in his country and it was a wedding  there they was the family and all the friends  the parson was just puttin on the last touches and he says they as the lord have joined let no man put asunder  parson says the bridegroom i rises to question your grammar in that there sentence  i want this weddin done right  when the smoke clears away the bride she looks around and sees a dead parson a dead bridegroom a dead brother two dead uncles and five dead weddingguests  so she heaves a mighty strong sigh and says them newfangled selfcocking revolvers sure has played hell with my prospects  and so i say to youall daylight added as the roar of laughter died down that them four kings of jack kearns sure has played hell with my prospects  im busted highern a kite and im hittin the trail for dyea  goin out some one called  a spasm of anger wrought on his face for a flashing instant but in the next his goodhumor was back again  i know youall are only pokin fun asking such a question he said with a smile  of course i aint going out  take the oath again daylight the same voice cried  i sure will  i first come over chilcoot in 83  i went out over the pass in a fall blizzard with a rag of a shirt and a cup of raw flour i got my grubstake in juneau that winter and in the spring i went over the pass once more  and once more the famine drew me out  next spring i went in again and i swore then that id never come out till i made my stake  well i aint made it and here i am  and i aint going out now  i get the mail and i come right back  i wont stop the night at dyea ill hit up chilcoot soon as i change the dogs and get the mail and grub  and so i swear once more by the milltails of hell and the head of john the baptist ill never hit for the outside till i make my pile  and i tell youall here and now its got to be an almighty big pile  how much might you call a pile bettles demanded from beneath his arms clutched lovingly around daylights legs  yes how much  what do you call a pile others cried  daylight steadied himself for a moment and debated  four or five millions he said slowly and held up his hand for silence as his statement was received with derisive yells  ill be real conservative and put the bottom notch at a million  and for not an ounce lessn that will i go out of the country  again his statement was received with an outburst of derision not only had the total gold output of the yukon up to date been below five millions but no man had ever made a strike of a hundred thousand much less of a million  youall listen to me  you seen jack kearns get a hunch tonight  we had him sure beat before the draw  his ornery three kings was no good but he just knew there was another king comingthat was his hunchand he got it  and i tell youall i got a hunch  theres a big strike coming on the yukon and its just about due  i dont mean no ornery moosehide birchcreek kind of a strike  i mean a real ripsnorter hairraiser  i tell youall shes in the air and hellbent for election  nothing can stop her and shell come up river  theres where youall track my moccasins in the near future if youall want to find mesomewhere in the country around stewart river indian river and klondike river  when i get back with the mail ill head that way so fast youall wont see my trail for smoke  shes acoming fellows gold from the grass roots down a hundred dollars to the pan and a stampede in from the outside fifty thousand strong  youallll think all hells busted loose when that strike is made  he raised his glass to his lips  heres kindness and hoping youall will be in on it  he drank and stepped down from the chair falling into another one of bettles bearhugs  if i was you daylight i wouldnt mush today joe hines counselled coming in from consulting the spirit thermometer outside the door were in for a good cold snap  its sixtytwo below now and still goin down  better wait till she breaks  daylight laughed and the old sourdoughs around him laughed  just like you shorthorns bettles cried afeard of a little frost and blamed little you know daylight if you think frost kin stop m  freeze his lungs if he travels in it was the reply  freeze pap and lollypop  look here hines you only ben in this here country three years  you aint seasoned yet  ive seen daylight do fifty miles up on the koyokuk on a day when the thermometer busted at seventytwo  hines shook his head dolefully  thems the kind that does freeze their lungs he lamented  if daylight pulls out before this snap breaks hell never get throughan him travelin without tent or fly  its a thousand miles to dyea bettles announced climbing on the chair and supporting his swaying body by an arm passed around daylights neck  its a thousand miles im sayin an most of the trail unbroke but i bet any chechaquoanything he wantsthat daylight makes dyea in thirty days  thats an average of over thirtythree miles a day doc watson warned and ive travelled some myself  a blizzard on chilcoot would tie him up for a week  yep bettles retorted an daylightll do the second thousand back again on end in thirty days more and i got five hundred dollars that says so and damn the blizzards  to emphasize his remarks he pulled out a goldsack the size of a bologna sausage and thumped it down on the bar  doc watson thumped his own sack alongside  hold on daylight cried  bettless right and i want in on this  i bet five hundred that sixty days from now i pull up at the tivoli door with the dyea mail  a sceptical roar went up and a dozen men pulled out their sacks  jack kearns crowded in close and caught daylights attention  i take you daylight he cried  two to one you dontnot in seventyfive days  no charity jack was the reply  the bettins even and the time is sixty days  seventyfive days and two to one you dont kearns insisted fifty milell be wide open and the rimice rotten  what you win from me is yours daylight went on  and by thunder jack you cant give it back that way  i wont bet with you  youre trying to give me money  but i tell youall one thing jack i got another hunch  im goin to win it back some one of these days youall just wait till the big strike up river  then you and mell take the roof off and sit in a game thatll be full mans size  is it a go  they shook hands  of course hell make it kearns whispered in bettles ear and theres five hundred daylights back in sixty days he added aloud  billy rawlins closed with the wager and bettles hugged kearns ecstatically  by yupiter i ban take that bet olaf henderson said dragging daylight away from bettles and kearns  winner pays daylight shouted closing the wager  and im sure going to win and sixty days is a long time between drinks so i pay now  name your brand you hoochinoos  name your brand  bettles a glass of whiskey in hand climbed back on his chair and swaying back and forth sang the one song he knew     o its henry ward beecher    and sundayschool teachers    all sing of the sassafrasroot    but you bet all the same    if it had its right name    its the juice of the forbidden fruit  the crowd roared out the chorus     but you bet all the same    if it had its right name    its the juice of the forbidden fruit  somebody opened the outer door  a vague gray light filtered in  burning daylight burning daylight some one called warningly  daylight paused for nothing heading for the door and pulling down his earflaps  kama stood outside by the sled a long narrow affair sixteen inches wide and seven and a half feet in length its slatted bottom raised six inches above the steelshod runners  on it lashed with thongs of moosehide were the light canvas bags that contained the mail and the food and gear for dogs and men  in front of it in a single line lay curled five frostrimed dogs  they were huskies matched in size and color all unusually large and all gray  from their cruel jaws to their bushy tails they were as like as peas in their likeness to timberwolves  wolves they were domesticated it was true but wolves in appearance and in all their characteristics on top the sled load thrust under the lashings and ready for immediate use were two pairs of snowshoes  bettles pointed to a robe of arctic hare skins the end of which showed in the mouth of a bag  thats his bed he said  six pounds of rabbit skins  warmest thing he ever slept under but im damned if it could keep me warm and i can go some myself  daylights a hellfire furnace thats what he is  id hate to be that indian doc watson remarked  hell killm hell killm sure bettles chanted exultantly i know ive ben with daylight on trail  that man aint never ben tired in his life  dont know what it means  i seen him travel all day with wet socks at fortyfive below  there aint another man living can do that  while this talk went on daylight was saying goodby to those that clustered around him  the virgin wanted to kiss him and fuddled slightly though he was with the whiskey he saw his way out without compromising with the apronstring  he kissed the virgin but he kissed the other three women with equal partiality  he pulled on his long mittens roused the dogs to their feet and took his place at the geepole4  mush you beauties he cried  the animals threw their weights against their breastbands on the instant crouching low to the snow and digging in their claws they whined eagerly and before the sled had gone half a dozen lengths both daylight and kama in the rear were running to keep up  and so running man and dogs dipped over the bank and down to the frozen bed of the yukon and in the gray light were gone   1 tenderfeet  2 oldtimers  3 mucluc a watertight eskimo boot made from walrushide and trimmed with fur  4 a geepole stout pole projecting forward from one side of the front end of the sled by which the sled is steered    chapter iv  on the river where was a packed trail and where snowshoes were unnecessary the dogs averaged six miles an hour  to keep up with them the two men were compelled to run  daylight and kama relieved each other regularly at the geepole for here was the hard work of steering the flying sled and of keeping in advance of it  the man relieved dropped behind the sled occasionally leaping upon it and resting  it was severe work but of the sort that was exhilarating  they were flying getting over the ground making the most of the packed trail  later on they would come to the unbroken trail where three miles an hour would constitute good going  then there would be no riding and resting and no running  then the geepole would be the easier task and a man would come back to it to rest after having completed his spell to the fore breaking trail with the snowshoes for the dogs  such work was far from exhilarating also they must expect places where for miles at a time they must toil over chaotic icejams where they would be fortunate if they made two miles an hour  and there would be the inevitable bad jams short ones it was true but so bad that a mile an hour would require terrific effort  kama and daylight did not talk  in the nature of the work they could not nor in their own natures were they given to talking while they worked at rare intervals when necessary they addressed each other in monosyllables kama for the most part contenting himself with grunts occasionally a dog whined or snarled but in the main the team kept silent  only could be heard the sharp jarring grate of the steel runners over the hard surface and the creak of the straining sled  as if through a wall daylight had passed from the hum and roar of the tivoli into another worlda world of silence and immobility  nothing stirred  the yukon slept under a coat of ice three feet thick  no breath of wind blew  nor did the sap move in the hearts of the spruce trees that forested the river banks on either hand  the trees burdened with the last infinitesimal pennyweight of snow their branches could hold stood in absolute petrifaction  the slightest tremor would have dislodged the snow and no snow was dislodged  the sled was the one point of life and motion in the midst of the solemn quietude and the harsh churn of its runners but emphasized the silence through which it moved  it was a dead world and furthermore a gray world  the weather was sharp and clear there was no moisture in the atmosphere no fog nor haze yet the sky was a gray pall  the reason for this was that though there was no cloud in the sky to dim the brightness of day there was no sun to give brightness  far to the south the sun climbed steadily to meridian but between it and the frozen yukon intervened the bulge of the earth  the yukon lay in a night shadow and the day itself was in reality a long twilightlight  at a quarter before twelve where a wide bend of the river gave a long vista south the sun showed its upper rim above the skyline  but it did not rise perpendicularly  instead it rose on a slant so that by high noon it had barely lifted its lower rim clear of the horizon  it was a dim wan sun  there was no heat to its rays and a man could gaze squarely into the full orb of it without hurt to his eyes  no sooner had it reached meridian than it began its slant back beneath the horizon and at quarter past twelve the earth threw its shadow again over the land  the men and dogs raced on  daylight and kama were both savages so far as their stomachs were concerned  they could eat irregularly in time and quantity gorging hugely on occasion and on occasion going long stretches without eating at all  as for the dogs they ate but once a day and then rarely did they receive more than a pound each of dried fish  they were ravenously hungry and at the same time splendidly in condition like the wolves their forebears their nutritive processes were rigidly economical and perfect  there was no waste  the last least particle of what they consumed was transformed into energy  and kama and daylight were like them  descended themselves from the generations that had endured they too endured  theirs was the simple elemental economy  a little food equipped them with prodigious energy  nothing was lost  a man of soft civilization sitting at a desk would have grown lean and woebegone on the fare that kept kama and daylight at the topnotch of physical efficiency  they knew as the man at the desk never knows what it is to be normally hungry all the time so that they could eat any time  their appetites were always with them and on edge so that they bit voraciously into whatever offered and with an entire innocence of indigestion  by three in the afternoon the long twilight faded into night the stars came out very near and sharp and bright and by their light dogs and men still kept the trail  they were indefatigable  and this was no record run of a single day but the first day of sixty such days though daylight had passed a night without sleep a night of dancing and carouse it seemed to have left no effect  for this there were two explanations first his remarkable vitality and next the fact that such nights were rare in his experience  again enters the man at the desk whose physical efficiency would be more hurt by a cup of coffee at bedtime than could daylights by a whole night long of strong drink and excitement  daylight travelled without a watch feeling the passage of time and largely estimating it by subconscious processes  by what he considered must be six oclock he began looking for a campingplace  the trail at a bend plunged out across the river  not having found a likely spot they held on for the opposite bank a mile away  but midway they encountered an icejam which took an hour of heavy work to cross  at last daylight glimpsed what he was looking for a dead tree close by the bank  the sled was run in and up  kama grunted with satisfaction and the work of making camp was begun  the division of labor was excellent  each knew what he must do with one ax daylight chopped down the dead pine  kama with a snowshoe and the other ax cleared away the two feet of snow above the yukon ice and chopped a supply of ice for cooking purposes  a piece of dry birch bark started the fire and daylight went ahead with the cooking while the indian unloaded the sled and fed the dogs their ration of dried fish  the food sacks he slung high in the trees beyond leapingreach of the huskies  next he chopped down a young spruce tree and trimmed off the boughs  close to the fire he trampled down the soft snow and covered the packed space with the boughs  on this flooring he tossed his own and daylights gearbags containing dry socks and underwear and their sleepingrobes  kama however had two robes of rabbit skin to daylights one  they worked on steadily without speaking losing no time  each did whatever was needed without thought of leaving to the other the least task that presented itself to hand  thus kama saw when more ice was needed and went and got it while a snowshoe pushed over by the lunge of a dog was stuck on end again by daylight  while coffee was boiling bacon frying and flapjacks were being mixed daylight found time to put on a big pot of beans  kama came back sat down on the edge of the spruce boughs and in the interval of waiting mended harness  i tink dat skookum and booga make um plenty fight maybe kama remarked as they sat down to eat  keep an eye on them was daylights answer  and this was their sole conversation throughout the meal  once with a muttered imprecation kama leaped away a stick of firewood in hand and clubbed apart a tangle of fighting dogs daylight between mouthfuls fed chunks of ice into the tin pot where it thawed into water  the meal finished kama replenished the fire cut more wood for the morning and returned to the spruce bough bed and his harnessmending  daylight cut up generous chunks of bacon and dropped them in the pot of bubbling beans  the moccasins of both men were wet and this in spite of the intense cold so when there was no further need for them to leave the oasis of spruce boughs they took off their moccasins and hung them on short sticks to dry before the fire turning them about from time to time  when the beans were finally cooked daylight ran part of them into a bag of floursacking a foot and a half long and three inches in diameter  this he then laid on the snow to freeze  the remainder of the beans were left in the pot for breakfast  it was past nine oclock and they were ready for bed  the squabbling and bickering among the dogs had long since died down and the weary animals were curled in the snow each with his feet and nose bunched together and covered by his wolfs brush of a tail  kama spread his sleepingfurs and lighted his pipe daylight rolled a brownpaper cigarette and the second conversation of the evening took place  i think we come near sixty miles said daylight  um i tink so said kama  they rolled into their robes allstanding each with a woolen mackinaw jacket on in place of the parkas5 they had worn all day  swiftly almost on the instant they closed their eyes they were asleep  the stars leaped and danced in the frosty air and overhead the colored bars of the aurora borealis were shooting like great searchlights  in the darkness daylight awoke and roused kama  though the aurora still flamed another day had begun  warmedover flapjacks warmedover beans fried bacon and coffee composed the breakfast  the dogs got nothing though they watched with wistful mien from a distance sitting up in the snow their tails curled around their paws occasionally they lifted one fore paw or the other with a restless movement as if the frost tingled in their feet  it was bitter cold at least sixtyfive below zero and when kama harnessed the dogs with naked hands he was compelled several times to go over to the fire and warm the numbing fingertips  together the two men loaded and lashed the sled  they warmed their hands for the last time pulled on their mittens and mushed the dogs over the bank and down to the rivertrail according to daylights estimate it was around seven oclock but the stars danced just as brilliantly and faint luminous streaks of greenish aurora still pulsed overhead  two hours later it became suddenly darkso dark that they kept to the trail largely by instinct and daylight knew that his timeestimate had been right  it was the darkness before dawn never anywhere more conspicuous than on the alaskan wintertrail  slowly the gray light came stealing through the gloom imperceptibly at first so that it was almost with surprise that they noticed the vague loom of the trail underfoot  next they were able to see the wheeldog and then the whole string of running dogs and snowstretches on either side  then the near bank loomed for a moment and was gone loomed a second time and remained  in a few minutes the far bank a mile away unobtrusively came into view and ahead and behind the whole frozen river could be seen with off to the left a wideextending range of sharpcut snowcovered mountains  and that was all no sun arose  the gray light remained gray  once during the day a lynx leaped lightly across the trail under the very nose of the leaddog and vanished in the white woods  the dogs wild impulses roused  they raised the huntingcry of the pack surged against their collars and swerved aside in pursuit  daylight yelling whoa struggled with the geepole and managed to overturn the sled into the soft snow  the dogs gave up the sled was righted and five minutes later they were flying along the hardpacked trail again  the lynx was the only sign of life they had seen in two days and it leaping velvetfooted and vanishing had been more like an apparition  at twelve oclock when the sun peeped over the earthbulge they stopped and built a small fire on the ice  daylight with the ax chopped chunks off the frozen sausage of beans  these thawed and warmed in the fryingpan constituted their meal they had no coffee he did not believe in the burning of daylight for such a luxury  the dogs stopped wrangling with one another and looked on wistfully  only at night did they get their pound of fish  in the meantime they worked  the cold snap continued  only men of iron kept the trail at such low temperatures and kama and daylight were picked men of their races but kama knew the other was the better man and thus at the start he was himself foredoomed to defeat  not that he slackened his effort or willingness by the slightest conscious degree but that he was beaten by the burden he carried in his mind  his attitude toward daylight was worshipful  stoical taciturn proud of his physical prowess he found all these qualities incarnated in his white companion  here was one that excelled in the things worth excelling in a mangod ready to hand and kama could not but worshipwithal he gave no signs of it no wonder the race of white men conquered was his thought when it bred men like this man  what chance had the indian against such a dogged enduring breed  even the indians did not travel at such low temperatures and theirs was the wisdom of thousands of generations yet here was this daylight from the soft southland harder than they laughing at their fears and swinging along the trail ten and twelve hours a day  and this daylight thought that he could keep up a days pace of thirtythree miles for sixty days  wait till a fresh fall of snow came down or they struck the unbroken trail or the rotten rimice that fringed open water  in the meantime kama kept the pace never grumbling never shirking sixtyfive degrees below zero is very cold  since water freezes at thirtytwo above sixtyfive below meant ninetyseven degrees below freezingpoint  some idea of the significance of this may be gained by conceiving of an equal difference of temperature in the opposite direction  one hundred and twentynine on the thermometer constitutes a very hot day yet such a temperature is but ninetyseven degrees above freezing  double this difference and possibly some slight conception may be gained of the cold through which kama and daylight travelled between dark and dark and through the dark  kama froze the skin on his cheekbones despite frequent rubbings and the flesh turned black and sore  also he slightly froze the edges of his lungtissuesa dangerous thing and the basic reason why a man should not unduly exert himself in the open at sixtyfive below  but kama never complained and daylight was a furnace of heat sleeping as warmly under his six pounds of rabbit skins as the other did under twelve pounds  on the second night fifty more miles to the good they camped in the vicinity of the boundary between alaska and the northwest territory the rest of the journey save the last short stretch to dyea would be travelled on canadian territory  with the hard trail and in the absence of fresh snow daylight planned to make the camp of forty mile on the fourth night  he told kama as much but on the third day the temperature began to rise and they knew snow was not far off for on the yukon it must get warm in order to snow  also on this day they encountered ten miles of chaotic icejams where a thousand times they lifted the loaded sled over the huge cakes by the strength of their arms and lowered it down again  here the dogs were wellnigh useless and both they and the men were tried excessively by the roughness of the way  an hours extra running that night caught up only part of the lost time  in the morning they awoke to find ten inches of snow on their robes the dogs were buried under it and were loath to leave their comfortable nests  this new snow meant hard going  the sled runners would not slide over it so well while one of the men must go in advance of the dogs and pack it down with snowshoes so that they should not wallow quite different was it from the ordinary snow known to those of the southland  it was hard and fine and dry  it was more like sugar kick it and it flew with a hissing noise like sand  there was no cohesion among the particles and it could not be moulded into snowballs it was not composed of flakes but of crystalstiny geometrical frostcrystals  in truth it was not snow but frost  the weather was warm as well barely twenty below zero and the two men with raised earflaps and dangling mittens sweated as they toiled  they failed to make forty mile that night and when they passed that camp next day daylight paused only long enough to get the mail and additional grub  on the afternoon of the following day they camped at the mouth of the klondike river not a soul had they encountered since forty mile and they had made their own trail  as yet that winter no one had travelled the river south of forty mile and for that matter the whole winter through they might be the only ones to travel it  in that day the yukon was a lonely land  between the klondike river and salt water at dyea intervened six hundred miles of snowcovered wilderness and in all that distance there were but two places where daylight might look forward to meeting men  both were isolated tradingposts sixty mile and fort selkirk  in the summertime indians might be met with at the mouths of the stewart and white rivers at the big and little salmons and on lake le barge but in the winter as he well knew they would be on the trail of the mooseherds following them back into the mountains  that night camped at the mouth of the klondike daylight did not turn in when the evenings work was done  had a white man been present daylight would have remarked that he felt his hunch working  as it was he tied on his snowshoes left the dogs curled in the snow and kama breathing heavily under his rabbit skins and climbed up to the big flat above the high earthbank but the spruce trees were too thick for an outlook and he threaded his way across the flat and up the first steep slopes of the mountain at the back  here flowing in from the east at right angles he could see the klondike and bending grandly from the south the yukon  to the left and downstream toward moosehide mountain the huge splash of white from which it took its name showing clearly in the starlight  lieutenant schwatka had given it its name but he daylight had first seen it long before that intrepid explorer had crossed the chilcoot and rafted down the yukon  but the mountain received only passing notice  daylights interest was centered in the big flat itself with deep water all along its edge for steamboat landings  a sure enough likely town site he muttered  room for a camp of forty thousand men  all thats needed is the goldstrike he meditated for a space  ten dollars to the panll do it and itd be the allfiredest stampede alaska ever seen  and if it dont come here itll come somewhere hereabouts  its a sure good idea to keep an eye out for town sites all the way up  he stood a while longer gazing out over the lonely flat and visioning with constructive imagination the scene if the stampede did come  in fancy he placed the sawmills the big trading stores the saloons and dancehalls and the long streets of miners cabins  and along those streets he saw thousands of men passing up and down while before the stores were the heavy freightingsleds with long strings of dogs attached  also he saw the heavy freighters pulling down the main street and heading up the frozen klondike toward the imagined somewhere where the diggings must be located  he laughed and shook the vision from his eyes descended to the level and crossed the flat to camp  five minutes after he had rolled up in his robe he opened his eyes and sat up amazed that he was not already asleep  he glanced at the indian sleeping beside him at the embers of the dying fire at the five dogs beyond with their wolfs brushes curled over their noses and at the four snowshoes standing upright in the snow  its sure hell the way that hunch works on me he murmured his mind reverted to the poker game  four kings he grinned reminiscently that was a hunch  he lay down again pulled the edge of the robe around his neck and over his earflaps closed his eyes and this time fell asleep   5 parka a light hooded smocklike garment made of cotton drill    chapter v  at sixty mile they restocked provisions added a few pounds of letters to their load and held steadily on  from forty mile they had had unbroken trail and they could look forward only to unbroken trail clear to dyea  daylight stood it magnificently but the killing pace was beginning to tell on kama  his pride kept his mouth shut but the result of the chilling of his lungs in the cold snap could not be concealed  microscopically small had been the edges of the lungtissue touched by the frost but they now began to slough off giving rise to a dry hacking cough  any unusually severe exertion precipitated spells of coughing during which he was almost like a man in a fit the blood congested in his eyes till they bulged while the tears ran down his cheeks  a whiff of the smoke from frying bacon would start him off for a halfhours paroxysm and he kept carefully to windward when daylight was cooking  they plodded days upon days and without end over the soft unpacked snow  it was hard monotonous work with none of the joy and bloodstir that went with flying over hard surface  now one man to the fore in the snowshoes and now the other it was a case of stubborn unmitigated plod  a yard of powdery snow had to be pressed down and the widewebbed shoe under a mans weight sank a full dozen inches into the soft surface  snowshoe work under such conditions called for the use of muscles other than those used in ordinary walking  from step to step the rising foot could not come up and forward on a slant it had to be raised perpendicularly  when the snowshoe was pressed into the snow its nose was confronted by a vertical wall of snow twelve inches high  if the foot in rising slanted forward the slightest bit the nose of the shoe penetrated the obstructing wall and tipped downward till the heel of the shoe struck the mans leg behind thus up straight up twelve inches each foot must be raised every time and all the time ere the forward swing from the knee could begin  on this partially packed surface followed the dogs the man at the geepole and the sled  at the best toiling as only picked men could toil they made no more than three miles an hour  this meant longer hours of travel and daylight for good measure and for a margin against accidents hit the trail for twelve hours a day  since three hours were consumed by making camp at night and cooking beans by getting breakfast in the morning and breaking camp and by thawing beans at the midday halt nine hours were left for sleep and recuperation and neither men nor dogs wasted many minutes of those nine hours  at selkirk the trading post near pelly river daylight suggested that kama lay over rejoining him on the back trip from dyea  a strayed indian from lake le barge was willing to take his place but kama was obdurate  he grunted with a slight intonation of resentment and that was all  the dogs however daylight changed leaving his own exhausted team to rest up against his return while he went on with six fresh dogs  they travelled till ten oclock the night they reached selkirk and at six next morning they plunged ahead into the next stretch of wilderness of nearly five hundred miles that lay between selkirk and dyea  a second cold snap came on but cold or warm it was all the same an unbroken trail  when the thermometer went down to fifty below it was even harder to travel for at that low temperature the hard frostcrystals were more like sandgrains in the resistance they offered to the sled runners the dogs had to pull harder than over the same snow at twenty or thirty below zero  daylight increased the days travel to thirteen hours  he jealously guarded the margin he had gained for he knew there were difficult stretches to come  it was not yet quite midwinter and the turbulent fifty mile river vindicated his judgment  in many places it ran wide open with precarious rimice fringing it on either side  in numerous places where the water dashed against the steepsided bluffs rimice was unable to form  they turned and twisted now crossing the river now coming back again sometimes making half a dozen attempts before they found a way over a particularly bad stretch  it was slow work  the icebridges had to be tested and either daylight or kama went in advance snowshoes on their feet and long poles carried crosswise in their hands  thus if they broke through they could cling to the pole that bridged the hole made by their bodies  several such accidents were the share of each  at fifty below zero a man wet to the waist cannot travel without freezing so each ducking meant delay  as soon as rescued the wet man ran up and down to keep up his circulation while his dry companion built a fire  thus protected a change of garments could be made and the wet ones dried against the next misadventure  to make matters worse this dangerous river travel could not be done in the dark and their working day was reduced to the six hours of twilight  every moment was precious and they strove never to lose one  thus before the first hint of the coming of gray day camp was broken sled loaded dogs harnessed and the two men crouched waiting over the fire  nor did they make the midday halt to eat  as it was they were running far behind their schedule each day eating into the margin they had run up there were days when they made fifteen miles and days when they made a dozen  and there was one bad stretch where in two days they covered nine miles being compelled to turn their backs three times on the river and to portage sled and outfit over the mountains  at last they cleared the dread fifty mile river and came out on lake le barge  here was no open water nor jammed ice  for thirty miles or more the snow lay level as a table withal it lay three feet deep and was soft as flour  three miles an hour was the best they could make but daylight celebrated the passing of the fifty mile by traveling late  at eleven in the morning they emerged at the foot of the lake at three in the afternoon as the arctic night closed down he caught his first sight of the head of the lake and with the first stars took his bearings  at eight in the evening they left the lake behind and entered the mouth of the lewes river  here a halt of half an hour was made while chunks of frozen boiled beans were thawed and the dogs were given an extra ration of fish  then they pulled on up the river till one in the morning when they made their regular camp  they had hit the trail sixteen hours on end that day the dogs had come in too tired to fight among themselves or even snarl and kama had perceptibly limped the last several miles yet daylight was on trail next morning at six oclock  by eleven he was at the foot of white horse and that night saw him camped beyond the box canon the last bad riverstretch behind him the string of lakes before him  there was no let up in his pace  twelve hours a day six in the twilight and six in the dark they toiled on the trail  three hours were consumed in cooking repairing harnesses and making and breaking camp and the remaining nine hours dogs and men slept as if dead  the iron strength of kama broke  day by day the terrific toil sapped him day by day he consumed more of his reserves of strength  he became slower of movement the resiliency went out of his muscles and his limp became permanent  yet he labored stoically on never shirking never grunting a hint of complaint  daylight was thinfaced and tired  he looked tired yet somehow with that marvelous mechanism of a body that was his he drove on ever on remorselessly on  never was he more a god in kamas mind than in the last days of the southbound traverse as the failing indian watched him ever to the fore pressing onward with urgency of endurance such as kama had never seen nor dreamed could thrive in human form  the time came when kama was unable to go in the lead and break trail and it was a proof that he was far gone when he permitted daylight to toil all day at the heavy snowshoe work  lake by lake they crossed the string of lakes from marsh to linderman and began the ascent of chilcoot  by all rights daylight should have camped below the last pitch of the pass at the dim end of day but he kept on and over and down to sheep camp while behind him raged a snowstorm that would have delayed him twentyfour hours  this last excessive strain broke kama completely  in the morning he could not travel  at five when called he sat up after a struggle groaned and sank back again  daylight did the camp work of both harnessed the dogs and when ready for the start rolled the helpless indian in all three sleeping robes and lashed him on top of the sled the going was good they were on the last lap and he raced the dogs down through dyea canon and along the hardpacked trail that led to dyea post  and running still kama groaning on top the load and daylight leaping at the geepole to avoid going under the runners of the flying sled they arrived at dyea by the sea  true to his promise daylight did not stop  an hours time saw the sled loaded with the ingoing mail and grub fresh dogs harnessed and a fresh indian engaged  kama never spoke from the time of his arrival till the moment daylight ready to depart stood beside him to say goodby  they shook hands  you kill um dat damn indian kama said  sawee daylight  you kill um  hell sure last as far as pelly daylight grinned  kama shook his head doubtfully and rolled over on his side turning his back in token of farewell  daylight won across chilcoot that same day dropping down five hundred feet in the darkness and the flurrying snow to crater lake where he camped  it was a cold camp far above the timberline and he had not burdened his sled with firewood that night three feet of snow covered them and in the black morning when they dug themselves out the indian tried to desert  he had had enough of traveling with what he considered a madman  but daylight persuaded him in grim ways to stay by the outfit and they pulled on across deep lake and long lake and dropped down to the levelgoing of lake linderman  it was the same killing pace going in as coming out and the indian did not stand it as well as kama  he too never complained  nor did he try again to desert  he toiled on and did his best while he renewed his resolve to steer clear of daylight in the future the days slipped into days nights and twilights alternating cold snaps gave way to snowfalls and cold snaps came on again and all the while through the long hours the miles piled up behind them  but on the fifty mile accident befell them  crossing an icebridge the dogs broke through and were swept under the downstream ice  the traces that connected the team with the wheeldog parted and the team was never seen again  only the one wheeldog remained and daylight harnessed the indian and himself to the sled  but a man cannot take the place of a dog at such work and the two men were attempting to do the work of five dogs  at the end of the first hour daylight lightened up dogfood extra gear and the spare ax were thrown away under the extraordinary exertion the dog snapped a tendon the following day and was hopelessly disabled  daylight shot it and abandoned the sled  on his back he took one hundred and sixty pounds of mail and grub and on the indians put one hundred and twentyfive pounds  the stripping of gear was remorseless  the indian was appalled when he saw every pound of worthless mail matter retained while beans cups pails plates and extra clothing were thrown by the board  one robe each was kept one ax one tin pail and a scant supply of bacon and flour  bacon could be eaten raw on a pinch and flour stirred in hot water could keep men going  even the rifle and the score of rounds of ammunition were left behind  and in this fashion they covered the two hundred miles to selkirk daylight travelled late and early the hours formerly used by campmaking and dogtending being now devoted to the trail  at night they crouched over a small fire wrapped in their robes drinking flour broth and thawing bacon on the ends of sticks and in the morning darkness without a word they arose slipped on their packs adjusted headstraps and hit the trail  the last miles into selkirk daylight drove the indian before him a hollowcheeked gaunteyed wraith of a man who else would have lain down and slept or abandoned his burden of mail  at selkirk the old team of dogs fresh and in condition were harnessed and the same day saw daylight plodding on alternating places at the geepole as a matter of course with the le barge indian who had volunteered on the way out  daylight was two days behind his schedule and falling snow and unpacked trail kept him two days behind all the way to forty mile  and here the weather favored  it was time for a big cold snap and he gambled on it cutting down the weight of grub for dogs and men  the men of forty mile shook their heads ominously and demanded to know what he would do if the snow still fell  that cold snaps sure got to come he laughed and mushed out on the trail  a number of sleds had passed back and forth already that winter between forty mile and circle city and the trail was well packed  and the cold snap came and remained and circle city was only two hundred miles away  the le barge indian was a young man unlearned yet in his own limitations and filled with pride  he took daylights pace with joy and even dreamed at first that he would play the white man out  the first hundred miles he looked for signs of weakening and marveled that he saw them not  throughout the second hundred miles he observed signs in himself and gritted his teeth and kept up  and ever daylight flew on and on running at the geepole or resting his spell on top the flying sled the last day clearer and colder than ever gave perfect going and they covered seventy miles  it was ten at night when they pulled up the earthbank and flew along the main street of circle city and the young indian though it was his spell to ride leaped off and ran behind the sled  it was honorable braggadocio and despite the fact that he had found his limitations and was pressing desperately against them he ran gamely on    chapter vi  a crowd filled the tivolithe old crowd that had seen daylight depart two months before for this was the night of the sixtieth day and opinion was divided as ever as to whether or not he would compass the achievement  at ten oclock bets were still being made though the odds rose bet by bet against his success  down in her heart the virgin believed he had failed yet she made a bet of twenty ounces with charley bates against forty ounces that daylight would arrive before midnight  she it was who heard the first yelps of the dogs  listen she cried  its daylight  there was a general stampede for the door but where the double stormdoors were thrown wide open the crowd fell back  they heard the eager whining of dogs the snap of a dogwhip and the voice of daylight crying encouragement as the weary animals capped all they had done by dragging the sled in over the wooden floor  they came in with a rush and with them rushed in the frost a visible vapor of smoking white through which their heads and backs showed as they strained in the harness till they had all the seeming of swimming in a river behind them at the geepole came daylight hidden to the knees by the swirling frost through which he appeared to wade  he was the same old daylight withal lean and tiredlooking and his black eyes were sparkling and flashing brighter than ever his parka of cotton drill hooded him like a monk and fell in straight lines to his knees  grimed and scorched by campsmoke and fire the garment in itself told the story of his trip  a twomonths beard covered his face and the beard in turn was matted with the ice of his breathing through the long seventymile run  his entry was spectacular melodramatic and he knew it  it was his life and he was living it at the top of his bent  among his fellows he was a great man an arctic hero  he was proud of the fact and it was a high moment for him fresh from two thousand miles of trail to come surging into that barroom dogs sled mail indian paraphernalia and all  he had performed one more exploit that would make the yukon ring with his namehe burning daylight the king of travelers and dogmushers  he experienced a thrill of surprise as the roar of welcome went up and as every familiar detail of the tivoli greeted his visionthe long bar and the array of bottles the gambling games the big stove the weigher at the goldscales the musicians the men and women the virgin celia and nellie dan macdonald bettles billy rawlins olaf henderson doc watsonall of them  it was just as he had left it and in all seeming it might well be the very day he had left  the sixty days of incessant travel through the white wilderness suddenly telescoped and had no existence in time they were a moment an incident  he had plunged out and into them through the wall of silence and back through the wall of silence he had plunged apparently the next instant and into the roar and turmoil of the tivoli  a glance down at the sled with its canvas mailbags was necessary to reassure him of the reality of those sixty days and the two thousand miles over the ice  as in a dream he shook the hands that were thrust out to him  he felt a vast exaltation  life was magnificent  he loved it all  a great sense of humanness and comradeship swept over him  these were all his his own kind  it was immense tremendous he felt melting in the heart of him and he would have liked to shake hands with them all at once to gather them to his breast in one mighty embrace  he drew a deep breath and cried the winner pays and im the winner aint i  surge up youall malemutes and siwashes and name your poison  theres your dyea mail straight from salt water and no hornswogglin about it  cast the lashings adrift youall and wade into it  a dozen pairs of hands were at the sledlashings when the young le barge indian bending at the same task suddenly and limply straightened up  in his eyes was a great surprise  he stared about him wildly for the thing he was undergoing was new to him  he was profoundly struck by an unguessed limitation  he shook as with a palsy and he gave at the knees slowly sinking down to fall suddenly across the sled and to know the smashing blow of darkness across his consciousness  exhaustion said daylight  take him off and put him to bed some of youall  hes sure a good indian  daylights right was doc watsons verdict a moment later the mans plumb tuckered out  the mail was taken charge of the dogs driven away to quarters and fed and bettles struck up the paean of the sassafras root as they lined up against the long bar to drink and talk and collect their debts  a few minutes later daylight was whirling around the dancefloor waltzing with the virgin  he had replaced his parka with his fur cap and blanketcloth coat kicked off his frozen moccasins and was dancing in his stocking feet  after wetting himself to the knees late that afternoon he had run on without changing his footgear and to the knees his long german socks were matted with ice  in the warmth of the room it began to thaw and to break apart in clinging chunks  these chunks rattled together as his legs flew around and every little while they fell clattering to the floor and were slipped upon by the other dancers  but everybody forgave daylight  he who was one of the few that made the law in that far land who set the ethical pace and by conduct gave the standard of right and wrong was nevertheless above the law  he was one of those rare and favored mortals who can do no wrong  what he did had to be right whether others were permitted or not to do the same things  of course such mortals are so favored by virtue of the fact that they almost always do the right and do it in finer and higher ways than other men  so daylight an elder hero in that young land and at the same time younger than most of them moved as a creature apart as a man above men as a man who was greatly man and all man  and small wonder it was that the virgin yielded herself to his arms as they danced dance after dance and was sick at heart at the knowledge that he found nothing in her more than a good friend and an excellent dancer  small consolation it was to know that he had never loved any woman  she was sick with love of him and he danced with her as he would dance with any woman as he would dance with a man who was a good dancer and upon whose arm was tied a handkerchief to conventionalize him into a woman  one such man daylight danced with that night  among frontiersmen it has always been a test of endurance for one man to whirl another down and when ben davis the farodealer a gaudy bandanna on his arm got daylight in a virginia reel the fun began  the reel broke up and all fell back to watch  around and around the two men whirled always in the one direction  word was passed on into the big barroom and bar and gambling tables were deserted  everybody wanted to see and they packed and jammed the danceroom  the musicians played on and on and on and on the two men whirled  davis was skilled at the trick and on the yukon he had put many a strong man on his back  but after a few minutes it was clear that he and not daylight was going  for a while longer they spun around and then daylight suddenly stood still released his partner and stepped back reeling himself and fluttering his hands aimlessly as if to support himself against the air  but davis a giddy smile of consternation on his face gave sideways turned in an attempt to recover balance and pitched headlong to the floor  still reeling and staggering and clutching at the air with his hands daylight caught the nearest girl and started on in a waltz again he had done the big thing  weary from two thousand miles over the ice and a run that day of seventy miles he had whirled a fresh man down and that man ben davis  daylight loved the high places and though few high places there were in his narrow experience he had made a point of sitting in the highest he had ever glimpsed  the great world had never heard his name but it was known far and wide in the vast silent north by whites and indians and eskimos from bering sea to the passes from the head reaches of remotest rivers to the tundra shore of point barrow  desire for mastery was strong in him and it was all one whether wrestling with the elements themselves with men or with luck in a gambling game  it was all a game life and its affairs  and he was a gambler to the core  risk and chance were meat and drink  true it was not altogether blind for he applied wit and skill and strength but behind it all was the everlasting luck the thing that at times turned on its votaries and crushed the wise while it blessed the foolsluck the thing all men sought and dreamed to conquer and so he  deep in his lifeprocesses life itself sang the siren song of its own majesty ever awhisper and urgent counseling him that he could achieve more than other men win out where they failed ride to success where they perished  it was the urge of life healthy and strong unaware of frailty and decay drunken with sublime complacence egomad enchanted by its own mighty optimism  and ever in vaguest whisperings and clearest trumpetcalls came the message that sometime somewhere somehow he would run luck down make himself the master of luck and tie it and brand it as his own  when he played poker the whisper was of four aces and royal flushes  when he prospected it was of gold in the grassroots gold on bedrock and gold all the way down  at the sharpest hazards of trail and river and famine the message was that other men might die but that he would pull through triumphant  it was the old old lie of life fooling itself believing itselfimmortal and indestructible bound to achieve over other lives and win to its hearts desire  and so reversing at times daylight waltzed off his dizziness and led the way to the bar  but a united protest went up  his theory that the winner paid was no longer to be tolerated  it was contrary to custom and common sense and while it emphasized goodfellowship nevertheless in the name of goodfellowship it must cease  the drinks were rightfully on ben davis and ben davis must buy them furthermore all drinks and general treats that daylight was guilty of ought to be paid by the house for daylight brought much custom to it whenever he made a night bettles was the spokesman and his argument tersely and offensively vernacular was unanimously applauded  daylight grinned stepped aside to the roulettetable and bought a stack of yellow chips  at the end of ten minutes he weighed in at the scales and two thousand dollars in golddust was poured into his own and an extra sack  luck a mere flutter of luck but it was his elation was added to elation  he was living and the night was his he turned upon his wellwishing critics  now the winner sure does pay he said  and they surrendered  there was no withstanding daylight when he vaulted on the back of life and rode it bitted and spurred  at one in the morning he saw elijah davis herding henry finn and joe hines the lumberjack toward the door  daylight interfered  where are youall going he demanded attempting to draw them to the bar  bed elijah davis answered  he was a lean tobaccochewing new englander the one daring spirit in his family that had heard and answered the call of the west shouting through the mount desert back oddlots  got to joe hines added apologetically  were mushing out in the mornin  daylight still detained them  where to  whats the excitement  no excitement elijah explained  were just agoin to play your hunch an tackle the upper country  dont you want to come along  i sure do daylight affirmed  but the question had been put in fun and elijah ignored the acceptance  were tacklin the stewart he went on  al mayo told me he seen some likely lookin bars first time he come down the stewart and were goin to sample em while the rivers froze you listen daylight an mark my words the times comin when winter digginsll be all the go therell be men in them days thatll laugh at our summer stratchin an groundwallerin  at that time winter mining was undreamed of on the yukon  from the moss and grass the land was frozen to bedrock and frozen gravel hard as granite defied pick and shovel  in the summer the men stripped the earth down as fast as the sun thawed it then was the time they did their mining  during the winter they freighted their provisions went moosehunting got all ready for the summers work and then loafed the bleak dark months through in the big central camps such as circle city and forty mile  winter diggins sure comin daylight agreed  wait till that big strike is made up river  then youallll see a new kind of mining whats to prevent woodburning and sinking shafts and drifting along bedrock  wont need to timber  that frozen muck and gravelll stand till hell is froze and its milltails is turned to icecream  why theyll be working paystreaks a hundred feet deep in them days thats comin  im sure going along with youall elijah  elijah laughed gathered his two partners up and was making a second attempt to reach the door  hold on daylight called  i sure mean it  the three men turned back suddenly upon him in their faces surprise delight and incredulity  gwan youre foolin said finn the other lumberjack a quiet steady wisconsin man  theres my dawgs and sled daylight answered  thatll make two teams and halve the loadsthough weallll have to travel easy for a spell for them dawgs is sure tired  the three men were overjoyed but still a trifle incredulous  now look here joe hines blurted out none of your foolin daylight we mean business  will you come  daylight extended his hand and shook  then youd best be gettin to bed elijah advised were mushin out at six and four hours sleep is none so long  mebbe we ought to lay over a day and let him rest up finn suggested  daylights pride was touched  no you dont he cried  we all start at six  what time do youall want to be called  five  all right ill rouse youall out  you oughter have some sleep elijah counselled gravely  you cant go on forever  daylight was tired profoundly tired  even his iron body acknowledged weariness  every muscle was clamoring for bed and rest was appalled at continuance of exertion and at thought of the trail again  all this physical protest welled up into his brain in a wave of revolt  but deeper down scornful and defiant was life itself the essential fire of it whispering that all daylights fellows were looking on that now was the time to pile deed upon deed to flaunt his strength in the face of strength  it was merely life whispering its ancient lies and in league with it was whiskey with all its consummate effrontery and vainglory  mebbe youall think i aint weaned yet daylight demanded why i aint had a drink or a dance or seen a soul in two months  youall get to bed  ill call youall at five  and for the rest of the night he danced on in his stocking feet and at five in the morning rapping thunderously on the door of his new partners cabin he could be heard singing the song that had given him his name  burning daylight youall stewart river hunchers  burning daylight burning daylight  burning daylight    chapter vii  this time the trail was easier  it was better packed and they were not carrying mail against time  the days run was shorter and likewise the hours on trail  on his mail run daylight had played out three indians but his present partners knew that they must not be played out when they arrived at the stewart bars so they set the slower pace  and under this milder toil where his companions nevertheless grew weary daylight recuperated and rested up  at forty mile they laid over two days for the sake of the dogs and at sixty mile daylights team was left with the trader  unlike daylight after the terrible run from selkirk to circle city they had been unable to recuperate on the back trail  so the four men pulled on from sixty mile with a fresh team of dogs on daylights sled  the following night they camped in the cluster of islands at the mouth of the stewart  daylight talked town sites and though the others laughed at him he staked the whole maze of high wooded islands  just supposing the big strike does come on the stewart he argued mebbe youallll be in on it and then again mebbe youall wont  but i sure will  youalld better reconsider and go in with me on it  but they were stubborn  youre as bad as harper and joe ladue said joe hines theyre always at that game  you know that big flat jest below the klondike and under moosehide mountain  well the recorder at forty mile was tellin me they staked that not a month agothe harper  ladue town site  ha ha ha  elijah and finn joined him in his laughter but daylight was gravely in earnest  there she is he cried  the hunch is working  its in the air i tell youall  whatd theyall stake the big flat for if theyall didnt get the hunch  wish id staked it  the regret in his voice was provocative of a second burst of laughter  laugh youall laugh  thats whats the trouble with youall youall think goldhunting is the only way to make a stake  but let me tell youall that when the big strike sure does come youallll do a little surfacescratchin and muckraking but danged little youallll have to show for it  youall laugh at quicksilver in the riffles and think flour gold was manufactured by god almighty for the express purpose of fooling suckers and chechaquos  nothing but coarse gold for youall thats your way not getting half of it out of the ground and losing into the tailings half of what youall do get  but the men that land big will be them that stake the town sites organize the tradin companies start the banks  here the explosion of mirth drowned him out  banks in alaska the idea of it was excruciating  yep and start the stock exchanges  again they were convulsed  joe hines rolled over on his sleepingrobe holding his sides  and after them will come the big mining sharks that buy whole creeks where youall have been scratching like a lot of picayune hens and theyall will go to hydraulicking in summer and steamthawing in winter  steamthawing  that was the limit  daylight was certainly exceeding himself in his consummate funmaking steamthawingwhen even woodburning was an untried experiment a dream in the air  laugh dang you laugh why your eyes aint open yet  youall are a bunch of little mewing kittens  i tell youall if that strike comes on klondike harper and ladue will be millionaires and if it comes on stewart youall watch the elam harnish town site boom  in them days when youall come around makin poor mouths  he heaved a sigh of resignation  well i suppose ill have to give youall a grubstake or soup or something or other  daylight had vision  his scope had been rigidly limited yet whatever he saw he saw big  his mind was orderly his imagination practical and he never dreamed idly  when he superimposed a feverish metropolis on a waste of timbered snowcovered flat he predicated first the goldstrike that made the city possible and next he had an eye for steamboat landings sawmill and warehouse locations and all the needs of a farnorthern mining city  but this in turn was the mere setting for something bigger namely the play of temperament opportunities swarmed in the streets and buildings and human and economic relations of the city of his dream  it was a larger table for gambling  the limit was the sky with the southland on one side and the aurora borealis on the other  the play would be big bigger than any yukoner had ever imagined and he burning daylight would see that he got in on that play  in the meantime there was naught to show for it but the hunch but it was coming  as he would stake his last ounce on a good poker hand so he staked his life and effort on the hunch that the future held in store a big strike on the upper river  so he and his three companions with dogs and sleds and snowshoes toiled up the frozen breast of the stewart toiled on and on through the white wilderness where the unending stillness was never broken by the voices of men the stroke of an ax or the distant crack of a rifle  they alone moved through the vast and frozen quiet little mites of earthmen crawling their score of miles a day melting the ice that they might have water to drink camping in the snow at night their wolfdogs curled in frostrimed hairy bunches their eight snowshoes stuck on end in the snow beside the sleds  no signs of other men did they see though once they passed a rude polingboat cached on a platform by the river bank whoever had cached it had never come back for it and they wondered and mushed on another time they chanced upon the site of an indian village but the indians had disappeared undoubtedly they were on the higher reaches of the stewart in pursuit of the mooseherds  two hundred miles up from the yukon they came upon what elijah decided were the bars mentioned by al mayo  a permanent camp was made their outfit of food cached on a high platform to keep it from the dogs and they started work on the bars cutting their way down to gravel through the rim of ice  it was a hard and simple life  breakfast over and they were at work by the first gray light and when night descended they did their cooking and campchores smoked and yarned for a while then rolled up in their sleepingrobes and slept while the aurora borealis flamed overhead and the stars leaped and danced in the great cold  their fare was monotonous sourdough bread bacon beans and an occasional dish of rice cooked along with a handful of prunes  fresh meat they failed to obtain  there was an unwonted absence of animal life  at rare intervals they chanced upon the trail of a snowshoe rabbit or an ermine but in the main it seemed that all life had fled the land  it was a condition not unknown to them for in all their experience at one time or another they had travelled one year through a region teeming with game where a year or two or three years later no game at all would be found  gold they found on the bars but not in paying quantities elijah while on a hunt for moose fifty miles away had panned the surface gravel of a large creek and found good colors  they harnessed their dogs and with light outfits sledded to the place  here and possibly for the first time in the history of the yukon woodburning in sinking a shaft was tried  it was daylights initiative  after clearing away the moss and grass a fire of dry spruce was built  six hours of burning thawed eight inches of muck  their picks drove full depth into it and when they had shoveled out another fire was started  they worked early and late excited over the success of the experiment  six feet of frozen muck brought them to gravel likewise frozen here progress was slower  but they learned to handle their fires better and were soon able to thaw five and six inches at a burning  flour gold was in this gravel and after two feet it gave away again to muck  at seventeen feet they struck a thin streak of gravel and in it coarse gold testpans running as high as six and eight dollars  unfortunately this streak of gravel was not more than an inch thick  beneath it was more muck tangled with the trunks of ancient trees and containing fossil bones of forgotten monsters  but gold they had foundcoarse gold and what more likely than that the big deposit would be found on bedrock  down to bedrock they would go if it were forty feet away  they divided into two shifts working day and night on two shafts and the smoke of their burning rose continually  it was at this time that they ran short of beans and that elijah was despatched to the main camp to bring up more grub  elijah was one of the hardbitten oldtime travelers himself  the round trip was a hundred miles but he promised to be back on the third day one day going light two days returning heavy  instead he arrived on the night of the second day  they had just gone to bed when they heard him coming  what in hells the matter now henry finn demanded as the empty sled came into the circle of firelight and as he noted that elijahs long serious face was longer and even more serious  joe hines threw wood on the fire and the three men wrapped in their robes huddled up close to the warmth  elijahs whiskered face was matted with ice as were his eyebrows so that what of his fur garb he looked like a new england caricature of father christmas  you recollect that big spruce that held up the corner of the cache next to the river elijah began  the disaster was quickly told  the big tree with all the seeming of hardihood promising to stand for centuries to come had suffered from a hidden decay  in some way its rooted grip on the earth had weakened the added burden of the cache and the winter snow had been too much for it the balance it had so long maintained with the forces of its environment had been overthrown it had toppled and crashed to the ground wrecking the cache and in turn overthrowing the balance with environment that the four men and eleven dogs had been maintaining their supply of grub was gone  the wolverines had got into the wrecked cache and what they had not eaten they had destroyed  they plumb et all the bacon and prunes and sugar and dogfood elijah reported and gosh darn my buttons if they didnt gnaw open the sacks and scatter the flour and beans and rice from dan to beersheba  i found empty sacks where theyd dragged them a quarter of a mile away  nobody spoke for a long minute  it was nothing less than a catastrophe in the dead of an arctic winter and in a gameabandoned land to lose their grub  they were not panicstricken but they were busy looking the situation squarely in the face and considering  joe hines was the first to speak  we can pan the snow for the beans and rice though there want moren eight or ten pounds of rice left  and somebody will have to take a team and pull for sixty mile daylight said next  ill go said finn  they considered a while longer  but how are we going to feed the other team and three men till he gets back hines demanded  only one thing to it was elijahs contribution  youll have to take the other team joe and pull up the stewart till you find them indians  then you come back with a load of meat youll get here long before henry can make it from sixty mile and while youre gone therell only be daylight and me to feed and well feed good and small  and in the morning weallll pull for the cache and pan snow to find what grub weve got  daylight lay back as he spoke and rolled in his robe to sleep then added better turn in for an early start  two of you can take the dogs down  elijah and mell skin out on both sides and see if weall can scare up a moose on the way down    chapter viii  no time was lost  hines and finn with the dogs already on short rations were two days in pulling down  at noon of the third day elijah arrived reporting no moose sign  that night daylight came in with a similar report  as fast as they arrived the men had started careful panning of the snow all around the cache  it was a large task for they found stray beans fully a hundred yards from the cache  one more day all the men toiled the result was pitiful and the four showed their caliber in the division of the few pounds of food that had been recovered little as it was the lions share was left with daylight and elijah  the men who pulled on with the dogs one up the stewart and one down would come more quickly to grub  the two who remained would have to last out till the others returned furthermore while the dogs on several ounces each of beans a day would travel slowly nevertheless the men who travelled with them on a pinch would have the dogs themselves to eat but the men who remained when the pinch came would have no dogs  it was for this reason that daylight and elijah took the more desperate chance  they could not do less nor did they care to do less  the days passed and the winter began merging imperceptibly into the northland spring that comes like a thunderbolt of suddenness  it was the spring of 1896 that was preparing  each day the sun rose farther east of south remained longer in the sky and set farther to the west  march ended and april began and daylight and elijah lean and hungry wondered what had become of their two comrades  granting every delay and throwing in generous margins for good measure the time was long since passed when they should have returned  without doubt they had met with disaster the party had considered the possibility of disaster for one man and that had been the principal reason for despatching the two in different directions  but that disaster should have come to both of them was the final blow  in the meantime hoping against hope daylight and elija eked out a meagre existence  the thaw had not yet begun so they were able to gather the snow about the ruined cache and melt it in pots and pails and gold pans  allowed to stand for a while when poured off a thin deposit of slime was found on the bottoms of the vessels  this was the flour the infinitesimal trace of it scattered through thousands of cubic yards of snow  also in this slime occurred at intervals a watersoaked tealeaf or coffeeground and there were in it fragments of earth and litter  but the farther they worked away from the site of the cache the thinner became the trace of flour the smaller the deposit of slime  elijah was the older man and he weakened first so that he came to lie up most of the time in his furs  an occasional treesquirrel kept them alive  the hunting fell upon daylight and it was hard work  with but thirty rounds of ammunition he dared not risk a miss and since his rifle was a 4590 he was compelled to shoot the small creatures through the head  there were very few of them and days went by without seeing one  when he did see one he took infinite precautions he would stalk it for hours  a score of times with arms that shook from weakness he would draw a sight on the animal and refrain from pulling the trigger  his inhibition was a thing of iron  he was the master not til absolute certitude was his did he shoot  no matter how sharp the pangs of hunger and desire for that palpitating morsel of chattering life he refused to take the slightest risk of a miss  he born gambler was gambling in the bigger way  his life was the stake his cards were the cartridges and he played as only a big gambler could play with infinite precaution with infinite consideration each shot meant a squirrel and though days elapsed between shots it never changed his method of play  of the squirrels nothing was lost  even the skins were boiled to make broth the bones pounded into fragments that could be chewed and swallowed  daylight prospected through the snow and found occasional patches of mossberries  at the best mossberries were composed practically of seeds and water with a tough rind of skin about them but the berries he found were of the preceding year dry and shrivelled and the nourishment they contained verged on the minus quality  scarcely better was the bark of young saplings stewed for an hour and swallowed after prodigious chewing  april drew toward its close and spring smote the land  the days stretched out their length  under the heat of the sun the snow began to melt while from down under the snow arose the trickling of tiny streams  for twentyfour hours the chinook wind blew and in that twentyfour hours the snow was diminished fully a foot in depth  in the late afternoons the melting snow froze again so that its surface became ice capable of supporting a mans weight  tiny white snowbirds appeared from the south lingered a day and resumed their journey into the north  once high in the air looking for open water and ahead of the season a wedged squadron of wild geese honked northwards  and down by the river bank a clump of dwarf willows burst into bud  these young buds stewed seemed to posess an encouraging nutrition elijah took heart of hope though he was cast down again when daylight failed to find another clump of willows  the sap was rising in the trees and daily the trickle of unseen streamlets became louder as the frozen land came back to life but the river held in its bonds of frost  winter had been long months in riveting them and not in a day were they to be broken not even by the thunderbolt of spring  may came and stray lastyears mosquitoes fullgrown but harmless crawled out of rock crevices and rotten logs crickets began to chirp and more geese and ducks flew overhead  and still the river held  by may tenth the ice of the stewart with a great rending and snapping tore loose from the banks and rose three feet  but it did not go downstream  the lower yukon up to where the stewart flowed into it must first break and move on  until then the ice of the stewart could only rise higher and higher on the increasing flood beneath  when the yukon would break was problematical  two thousand miles away it flowed into bering sea and it was the ice conditions of bering sea that would determine when the yukon could rid itself of the millions of tons of ice that cluttered its breast  on the twelfth of may carrying their sleepingrobes a pail an ax and the precious rifle the two men started down the river on the ice their plan was to gain to the cached polingboat they had seen so that at the first open water they could launch it and drift with the stream to sixty mile  in their weak condition without food the going was slow and difficult elijah developed a habit of falling down and being unable to rise  daylight gave of his own strength to lift him to his feet whereupon the older man would stagger automatically on until he stumbled and fell again  on the day they should have reached the boat elijah collapsed utterly when daylight raised him he fell again  daylight essayed to walk with him supporting him but such was daylights own weakness that they fell together  dragging elijah to the bank a rude camp was made and daylight started out in search of squirrels  it was at this time that he likewise developed the falling habit  in the evening he found his first squirrel but darkness came on without his getting a certain shot with primitive patience he waited till next day and then within the hour the squirrel was his  the major portion he fed to elijah reserving for himself the tougher parts and the bones  but such is the chemistry of life that this small creature this trifle of meat that moved by being eaten transmuted to the meat of the men the same power to move  no longer did the squirrel run up spruce trees leap from branch to branch or cling chattering to giddy perches  instead the same energy that had done these things flowed into the wasted muscles and reeling wills of the men making them movenay moving themtill they tottered the several intervening miles to the cached boat underneath which they fell together and lay motionless a long time  light as the task would have been for a strong man to lower the small boat to the ground it took daylight hours  and many hours more day by day he dragged himself around it lying on his side to calk the gaping seams with moss  yet when this was done the river still held its ice had risen many feet but would not start downstream  and one more task waited the launching of the boat when the river ran water to receive it  vainly daylight staggered and stumbled and fell and crept through the snow that was wet with thaw or across it when the nights frost still crusted it beyond the weight of a man searching for one more squirrel striving to achieve one more transmutation of furry leap and scolding chatter into the lifts and tugs of a mans body that would hoist the boat over the rim of shoreice and slide it down into the stream  not till the twentieth of may did the river break  the downstream movement began at five in the morning and already were the days so long that daylight sat up and watched the icerun  elijah was too far gone to be interested in the spectacle  though vaguely conscious he lay without movement while the ice tore by great cakes of it caroming against the bank uprooting trees and gouging out earth by hundreds of tons  all about them the land shook and reeled from the shock of these tremendous collisions  at the end of an hour the run stopped somewhere below it was blocked by a jam  then the river began to rise lifting the ice on its breast till it was higher than the bank  from behind ever more water bore down and ever more millions of tons of ice added their weight to the congestion the pressures and stresses became terrific  huge cakes of ice were squeezed out till they popped into the air like melon seeds squeezed from between the thumb and forefinger of a child while all along the banks a wall of ice was forced up when the jam broke the noise of grinding and smashing redoubled  for another hour the run continued  the river fell rapidly  but the wall of ice on top the bank and extending down into the falling water remained  the tail of the icerun passed and for the first time in six months daylight saw open water  he knew that the ice had not yet passed out from the upper reaches of the stewart that it lay in packs and jams in those upper reaches and that it might break loose and come down in a second run any time but the need was too desperate for him to linger elijah was so far gone that he might pass at any moment  as for himself he was not sure that enough strength remained in his wasted muscles to launch the boat  it was all a gamble  if he waited for the second icerun elijah would surely die and most probably himself  if he succeeded in launching the boat if he kept ahead of the second icerun if he did not get caught by some of the runs from the upper yukon if luck favored in all these essential particulars as well as in a score of minor ones they would reach sixty mile and be saved ifand again the ifhe had strength enough to land the boat at sixty mile and not go by  he set to work  the wall of ice was five feet above the ground on which the boat rested  first prospecting for the best launchingplace he found where a huge cake of ice shelved upward from the river that ran fifteen feet below to the top of the wall  this was a score of feet away and at the end of an hour he had managed to get the boat that far  he was sick with nausea from his exertions and at times it seemed that blindness smote him for he could not see his eyes vexed with spots and points of light that were as excruciating as diamonddust his heart pounding up in his throat and suffocating him elijah betrayed no interest did not move nor open his eyes and daylight fought out his battle alone  at last falling on his knees from the shock of exertion he got the boat poised on a secure balance on top the wall  crawling on hands and knees he placed in the boat his rabbitskin robe the rifle and the pail  he did not bother with the ax  it meant an additional crawl of twenty feet and back and if the need for it should arise he well knew he would be past all need  elijah proved a bigger task than he had anticipated  a few inches at a time resting in between he dragged him over the ground and up a broken rubble of ice to the side of the boat but into the boat he could not get him  elijahs limp body was far more difficult to lift and handle than an equal weight of like dimensions but rigid  daylight failed to hoist him for the body collapsed at the middle like a partempty sack of corn getting into the boat daylight tried vainly to drag his comrade in after him  the best he could do was to get elijahs head and shoulders on top the gunwale  when he released his hold to heave from farther down the body elijah promptly gave at the middle and came down on the ice  in despair daylight changed his tactics  he struck the other in the face  god almighty aint youall a man he cried  there damn youall there  at each curse he struck him on the cheeks the nose the mouth striving by the shock of the hurt to bring back the sinking soul and farwandering will of the man  the eyes fluttered open  now listen he shouted hoarsely  when i get your head to the gunwale hang on  hear me  hang on  bite into it with your teeth but hang on  the eyes fluttered down but daylight knew the message had been received  again he got the helpless mans head and shoulders on the gunwale  hang on damn you  bite in he shouted as he shifted his grip lower down  one weak hand slipped off the gunwale the fingers of the other hand relaxed but elijah obeyed and his teeth held on  when the lift came his face ground forward and the splintery wood tore and crushed the skin from nose lips and chin and face downward he slipped on and down to the bottom of the boat till his limp middle collapsed across the gunwale and his legs hung down outside  but they were only his legs and daylight shoved them in after him  breathing heavily he turned elijah over on his back and covered him with his robes  the final task remainedthe launching of the boat  this of necessity was the severest of all for he had been compelled to load his comrade in aft of the balance  it meant a supreme effort at lifting  daylight steeled himself and began something must have snapped for though he was unaware of it the next he knew he was lying doubled on his stomach across the sharp stern of the boat evidently and for the first time in his life he had fainted furthermore it seemed to him that he was finished that he had not one more movement left in him and that strangest of all he did not care visions came to him clearcut and real and concepts sharp as steel cuttingedges he who all his days had looked on naked life had never seen so much of lifes nakedness before  for the first time he experienced a doubt of his own glorious personality  for the moment life faltered and forgot to lie  after all he was a little earthmaggot just like all the other earthmaggots like the squirrel he had eaten like the other men he had seen fail and die like joe hines and henry finn who had already failed and were surely dead like elijah lying there uncaring with his skinned face in the bottom of the boat  daylights position was such that from where he lay he could look up river to the bend around which sooner or later the next icerun would come  and as he looked he seemed to see back through the past to a time when neither white man nor indian was in the land and ever he saw the same stewart river winter upon winter breasted with ice and spring upon spring bursting that ice asunder and running free and he saw also into an illimitable future when the last generations of men were gone from off the face of alaska when he too would be gone and he saw ever remaining that river freezing and fresheting and running on and on  life was a liar and a cheat  it fooled all creatures  it had fooled him burning daylight one of its chiefest and most joyous exponents he was nothinga mere bunch of flesh and nerves and sensitiveness that crawled in the muck for gold that dreamed and aspired and gambled and that passed and was gone  only the dead things remained the things that were not flesh and nerves and sensitiveness the sand and muck and gravel the stretching flats the mountains the river itself freezing and breaking year by year down all the years  when all was said and done it was a scurvy game  the dice were loaded  those that died did not win and all died  who won  not even life the stoolpigeon the archcapper for the gamelife the ever flourishing graveyard the everlasting funeral procession  he drifted back to the immediate present for a moment and noted that the river still ran wide open and that a moosebird perched on the bow of the boat was surveying him impudently then he drifted dreamily back to his meditations  there was no escaping the end of the game  he was doomed surely to be out of it all  and what of it  he pondered that question again and again  conventional religion had passed daylight by  he had lived a sort of religion in his square dealing and right playing with other men and he had not indulged in vain metaphysics about future life  death ended all  he had always believed that and been unafraid  and at this moment the boat fifteen feet above the water and immovable himself fainting with weakness and without a particle of strength left in him he still believed that death ended all and he was still unafraid  his views were too simply and solidly based to be overthrown by the first squirm or the last of deathfearing life  he had seen men and animals die and into the field of his vision by scores came such deaths  he saw them over again just as he had seen them at the time and they did not shake him  what of it  they were dead and dead long since  they werent bothering about it  they werent lying on their bellies across a boat and waiting to die  death was easyeasier than he had ever imagined and now that it was near the thought of it made him glad  a new vision came to him  he saw the feverish city of his dreamthe gold metropolis of the north perched above the yukon on a high earthbank and farspreading across the flat  he saw the river steamers tied to the bank and lined against it three deep he saw the sawmills working and the long dogteams with double sleds behind freighting supplies to the diggings  and he saw further the gamblinghouses banks stockexchanges and all the gear and chips and markers the chances and opportunities of a vastly bigger gambling game than any he had ever seen  it was sure hell he thought with the hunch aworking and that big strike coming to be out of it all  life thrilled and stirred at the thought and once more began uttering his ancient lies  daylight rolled over and off the boat leaning against it as he sat on the ice  he wanted to be in on that strike  and why shouldnt he somewhere in all those wasted muscles of his was enough strength if he could gather it all at once to upend the boat and launch it  quite irrelevantly the idea suggested itself of buying a share in the klondike town site from harper and joe ladue  they would surely sell a third interest cheap  then if the strike came on the stewart he would be well in on it with the elam harnish town site if on the klondike he would not be quite out of it  in the meantime he would gather strength  he stretched out on the ice full length face downward and for half an hour he lay and rested then he arose shook the flashing blindness from his eyes and took hold of the boat  he knew his condition accurately  if the first effort failed the following efforts were doomed to fail  he must pull all his rallied strength into the one effort and so thoroughly must he put all of it in that there would be none left for other attempts  he lifted and he lifted with the soul of him as well as with the body consuming himself body and spirit in the effort  the boat rose  he thought he was going to faint but he continued to lift  he felt the boat give as it started on its downward slide  with the last shred of his strength he precipitated himself into it landing in a sick heap on elijahs legs  he was beyond attempting to rise and as he lay he heard and felt the boat take the water  by watching the treetops he knew it was whirling  a smashing shock and flying fragments of ice told him that it had struck the bank  a dozen times it whirled and struck and then it floated easily and free  daylight came to and decided he had been asleep  the sun denoted that several hours had passed  it was early afternoon he dragged himself into the stern and sat up  the boat was in the middle of the stream the wooded banks with their baselines of flashing ice were slipping by  near him floated a huge uprooted pine  a freak of the current brought the boat against it  crawling forward he fastened the painter to a root  the tree deeper in the water was travelling faster and the painter tautened as the boat took the tow  then with a last giddy look around wherein he saw the banks tilting and swaying and the sun swinging in pendulumsweep across the sky daylight wrapped himself in his rabbitskin robe lay down in the bottom and fell asleep  when he awoke it was dark night  he was lying on his back and he could see the stars shining  a subdued murmur of swollen waters could be heard  a sharp jerk informed him that the boat swerving slack into the painter had been straightened out by the swiftermoving pine tree a piece of stray driftice thumped against the boat and grated along its side  well the following jam hadnt caught him yet was his thought as he closed his eyes and slept again  it was bright day when next he opened his eyes  the sun showed it to be midday  a glance around at the faraway banks and he knew that he was on the mighty yukon  sixty mile could not be far away  he was abominably weak  his movements were slow fumbling and inaccurate accompanied by panting and headswimming as he dragged himself into a sittingup position in the stern his rifle beside him  he looked a long time at elijah but could not see whether he breathed or not and he was too immeasurably far away to make an investigation  he fell to dreaming and meditating again dreams and thoughts being often broken by sketches of blankness wherein he neither slept nor was unconscious nor was aware of anything  it seemed to him more like cogs slipping in his brain  and in this intermittent way he reviewed the situation  he was still alive and most likely would be saved but how came it that he was not lying dead across the boat on top the icerim  then he recollected the great final effort he had made  but why had he made it  he asked himself  it had not been fear of death he had not been afraid that was sure  then he remembered the hunch and the big strike he believed was coming and he knew that the spur had been his desire to sit in for a hand at that big game and again why  what if he made his million  he would die just the same as those that never won more than grubstakes  then again why  but the blank stretches in his thinking process began to come more frequently and he surrendered to the delightful lassitude that was creeping over him  he roused with a start  something had whispered in him that he must awake  abruptly he saw sixty mile not a hundred feet away  the current had brought him to the very door  but the same current was now sweeping him past and on into the downriver wilderness  no one was in sight  the place might have been deserted save for the smoke he saw rising from the kitchen chimney  he tried to call but found he had no voice left  an unearthly guttural hiss alternately rattled and wheezed in his throat  he fumbled for the rifle got it to his shoulder and pulled the trigger  the recoil of the discharge tore through his frame racking it with a thousand agonies  the rifle had fallen across his knees and an attempt to lift it to his shoulder failed  he knew he must be quick and felt that he was fainting so he pulled the trigger of the gun where it lay  this time it kicked off and overboard  but just before darkness rushed over him he saw the kitchen door open and a woman look out of the big log house that was dancing a monstrous jig among the trees    chapter ix  ten days later harper and joe ladue arrived at sixty mile and daylight still a trifle weak but strong enough to obey the hunch that had come to him traded a third interest in his stewart town site for a third interest in theirs on the klondike  they had faith in the upper country and harper left downstream with a raftload of supplies to start a small post at the mouth of the klondike  why dont you tackle indian river daylight harper advised at parting  theres whole slathers of creeks and draws draining in up there and somewhere gold just crying to be found  thats my hunch theres a big strike coming and indian river aint going to be a million miles away  and the place is swarming with moose joe ladue added  bob hendersons up there somewhere been there three years now swearing something big is going to happen living offn straight moose and prospecting around like a crazy man  daylight decided to go indian river a flutter as he expressed it but elijah could not be persuaded into accompanying him elijahs soul had been seared by famine and he was obsessed by fear of repeating the experience  i jest cant bear to separate from grub he explained  i know its downright foolishness but i jest cant help it  its all i can do to tear myself away from the table when i know im full to bustin and aint got storage for another bite  im going back to circle to camp by a cache until i get cured  daylight lingered a few days longer gathering strength and arranging his meagre outfit  he planned to go in light carrying a pack of seventyfive pounds and making his five dogs pack as well indian fashion loading them with thirty pounds each depending on the report of ladue he intended to follow bob hendersons example and live practically on straight meat  when jack kearns scow laden with the sawmill from lake linderman tied up at sixty mile daylight bundled his outfit and dogs on board turned his townsite application over to elijah to be filed and the same day was landed at the mouth of indian river  forty miles up the river at what had been described to him as quartz creek he came upon signs of bob hendersons work and also at australia creek thirty miles farther on  the weeks came and went but daylight never encountered the other man  however he found moose plentiful and he and his dogs prospered on the meat diet  he found pay that was no more than wages on a dozen surface bars and from the generous spread of flour gold in the muck and gravel of a score of creeks he was more confident than ever that coarse gold in quantity was waiting to be unearthed  often he turned his eyes to the northward ridge of hills and pondered if the gold came from them  in the end he ascended dominion creek to its head crossed the divide and came down on the tributary to the klondike that was later to be called hunker creek  while on the divide had he kept the big dome on his right he would have come down on the gold bottom so named by bob henderson whom he would have found at work on it taking out the first paygold ever panned on the klondike  instead daylight continued down hunker to the klondike and on to the summer fishing camp of the indians on the yukon  here for a day he camped with carmack a squawman and his indian brotherinlaw skookum jim bought a boat and with his dogs on board drifted down the yukon to forty mile  august was drawing to a close the days were growing shorter and winter was coming on  still with unbounded faith in his hunch that a strike was coming in the upper country his plan was to get together a party of four or five and if that was impossible at least a partner and to pole back up the river before the freezeup to do winter prospecting  but the men of forty mile were without faith  the diggings to the westward were good enough for them  then it was that carmack his brotherinlaw skookum jim and cultus charlie another indian arrived in a canoe at forty mile went straight to the gold commissioner and recorded three claims and a discovery claim on bonanza creek  after that in the sourdough saloon that night they exhibited coarse gold to the sceptical crowd  men grinned and shook their heads  they had seen the motions of a gold strike gone through before  this was too patently a scheme of harpers and joe ladues trying to entice prospecting in the vicinity of their town site and trading post  and who was carmack  a squawman  and who ever heard of a squawman striking anything  and what was bonanza creek merely a moose pasture entering the klondike just above its mouth and known to oldtimers as rabbit creek  now if daylight or bob henderson had recorded claims and shown coarse gold theyd known there was something in it  but carmack the squawman and skookum jim  and cultus charlie  no no that was asking too much  daylight too was sceptical and this despite his faith in the upper country  had he not only a few days before seen carmack loafing with his indians and with never a thought of prospecting  but at eleven that night sitting on the edge of his bunk and unlacing his moccasins a thought came to him  he put on his coat and hat and went back to the sourdough  carmack was still there flashing his coarse gold in the eyes of an unbelieving generation  daylight ranged alongside of him and emptied carmacks sack into a blower  this he studied for a long time then from his own sack into another blower he emptied several ounces of circle city and forty mile gold  again for a long time he studied and compared  finally he pocketed his own gold returned carmacks and held up his hand for silence  boys i want to tell youall something he said  shes sure comethe upriver strike  and i tell youall clear and forcible this is it  there aint never been gold like that in a blower in this country before  its new gold  its got more silver in it  youall can see it by the color  carmacks sure made a strike  whoalls got faith to come along with me  there were no volunteers  instead laughter and jeers went up  mebbe you got a town site up there some one suggested  i sure have was the retort and a third interest in harper and ladues  and i can see my corner lots selling out for more than your henscratching ever turned up on birch creek  thats all right daylight one curly parson interposed soothingly youve got a reputation and we know youre dead sure on the square but youre as likely as any to be mistook on a flimflam game such as these loafers is putting up  i ask you straight when did carmack do this here prospecting  you said yourself he was lying in camp fishing salmon along with his siwash relations and that was only the other day  and daylight told the truth carmack interrupted excitedly and im telling the truth the gospel truth  i wasnt prospecting  hadnt no idea of it  but when daylight pulls out the very same day who drifts in down river on a raftload of supplies but bob henderson  hed come out to sixty mile planning to go back up indian river and portage the grub across the divide between quartz creek and gold bottom  where in hells gold bottom curly parsons demanded  over beyond bonanza that was rabbit creek the squawman went on its a draw of a big creek that runs into the klondike thats the way i went up but i come back by crossing the divide keeping along the crest several miles and dropping down into bonanza  come along with me carmack and get staked says bob henderson to me  ive hit it this time on gold bottom  ive took out fortyfive ounces already and i went along skookum jim and cultus charlie too  and we all staked on gold bottom i come back by bonanza on the chance of finding a moose  along down bonanza we stopped and cooked grub  i went to sleep and what does skookum jim do but try his hand at prospecting hed been watching henderson you see  he goes right slap up to the foot of a birch tree first pan fills it with dirt and washes out moren a dollar coarse gold  then he wakes me up and i goes at it  i got two and a half the first lick  then i named the creek bonanza staked discovery and we come here and recorded  he looked about him anxiously for signs of belief but found himself in a circle of incredulous facesall save daylight who had studied his countenance while he told his story  how much is harper and ladue givin you for manufacturing a stampede some one asked  they dont know nothing about it carmack answered  i tell you its the god almightys truth  i washed out three ounces in an hour  and theres the gold daylight said  i tell youall boys they aint never been gold like that in the blower before  look at the color of it  a trifle darker curly parson said  most likely carmacks been carrying a couple of silver dollars along in the same sack and whats more if theres anything in it why aint bob henderson smoking along to record  hes up on gold bottom carmack explained  we made the strike coming back  a burst of laughter was his reward  whoallll go pardners with me and pull out in a polingboat tomorrow for this here bonanza daylight asked  no one volunteered  then whoallll take a job from me cash wages in advance to pole up a thousand pounds of grub  curly parsons and another pat monahan accepted and with his customary speed daylight paid them their wages in advance and arranged the purchase of the supplies though he emptied his sack in doing so he was leaving the sourdough when he suddenly turned back to the bar from the door  got another hunch was the query  i sure have he answered  flours sure going to be worth what a man will pay for it this winter up on the klondike  wholl lend me some money  on the instant a score of the men who had declined to accompany him on the wildgoose chase were crowding about him with proffered goldsacks  how much flour do you want asked the alaska commercial companys storekeeper  about two ton  the proffered goldsacks were not withdrawn though their owners were guilty of an outrageous burst of merriment  what are you going to do with two tons the storekeeper demanded  son daylight made reply youall aint been in this country long enough to know all its curves  im going to start a sauerkraut factory and combined dandruff remedy  he borrowed money right and left engaging and paying six other men to bring up the flour in half as many more polingboats again his sack was empty and he was heavily in debt  curly parsons bowed his head on the bar with a gesture of despair  what gets me he moaned is what youre going to do with it all  ill tell youall in simple a b c and one two three daylight held up one finger and began checking off  hunch number one a big strike coming in upper country  hunch number two carmacks made it hunch number three aint no hunch at all  its a cinch  if one and two is right then flour just has to go skyhigh  if im riding hunches one and two i just got to ride this cinch which is number three  if im right flourll balance gold on the scales this winter i tell youall boys when youall got a hunch play it for all its worth  whats luck good for if youall aint to ride it  and when youall ride it ride like hell  ive been years in this country just waiting for the right hunch to come along  and here she is well im going to play her thats all  good night youall good night    chapter x  still men were without faith in the strike  when daylight with his heavy outfit of flour arrived at the mouth of the klondike he found the big flat as desolate and tenantless as ever  down close by the river chief isaac and his indians were camped beside the frames on which they were drying salmon several oldtimers were also in camp there  having finished their summer work on ten mile creek they had come down the yukon bound for circle city  but at sixty mile they had learned of the strike and stopped off to look over the ground  they had just returned to their boat when daylight landed his flour and their report was pessimistic  damned moosepasture quoth one long jim harney pausing to blow into his tin mug of tea  dont you have nothin to do with it daylight  its a blamed rotten sell  theyre just going through the motions of a strike  harper and ladues behind it and carmacks the stoolpigeon  whoever heard of mining a moosepasture half a mile between rimrock and god alone knows how far to bedrock  daylight nodded sympathetically and considered for a space  did youall pan any he asked finally  pan hell was the indignant answer  think i was born yesterday only a chechaquod fool around that pasture long enough to fill a pan of dirt  you dont catch me at any such foolishness  one look was enough for me  were pulling on in the morning for circle city  i aint never had faith in this upper country  headreaches of the tanana is good enough for me from now on and mark my words when the big strike comes shell come down river  johnny here staked a couple of miles below discovery but he dont know no better  johnny looked shamefaced  i just did it for fun he explained  id give my chance in the creek for a pound of star plug  ill go you daylight said promptly  but dont youall come squealing if i take twenty or thirty thousand out of it  johnny grinned cheerfully  gimme the tobacco he said  wish id staked alongside long jim murmured plaintively  it aint too late daylight replied  but its a twentymile walk there and back  ill stake it for you tomorrow when i go up daylight offered  then you do the same as johnny  get the fees from tim logan hes tending bar in the sourdough and hell lend it to me  then fill in your own name transfer to me and turn the papers over to tim  me too chimed in the third oldtimer  and for three pounds of star plug chewing tobacco daylight bought outright three fivehundredfoot claims on bonanza  he could still stake another claim in his own name the others being merely transfers  must say youre almighty brash with your chewin tobacco long jim grinned  got a factory somewheres  nope but i got a hunch was the retort and i tell youall its cheaper than dirt to ride her at the rate of three plugs for three claims  but an hour later at his own camp joe ladue strode in fresh from bonanza creek  at first noncommittal over carmacks strike then later dubious he finally offered daylight a hundred dollars for his share in the town site  cash daylight queried  sure  there she is  so saying ladue pulled out his goldsack  daylight hefted it absentmindedly and still absentmindedly untied the strings and ran some of the golddust out on his palm  it showed darker than any dust he had ever seen with the exception of carmacks he ran the gold back tied the mouth of the sack and returned it to ladue  i guess youall need it moren i do was daylights comment  nope got plenty more the other assured him  where that come from  daylight was all innocence as he asked the question and ladue received the question as stolidly as an indian  yet for a swift instant they looked into each others eyes and in that instant an intangible something seemed to flash out from all the body and spirit of joe ladue  and it seemed to daylight that he had caught this flash sensed a secret something in the knowledge and plans behind the others eyes  youall know the creek bettern me daylight went on  and if my share in the town sites worth a hundred to youall with what youall know its worth a hundred to me whether i know it or not  ill give you three hundred ladue offered desperately  still the same reasoning  no matter what i dont know its worth to me whatever youall are willing to pay for it  then it was that joe ladue shamelessly gave over  he led daylight away from the camp and men and told him things in confidence  shes sure there he said in conclusion  i didnt sluice it or cradle it  i panned it all in that sack yesterday on the rimrock i tell you you can shake it out of the grassroots and whats on bedrock down in the bottom of the creek they aint no way of tellin but shes big i tell you big  keep it quiet and locate all you can its in spots but i wouldnt be none surprised if some of them claims yielded as high as fifty thousand  the only trouble is that its spotted                                  a month passed by and bonanza creek remained quiet  a sprinkling of men had staked but most of them after staking had gone on down to forty mile and circle city  the few that possessed sufficient faith to remain were busy building log cabins against the coming of winter carmack and his indian relatives were occupied in building a sluice box and getting a head of water  the work was slow for they had to saw their lumber by hand from the standing forest  but farther down bonanza were four men who had drifted in from up river dan mcgilvary dave mckay dave edwards and harry waugh  they were a quiet party neither asking nor giving confidences and they herded by themselves but daylight who had panned the spotted rim of carmacks claim and shaken coarse gold from the grassroots and who had panned the rim at a hundred other places up and down the length of the creek and found nothing was curious to know what lay on bedrock  he had noted the four quiet men sinking a shaft close by the stream and he had heard their whipsaw going as they made lumber for the sluice boxes he did not wait for an invitation but he was present the first day they sluiced  and at the end of five hours shovelling for one man he saw them take out thirteen ounces and a half of gold  it was coarse gold running from pinheads to a twelvedollar nugget and it had come from off bedrock  the first fall snow was flying that day and the arctic winter was closing down but daylight had no eyes for the bleakgray sadness of the dying shortlived summer  he saw his vision coming true and on the big flat was upreared anew his golden city of the snows  gold had been found on bedrock  that was the big thing  carmacks strike was assured  daylight staked a claim in his own name adjoining the three he had purchased with his plug tobacco  this gave him a block of property two thousand feet long and extending in width from rimrock to rimrock  returning that night to his camp at the mouth of klondike he found in it kama the indian he had left at dyea  kama was travelling by canoe bringing in the last mail of the year  in his possession was some two hundred dollars in golddust which daylight immediately borrowed  in return he arranged to stake a claim for him which he was to record when he passed through forty mile  when kama departed next morning he carried a number of letters for daylight addressed to all the oldtimers down river in which they were urged to come up immediately and stake  also kama carried letters of similar import given him by the other men on bonanza  it will sure be the goshdangdest stampede that ever was daylight chuckled as he tried to vision the excited populations of forty mile and circle city tumbling into polingboats and racing the hundreds of miles up the yukon for he knew that his word would be unquestioningly accepted  with the arrival of the first stampeders bonanza creek woke up and thereupon began a longdistance race between unveracity and truth wherein lie no matter how fast men were continually overtaken and passed by truth  when men who doubted carmacks report of two and a half to the pan themselves panned two and a half they lied and said that they were getting an ounce  and long ere the lie was fairly on its way they were getting not one ounce but five ounces  this they claimed was ten ounces but when they filled a pan of dirt to prove the lie they washed out twelve ounces  and so it went  they continued valiantly to lie but the truth continued to outrun them  one day in december daylight filled a pan from bed rock on his own claim and carried it into his cabin  here a fire burned and enabled him to keep water unfrozen in a canvas tank  he squatted over the tank and began to wash  earth and gravel seemed to fill the pan  as he imparted to it a circular movement the lighter coarser particles washed out over the edge  at times he combed the surface with his fingers raking out handfuls of gravel  the contents of the pan diminished  as it drew near to the bottom for the purpose of fleeting and tentative examination he gave the pan a sudden sloshing movement emptying it of water  and the whole bottom showed as if covered with butter  thus the yellow gold flashed up as the muddy water was flirted away  it was goldgolddust coarse gold nuggets large nuggets  he was all alone  he set the pan down for a moment and thought long thoughts  then he finished the washing and weighed the result in his scales  at the rate of sixteen dollars to the ounce the pan had contained seven hundred and odd dollars  it was beyond anything that even he had dreamed  his fondest anticipations had gone no farther than twenty or thirty thousand dollars to a claim but here were claims worth half a million each at the least even if they were spotted  he did not go back to work in the shaft that day nor the next nor the next  instead capped and mittened a light stampeding outfit including his rabbit skin robe strapped on his back he was out and away on a manydays tramp over creeks and divides inspecting the whole neighboring territory  on each creek he was entitled to locate one claim but he was chary in thus surrendering up his chances  on hunker creek only did he stake a claim  bonanza creek he found staked from mouth to source while every little draw and pup and gulch that drained into it was likewise staked  little faith was had in these sidestreams they had been staked by the hundreds of men who had failed to get in on bonanza  the most popular of these creeks was adams  the one least fancied was eldorado which flowed into bonanza just above karmacks discovery claim  even daylight disliked the looks of eldorado but still riding his hunch he bought a half share in one claim on it for half a sack of flour  a month later he paid eight hundred dollars for the adjoining claim  three months later enlarging this block of property he paid forty thousand for a third claim and though it was concealed in the future he was destined not long after to pay one hundred and fifty thousand for a fourth claim on the creek that had been the least liked of all the creeks  in the meantime and from the day he washed seven hundred dollars from a single pan and squatted over it and thought a long thought he never again touched hand to pick and shovel  as he said to joe ladue the night of that wonderful washing  joe i aint never going to work hard again  heres where i begin to use my brains  im going to farm gold  gold will grow gold if youall have the savvee and can get hold of some for seed  when i seen them seven hundred dollars in the bottom of the pan i knew i had the seed at last  where are you going to plant it joe ladue had asked  and daylight with a wave of his hand definitely indicated the whole landscape and the creeks that lay beyond the divides  there she is he said and youall just watch my smoke theres millions here for the man who can see them  and i seen all them millions this afternoon when them seven hundred dollars peeped up at me from the bottom of the pan and chirruped well if here aint burning daylight come at last    chapter xi  the hero of the yukon in the younger days before the carmack strike burning daylight now became the hero of the strike  the story of his hunch and how he rode it was told up and down the land  certainly he had ridden it far and away beyond the boldest for no five of the luckiest held the value in claims that he held  and furthermore he was still riding the hunch and with no diminution of daring  the wise ones shook their heads and prophesied that he would lose every ounce he had won he was speculating they contended as if the whole country was made of gold and no man could win who played a placer strike in that fashion  on the other hand his holdings were reckoned as worth millions and there were men so sanguine that they held the man a fool who coppered6 any bet daylight laid  behind his magnificent freehandedness and careless disregard for money were hard practical judgment imagination and vision and the daring of the big gambler he foresaw what with his own eyes he had never seen and he played to win much or lose all  theres too much gold here in bonanza to be just a pocket he argued its sure come from a motherlode somewhere and other creeks will show up  youall keep your eyes on indian river the creeks that drain that side the klondike watershed are just as likely to have gold as the creeks that drain this side  and he backed this opinion to the extent of grubstaking half a dozen parties of prospectors across the big divide into the indian river region  other men themselves failing to stake on lucky creeks he put to work on his bonanza claims  and he paid them wellsixteen dollars a day for an eighthour shift and he ran three shifts  he had grub to start them on and when on the last water the bella arrived loaded with provisions he traded a warehouse site to jack kearns for a supply of grub that lasted all his men through the winter of 1896  and that winter when famine pinched and flour sold for two dollars a pound he kept three shifts of men at work on all four of the bonanza claims other mineowners paid fifteen dollars a day to their men but he had been the first to put men to work and from the first he paid them a full ounce a day  one result was that his were picked men and they more than earned their higher pay  one of his wildest plays took place in the early winter after the freezeup  hundreds of stampeders after staking on other creeks than bonanza had gone on disgruntled down river to forty mile and circle city  daylight mortgaged one of his bonanza dumps with the alaska commercial company and tucked a letter of credit into his pouch  then he harnessed his dogs and went down on the ice at a pace that only he could travel  one indian down another indian back and four teams of dogs was his record  and at forty mile and circle city he bought claims by the score many of these were to prove utterly worthless but some few of them were to show up more astoundingly than any on bonanza he bought right and left paying as low as fifty dollars and as high as five thousand  this highest one he bought in the tivoli saloon  it was an upper claim on eldorado and when he agreed to the price jacob wilkins an oldtimer just returned from a look at the moosepasture got up and left the room saying  daylight ive known you seven year and youve always seemed sensible till now  and now youre just letting them rob you right and left thats what it isrobbery  five thousand for a claim on that damned moosepasture is bunco  i just cant stay in the room and see you buncoed that way  i tell youall daylight answered wilkins carmacks strikes so big that weall cant see it all  its a lottery  every claim i buy is a ticket  and theres sure going to be some capital prizes  jacob wilkins standing in the open door sniffed incredulously  now supposing wilkins daylight went on supposing youall knew it was going to rain soup  whatd youall do  buy spoons of course well im sure buying spoons  shes going to rain soup up there on the klondike and them that has forks wont be catching none of it  but wilkins here slammed the door behind him and daylight broke off to finish the purchase of the claim  back in dawson though he remained true to his word and never touched hand to pick and shovel he worked as hard as ever in his life  he had a thousand irons in the fire and they kept him busy  representation work was expensive and he was compelled to travel often over the various creeks in order to decide which claims should lapse and which should be retained  a quartz miner himself in his early youth before coming to alaska he dreamed of finding the motherlode  a placer camp he knew was ephemeral while a quartz camp abided and he kept a score of men in the quest for months  the motherlode was never found and years afterward he estimated that the search for it had cost him fifty thousand dollars  but he was playing big  heavy as were his expenses he won more heavily  he took lays bought half shares shared with the men he grubstaked and made personal locations  day and night his dogs were ready and he owned the fastest teams so that when a stampede to a new discovery was on it was burning daylight to the fore through the longest coldest nights till he blazed his stakes next to discovery in one way or another to say nothing of the many worthless creeks he came into possession of properties on the good creeks such as sulphur dominion excelsis siwash cristo alhambra and doolittle  the thousands he poured out flowed back in tens of thousands  forty mile men told the story of his two tons of flour and made calculations of what it had returned him that ranged from half a million to a million one thing was known beyond all doubt namely that the half share in the first eldorado claim bought by him for a half sack of flour was worth five hundred thousand  on the other hand it was told that when freda the dancer arrived from over the passes in a peterborough canoe in the midst of a drive of mushice on the yukon and when she offered a thousand dollars for ten sacks and could find no sellers he sent the flour to her as a present without ever seeing her  in the same way ten sacks were sent to the lone catholic priest who was starting the first hospital  his generosity was lavish  others called it insane  at a time when riding his hunch he was getting half a million for half a sack of flour it was nothing less than insanity to give twenty whole sacks to a dancinggirl and a priest  but it was his way money was only a marker  it was the game that counted with him the possession of millions made little change in him except that he played the game more passionately  temperate as he had always been save on rare occasions now that he had the wherewithal for unlimited drinks and had daily access to them he drank even less  the most radical change lay in that except when on trail he no longer did his own cooking  a brokendown miner lived in his log cabin with him and now cooked for him  but it was the same food bacon beans flour prunes dried fruits and rice he still dressed as formerly overalls german socks moccasins flannel shirt fur cap and blanket coat  he did not take up with cigars which cost the cheapest from half a dollar to a dollar each  the same bull durham and brownpaper cigarette handrolled contented him  it was true that he kept more dogs and paid enormous prices for them  they were not a luxury but a matter of business  he needed speed in his travelling and stampeding  and by the same token he hired a cook  he was too busy to cook for himself that was all  it was poor business playing for millions to spend time building fires and boiling water  dawson grew rapidly that winter of 1896  money poured in on daylight from the sale of town lots  he promptly invested it where it would gather more  in fact he played the dangerous game of pyramiding and no more perilous pyramiding than in a placer camp could be imagined but he played with his eyes wide open  youall just wait till the news of this strike reaches the outside he told his oldtimer cronies in the moosehorn saloon the news wont get out till next spring  then theres going to be three rushes  a summer rush of men coming in light a fall rush of men with outfits and a spring rush the next year after that of fifty thousand youall wont be able to see the landscape for chechaquos  well theres the summer and fall rush of 1897 to commence with  what are youall going to do about it  what are you going to do about it a friend demanded  nothing he answered  ive sure already done it  ive got a dozen gangs strung out up the yukon getting out logs  youallll see their rafts coming down after the river breaks  cabins they sure will be worth what a man can pay for them next fall lumber it will sure go to topnotch  ive got two sawmills freighting in over the passes theyll come down as soon as the lakes open up  and if youall are thinking of needing lumber ill make youall contracts right nowthree hundred dollars a thousand undressed  corner lots in desirable locations sold that winter for from ten to thirty thousand dollars  daylight sent word out over the trails and passes for the newcomers to bring down lografts and as a result the summer of 1897 saw his sawmills working day and night on three shifts and still he had logs left over with which to build cabins  these cabins land included sold at from one to several thousand dollars twostory log buildings in the business part of town brought him from forty to fifty thousand dollars apiece  these fresh accretions of capital were immediately invested in other ventures  he turned gold over and over until everything that he touched seemed to turn to gold  but that first wild winter of carmacks strike taught daylight many things  despite the prodigality of his nature he had poise  he watched the lavish waste of the mushroom millionaires and failed quite to understand it  according to his nature and outlook it was all very well to toss an ante away in a nights frolic  that was what he had done the night of the pokergame in circle city when he lost fifty thousandall that he possessed but he had looked on that fifty thousand as a mere ante  when it came to millions it was different such a fortune was a stake and was not to be sown on barroom floors literally sown flung broadcast out of the moosehide sacks by drunken millionaires who had lost all sense of proportion  there was mcmann who ran up a single barroom bill of thirtyeight thousand dollars and jimmie the rough who spent one hundred thousand a month for four months in riotous living and then fell down drunk in the snow one march night and was frozen to death and swiftwater bill who after spending three valuable claims in an extravagance of debauchery borrowed three thousand dollars with which to leave the country and who out of this sum because the ladylove that had jilted him liked eggs cornered the one hundred and ten dozen eggs on the dawson market paying twentyfour dollars a dozen for them and promptly feeding them to the wolfdogs  champagne sold at from forty to fifty dollars a quart and canned oyster stew at fifteen dollars  daylight indulged in no such luxuries he did not mind treating a barroom of men to whiskey at fifty cents a drink but there was somewhere in his own extravagant nature a sense of fitness and arithmetic that revolted against paying fifteen dollars for the contents of an oyster can  on the other hand he possibly spent more money in relieving hardluck cases than did the wildest of the new millionaires on insane debauchery  father judge of the hospital could have told of far more important donations than that first ten sacks of flour  and oldtimers who came to daylight invariably went away relieved according to their need but fifty dollars for a quart of fizzy champagne  that was appalling  and yet he still on occasion made one of his oldtime hellroaring nights  but he did so for different reasons first it was expected of him because it had been his way in the old days  and second he could afford it  but he no longer cared quite so much for that form of diversion  he had developed in a new way the taste for power  it had become a lust with him  by far the wealthiest miner in alaska he wanted to be still wealthier  it was a big game he was playing in and he liked it better than any other game  in a way the part he played was creative  he was doing something  and at no time striking another chord of his nature could he take the joy in a milliondollar eldorado dump that was at all equivalent to the joy he took in watching his two sawmills working and the big down river lografts swinging into the bank in the big eddy just above moosehide mountain  gold even on the scales was after all an abstraction  it represented things and the power to do  but the sawmills were the things themselves concrete and tangible and they were things that were a means to the doing of more things they were dreams come true hard and indubitable realizations of fairy gossamers  with the summer rush from the outside came special correspondents for the big newspapers and magazines and one and all using unlimited space they wrote daylight up so that so far as the world was concerned daylight loomed the largest figure in alaska  of course after several months the world became interested in the spanish war and forgot all about him but in the klondike itself daylight still remained the most prominent figure  passing along the streets of dawson all heads turned to follow him and in the saloons chechaquos watched him awesomely scarcely taking their eyes from him as long as he remained in their range of vision  not alone was he the richest man in the country but he was burning daylight the pioneer the man who almost in the midst of antiquity of that young land had crossed the chilcoot and drifted down the yukon to meet those elder giants al mayo and jack mcquestion  he was the burning daylight of scores of wild adventures the man who carried word to the icebound whaling fleet across the tundra wilderness to the arctic sea who raced the mail from circle to salt water and back again in sixty days who saved the whole tanana tribe from perishing in the winter of 91in short the man who smote the chechaquos imaginations more violently than any other dozen men rolled into one  he had the fatal facility for selfadvertisement  things he did no matter how adventitious or spontaneous struck the popular imagination as remarkable  and the latest thing he had done was always on mens lips whether it was being first in the heartbreaking stampede to danish creek in killing the record baldface grizzly over on sulphur creek or in winning the singlepaddle canoe race on the queens birthday after being forced to participate at the last moment by the failure of the sourdough representative to appear  thus one night in the moosehorn he locked horns with jack kearns in the longpromised return game of poker  the sky and eight oclock in the morning were made the limits and at the close of the game daylights winnings were two hundred and thirty thousand dollars  to jack kearns already a severaltimes millionaire this loss was not vital  but the whole community was thrilled by the size of the stakes and each one of the dozen correspondents in the field sent out a sensational article   6 to copper a term in faro meaning to play a card to lose    chapter xii  despite his many sources of revenue daylights pyramiding kept him pinched for cash throughout the first winter  the paygravel thawed on bedrock and hoisted to the surface immediately froze again  thus his dumps containing several millions of gold were inaccessible  not until the returning sun thawed the dumps and melted the water to wash them was he able to handle the gold they contained  and then he found himself with a surplus of gold deposited in the two newly organized banks and he was promptly besieged by men and groups of men to enlist his capital in their enterprises  but he elected to play his own game and he entered combinations only when they were generally defensive or offensive  thus though he had paid the highest wages he joined the mineowners association engineered the fight and effectually curbed the growing insubordination of the wageearners  times had changed the old days were gone forever  this was a new era and daylight the wealthy mineowner was loyal to his class affiliations  it was true the oldtimers who worked for him in order to be saved from the club of the organized owners were made foremen over the gang of chechaquos but this with daylight was a matter of heart not head  in his heart he could not forget the old days while with his head he played the economic game according to the latest and most practical methods  but outside of such groupcombinations of exploiters he refused to bind himself to any mans game  he was playing a great lone hand and he needed all his money for his own backing  the newly founded stockexchange interested him keenly  he had never before seen such an institution but he was quick to see its virtues and to utilize it most of all it was gambling and on many an occasion not necessary for the advancement of his own schemes he as he called it went the stockexchange a flutter out of sheer wantonness and fun  it sure beats faro was his comment one day when after keeping the dawson speculators in a fever for a week by alternate bulling and bearing he showed his hand and cleaned up what would have been a fortune to any other man  other men having made their strike had headed south for the states taking a furlough from the grim arctic battle  but asked when he was going outside daylight always laughed and said when he had finished playing his hand  he also added that a man was a fool to quit a game just when a winning hand had been dealt him  it was held by the thousands of heroworshipping chechaquos that daylight was a man absolutely without fear  but bettles and dan macdonald and other sourdoughs shook their heads and laughed as they mentioned women  and they were right  he had always been afraid of them from the time himself a lad of seventeen when queen anne of juneau made open and ridiculous love to him  for that matter he never had known women  born in a miningcamp where they were rare and mysterious having no sisters his mother dying while he was an infant he had never been in contact with them  true running away from queen anne he had later encountered them on the yukon and cultivated an acquaintance with themthe pioneer ones who crossed the passes on the trail of the men who had opened up the first diggings  but no lamb had ever walked with a wolf in greater fear and trembling than had he walked with them  it was a matter of masculine pride that he should walk with them and he had done so in fair seeming but women had remained to him a closed book and he preferred a game of solo or sevenup any time  and now known as the king of the klondike carrying several other royal titles such as eldorado king bonanza king the lumber baron and the prince of the stampeders not to omit the proudest appellation of all namely the father of the sourdoughs he was more afraid of women than ever  as never before they held out their arms to him and more women were flocking into the country day by day  it mattered not whether he sat at dinner in the gold commissioners house called for the drinks in a dancehall or submitted to an interview from the woman representative of the new york sun one and all of them held out their arms  there was one exception and that was freda the girl that danced and to whom he had given the flour  she was the only woman in whose company he felt at ease for she alone never reached out her arms  and yet it was from her that he was destined to receive next to his severest fright  it came about in the fall of 1897  he was returning from one of his dashes this time to inspect henderson a creek that entered the yukon just below the stewart  winter had come on with a rush and he fought his way down the yukon seventy miles in a frail peterborough canoe in the midst of a run of mushice  hugging the rimice that had already solidly formed he shot across the icespewing mouth of the klondike just in time to see a lone man dancing excitedly on the rim and pointing into the water  next he saw the furclad body of a woman face under sinking in the midst of the driving mushice a lane opening in the swirl of the current it was a matter of seconds to drive the canoe to the spot reach to the shoulder in the water and draw the woman gingerly to the canoes side  it was freda  and all might yet have been well with him had she not later when brought back to consciousness blazed at him with angry blue eyes and demanded why did you  oh why did you  this worried him  in the nights that followed instead of sinking immediately to sleep as was his wont he lay awake visioning her face and that blue blaze of wrath and conning her words over and over they rang with sincerity  the reproach was genuine  she had meant just what she said  and still he pondered  the next time he encountered her she had turned away from him angrily and contemptuously  and yet again she came to him to beg his pardon and she dropped a hint of a man somewhere sometimeshe said not howwho had left her with no desire to live  her speech was frank but incoherent and all he gleaned from it was that the event whatever it was had happened years before  also he gleaned that she had loved the man  that was the thinglove  it caused the trouble  it was more terrible than frost or famine  women were all very well in themselves good to look upon and likable but along came this thing called love and they were seared to the bone by it made so irrational that one could never guess what they would do next  this fredawoman was a splendid creature fullbodied beautiful and nobodys fool but love had come along and soured her on the world driving her to the klondike and to suicide so compellingly that she was made to hate the man that saved her life  well he had escaped love so far just as he had escaped smallpox yet there it was as contagious as smallpox and a whole lot worse in running its course  it made men and women do such fearful and unreasonable things  it was like delirium tremens only worse  and if he daylight caught it he might have it as badly as any of them  it was lunacy stark lunacy and contagious on top of it all  a half dozen young fellows were crazy over freda  they all wanted to marry her  yet she in turn was crazy over that some other fellow on the other side of the world and would have nothing to do with them  but it was left to the virgin to give him his final fright  she was found one morning dead in her cabin  a shot through the head had done it and she had left no message no explanation  then came the talk some wit voicing public opinion called it a case of too much daylight  she had killed herself because of him  everybody knew this and said so  the correspondents wrote it up and once more burning daylight king of the klondike was sensationally featured in the sunday supplements of the united states  the virgin had straightened up so the featurestories ran and correctly so  never had she entered a dawson city dancehall  when she first arrived from circle city she had earned her living by washing clothes  next she had bought a sewingmachine and made mens drill parkas fur caps and moosehide mittens  then she had gone as a clerk into the first yukon bank  all this and more was known and told though one and all were agreed that daylight while the cause had been the innocent cause of her untimely end  and the worst of it was that daylight knew it was true  always would he remember that last night he had seen her  he had thought nothing of it at the time but looking back he was haunted by every little thing that had happened  in the light of the tragic event he could understand everythingher quietness that calm certitude as if all vexing questions of living had been smoothed out and were gone and that certain ethereal sweetness about all that she had said and done that had been almost maternal  he remembered the way she had looked at him how she had laughed when he narrated mickey dolans mistake in staking the fraction on skookum gulch  her laughter had been lightly joyous while at the same time it had lacked its oldtime robustness not that she had been grave or subdued  on the contrary she had been so patently content so filled with peace  she had fooled him fool that he was  he had even thought that night that her feeling for him had passed and he had taken delight in the thought and caught visions of the satisfying future friendship that would be theirs with this perturbing love out of the way  and then when he stood at the door cap in hand and said good night it had struck him at the time as a funny and embarrassing thing her bending over his hand and kissing it  he had felt like a fool but he shivered now when he looked back on it and felt again the touch of her lips on his hand  she was saying goodby an eternal goodby and he had never guessed  at that very moment and for all the moments of the evening coolly and deliberately as he well knew her way she had been resolved to die  if he had only known it  untouched by the contagious malady himself nevertheless he would have married her if he had had the slightest inkling of what she contemplated  and yet he knew furthermore that hers was a certain stiffkneed pride that would not have permitted her to accept marriage as an act of philanthropy  there had really been no saving her after all the lovedisease had fastened upon her and she had been doomed from the first to perish of it  her one possible chance had been that he too should have caught it and he had failed to catch it  most likely if he had it would have been from freda or some other woman  there was dartworthy the college man who had staked the rich fraction on bonanza above discovery everybody knew that old doolittles daughter bertha was madly in love with him  yet when he contracted the disease of all women it had been with the wife of colonel walthstone the great guggenhammer mining expert result three lunacy cases dartworthy selling out his mine for onetenth its value the poor woman sacrificing her respectability and sheltered nook in society to flee with him in an open boat down the yukon and colonel walthstone breathing murder and destruction taking out after them in another open boat  the whole impending tragedy had moved on down the muddy yukon passing forty mile and circle and losing itself in the wilderness beyond  but there it was love disorganizing mens and womens lives driving toward destruction and death turning topsyturvy everything that was sensible and considerate making bawds or suicides out of virtuous women and scoundrels and murderers out of men who had always been clean and square  for the first time in his life daylight lost his nerve  he was badly and avowedly frightened  women were terrible creatures and the lovegerm was especially plentiful in their neighborhood  and they were so reckless so devoid of fear  they were not frightened by what had happened to the virgin  they held out their arms to him more seductively than ever  even without his fortune reckoned as a mere man just past thirty magnificently strong and equally goodlooking and goodnatured he was a prize for most normal women but when to his natural excellences were added the romance that linked with his name and the enormous wealth that was his practically every free woman he encountered measured him with an appraising and delighted eye to say nothing of more than one woman who was not free  other men might have been spoiled by this and led to lose their heads but the only effect on him was to increase his fright  as a result he refused most invitations to houses where women might be met and frequented bachelor boards and the moosehorn saloon which had no dancehall attached    chapter xiii  six thousand spent the winter of 1897 in dawson work on the creeks went on apace while beyond the passes it was reported that one hundred thousand more were waiting for the spring  late one brief afternoon daylight on the benches between french hill and skookum hill caught a wider vision of things  beneath him lay the richest part of eldorado creek while up and down bonanza he could see for miles  it was a scene of a vast devastation the hills to their tops had been shorn of trees and their naked sides showed signs of goring and perforating that even the mantle of snow could not hide  beneath him in every direction were the cabins of men  but not many men were visible  a blanket of smoke filled the valleys and turned the gray day to melancholy twilight  smoke arose from a thousand holes in the snow where deep down on bedrock in the frozen muck and gravel men crept and scratched and dug and ever built more fires to break the grip of the frost  here and there where new shafts were starting these fires flamed redly  figures of men crawled out of the holes or disappeared into them or on raised platforms of handhewn timber windlassed the thawed gravel to the surface where it immediately froze  the wreckage of the spring washing appeared everywherepiles of sluiceboxes sections of elevated flumes huge waterwheelsall the debris of an army of goldmad men  italls plain gophering daylight muttered aloud  he looked at the naked hills and realized the enormous wastage of wood that had taken place  from this birdseye view he realized the monstrous confusion of their excited workings  it was a gigantic inadequacy  each worked for himself and the result was chaos  in this richest of diggings it cost out by their feverish unthinking methods another dollar was left hopelessly in the earth  given another year and most of the claims would be worked out and the sum of the gold taken out would no more than equal what was left behind  organization was what was needed he decided and his quick imagination sketched eldorado creek from mouth to source and from mountain top to mountain top in the hands of one capable management  even steamthawing as yet untried but bound to come he saw would be a makeshift  what should be done was to hydraulic the valley sides and benches and then on the creek bottom to use golddredges such as he had heard described as operating in california  there was the very chance for another big killing  he had wondered just what was precisely the reason for the guggenhammers and the big english concerns sending in their highsalaried experts  that was their scheme  that was why they had approached him for the sale of workedout claims and tailings they were content to let the small mineowners gopher out what they could for there would be millions in the leavings  and gazing down on the smoky inferno of crude effort daylight outlined the new game he would play a game in which the guggenhammers and the rest would have to reckon with him  cut along with the delight in the new conception came a weariness he was tired of the long arctic years and he was curious about the outsidethe great world of which he had heard other men talk and of which he was as ignorant as a child there were games out there to play  it was a larger table and there was no reason why he with his millions should not sit in and take a hand  so it was that afternoon on skookum hill that he resolved to play this last best klondike hand and pull for the outside  it took time however  he put trusted agents to work on the heels of great experts and on the creeks where they began to buy he likewise bought  wherever they tried to corner a workedout creek they found him standing in the way owning blocks of claims or artfully scattered claims that put all their plans to naught  i play youall wide open to winam i right he told them once in a heated conference  followed wars truces compromises victories and defeats  by 1898 sixty thousand men were on the klondike and all their fortunes and affairs rocked back and forth and were affected by the battles daylight fought  and more and more the taste for the larger game urged in daylights mouth  here he was already locked in grapples with the great guggenhammers and winning fiercely winning  possibly the severest struggle was waged on ophir the veriest of moosepastures whose lowgrade dirt was valuable only because of its vastness  the ownership of a block of seven claims in the heart of it gave daylight his grip and they could not come to terms  the guggenhammer experts concluded that it was too big for him to handle and when they gave him an ultimatum to that effect he accepted and bought them out  the plan was his own but he sent down to the states for competent engineers to carry it out  in the rinkabilly watershed eighty miles away he built his reservoir and for eighty miles the huge wooden conduit carried the water across country to ophir  estimated at three millions the reservoir and conduit cost nearer four  nor did he stop with this  electric power plants were installed and his workings were lighted as well as run by electricity  other sourdoughs who had struck it rich in excess of all their dreams shook their heads gloomily warned him that he would go broke and declined to invest in so extravagant a venture  but daylight smiled and sold out the remainder of his townsite holdings  he sold at the right time at the height of the placer boom when he prophesied to his old cronies in the moosehorn saloon that within five years town lots in dawson could not be given away while the cabins would be chopped up for firewood he was laughed at roundly and assured that the motherlode would be found ere that time  but he went ahead when his need for lumber was finished selling out his sawmills as well  likewise he began to get rid of his scattered holdings on the various creeks and without thanks to any one he finished his conduit built his dredges imported his machinery and made the gold of ophir immediately accessible  and he who five years before had crossed over the divide from indian river and threaded the silent wilderness his dogs packing indian fashion himself living indian fashion on straight moose meat now heard the hoarse whistles calling his hundreds of laborers to work and watched them toil under the white glare of the arclamps  but having done the thing he was ready to depart  and when he let the word go out the guggenhammers vied with the english concerns and with a new french company in bidding for ophir and all its plant  the guggenhammers bid highest and the price they paid netted daylight a clean million  it was current rumor that he was worth anywhere from twenty to thirty millions  but he alone knew just how he stood and that with his last claim sold and the table swept clean of his winnings he had ridden his hunch to the tune of just a trifle over eleven millions  his departure was a thing that passed into the history of the yukon along with his other deeds  all the yukon was his guest dawson the seat of the festivity  on that one last night no mans dust save his own was good  drinks were not to be purchased  every saloon ran open with extra relays of exhausted bartenders and the drinks were given away  a man who refused this hospitality and persisted in paying found a dozen fights on his hands  the veriest chechaquos rose up to defend the name of daylight from such insult  and through it all on moccasined feet moved daylight hellroaring burning daylight overspilling with good nature and camaraderie howling his hewolf howl and claiming the night as his bending mens arms down on the bars performing feats of strength his bronzed face flushed with drink his black eyes flashing clad in overalls and blanket coat his earflaps dangling and his gauntleted mittens swinging from the cord across the shoulders  but this time it was neither an ante nor a stake that he threw away but a mere marker in the game that he who held so many markers would not miss  as a night it eclipsed anything that dawson had ever seen  it was daylights desire to make it memorable and his attempt was a success a goodly portion of dawson got drunk that night  the fall weather was on and though the freezeup of the yukon still delayed the thermometer was down to twentyfive below zero and falling  wherefore it was necessary to organize gangs of lifesavers who patrolled the streets to pick up drunken men from where they fell in the snow and where an hours sleep would be fatal  daylight whose whim it was to make them drunk by hundreds and by thousands was the one who initiated this life saving  he wanted dawson to have its night but in his deeper processes never careless nor wanton he saw to it that it was a night without accident  and like his olden nights his ukase went forth that there should be no quarrelling nor fighting offenders to be dealt with by him personally  nor did he have to deal with any hundreds of devoted followers saw to it that the evilly disposed were rolled in the snow and hustled off to bed in the great world where great captains of industry die all wheels under their erstwhile management are stopped for a minute  but in the klondike such was its hilarious sorrow at the departure of its captain that for twentyfour hours no wheels revolved  even great ophir with its thousand men on the payroll closed down  on the day after the night there were no men present or fit to go to work  next morning at break of day dawson said goodby  the thousands that lined the bank wore mittens and their earflaps pulled down and tied it was thirty below zero the rimice was thickening and the yukon carried a run of mushice  from the deck of the seattle daylight waved and called his farewells  as the lines were cast off and the steamer swung out into the current those near him saw the moisture well up in daylights eyes  in a way it was to him departure from his native land this grim arctic region which was practically the only land he had known  he tore off his cap and waved it  goodby youall he called  goodby youall      part ii    chapter i  in no blaze of glory did burning daylight descend upon san francisco not only had he been forgotten but the klondike along with him  the world was interested in other things and the alaskan adventure like the spanish war was an old story  many things had happened since then  exciting things were happening every day and the sensationspace of newspapers was limited the effect of being ignored however was an exhilaration  big man as he had been in the arctic game it merely showed how much bigger was this new game when a man worth eleven millions and with a history such as his passed unnoticed  he settled down in st francis hotel was interviewed by the cubreporters on the hotelrun and received brief paragraphs of notice for twentyfour hours  he grinned to himself and began to look around and get acquainted with the new order of beings and things  he was very awkward and very selfpossessed  in addition to the stiffening afforded his backbone by the conscious ownership of eleven millions he possessed an enormous certitude  nothing abashed him nor was he appalled by the display and culture and power around him  it was another kind of wilderness that was all and it was for him to learn the ways of it the signs and trails and waterholes where good hunting lay and the bad stretches of field and flood to be avoided  as usual he fought shy of the women  he was still too badly scared to come to close quarters with the dazzling and resplendent creatures his own millions made accessible  they looked and longed but he so concealed his timidity that he had all the seeming of moving boldly among them  nor was it his wealth alone that attracted them  he was too much a man and too much an unusual type of man  young yet barely thirtysix eminently handsome magnificently strong almost bursting with a splendid virility his free trailstride never learned on pavements and his black eyes hinting of great spaces and unwearied with the close perspective of the city dwellers drew many a curious and wayward feminine glance  he saw grinned knowingly to himself and faced them as so many dangers with a cool demeanor that was a far greater personal achievement than had they been famine frost or flood  he had come down to the states to play the mans game not the womans game and the men he had not yet learned  they struck him as softsoft physically yet he divined them hard in their dealings but hard under an exterior of supple softness  it struck him that there was something catlike about them  he met them in the clubs and wondered how real was the goodfellowship they displayed and how quickly they would unsheathe their claws and gouge and rend  thats the proposition he repeated to himself what will theyall do when the play is close and down to brass tacks  he felt unwarrantably suspicious of them theyre sure slick was his secret judgment and from bits of gossip dropped now and again he felt his judgment well buttressed  on the other hand they radiated an atmosphere of manliness and the fair play that goes with manliness  they might gouge and rend in a fightwhich was no more than natural but he felt somehow that they would gouge and rend according to rule this was the impression he got of thema generalization tempered by knowledge that there was bound to be a certain percentage of scoundrels among them  several months passed in san francisco during which time he studied the game and its rules and prepared himself to take a hand  he even took private instruction in english and succeeded in eliminating his worst faults though in moments of excitement he was prone to lapse into youall knowed sure and similar solecisms  he learned to eat and dress and generally comport himself after the manner of civilized man but through it all he remained himself not unduly reverential nor considerative and never hesitating to stride roughshod over any softfaced convention if it got in his way and the provocation were great enough  also and unlike the average run of weaker men coming from back countries and far places he failed to reverence the particular tin gods worshipped variously by the civilized tribes of men  he had seen totems before and knew them for what they were  tiring of being merely an onlooker he ran up to nevada where the new goldmining boom was fairly startedjust to try a flutter as he phrased it to himself  the flutter on the tonopah stock exchange lasted just ten days during which time his smashing wildbull game played ducks and drakes with the more stereotyped gamblers and at the end of which time having gambled floridel into his fist he let go for a net profit of half a million  whereupon smacking his lips he departed for san francisco and the st francis hotel  it tasted good and his hunger for the game became more acute  and once more the papers sensationalized him  burning daylight was a bigletter headline again  interviewers flocked about him  old files of magazines and newspapers were searched through and the romantic and historic elam harnish adventurer of the frost king of the klondike and father of the sourdoughs strode upon the breakfast table of a million homes along with the toast and breakfast foods even before his elected time he was forcibly launched into the game financiers and promoters and all the flotsam and jetsam of the sea of speculation surged upon the shores of his eleven millions  in selfdefence he was compelled to open offices  he had made them sit up and take notice and now willynilly they were dealing him hands and clamoring for him to play  well play he would hed show em even despite the elated prophesies made of how swiftly he would be trimmedprophesies coupled with descriptions of the bucolic game he would play and of his wild and woolly appearance  he dabbled in little things at firststalling for time as he explained it to holdsworthy a friend he had made at the altapacific club  daylight himself was a member of the club and holdsworthy had proposed him  and it was well that daylight played closely at first for he was astounded by the multitudes of sharksgroundsharks he called themthat flocked about him  he saw through their schemes readily enough and even marveled that such numbers of them could find sufficient prey to keep them going their rascality and general dubiousness was so transparent that he could not understand how any one could be taken in by them  and then he found that there were sharks and sharks  holdsworthy treated him more like a brother than a mere fellowclubman watching over him advising him and introducing him to the magnates of the local financial world  holdsworthys family lived in a delightful bungalow near menlo park and here daylight spent a number of weekends seeing a fineness and kindness of home life of which he had never dreamed  holdsworthy was an enthusiast over flowers and a half lunatic over raising prize poultry and these engrossing madnesses were a source of perpetual joy to daylight who looked on in tolerant good humor such amiable weaknesses tokened the healthfulness of the man and drew daylight closer to him  a prosperous successful business man without great ambition was daylights estimate of hima man too easily satisfied with the small stakes of the game ever to launch out in big play  on one such weekend visit holdsworthy let him in on a good thing a good little thing a brickyard at glen ellen  daylight listened closely to the others description of the situation  it was a most reasonable venture and daylights one objection was that it was so small a matter and so far out of his line and he went into it only as a matter of friendship holdsworthy explaining that he was himself already in a bit and that while it was a good thing he would be compelled to make sacrifices in other directions in order to develop it  daylight advanced the capital fifty thousand dollars and as he laughingly explained afterward i was stung all right but it wasnt holdsworthy that did it half as much as those blamed chickens and fruittrees of his  it was a good lesson however for he learned that there were few faiths in the business world and that even the simple homely faith of breaking bread and eating salt counted for little in the face of a worthless brickyard and fifty thousand dollars in cash  but the sharks and sharks of various orders and degrees he concluded were on the surface  deep down he divined were the integrities and the stabilities  these big captains of industry and masters of finance he decided were the men to work with by the very nature of their huge deals and enterprises they had to play fair  no room there for little sharpers tricks and bunco games  it was to be expected that little men should salt goldmines with a shotgun and work off worthless brickyards on their friends but in high finance such methods were not worth while  there the men were engaged in developing the country organizing its railroads opening up its mines making accessible its vast natural resources  their play was bound to be big and stable  they sure cant afford tinhorn tactics was his summing up  so it was that he resolved to leave the little men the holdsworthys alone and while he met them in goodfellowship he chummed with none and formed no deep friendships  he did not dislike the little men the men of the altapacific for instance  he merely did not elect to choose them for partners in the big game in which he intended to play what that big game was even he did not know  he was waiting to find it  and in the meantime he played small hands investing in several aridlands reclamation projects and keeping his eyes open for the big chance when it should come along  and then he met john dowsett the great john dowsett  the whole thing was fortuitous  this cannot be doubted as daylight himself knew it was by the merest chance when in los angeles that he heard the tuna were running strong at santa catalina and went over to the island instead of returning directly to san francisco as he had planned there he met john dowsett resting off for several days in the middle of a flying western trip dowsett had of course heard of the spectacular klondike king and his rumored thirty millions and he certainly found himself interested by the man in the acquaintance that was formed somewhere along in this acquaintanceship the idea must have popped into his brain  but he did not broach it preferring to mature it carefully  so he talked in large general ways and did his best to be agreeable and win daylights friendship  it was the first big magnate daylight had met face to face and he was pleased and charmed  there was such a kindly humanness about the man such a genial democraticness that daylight found it hard to realize that this was the john dowsett president of a string of banks insurance manipulator reputed ally of the lieutenants of standard oil and known ally of the guggenhammers  nor did his looks belie his reputation and his manner  physically he guaranteed all that daylight knew of him  despite his sixty years and snowwhite hair his handshake was firmly hearty and he showed no signs of decrepitude walking with a quick snappy step making all movements definitely and decisively  his skin was a healthy pink and his thin clean lips knew the way to writhe heartily over a joke  he had honest blue eyes of palest blue they looked out at one keenly and frankly from under shaggy gray brows  his mind showed itself disciplined and orderly and its workings struck daylight as having all the certitude of a steel trap  he was a man who knew and who never decorated his knowledge with foolish frills of sentiment or emotion  that he was accustomed to command was patent and every word and gesture tingled with power  combined with this was his sympathy and tact and daylight could note easily enough all the earmarks that distinguished him from a little man of the holdsworthy caliber daylight knew also his history the prime old american stock from which he had descended his own war record the john dowsett before him who had been one of the banking buttresses of the cause of the union the commodore dowsett of the war of 1812 the general dowsett of revolutionary fame and that first far dowsett owner of lands and slaves in early new england  hes sure the real thing he told one of his fellowclubmen afterwards in the smokingroom of the altapacific  i tell you gallon he was a genuine surprise to me  i knew the big ones had to be like that but i had to see him to really know it hes one of the fellows that does things  you can see it sticking out all over him hes one in a thousand thats straight a man to tie to  theres no limit to any game he plays and you can stack on it that he plays right up to the handle  i bet he can lose or win half a dozen million without batting an eye  gallon puffed at his cigar and at the conclusion of the panegyric regarded the other curiously but daylight ordering cocktails failed to note this curious stare  going in with him on some deal i suppose gallon remarked  nope not the slightest idea  heres kindness  i was just explaining that id come to understand how these big fellows do big things  why dye know he gave me such a feeling that he knew everything that i was plumb ashamed of myself  i guess i could give him cards and spades when it comes to driving a dogteam though daylight observed after a meditative pause  and i really believe i could put him on to a few wrinkles in poker and placer mining and maybe in paddling a birch canoe  and maybe i stand a better chance to learn the game hes been playing all his life than he would stand of learning the game i played up north    chapter ii  it was not long afterward that daylight came on to new york  a letter from john dowsett had been the causea simple little typewritten letter of several lines  but daylight had thrilled as he read it  he remembered the thrill that was his a callow youth of fifteen when in tempas butte through lack of a fourth man tom galsworthy the gambler had said get in kid take a hand  that thrill was his now  the bald typewritten sentences seemed gorged with mystery  our mr howison will call upon you at your hotel  he is to be trusted  we must not be seen together  you will understand after we have had our talk  daylight conned the words over and over  that was it the big game had arrived and it looked as if he were being invited to sit in and take a hand  surely for no other reason would one man so peremptorily invite another man to make a journey across the continent  they metthanks to our mr howisonup the hudson in a magnificent country home  daylight according to instructions arrived in a private motorcar which had been furnished him whose car it was he did not know any more than did he know the owner of the house with its generous rolling treestudded lawns  dowsett was already there and another man whom daylight recognized before the introduction was begun it was nathaniel letton and none other  daylight had seen his face a score of times in the magazines and newspapers and read about his standing in the financial world and about his endowed university of daratona  he likewise struck daylight as a man of power though he was puzzled in that he could find no likeness to dowsett  except in the matter of cleannessa cleanness that seemed to go down to the deepest fibers of himnathaniel letton was unlike the other in every particular  thin to emaciation he seemed a cold flame of a man a man of a mysterious chemic sort of flame who under a glacierlike exterior conveyed somehow the impression of the ardent heat of a thousand suns  his large gray eyes were mainly responsible for this feeling and they blazed out feverishly from what was almost a deathshead so thin was the face the skin of which was a ghastly dull dead white  not more than fifty thatched with a sparse growth of irongray hair he looked several times the age of dowsett  yet nathaniel letton possessed controldaylight could see that plainly he was a thinfaced ascetic living in a state of high attenuated calma molten planet under a transcontinental ice sheet  and yet above all most of all daylight was impressed by the terrific and almost awful cleanness of the man  there was no dross in him  he had all the seeming of having been purged by fire  daylight had the feeling that a healthy manoath would be a deadly offence to his ears a sacrilege and a blasphemy  they drankthat is nathaniel letton took mineral water served by the smoothly operating machine of a lackey who inhabited the place while dowsett took scotch and soda and daylight a cocktail  nobody seemed to notice the unusualness of a martini at midnight though daylight looked sharply for that very thing for he had long since learned that martinis had their strictly appointed times and places  but he liked martinis and being a natural man he chose deliberately to drink when and how he pleased  others had noticed this peculiar habit of his but not so dowsett and letton and daylights secret thought was they sure wouldnt bat an eye if i called for a glass of corrosive sublimate  leon guggenhammer arrived in the midst of the drink and ordered scotch  daylight studied him curiously  this was one of the great guggenhammer family a younger one but nevertheless one of the crowd with which he had locked grapples in the north  nor did leon guggenhammer fail to mention cognizance of that old affair  he complimented daylight on his prowessthe echoes of ophir came down to us you know  and i must say mr daylighter mr harnish that you whipped us roundly in that affair  echoes  daylight could not escape the shock of the phraseechoes had come down to them of the fight into which he had flung all his strength and the strength of his klondike millions  the guggenhammers sure must go some when a fight of that dimension was no more than a skirmish of which they deigned to hear echoes  they sure play an almighty big game down here was his conclusion accompanied by a corresponding elation that it was just precisely that almighty big game in which he was about to be invited to play a hand for the moment he poignantly regretted that rumor was not true and that his eleven millions were not in reality thirty millions  well that much he would be frank about he would let them know exactly how many stacks of chips he could buy  leon guggenhammer was young and fat  not a day more than thirty his face save for the adumbrated puff sacks under the eyes was as smooth and lineless as a boys  he too gave the impression of cleanness he showed in the pink of health his unblemished smoothshaven skin shouted advertisement of his splendid physical condition  in the face of that perfect skin his very fatness and mature rotund paunch could be nothing other than normal  he was constituted to be prone to fatness that was all  the talk soon centred down to business though guggenhammer had first to say his say about the forthcoming international yacht race and about his own palatial steam yacht the electra whose recent engines were already antiquated  dowsett broached the plan aided by an occasional remark from the other two while daylight asked questions  whatever the proposition was he was going into it with his eyes open  and they filled his eyes with the practical vision of what they had in mind  they will never dream you are with us guggenhammer interjected as the outlining of the matter drew to a close his handsome jewish eyes flashing enthusiastically  theyll think you are raiding on your own in proper buccaneer style  of course you understand mr harnish the absolute need for keeping our alliance in the dark nathaniel letton warned gravely  daylight nodded his head  and you also understand letton went on that the result can only be productive of good  the thing is legitimate and right and the only ones who may be hurt are the stock gamblers themselves  it is not an attempt to smash the market  as you see yourself you are to bull the market  the honest investor will be the gainer  yes thats the very thing dowsett said  the commercial need for copper is continually increasing  ward valley copper and all that it stands forpractically onequarter of the worlds supply as i have shown youis a big thing how big even we can scarcely estimate our arrangements are made  we have plenty of capital ourselves and yet we want more  also there is too much ward valley out to suit our present plans  thus we kill both birds with one stone  and i am the stone daylight broke in with a smile  yes just that  not only will you bull ward valley but you will at the same time gather ward valley in  this will be of inestimable advantage to us while you and all of us will profit by it as well and as mr letton has pointed out the thing is legitimate and square on the eighteenth the directors meet and instead of the customary dividend a double dividend will be declared  and where will the shorts be then leon guggenhammer cried excitedly  the shorts will be the speculators nathaniel letton explained the gamblers the froth of wall streetyou understand  the genuine investors will not be hurt  furthermore they will have learned for the thousandth time to have confidence in ward valley  and with their confidence we can carry through the large developments we have outlined to you  there will be all sorts of rumors on the street dowsett warned daylight but do not let them frighten you  these rumors may even originate with us  you can see how and why clearly  but rumors are to be no concern of yours  you are on the inside all you have to do is buy buy buy and keep on buying to the last stroke when the directors declare the double dividend ward valley will jump so that it wont be feasible to buy after that  what we want letton took up the strain pausing significantly to sip his mineral water what we want is to take large blocks of ward valley off the hands of the public  we could do this easily enough by depressing the market and frightening the holders  and we could do it more cheaply in such fashion  but we are absolute masters of the situation and we are fair enough to buy ward valley on a rising market  not that we are philanthropists but that we need the investors in our big development scheme  nor do we lose directly by the transaction the instant the action of the directors becomes known ward valley will rush heavenward  in addition and outside the legitimate field of the transaction we will pinch the shorts for a very large sum  but that is only incidental you understand and in a way unavoidable  on the other hand we shall not turn up our noses at that phase of it  the shorts shall be the veriest gamblers of course and they will get no more than they deserve  and one other thing mr harnish guggenhammer said if you exceed your available cash or the amount you care to invest in the venture dont fail immediately to call on us  remember we are behind you  yes we are behind you dowsett repeated  nathaniel letton nodded his head in affirmation  now about that double dividend on the eighteenth john dowsett drew a slip of paper from his notebook and adjusted his glasses  let me show you the figures  here you see  and thereupon he entered into a long technical and historical explanation of the earnings and dividends of ward valley from the day of its organization  the whole conference lasted not more than an hour during which time daylight lived at the topmost of the highest peak of life that he had ever scaled  these men were big players  they were powers  true as he knew himself they were not the real inner circle  they did not rank with the morgans and harrimans  and yet they were in touch with those giants and were themselves lesser giants  he was pleased too with their attitude toward him  they met him deferentially but not patronizingly  it was the deference of equality and daylight could not escape the subtle flattery of it for he was fully aware that in experience as well as wealth they were far and away beyond him  well shake up the speculating crowd leon guggenhammer proclaimed jubilantly as they rose to go  and you are the man to do it mr harnish  they are bound to think you are on your own and their shears are all sharpened for the trimming of newcomers like you  they will certainly be misled letton agreed his eerie gray eyes blazing out from the voluminous folds of the huge mueller with which he was swathing his neck to the ears  their minds run in ruts  it is the unexpected that upsets their stereotyped calculationsany new combination any strange factor any fresh variant  and you will be all that to them mr harnish  and i repeat they are gamblers and they will deserve all that befalls them  they clog and cumber all legitimate enterprise  you have no idea of the trouble they cause men like ussometimes by their gambling tactics upsetting the soundest plans even overturning the stablest institutions  dowsett and young guggenhammer went away in one motorcar and letton by himself in another  daylight with still in the forefront of his consciousness all that had occurred in the preceding hour was deeply impressed by the scene at the moment of departure  the three machines stood like weird night monsters at the gravelled foot of the wide stairway under the unlighted portecochere  it was a dark night and the lights of the motorcars cut as sharply through the blackness as knives would cut through solid substance  the obsequious lackeythe automatic genie of the house which belonged to none of the three menstood like a graven statue after having helped them in the furcoated chauffeurs bulked dimly in their seats  one after the other like spurred steeds the cars leaped into the blackness took the curve of the driveway and were gone  daylights car was the last and peering out he caught a glimpse of the unlighted house that loomed hugely through the darkness like a mountain  whose was it  he wondered  how came they to use it for their secret conference  would the lackey talk  how about the chauffeurs  were they trusted men like our mr howison  mystery the affair was alive with it  and hand in hand with mystery walked power  he leaned back and inhaled his cigarette  big things were afoot  the cards were shuffled even the for a mighty deal and he was in on it  he remembered back to his poker games with jack kearns and laughed aloud  he had played for thousands in those days on the turn of a card but now he was playing for millions  and on the eighteenth when that dividend was declared he chuckled at the confusion that would inevitably descend upon the men with the sharpened shears waiting to trim himhim burning daylight    chapter iii  back at his hotel though nearly two in the morning he found the reporters waiting to interview him  next morning there were more  and thus with blare of paper trumpet was he received by new york  once more with beating of tomstoms and wild hullaballoo his picturesque figure strode across the printed sheet  the king of the klondike the hero of the arctic the thirtymilliondollar millionaire of the north had come to new york  what had he come for  to trim the new yorkers as he had trimmed the tonopah crowd in nevada  wall street had best watch out for the wild man of klondike had just come to town  or perchance would wall street trim him  wall street had trimmed many wild men would this be burning daylights fate  daylight grinned to himself and gave out ambiguous interviews  it helped the game and he grinned again as he meditated that wall street would sure have to go some before it trimmed him  they were prepared for him to play and when heavy buying of ward valley began it was quickly decided that he was the operator financial gossip buzzed and hummed  he was after the guggenhammers once more  the story of ophir was told over again and sensationalized until even daylight scarcely recognized it still it was all grist to his mill  the stock gamblers were clearly befooled  each day he increased his buying and so eager were the sellers that ward valley rose but slowly  it sure beats poker daylight whispered gleefully to himself as he noted the perturbation he was causing  the newspapers hazarded countless guesses and surmises and daylight was constantly dogged by a small battalion of reporters  his own interviews were gems  discovering the delight the newspapers took in his vernacular in his youalls and sures and surgeups he even exaggerated these particularities of speech exploiting the phrases he had heard other frontiersmen use and inventing occasionally a new one of his own  a wildly exciting time was his during the week preceding thursday the eighteenth  not only was he gambling as he had never gambled before but he was gambling at the biggest table in the world and for stakes so large that even the casehardened habitues of that table were compelled to sit up  in spite of the unlimited selling his persistent buying compelled ward valley steadily to rise and as thursday approached the situation became acute something had to smash  how much ward valley was this klondike gambler going to buy  how much could he buy  what was the ward valley crowd doing all this time  daylight appreciated the interviews with them that appearedinterviews delightfully placid and noncommittal  leon guggenhammer even hazarded the opinion that this northland croesus might possibly be making a mistake but not that they cared john dowsett explained  nor did they object  while in the dark regarding his intentions of one thing they were certain namely that he was bulling ward valley  and they did not mind that  no matter what happened to him and his spectacular operations ward valley was all right and would remain all right as firm as the rock of gibraltar  no they had no ward valley to sell thank you  this purely fictitious state of the market was bound shortly to pass and ward valley was not to be induced to change the even tenor of its way by any insane stock exchange flurry  it is purely gambling from beginning to end were nathaniel lettons words and we refuse to have anything to do with it or to take notice of it in any way  during this time daylight had several secret meetings with his partnersone with leon guggenhammer one with john dowsett and two with mr howison  beyond congratulations they really amounted to nothing for as he was informed everything was going satisfactorily  but on tuesday morning a rumor that was disconcerting came to daylights ears  it was also published in the wall street journal and it was to the effect on apparently straight inside information that on thursday when the directors of ward valley met instead of the customary dividend being declared an assessment would be levied  it was the first check daylight had received  it came to him with a shock that if the thing were so he was a broken man  and it also came to him that all this colossal operating of his was being done on his own money dowsett guggenhammer and letton were risking nothing  it was a panic shortlived it was true but sharp enough while it lasted to make him remember holdsworthy and the brickyard and to impel him to cancel all buying orders while he rushed to a telephone  nothing in itonly a rumor came leon guggenhammers throaty voice in the receiver  as you know said nathaniel letton i am one of the directors and i should certainly be aware of it were such action contemplated  and john dowsett i warned you against just such rumors  there is not an iota of truth in itcertainly not  i tell you on my honor as a gentleman  heartily ashamed of himself for his temporary loss of nerve daylight returned to his task  the cessation of buying had turned the stock exchange into a bedlam and down all the line of stocks the bears were smashing  ward valley as the ape received the brunt of the shock and was already beginning to tumble  daylight calmly doubled his buying orders  and all through tuesday and wednesday and thursday morning he went on buying while ward valley rose triumphantly higher still they sold and still he bought exceeding his power to buy many times over when delivery was taken into account  what of that  on this day the double dividend would be declared he assured himself the pinch of delivery would be on the shorts  they would be making terms with him  and then the thunderbolt struck  true to the rumor ward valley levied the assessment  daylight threw up his arms  he verified the report and quit  not alone ward valley but all securities were being hammered down by the triumphant bears  as for ward valley daylight did not even trouble to learn if it had fetched bottom or was still tumbling  not stunned not even bewildered while wall street went mad daylight withdrew from the field to think it over  after a short conference with his brokers he proceeded to his hotel on the way picking up the evening papers and glancing at the headlines  burning daylight cleaned out he read daylight gets his another westerner fails to find easy money  as he entered his hotel a later edition announced the suicide of a young man a lamb who had followed daylights play  what in hell did he want to kill himself for  was daylights muttered comment  he passed up to his rooms ordered a martini cocktail took off his shoes and sat down to think  after half an hour he roused himself to take the drink and as he felt the liquor pass warmingly through his body his features relaxed into a slow deliberate yet genuine grin he was laughing at himself  buncoed by gosh he muttered  then the grin died away and his face grew bleak and serious leaving out his interests in the several western reclamation projects which were still assessing heavily he was a ruined man  but harder hit than this was his pride  he had been so easy  they had goldbricked him and he had nothing to show for it  the simplest farmer would have had documents while he had nothing but a gentlemans agreement and a verbal one at that gentlemans agreement  he snorted over it  john dowsetts voice just as he had heard it in the telephone receiver sounded in his ears the words on my honor as a gentleman  they were sneakthieves and swindlers that was what they were and they had given him the doublecross  the newspapers were right  he had come to new york to be trimmed and messrs dowsett letton and guggenhammer had done it  he was a little fish and they had played with him ten daysample time in which to swallow him along with his eleven millions  of course they had been unloading on him all the time and now they were buying ward valley back for a song ere the market righted itself  most probably out of his share of the swag nathaniel letton would erect a couple of new buildings for that university of his  leon guggenhammer would buy new engines for that yacht or a whole fleet of yachts  but what the devil dowsett would do with his whack was beyond himmost likely start another string of banks  and daylight sat and consumed cocktails and saw back in his life to alaska and lived over the grim years in which he had battled for his eleven millions  for a while murder ate at his heart and wild ideas and sketchy plans of killing his betrayers flashed through his mind that was what that young man should have done instead of killing himself  he should have gone gunning daylight unlocked his grip and took out his automatic pistola big colts 44  he released the safety catch with his thumb and operating the sliding outer barrel ran the contents of the clip through the mechanism  the eight cartridges slid out in a stream  he refilled the clip threw a cartridge into the chamber and with the trigger at full cock thrust up the safety ratchet  he shoved the weapon into the side pocket of his coat ordered another martini and resumed his seat  he thought steadily for an hour but he grinned no more  lines formed in his face and in those lines were the travail of the north the bite of the frost all that he had achieved and sufferedthe long unending weeks of trail the bleak tundra shore of point barrow the smashing icejam of the yukon the battles with animals and men the leandragged days of famine the long months of stinging hell among the mosquitoes of the koyokuk the toil of pick and shovel the scars and mars of packstrap and tumpline the straight meat diet with the dogs and all the long procession of twenty full years of toil and sweat and endeavor  at ten oclock he arose and pored over the city directory  then he put on his shoes took a cab and departed into the night twice he changed cabs and finally fetched up at the night office of a detective agency he superintended the thing himself laid down money in advance in profuse quantities selected the six men he needed and gave them their instructions  never for so simple a task had they been so well paid for to each in addition to office charges he gave a fivehundreddollar bill with the promise of another if he succeeded some time next day he was convinced if not sooner his three silent partners would come together  to each one two of his detectives were to be attached  time and place was all he wanted to learn  stop at nothing boys were his final instructions  i must have this information  whatever you do whatever happens ill sure see you through  returning to his hotel he changed cabs as before went up to his room and with one more cocktail for a nightcap went to bed and to sleep in the morning he dressed and shaved ordered breakfast and the newspapers sent up and waited  but he did not drink  by nine oclock his telephone began to ring and the reports to come in  nathaniel letton was taking the train at tarrytown  john dowsett was coming down by the subway  leon guggenhammer had not stirred out yet though he was assuredly within  and in this fashion with a map of the city spread out before him daylight followed the movements of his three men as they drew together  nathaniel letton was at his offices in the mutualsolander building  next arrived guggenhammer  dowsett was still in his own offices  but at eleven came the word that he also had arrived and several minutes later daylight was in a hired motorcar and speeding for the mutualsolander building    chapter iv  nathaniel letton was talking when the door opened he ceased and with his two companions gazed with controlled perturbation at burning daylight striding into the room  the free swinging movements of the trailtraveler were unconsciously exaggerated in that stride of his in truth it seemed to him that he felt the trail beneath his feet  howdy gentlemen howdy he remarked ignoring the unnatural calm with which they greeted his entrance  he shook hands with them in turn striding from one to another and gripping their hands so heartily that nathaniel letton could not forbear to wince  daylight flung himself into a massive chair and sprawled lazily with an appearance of fatigue  the leather grip he had brought into the room he dropped carelessly beside him on the floor  goddle mighty but ive sure been going some he sighed  we sure trimmed them beautiful  it was real slick  and the beauty of the play never dawned on me till the very end  it was pure and simple knock down and drag out  and the way they fell for it was amazin  the geniality in his lazy western drawl reassured them  he was not so formidable after all  despite the act that he had effected an entrance in the face of lettons instructions to the outer office he showed no indication of making a scene or playing rough  well daylight demanded goodhumoredly aint youall got a good word for your pardner  or has his sure enough brilliance plumb dazzled youall  letton made a dry sound in his throat  dowsett sat quietly and waited while leon guggenhammer struggled into articulation  you have certainly raised cain he said  daylights black eyes flashed in a pleased way  didnt i though he proclaimed jubilantly  and didnt we foolem i was totally surprised  i never dreamed they would be that easy  and now he went on not permitting the pause to grow awkward weall might as well have an accounting  im pullin west this afternoon on that blamed twentieth century  he tugged at his grip got it open and dipped into it with both his hands  but dont forget boys when youall want me to hornswoggle wall street another flutter all youall have to do is whisper the word  ill sure be right there with the goods  his hands emerged clutching a great mass of stubs checkbooks and brokers receipts  these he deposited in a heap on the big table and dipping again he fished out the stragglers and added them to the pile he consulted a slip of paper drawn from his coat pocket and read aloud  ten million twentyseven thousand and fortytwo dollars and sixtyeight cents is my figurin on my expenses  of course thatalls taken from the winnings before weall get to figurin on the whackup wheres your figures  it must a been a goddle mighty big cleanup  the three men looked their bepuzzlement at one another  the man was a bigger fool than they had imagined or else he was playing a game which they could not divine  nathaniel letton moistened his lips and spoke up  it will take some hours yet mr harnish before the full accounting can be made  mr howison is at work upon it now weahas you say it has been a gratifying cleanup  suppose we have lunch together and talk it over  ill have the clerks work through the noon hour so that you will have ample time to catch your train  dowsett and guggenhammer manifested a relief that was almost obvious the situation was clearing  it was disconcerting under the circumstances to be pent in the same room with this heavymuscled indianlike man whom they had robbed  they remembered unpleasantly the many stories of his strength and recklessness  if letton could only put him off long enough for them to escape into the policed world outside the office door all would be well and daylight showed all the signs of being put off  im real glad to hear that he said  i dont want to miss that train and youall have done me proud gentlemen letting me in on this deal  i just do appreciate it without being able to express my feelings  but i am sure almighty curious and id like terrible to know mr letton what your figures of our winning is  can youall give me a rough estimate  nathaniel letton did not look appealingly at his two friends but in the brief pause they felt that appeal pass out from him dowsett of sterner mould than the others began to divine that the klondiker was playing  but the other two were still older the blandishment of his childlike innocence  it is extremelyerdifficult leon guggenhammer began  you see ward valley has fluctuated so er  that no estimate can possibly be made in advance letton supplemented  approximate it approximate it daylight counselled cheerfully  it dont hurt if youall are a million or so out one side or the other  the figuresll straighten that up  but im that curious im just itching all over  what dye say  why continue to play at cross purposes dowsett demanded abruptly and coldly  let us have the explanation here and now mr harnish is laboring under a false impression and he should be set straight  in this deal  but daylight interrupted  he had played too much poker to be unaware or unappreciative of the psychological factor and he headed dowsett off in order to play the denouncement of the present game in his own way  speaking of deals he said reminds me of a poker game i once seen in reno nevada  it want what youall would call a square game theyall was tinhorns that sat in  but they was a tenderfootshorthorns theyall are called out there  he stands behind the dealer and sees that same dealer give hisself four aces offen the bottom of the deck  the tenderfoot is sure shocked  he slides around to the player facin the dealer across the table  say he whispers i seen the dealer deal hisself four aces  well an what of it says the player  im tryin to tell youall because i thought youall ought to know says the tenderfoot  i tell youall i seen him deal hisself four aces  say mister says the player youalld better get outa here youall dont understand the game  its his deal aint it  the laughter that greeted his story was hollow and perfunctory but daylight appeared not to notice it  your story has some meaning i suppose dowsett said pointedly  daylight looked at him innocently and did not reply  he turned jovially to nathaniel letton  fire away he said  give us an approximation of our winning as i said before a million out one way or the other wont matter its bound to be such an almighty big winning  by this time letton was stiffened by the attitude dowsett had taken and his answer was prompt and definite  i fear you are under a misapprehension mr harnish  there are no winnings to be divided with you  now dont get excited i beg of you i have but to press this button  far from excited daylight had all the seeming of being stunned he felt absently in his vest pocket for a match lighted it and discovered that he had no cigarette  the three men watched him with the tense closeness of cats  now that it had come they knew that they had a nasty few minutes before them  do youall mind saying that over again daylight said  seems to me i aint got it just exactly right  youall said  he hung with painful expectancy on nathaniel lettons utterance  i said you were under a misapprehension mr harnish that was all you have been stock gambling and you have been hard hit but neither ward valley nor i nor my associates feel that we owe you anything  daylight pointed at the heap of receipts and stubs on the table  thatall represents ten million twentyseven thousand and fortytwo dollars and sixtyeight cents hard cash  aint it good for anything here  letton smiled and shrugged his shoulders  daylight looked at dowsett and murmured  i guess that story of mine had some meaning after all  he laughed in a sickly fashion  it was your deal all right and youall dole them right too  well i aint kicking  im like the player in that poker game  it was your deal and youall had a right to do your best and you done itcleaned me out slickern a whistle  he gazed at the heap on the table with an air of stupefaction  and thatall aint worth the paper its written on gol dast it youall can sure deal em round when you get a chance oh no i aint akicking  it was your deal and youall certainly done me and a man aint half a man that squeals on another mans deal  and now the hand is played out and the cards are on the table and the deals over but  his hand dipping swiftly into his inside breast pocket appeared with the big colts automatic  as i was saying the old deals finished  now its my deal and im agoing to see if i can hold them four aces  take your hand away you whited sepulchre he cried sharply  nathaniel lettons hand creeping toward the pushbutton on the desk was abruptly arrested  change chairs daylight commanded  take that chair over there you gangrenelivered skunk  jump by god or ill make you leak till folksll think your father was a water hydrant and your mother a sprinklingcart  youall move your chair alongside guggenhammer and youall dowsett sit right there while i just irrelevantly explain the virtues of this here automatic  shes loaded for big game and she goes off eight times  shes a sure hummer when she gets started  preliminary remarks being over i now proceed to deal remember i aint making no remarks about your deal  you done your darndest and it was all right  but this is my deal and its up to me to do my darndest  in the first place youall know me  im burning daylightsavvee  aint afraid of god devil death nor destruction thems my four aces and they sure copper your bets  look at that there living skeleton letton youre sure afraid to die  your bones is all rattling together youre that scared  and look at that fat jew there this little weapons sure put the fear of god in his heart hes yellow as a sick persimmon  dowsett youre a cool one  youall aint batted an eye nor turned a hair  thats because youre great on arithmetic  and that makes youall dead easy in this deal of mine youre sitting there and adding two and two together and youall know i sure got you skinned  you know me and that i aint afraid of nothing  and youall adds up all your money and knows you aint agoing to die if you can help it  ill see you hanged was dowsetts retort  not by a damned sight  when the fun starts youre the first i plug ill hang all right but youall wont live to see it youall die here and now while ill die subject to the laws delaysavvee  being dead with grass growing out of your carcasses you wont know when i hang but ill sure have the pleasure a long time of knowing youall beat me to it  daylight paused  you surely wouldnt kill us letton asked in a queer thin voice  daylight shook his head  its sure too expensive  youall aint worth it  id sooner have my chips back  and i guess youalld sooner give my chips back than go to the deadhouse  a long silence followed  well ive done dealt  its up to youall to play  but while youre deliberating i want to give youall a warning if that door opens and any one of you cusses lets on theres anything unusual right here and then i sure start plugging  they aint a soulll get out the room except feet first  a long session of three hours followed  the deciding factor was not the big automatic pistol but the certitude that daylight would use it not alone were the three men convinced of this but daylight himself was convinced  he was firmly resolved to kill the men if his money was not forthcoming  it was not an easy matter on the spur of the moment to raise ten millions in paper currency and there were vexatious delays  a dozen times mr howison and the head clerk were summoned into the room  on these occasions the pistol lay on daylights lap covered carelessly by a newspaper while he was usually engaged in rolling or lighting his brownpaper cigarettes  but in the end the thing was accomplished  a suitcase was brought up by one of the clerks from the waiting motorcar and daylight snapped it shut on the last package of bills  he paused at the door to make his final remarks  theres three several things i sure want to tell youall  when i get outside this door youallll be set free to act and i just want to warn youall about what to do  in the first place no warrants for my arrestsavvee  this moneys mine and i aint robbed you of it  if it gets out how you gave me the doublecross and how i done you back again the laughll be on you and itll sure be an almighty big laugh youall cant afford that laugh besides having got back my stake that youall robbed me of if you arrest me and try to rob me a second time ill go gunning for youall and ill sure get you  no little fraidcat shrimps like youall can skin burning daylight  if you win you lose and therell sure be some several unexpected funerals around this burg  just look me in the eye and youallll savvee i mean business them stubs and receipts on the table is all yourn  good day  as the door shut behind him nathaniel letton sprang for the telephone and dowsett intercepted him  what are you going to do dowsett demanded  the police  its downright robbery  i wont stand it  i tell you i wont stand it  dowsett smiled grimly but at the same time bore the slender financier back and down into his chair  well talk it over he said and in leon guggenhammer he found an anxious ally  and nothing ever came of it  the thing remained a secret with the three men  nor did daylight ever give the secret away though that afternoon leaning back in his stateroom on the twentieth century his shoes off and feet on a chair he chuckled long and heartily  new york remained forever puzzled over the affair nor could it hit upon a rational explanation by all rights burning daylight should have gone broke yet it was known that he immediately reappeared in san francisco possessing an apparently unimpaired capital  this was evidenced by the magnitude of the enterprises he engaged in such as for instance panama mail by sheer weight of money and fighting power wresting the control away from shiftily and selling out in two months to the harriman interests at a rumored enormous advance    chapter v  back in san francisco daylight quickly added to his reputation in ways it was not an enviable reputation  men were afraid of him  he became known as a fighter a fiend a tiger  his play was a ripping and smashing one and no one knew where or how his next blow would fall the element of surprise was large  he balked on the unexpected and fresh from the wild north his mind not operating in stereotyped channels he was able in unusual degree to devise new tricks and stratagems  and once he won the advantage he pressed it remorselessly  as relentless as a red indian was said of him and it was said truly  on the other hand he was known as square  his word was as good as his bond and this despite the fact that he accepted nobodys word  he always shied at propositions based on gentlemens agreements and a man who ventured his honor as a gentleman in dealing with daylight inevitably was treated to an unpleasant time  daylight never gave his own word unless he held the whiphand  it was a case with the other fellow taking it or nothing  legitimate investment had no place in daylights play  it tied up his money and reduced the element of risk  it was the gambling side of business that fascinated him and to play in his slashing manner required that his money must be ready to hand it was never tied up save for short intervals for he was principally engaged in turning it over and over raiding here there and everywhere a veritable pirate of the financial main a fiveper cent safe investment had no attraction for him but to risk millions in sharp harsh skirmish standing to lose everything or to win fifty or a hundred per cent was the savor of life to him  he played according to the rules of the game but he played mercilessly  when he got a man or a corporation down and they squealed he gouged no less hard  appeals for financial mercy fell on deaf ears  he was a free lance and had no friendly business associations  such alliances as were formed from time to time were purely affairs of expediency and he regarded his allies as men who would give him the doublecross or ruin him if a profitable chance presented  in spite of this point of view he was faithful to his allies  but he was faithful just as long as they were and no longer the treason had to come from them and then it was ware daylight  the business men and financiers of the pacific coast never forgot the lesson of charles klinkner and the california  altamont trust company klinkner was the president  in partnership with daylight the pair raided the san jose interurban  the powerful lake power  electric lighting corporation came to the rescue and klinkner seeing what he thought was the opportunity went over to the enemy in the thick of the pitched battle  daylight lost three millions before he was done with it and before he was done with it he saw the california  altamont trust company hopelessly wrecked and charles klinkner a suicide in a felons cell  not only did daylight lose his grip on san jose interurban but in the crash of his battle front he lost heavily all along the line  it was conceded by those competent to judge that he could have compromised and saved much  but instead he deliberately threw up the battle with san jose interurban and lake power and apparently defeated with napoleonic suddenness struck at klinkner  it was the last unexpected thing klinkner would have dreamed of and daylight knew it  he knew further that the california  altamont trust company has an intrinsically sound institution but that just then it was in a precarious condition due to klinkners speculations with its money  he knew also that in a few months the trust company would be more firmly on its feet than ever thanks to those same speculations and that if he were to strike he must strike immediately its just that much money in pocket and a whole lot more he was reported to have said in connection with his heavy losses  its just so much insurance against the future  henceforth men who go in with me on deals will think twice before they try to doublecross me and then some  the reason for his savageness was that he despised the men with whom he played  he had a conviction that not one in a hundred of them was intrinsically square and as for the square ones he prophesied that playing in a crooked game they were sure to lose and in the long run go broke  his new york experience had opened his eyes  he tore the veils of illusion from the business game and saw its nakedness  he generalized upon industry and society somewhat as follows  society as organized was a vast bunco game  there were many hereditary inefficientsmen and women who were not weak enough to be confined in feebleminded homes but who were not strong enough to be ought else than hewers of wood and drawers of water  then there were the fools who took the organized bunco game seriously honoring and respecting it  they were easy game for the others who saw clearly and knew the bunco game for what it was  work legitimate work was the source of all wealth  that was to say whether it was a sack of potatoes a grand piano or a sevenpassenger touring car it came into being only by the performance of work  where the bunco came in was in the distribution of these things after labor had created them  he failed to see the hornyhanded sons of toil enjoying grand pianos or riding in automobiles  how this came about was explained by the bunco  by tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands men sat up nights and schemed how they could get between the workers and the things the workers produced  these schemers were the business men  when they got between the worker and his product they took a whack out of it for themselves the size of the whack was determined by no rule of equity but by their own strength and swinishness  it was always a case of all the traffic can bear  he saw all men in the business game doing this  one day in a mellow mood induced by a string of cocktails and a hearty lunch he started a conversation with jones the elevator boy jones was a slender mopheaded mangrown truculent flame of an individual who seemed to go out of his way to insult his passengers it was this that attracted daylights interest and he was not long in finding out what was the matter with jones  he was a proletarian according to his own aggressive classification and he had wanted to write for a living  failing to win with the magazines and compelled to find himself in food and shelter he had gone to the little valley of petacha not a hundred miles from los angeles  here toiling in the daytime he planned to write and study at night  but the railroad charged all the traffic would bear  petacha was a desert valley and produced only three things cattle firewood and charcoal  for freight to los angeles on a carload of cattle the railroad charged eight dollars  this jones explained was due to the fact that the cattle had legs and could be driven to los angeles at a cost equivalent to the charge per car load  but firewood had no legs and the railroad charged just precisely twentyfour dollars a carload  this was a fine adjustment for by working hammerandtongs through a twelvehour day after freight had been deducted from the selling price of the wood in los angeles the woodchopper received one dollar and sixty cents  jones had thought to get ahead of the game by turning his wood into charcoal  his estimates were satisfactory  but the railroad also made estimates  it issued a rate of fortytwo dollars a car on charcoal  at the end of three months jones went over his figures and found that he was still making one dollar and sixty cents a day  so i quit jones concluded  i went hobbling for a year and i got back at the railroads  leaving out the little things i came across the sierras in the summer and touched a match to the snowsheds  they only had a little thirtythousanddollar fire i guess that squared up all balances due on petacha  son aint you afraid to be turning loose such information daylight gravely demanded  not on your life quoth jones  they cant prove it  you could say i said so and i could say i didnt say so and a hell of a lot that evidence would amount to with a jury  daylight went into his office and meditated awhile  that was it all the traffic would bear  from top to bottom that was the rule of the game and what kept the game going was the fact that a sucker was born every minute  if a jones were born every minute the game wouldnt last very long  lucky for the players that the workers werent joneses  but there were other and larger phases of the game  little business men shopkeepers and such ilk took what whack they could out of the product of the worker but after all it was the large business men who formed the workers through the little business men  when all was said and done the latter like jones in petacha valley got no more than wages out of their whack  in truth they were hired men for the large business men  still again higher up were the big fellows they used vast and complicated paraphernalia for the purpose on a large scale of getting between hundreds of thousands of workers and their products  these men were not so much mere robbers as gamblers and not content with their direct winnings being essentially gamblers they raided one another  they called this feature of the game high finance  they were all engaged primarily in robbing the worker but every little while they formed combinations and robbed one another of the accumulated loot this explained the fiftythousanddollar raid on him by holdsworthy and the tenmilliondollar raid on him by dowsett letton and guggenhammer and when he raided panama mail he had done exactly the same thing well he concluded it was finer sport robbing the robbers than robbing the poor stupid workers  thus all unread in philosophy daylight preempted for himself the position and vocation of a twentiethcentury superman  he found with rare and mythical exceptions that there was no noblesse oblige among the business and financial supermen  as a clever traveler had announced in an afterdinner speech at the altapacific there was honor amongst thieves and this was what distinguished thieves from honest men  that was it  it hit the nail on the head  these modern supermen were a lot of sordid banditti who had the successful effrontery to preach a code of right and wrong to their victims which they themselves did not practise  with them a mans word was good just as long as he was compelled to keep it  thou shalt not steal was only applicable to the honest worker  they the supermen were above such commandments  they certainly stole and were honored by their fellows according to the magnitude of their stealings  the more daylight played the game the clearer the situation grew despite the fact that every robber was keen to rob every other robber the band was well organized  it practically controlled the political machinery of society from the ward politician up to the senate of the united states  it passed laws that gave it privilege to rob  it enforced these laws by means of the police the marshals the militia and regular army and the courts  and it was a snap  a supermans chiefest danger was his fellowsuperman  the great stupid mass of the people did not count  they were constituted of such inferior clay that the veriest chicanery fooled them  the superman manipulated the strings and when robbery of the workers became too slow or monotonous they turned loose and robbed one another  daylight was philosophical but not a philosopher  he had never read the books  he was a hardheaded practical man and farthest from him was any intention of ever reading the books he had lived life in the simple where books were not necessary for an understanding of life and now life in the complex appeared just as simple  he saw through its frauds and fictions and found it as elemental as on the yukon men were made of the same stuff  they had the same passions and desires  finance was poker on a larger scale  the men who played were the men who had stakes  the workers were the fellows toiling for grubstakes  he saw the game played out according to the everlasting rules and he played a hand himself  the gigantic futility of humanity organized and befuddled by the bandits did not shock him  it was the natural order  practically all human endeavors were futile he had seen so much of it  his partners had starved and died on the stewart hundreds of oldtimers had failed to locate on bonanza and eldorado while swedes and chechaquos had come in on the moosepasture and blindly staked millions  it was life and life was a savage proposition at best  men in civilization robbed because they were so made  they robbed just as cats scratched famine pinched and frost bit  so it was that daylight became a successful financier  he did not go in for swindling the workers  not only did he not have the heart for it but it did not strike him as a sporting proposition  the workers were so easy so stupid it was more like slaughtering fat handreared pheasants on the english preserves he had heard about  the sport to him was in waylaying the successful robbers and taking their spoils from them  there was fun and excitement in that and sometimes they put up the very devil of a fight like robin hood of old daylight proceeded to rob the rich and in a small way to distribute to the needy  but he was charitable after his own fashion  the great mass of human misery meant nothing to him  that was part of the everlasting order he had no patience with the organized charities and the professional charity mongers  nor on the other hand was what he gave a conscience dole  he owed no man and restitution was unthinkable  what he gave was a largess a free spontaneous gift and it was for those about him  he never contributed to an earthquake fund in japan nor to an openair fund in new york city  instead he financed jones the elevator boy for a year that he might write a book  when he learned that the wife of his waiter at the st francis was suffering from tuberculosis he sent her to arizona and later when her case was declared hopeless he sent the husband too to be with her to the end likewise he bought a string of horsehair bridles from a convict in a western penitentiary who spread the good news until it seemed to daylight that half the convicts in that institution were making bridles for him  he bought them all paying from twenty to fifty dollars each for them  they were beautiful and honest things and he decorated all the available wallspace of his bedroom with them  the grim yukon life had failed to make daylight hard  it required civilization to produce this result  in the fierce savage game he now played his habitual geniality imperceptibly slipped away from him as did his lazy western drawl  as his speech became sharp and nervous so did his mental processes  in the swift rush of the game he found less and less time to spend on being merely goodnatured  the change marked his face itself  the lines grew sterner  less often appeared the playful curl of his lips the smile in the wrinkling corners of his eyes  the eyes themselves black and flashing like an indians betrayed glints of cruelty and brutal consciousness of power  his tremendous vitality remained and radiated from all his being but it was vitality under the new aspect of the mantrampling manconqueror  his battles with elemental nature had been in a way impersonal his present battles were wholly with the males of his species and the hardships of the trail the river and the frost marred him far less than the bitter keenness of the struggle with his fellows  he still had recrudescence of geniality but they were largely periodical and forced and they were usually due to the cocktails he took prior to mealtime  in the north he had drunk deeply and at irregular intervals but now his drinking became systematic and disciplined  it was an unconscious development but it was based upon physical and mental condition  the cocktails served as an inhibition without reasoning or thinking about it the strain of the office which was essentially due to the daring and audacity of his ventures required check or cessation and he found through the weeks and months that the cocktails supplied this very thing  they constituted a stone wall  he never drank during the morning nor in office hours but the instant he left the office he proceeded to rear this wall of alcoholic inhibition athwart his consciousness  the office became immediately a closed affair  it ceased to exist  in the afternoon after lunch it lived again for one or two hours when leaving it he rebuilt the wall of inhibition  of course there were exceptions to this and such was the rigor of his discipline that if he had a dinner or a conference before him in which in a business way he encountered enemies or allies and planned or prosecuted campaigns he abstained from drinking  but the instant the business was settled his everlasting call went out for a martini and for a doublemartini at that served in a long glass so as not to excite comment    chapter vi  into daylights life came dede mason  she came rather imperceptibly he had accepted her impersonally along with the office furnishing the office boy morrison the chief confidential and only clerk and all the rest of the accessories of a supermans gambling place of business had he been asked any time during the first months she was in his employ he would have been unable to tell the color of her eyes  from the fact that she was a demiblonde there resided dimly in his subconsciousness a conception that she was a brunette  likewise he had an idea that she was not thin while there was an absence in his mind of any idea that she was fat  as to how she dressed he had no ideas at all  he had no trained eye in such matters nor was he interested he took it for granted in the lack of any impression to the contrary that she was dressed some how  he knew her as miss mason and that was all though he was aware that as a stenographer she seemed quick and accurate  this impression however was quite vague for he had had no experience with other stenographers and naturally believed that they were all quick and accurate  one morning signing up letters he came upon an i shall glancing quickly over the page for similar constructions he found a number of i wills  the i shall was alone  it stood out conspicuously  he pressed the callbell twice and a moment later dede mason entered  did i say that miss mason he asked extending the letter to her and pointing out the criminal phrase  a shade of annoyance crossed her face  she stood convicted  my mistake she said  i am sorry  but its not a mistake you know she added quickly  how do you make that out challenged daylight  it sure dont sound right in my way of thinking  she had reached the door by this time and now turned the offending letter in her hand  its right just the same  but that would make all those i wills wrong then he argued  it does was her audacious answer  shall i change them  i shall be over to look that affair up on monday  daylight repeated the sentence from the letter aloud  he did it with a grave serious air listening intently to the sound of his own voice  he shook his head  it dont sound right miss mason it just dont sound right why nobody writes to me that way they all say i willeducated men too some of them  aint that so  yes she acknowledged and passed out to her machine to make the correction  it chanced that day that among the several men with whom he sat at luncheon was a young englishman a mining engineer  had it happened any other time it would have passed unnoticed but fresh from the tilt with his stenographer daylight was struck immediately by the englishmans i shall  several times in the course of the meal the phrase was repeated and daylight was certain there was no mistake about it  after luncheon he cornered macintosh one of the members whom he knew to have been a college man because of his football reputation  look here bunny daylight demanded which is right i shall be over to look that affair up on monday or i will be over to look that affair up on monday  the exfootball captain debated painfully for a minute  blessed if i know he confessed  which way do i say it  oh i will of course  then the other is right depend upon it  i always was rotten on grammar  on the way back to the office daylight dropped into a bookstore and bought a grammar and for a solid hour his feet up on the desk he toiled through its pages  knock off my head with little apples if the girl aint right he communed aloud at the end of the session  for the first time it struck him that there was something about his stenographer  he had accepted her up to then as a female creature and a bit of office furnishing  but now having demonstrated that she knew more grammar than did business men and college graduates she became an individual she seemed to stand out in his consciousness as conspicuously as the i shall had stood out on the typed page and he began to take notice  he managed to watch her leaving that afternoon and he was aware for the first time that she was wellformed and that her manner of dress was satisfying  he knew none of the details of womens dress and he saw none of the details of her neat shirtwaist and wellcut tailor suit  he saw only the effect in a general sketchy way  she looked right  this was in the absence of anything wrong or out of the way  shes a trim little goodlooker was his verdict when the outer office door closed on her  the next morning dictating he concluded that he liked the way she did her hair though for the life of him he could have given no description of it  the impression was pleasing that was all  she sat between him and the window and he noted that her hair was light brown with hints of golden bronze  a pale sun shining in touched the golden bronze into smouldering fires that were very pleasing to behold  funny he thought that he had never observed this phenomenon before  in the midst of the letter he came to the construction which had caused the trouble the day before  he remembered his wrestle with the grammar and dictated  i shall meet you halfway this proposition  miss mason gave a quick look up at him  the action was purely involuntary and in fact had been half a startle of surprise the next instant her eyes had dropped again and she sat waiting to go on with the dictation  but in that moment of her glance daylight had noted that her eyes were gray  he was later to learn that at times there were golden lights in those same gray eyes but he had seen enough as it was to surprise him for he became suddenly aware that he had always taken her for a brunette with brown eyes as a matter of course  you were right after all he confessed with a sheepish grin that sat incongruously on his stern indianlike features  again he was rewarded by an upward glance and an acknowledging smile and this time he verified the fact that her eyes were gray  but it dont sound right just the same he complained  at this she laughed outright  i beg your pardon she hastened to make amends and then spoiled it by adding but you are so funny  daylight began to feel a slight awkwardness and the sun would persist in setting her hair asmouldering  i didnt mean to be funny he said  that was why i laughed  but it is right and perfectly good grammar  all right he sighedi shall meet you halfway in this propositiongot that and the dictation went on  he discovered that in the intervals when she had nothing to do she read books and magazines or worked on some sort of feminine fancy work  passing her desk once he picked up a volume of kiplings poems and glanced bepuzzled through the pages  you like reading miss mason he said laying the book down  oh yes was her answer very much  another time it was a book of wells the wheels of change whats it all about daylight asked  oh its just a novel a lovestory  she stopped but he still stood waiting and she felt it incumbent to go on  its about a little cockney drapers assistant who takes a vacation on his bicycle and falls in with a young girl very much above him her mother is a popular writer and all that  and the situation is very curious and sad too and tragic  would you care to read it  does he get her daylight demanded  no thats the point of it  he wasnt  and he doesnt get her and youve read all them pages hundreds of them to find that out daylight muttered in amazement  miss mason was nettled as well as amused  but you read the mining and financial news by the hour she retorted  but i sure get something out of that  its business and its different  i get money out of it  what do you get out of books  points of view new ideas life  not worth a cent cash  but lifes worth more than cash she argued  oh well he said with easy masculine tolerance so long as you enjoy it  thats what counts i suppose and theres no accounting for taste  despite his own superior point of view he had an idea that she knew a lot and he experienced a fleeting feeling like that of a barbarian face to face with the evidence of some tremendous culture  to daylight culture was a worthless thing and yet somehow he was vaguely troubled by a sense that there was more in culture than he imagined  again on her desk in passing he noticed a book with which he was familiar  this time he did not stop for he had recognized the cover it was a magazine correspondents book on the klondike and he knew that he and his photograph figured in it and he knew also of a certain sensational chapter concerned with a womans suicide and with one too much daylight  after that he did not talk with her again about books  he imagined what erroneous conclusions she had drawn from that particular chapter and it stung him the more in that they were undeserved of all unlikely things to have the reputation of being a ladykillerhe burning daylightand to have a woman kill herself out of love for him  he felt that he was a most unfortunate man and wondered by what luck that one book of all the thousands of books should have fallen into his stenographers hands  for some days afterward he had an uncomfortable sensation of guiltiness whenever he was in miss masons presence and once he was positive that he caught her looking at him with a curious intent gaze as if studying what manner of man he was  he pumped morrison the clerk who had first to vent his personal grievance against miss mason before he could tell what little he knew of her  she comes from siskiyou county  shes very nice to work with in the office of course but shes rather stuck on herselfexclusive you know  how do you make that out daylight queried  well she thinks too much of herself to associate with those she works with in the office here for instance  she wont have anything to do with a fellow you see  ive asked her out repeatedly to the theatre and the chutes and such things  but nothing doing  says she likes plenty of sleep and cant stay up late and has to go all the way to berkeleythats where she lives  this phase of the report gave daylight a distinct satisfaction she was a bit above the ordinary and no doubt about it  but morrisons next words carried a hurt  but thats all hot air  shes running with the university boys thats what shes doing  she needs lots of sleep and cant go to the theatre with me but she can dance all hours with them  ive heard it pretty straight that she goes to all their hops and such things rather stylish and hightoned for a stenographer id say  and she keeps a horse too  she rides astride all over those hills out there i saw her one sunday myself  oh shes a highflyer and i wonder how she does it  sixtyfive a month dont go far  then she has a sick brother too  live with her people daylight asked  no hasnt got any  they were well to do ive heard  they must have been or that brother of hers couldnt have gone to the university of california  her father had a big cattleranch but he got to fooling with mines or something and went broke before he died  her mother died long before that  her brother must cost a lot of money  he was a husky once played football was great on hunting and being out in the mountains and such things he got his accident breaking horses and then rheumatism or something got into him  one leg is shorter than the other and withered up some  he has to walk on crutches  i saw her out with him oncecrossing the ferry  the doctors have been experimenting on him for years and hes in the french hospital now i think  all of which sidelights on miss mason went to increase daylights interest in her  yet much as he desired he failed to get acquainted with her  he had thoughts of asking her to luncheon but his was the innate chivalry of the frontiersman and the thoughts never came to anything  he knew a selfrespecting squaredealing man was not supposed to take his stenographer to luncheon  such things did happen he knew for he heard the chaffing gossip of the club but he did not think much of such men and felt sorry for the girls  he had a strange notion that a man had less rights over those he employed than over mere acquaintances or strangers  thus had miss mason not been his employee he was confident that he would have had her to luncheon or the theatre in no time  but he felt that it was an imposition for an employer because he bought the time of an employee in working hours to presume in any way upon any of the rest of that employees time  to do so was to act like a bully the situation was unfair  it was taking advantage of the fact that the employee was dependent on one for a livelihood  the employee might permit the imposition through fear of angering the employer and not through any personal inclination at all  in his own case he felt that such an imposition would be peculiarly obnoxious for had she not read that cursed klondike correspondents book  a pretty idea she must have of him a girl that was too hightoned to have anything to do with a goodlooking gentlemanly fellow like morrison  also and down under all his other reasons daylight was timid  the only thing he had ever been afraid of in his life was woman and he had been afraid all his life  nor was that timidity to be put easily to flight now that he felt the first glimmering need and desire for woman  the specter of the apronstring still haunted him and helped him to find excuses for getting on no forwarder with dede mason    chapter vii  not being favored by chance in getting acquainted with dede mason daylights interest in her slowly waned  this was but natural for he was plunged deep in hazardous operations and the fascinations of the game and the magnitude of it accounted for all the energy that even his magnificent organism could generate  such was his absorption that the pretty stenographer slowly and imperceptibly faded from the forefront of his consciousness thus the first faint spur in the best sense of his need for woman ceased to prod  so far as dede mason was concerned he possessed no more than a complacent feeling of satisfaction in that he had a very nice stenographer  and completely to put the quietus on any last lingering hopes he might have had of her he was in the thick of his spectacular and intensely bitter fight with the coastwise steam navigation company and the hawaiian nicaraguan and pacificmexican steamshipcompany he stirred up a bigger muss than he had anticipated and even he was astounded at the wide ramifications of the struggle and at the unexpected and incongruous interests that were drawn into it every newspaper in san francisco turned upon him  it was true one or two of them had first intimated that they were open to subsidization but daylights judgment was that the situation did not warrant such expenditure  up to this time the press had been amusingly tolerant and goodnaturedly sensational about him but now he was to learn what virulent scrupulousness an antagonized press was capable of  every episode of his life was resurrected to serve as foundations for malicious fabrications  daylight was frankly amazed at the new interpretation put upon all he had accomplished and the deeds he had done  from an alaskan hero he was metamorphosed into an alaskan bully liar desperado and all around bad man  not content with this lies upon lies out of whole cloth were manufactured about him  he never replied though once he went to the extent of disburdening his mind to half a dozen reporters  do your damnedest he told them burning daylights bucked bigger things than your dirty lying sheets  and i dont blame you boys that is not much you cant help it  youve got to live  theres a mighty lot of women in this world that make their living in similar fashion to yours because theyre not able to do anything better somebodys got to do the dirty work and it might as well be you youre paid for it and you aint got the backbone to rustle cleaner jobs  the socialist press of the city jubilantly exploited this utterance scattering it broadcast over san francisco in tens of thousands of paper dodgers  and the journalists stung to the quick retaliated with the only means in their powerprinters ink abuse  the attack became bitterer than ever  the whole affair sank to the deeper deeps of rancor and savageness  the poor woman who had killed herself was dragged out of her grave and paraded on thousands of reams of paper as a martyr and a victim to daylights ferocious brutality  staid statistical articles were published proving that he had made his start by robbing poor miners of their claims and that the capstone to his fortune had been put in place by his treacherous violation of faith with the guggenhammers in the deal on ophir  and there were editorials written in which he was called an enemy of society possessed of the manners and culture of a caveman a fomenter of wasteful business troubles the destroyer of the citys prosperity in commerce and trade an anarchist of dire menace and one editorial gravely recommended that hanging would be a lesson to him and his ilk and concluded with the fervent hope that some day his big motorcar would smash up and smash him with it  he was like a big bear raiding a beehive and regardless of the stings he obstinately persisted in pawing for the honey  he gritted his teeth and struck back  beginning with a raid on two steamship companies it developed into a pitched battle with a city a state and a continental coastline  very well they wanted fight and they would get it  it was what he wanted and he felt justified in having come down from the klondike for here he was gambling at a bigger table than ever the yukon had supplied  allied with him on a splendid salary with princely pickings thrown in was a lawyer larry hegan a young irishman with a reputation to make and whose peculiar genius had been unrecognized until daylight picked up with him  hegan had celtic imagination and daring and to such degree that daylights cooler head was necessary as a check on his wilder visions  hegans was a napoleonic legal mind without balance and it was just this balance that daylight supplied  alone the irishman was doomed to failure but directed by daylight he was on the highroad to fortune and recognition  also he was possessed of no more personal or civic conscience than napoleon  it was hegan who guided daylight through the intricacies of modern politics labor organization and commercial and corporation law  it was hegan prolific of resource and suggestion who opened daylights eyes to undreamed possibilities in twentiethcentury warfare and it was daylight rejecting accepting and elaborating who planned the campaigns and prosecuted them  with the pacific coast from peugeot sound to panama buzzing and humming and with san francisco furiously about his ears the two big steamship companies had all the appearance of winning  it looked as if burning daylight was being beaten slowly to his knees  and then he struckat the steamship companies at san francisco at the whole pacific coast  it was not much of a blow at first  a christian endeavor convention being held in san francisco a row was started by express drivers union no 927 over the handling of a small heap of baggage at the ferry building  a few heads were broken a score of arrests made and the baggage was delivered  no one would have guessed that behind this petty wrangle was the fine irish hand of hegan made potent by the klondike gold of burning daylight  it was an insignificant affair at bestor so it seemed  but the teamsters union took up the quarrel backed by the whole water front federation  step by step the strike became involved  a refusal of cooks and waiters to serve scab teamsters or teamsters employers brought out the cooks and waiters the butchers and meatcutters refused to handle meat destined for unfair restaurants  the combined employers associations put up a solid front and found facing them the 40000 organized laborers of san francisco  the restaurant bakers and the bakery wagon drivers struck followed by the milkers milk drivers and chicken pickers  the building trades asserted its position in unambiguous terms and all san francisco was in turmoil  but still it was only san francisco  hegans intrigues were masterly and daylights campaign steadily developed  the powerful fighting organization known as the pacific slope seamans union refused to work vessels the cargoes of which were to be handled by scab longshoremen and freighthandlers  the union presented its ultimatum and then called a strike  this had been daylights objective all the time every incoming coastwise vessel was boarded by the union officials and its crew sent ashore  and with the seamen went the firemen the engineers and the sea cooks and waiters  daily the number of idle steamers increased  it was impossible to get scab crews for the men of the seamans union were fighters trained in the hard school of the sea and when they went out it meant blood and death to scabs  this phase of the strike spread up and down the entire pacific coast until all the ports were filled with idle ships and sea transportation was at a standstill  the days and weeks dragged out and the strike held the coastwise steam navigation company and the hawaiian nicaraguan and pacificmexican steamship company were tied up completely  the expenses of combating the strike were tremendous and they were earning nothing while daily the situation went from bad to worse until peace at any price became the cry  and still there was no peace until daylight and his allies played out their hand raked in the winnings and allowed a goodly portion of a continent to resume business  it was noted in following years that several leaders of workmen built themselves houses and blocks of renting flats and took trips to the old countries while more immediately other leaders and dark horses came to political preferment and the control of the municipal government and the municipal moneys  in fact san franciscos bossridden condition was due in greater degree to daylights widespreading battle than even san francisco ever dreamed  for the part he had played the details of which were practically all rumor and guesswork quickly leaked out and in consequence he became a muchexecrated and wellhated man nor had daylight himself dreamed that his raid on the steamship companies would have grown to such colossal proportions  but he had got what he was after  he had played an exciting hand and won beating the steamship companies down into the dust and mercilessly robbing the stockholders by perfectly legal methods before he let go of course in addition to the large sums of money he had paid over his allies had rewarded themselves by gobbling the advantages which later enabled them to loot the city  his alliance with a gang of cutthroats had brought about a lot of cutthroating  but his conscience suffered no twinges  he remembered what he had once heard an old preacher utter namely that they who rose by the sword perished by the sword one took his chances when he played with cutting throats and his daylights throat was still intact  that was it  and he had won  it was all gamble and war between the strong men  the fools did not count  they were always getting hurt and that they always had been getting hurt was the conclusion he drew from what little he knew of history  san francisco had wanted war and he had given it war  it was the game  all the big fellows did the same and they did much worse too  dont talk to me about morality and civic duty he replied to a persistent interviewer  if you quit your job tomorrow and went to work on another paper you would write just what you were told to write  its morality and civic duty now with you on the new job it would be backing up a thieving railroad with morality and civic duty i suppose  your price my son is just about thirty per week thats what you sell for  but your paper would sell for a bit more pay its price today and it would shift its present rotten policy to some other rotten policy but it would never let up on morality and civic duty  and all because a sucker is born every minute  so long as the people stand for it theyll get it good and plenty my son  and the shareholders and business interests might as well shut up squawking about how much theyve been hurt  you never hear ary squeal out of them when theyve got the other fellow down and are gouging him  this is the time they got gouged and thats all there is to it  talk about mollycoddles  son those same fellows would steal crusts from starving men and pull gold fillings from the mouths of corpses yep and squawk like sam scratch if some blamed corpse hit back  theyre all tarred with the same brush little and big  look at your sugar trustwith all its millions stealing water like a common thief from new york city and shortweighing the government on its phoney scales morality and civic duty  son forget it    chapter viii  daylights coming to civilization had not improved him  true he wore better clothes had learned slightly better manners and spoke better english  as a gambler and a mantrampler he had developed remarkable efficiency  also he had become used to a higher standard of living and he had whetted his wits to razor sharpness in the fierce complicated struggle of fighting males but he had hardened and at the expense of his oldtime wholesouled geniality  of the essential refinements of civilization he knew nothing  he did not know they existed  he had become cynical bitter and brutal  power had its effect on him that it had on all men  suspicious of the big exploiters despising the fools of the exploited herd he had faith only in himself  this led to an undue and erroneous exaltation of his ego while kindly consideration of othersnay even simple respectwas destroyed until naught was left for him but to worship at the shrine of self  physically he was not the man of iron muscles who had come down out of the arctic  he did not exercise sufficiently ate more than was good for him and drank altogether too much  his muscles were getting flabby and his tailor called attention to his increasing waistband  in fact daylight was developing a definite paunch  this physical deterioration was manifest likewise in his face  the lean indian visage was suffering a city change  the slight hollows in the cheeks under the high cheekbones had filled out  the beginning of puffsacks under the eyes was faintly visible  the girth of the neck had increased and the first crease and fold of a double chin were becoming plainly discernible  the old effect of asceticism bred of terrific hardships and toil had vanished the features had become broader and heavier betraying all the stigmata of the life he lived advertising the mans selfindulgence harshness and brutality  even his human affiliations were descending  playing a lone hand contemptuous of most of the men with whom he played lacking in sympathy or understanding of them and certainly independent of them he found little in common with those to be encountered say at the altapacific  in point of fact when the battle with the steamship companies was at its height and his raid was inflicting incalculable damage on all business interests he had been asked to resign from the altapacific the idea had been rather to his liking and he had found new quarters in clubs like the riverside organized and practically maintained by the city bosses  he found that he really liked such men better  they were more primitive and simple and they did not put on airs  they were honest buccaneers frankly in the game for what they could get out of it on the surface more raw and savage but at least not glossed over with oily or graceful hypocrisy  the altapacific had suggested that his resignation be kept a private matter and then had privily informed the newspapers  the latter had made great capital out of the forced resignation but daylight had grinned and silently gone his way though registering a black mark against more than one club member who was destined to feel in the days to come the crushing weight of the klondikers financial paw  the stormcentre of a combined newspaper attack lasting for months daylights character had been torn to shreds  there was no fact in his history that had not been distorted into a criminality or a vice  this public making of him over into an iniquitous monster had pretty well crushed any lingering hope he had of getting acquainted with dede mason  he felt that there was no chance for her ever to look kindly on a man of his caliber and beyond increasing her salary to seventyfive dollars a month he proceeded gradually to forget about her  the increase was made known to her through morrison and later she thanked daylight and that was the end of it  one weekend feeling heavy and depressed and tired of the city and its ways he obeyed the impulse of a whim that was later to play an important part in his life  the desire to get out of the city for a whiff of country air and for a change of scene was the cause  yet to himself he made the excuse of going to glen ellen for the purpose of inspecting the brickyard with which holdsworthy had goldbricked him  he spent the night in the little country hotel and on sunday morning astride a saddlehorse rented from the glen ellen butcher rode out of the village  the brickyard was close at hand on the flat beside the sonoma creek  the kilns were visible among the trees when he glanced to the left and caught sight of a cluster of wooded knolls half a mile away perched on the rolling slopes of sonoma mountain  the mountain itself wooded towered behind  the trees on the knolls seemed to beckon to him  the dry earlysummer air shot through with sunshine was wine to him unconsciously he drank it in deep breaths  the prospect of the brickyard was uninviting  he was jaded with all things business and the wooded knolls were calling to him  a horse was between his legsa good horse he decided one that sent him back to the cayuses he had ridden during his eastern oregon boyhood he had been somewhat of a rider in those early days and the champ of bit and creak of saddleleather sounded good to him now  resolving to have his fun first and to look over the brickyard afterward he rode on up the hill prospecting for a way across country to get to the knolls  he left the country road at the first gate he came to and cantered through a hayfield  the grain was waisthigh on either side the wagon road and he sniffed the warm aroma of it with delighted nostrils  larks flew up before him and from everywhere came mellow notes  from the appearance of the road it was patent that it had been used for hauling clay to the now idle brickyard  salving his conscience with the idea that this was part of the inspection he rode on to the claypita huge scar in a hillside  but he did not linger long swinging off again to the left and leaving the road  not a farmhouse was in sight and the change from the city crowding was essentially satisfying  he rode now through open woods across little flowerscattered glades till he came upon a spring  flat on the ground he drank deeply of the clear water and looking about him felt with a shock the beauty of the world  it came to him like a discovery he had never realized it before he concluded and also he had forgotten much  one could not sit in at high finance and keep track of such things  as he drank in the air the scene and the distant song of larks he felt like a pokerplayer rising from a nightlong table and coming forth from the pent atmosphere to taste the freshness of the morn  at the base of the knolls he encountered a tumbledown stakeandrider fence  from the look of it he judged it must be forty years old at leastthe work of some first pioneer who had taken up the land when the days of gold had ended  the woods were very thick here yet fairly clear of underbrush so that while the blue sky was screened by the arched branches he was able to ride beneath  he now found himself in a nook of several acres where the oak and manzanita and madrono gave way to clusters of stately redwoods  against the foot of a steepsloped knoll he came upon a magnificent group of redwoods that seemed to have gathered about a tiny gurgling spring  he halted his horse for beside the spring uprose a wild california lily  it was a wonderful flower growing there in the cathedral nave of lofty trees  at least eight feet in height its stem rose straight and slender green and bare for twothirds its length and then burst into a shower of snowwhite waxen bells  there were hundreds of these blossoms all from the one stem delicately poised and ethereally frail  daylight had never seen anything like it  slowly his gaze wandered from it to all that was about him  he took off his hat with almost a vague religious feeling  this was different  no room for contempt and evil here  this was clean and fresh and beautifulsomething he could respect  it was like a church  the atmosphere was one of holy calm  here man felt the prompting of nobler things  much of this and more was in daylights heart as he looked about him but it was not a concept of his mind  he merely felt it without thinking about it at all  on the steep incline above the spring grew tiny maidenhair ferns while higher up were larger ferns and brakes  great mosscovered trunks of fallen trees lay here and there slowly sinking back and merging into the level of the forest mould beyond in a slightly clearer space wild grape and honeysuckle swung in green riot from gnarled old oak trees  a gray douglas squirrel crept out on a branch and watched him from somewhere came the distant knocking of a woodpecker  this sound did not disturb the hush and awe of the place  quiet woods noises belonged there and made the solitude complete  the tiny bubbling ripple of the spring and the gray flash of treesquirrel were as yardsticks with which to measure the silence and motionless repose  might be a million miles from anywhere daylight whispered to himself  but ever his gaze returned to the wonderful lily beside the bubbling spring  he tethered the horse and wandered on foot among the knolls their tops were crowned with centuryold spruce trees and their sides clothed with oaks and madronos and native holly  but to the perfect redwoods belonged the small but deep canon that threaded its way among the knolls  here he found no passage out for his horse and he returned to the lily beside the spring  on foot tripping stumbling leading the animal he forced his way up the hillside  and ever the ferns carpeted the way of his feet ever the forest climbed with him and arched overhead and ever the clean joy and sweetness stole in upon his senses  on the crest he came through an amazing thicket of velvettrunked young madronos and emerged on an open hillside that led down into a tiny valley  the sunshine was at first dazzling in its brightness and he paused and rested for he was panting from the exertion  not of old had he known shortness of breath such as this and muscles that so easily tired at a stiff climb  a tiny stream ran down the tiny valley through a tiny meadow that was carpeted kneehigh with grass and blue and white nemophila  the hillside was covered with mariposa lilies and wild hyacinth down through which his horse dropped slowly with circumspect feet and reluctant gait  crossing the stream daylight followed a faint cattle trail over a low rocky hill and through a winewooded forest of manzanita and emerged upon another tiny valley down which filtered another springfed meadowbordered streamlet  a jackrabbit bounded from a bush under his horses nose leaped the stream and vanished up the opposite hillside of scruboak  daylight watched it admiringly as he rode on to the head of the meadow  here he startled up a manypronged buck that seemed to soar across the meadow and to soar over the stakeandrider fence and still soaring disappeared in a friendly copse beyond  daylights delight was unbounded  it seemed to him that he had never been so happy  his old woods training was aroused and he was keenly interested in everything in the moss on the trees and branches in the bunches of mistletoe hanging in the oaks in the nest of a woodrat in the watercress growing in the sheltered eddies of the little stream in the butterflies drifting through the rifted sunshine and shadow in the blue jays that flashed in splashes of gorgeous color across the forest aisles in the tiny birds like wrens that hopped among the bushes and imitated certain minor quailcalls and in the crimsoncrested woodpecker that ceased its knocking and cocked its head on one side to survey him  crossing the stream he struck faint vestiges of a woodroad used evidently a generation back when the meadow had been cleared of its oaks  he found a hawks nest on the lightningshattered tipmost top of a sixfoot redwood  and to complete it all his horse stumbled upon several large broods of halfgrown quail and the air was filled with the thrum of their flight  he halted and watched the young ones petrifying and disappearing on the ground before his eyes and listening to the anxious calls of the old ones hidden in the thickets  it sure beats country places and bungalows at menlo park he communed aloud and if ever i get the hankering for country life its me for this every time  the old woodroad led him to a clearing where a dozen acres of grapes grew on winered soil  a cowpath more trees and thickets and he dropped down a hillside to the southeast exposure  here poised above a big forested canon and looking out upon sonoma valley was a small farmhouse  with its barn and outhouses it snuggled into a nook in the hillside which protected it from west and north  it was the erosion from this hillside he judged that had formed the little level stretch of vegetable garden  the soil was fat and black and there was water in plenty for he saw several faucets running wide open  forgotten was the brickyard  nobody was at home but daylight dismounted and ranged the vegetable garden eating strawberries and green peas inspecting the old adobe barn and the rusty plough and harrow and rolling and smoking cigarettes while he watched the antics of several broods of young chickens and the mother hens  a foottrail that led down the wall of the big canyon invited him and he proceeded to follow it  a waterpipe usually above ground paralleled the trail which he concluded led upstream to the bed of the creek  the wall of the canon was several hundred feet from top to bottom and magnificent were the untouched trees that the place was plunged in perpetual shade  he measured with his eye spruces five and six feet in diameter and redwoods even larger  one such he passed a twister that was at least ten or eleven feet through the trail led straight to a small dam where was the intake for the pipe that watered the vegetable garden  here beside the stream were alders and laurel trees and he walked through fernbrakes higher than his head  velvety moss was everywhere out of which grew maidenhair and goldback ferns  save for the dam it was a virgin wild  no ax had invaded and the trees died only of old age and stress of winter storm  the huge trunks of those that had fallen lay mosscovered slowly resolving back into the soil from which they sprang  some had lain so long that they were quite gone though their faint outlines level with the mould could still be seen  others bridged the stream and from beneath the bulk of one monster half a dozen younger trees overthrown and crushed by the fall growing out along the ground still lived and prospered their roots bathed by the stream their upshooting branches catching the sunlight through the gap that had been made in the forest roof  back at the farmhouse daylight mounted and rode on away from the ranch and into the wilder canons and steeper steeps beyond nothing could satisfy his holiday spirit now but the ascent of sonoma mountain and here on the crest three hours afterward he emerged tired and sweaty garments torn and face and hands scratched but with sparkling eyes and an unwonted zestfulness of expression  he felt the illicit pleasure of a schoolboy playing truant  the big gambling table of san francisco seemed very far away  but there was more than illicit pleasure in his mood  it was as though he were going through a sort of cleansing bath  no room here for all the sordidness meanness and viciousness that filled the dirty pool of city existence  without pondering in detail upon the matter at all his sensations were of purification and uplift  had he been asked to state how he felt he would merely have said that he was having a good time for he was unaware in his selfconsciousness of the potent charm of nature that was percolating through his cityrotted body and brainpotent in that he came of an abysmal past of wilderness dwellers while he was himself coated with but the thinnest rind of crowded civilization  there were no houses in the summit of sonoma mountain and all alone under the azure california sky he reined in on the southern edge of the peak  he saw open pasture country intersected with wooded canons descending to the south and west from his feet crease on crease and roll on roll from lower level to lower level to the floor of petaluma valley flat as a billiardtable a cardboard affair all patches and squares of geometrical regularity where the fat freeholds were farmed beyond to the west rose range on range of mountains cuddling purple mists of atmosphere in their valleys and still beyond over the last range of all he saw the silver sheen of the pacific  swinging his horse he surveyed the west and north from santa rosa to st helena and on to the east across sonoma to the chaparralcovered range that shut off the view of napa valley  here part way up the eastern wall of sonoma valley in range of a line intersecting the little village of glen ellen he made out a scar upon a hillside  his first thought was that it was the dump of a mine tunnel but remembering that he was not in goldbearing country he dismissed the scar from his mind and continued the circle of his survey to the southeast where across the waters of san pablo bay he could see sharp and distant the twin peaks of mount diablo  to the south was mount tamalpais and yes he was right fifty miles away where the draughty winds of the pacific blew in the golden gate the smoke of san francisco made a lowlying haze against the sky  i aint seen so much country all at once in many a day he thought aloud  he was loath to depart and it was not for an hour that he was able to tear himself away and take the descent of the mountain working out a new route just for the fun of it late afternoon was upon him when he arrived back at the wooded knolls  here on the top of one of them his keen eyes caught a glimpse of a shade of green sharply differentiated from any he had seen all day studying it for a minute he concluded that it was composed of three cypress trees and he knew that nothing else than the hand of man could have planted them there impelled by curiosity purely boyish he made up his mind to investigate  so densely wooded was the knoll and so steep that he had to dismount and go up on foot at times even on hands and knees struggling hard to force a way through the thicker underbrush  he came out abruptly upon the cypresses  they were enclosed in a small square of ancient fence the pickets he could plainly see had been hewn and sharpened by hand  inside were the mounds of two childrens graves two wooden headboards likewise handhewn told the state little david born 1855 died 1859 and little roy born 1853 died 1860  the poor little kids daylight muttered  the graves showed signs of recent care  withered bouquets of wild flowers were on the mounds and the lettering on the headboards was freshly painted  guided by these clews daylight cast about for a trail and found one leading down the side opposite to his ascent circling the base of the knoll he picked up with his horse and rode on to the farmhouse  smoke was rising from the chimney and he was quickly in conversation with a nervous slender young man who he learned was only a tenant on the ranch  how large was it  a matter of one hundred and eighty acres though it seemed much larger  this was because it was so irregularly shaped yes it included the claypit and all the knolls and its boundary that ran along the big canon was over a mile long  you see the young man said it was so rough and broken that when they began to farm this country the farmers bought in the good land to the edge of it  thats why its boundaries are all gouged and jagged  oh yes he and his wife managed to scratch a living without working too hard  they didnt have to pay much rent  hillard the owner depended on the income from the claypit  hillard was well off and had big ranches and vineyards down on the flat of the valley  the brickyard paid ten cents a cubic yard for the clay  as for the rest of the ranch the land was good in patches where it was cleared like the vegetable garden and the vineyard but the rest of it was too much upanddown  youre not a farmer daylight said  the young man laughed and shook his head  no im a telegraph operator  but the wife and i decided to take a two years vacation and  here we are but the times about up  im going back into the office this fall after i get the grapes off  yes there were about eleven acres in the vineyardwine grapes the price was usually good  he grew most of what they ate  if he owned the place hed clear a patch of land on the sidehill above the vineyard and plant a small home orchard  the soil was good  there was plenty of pasturage all over the ranch and there were several cleared patches amounting to about fifteen acres in all where he grew as much mountain hay as could be found  it sold for three to five dollars more a ton than the rankstalked valley hay  daylight listened there came to him a sudden envy of this young fellow living right in the midst of all this which daylight had travelled through the last few hours  what in thunder are you going back to the telegraph office for he demanded  the young man smiled with a certain wistfulness  because we cant get ahead here he hesitated an instant and because there are added expenses coming  the rent small as it is counts and besides im not strong enough to effectually farm the place  if i owned it or if i were a real husky like you id ask nothing better  nor would the wife  again the wistful smile hovered on his face  you see were country born and after bucking with cities for a few years we kind of feel we like the country best  weve planned to get ahead though and then some day well buy a patch of land and stay with it  the graves of the children  yes he had relettered them and hoed the weeds out  it had become the custom  whoever lived on the ranch did that  for years the story ran the father and mother had returned each summer to the graves  but there had come a time when they came no more and then old hillard started the custom  the scar across the valley  an old mine  it had never paid  the men had worked on it off and on for years for the indications had been good  but that was years and years ago  no paying mine had ever been struck in the valley though there had been no end of prospectholes put down and there had been a sort of rush there thirty years back  a fraillooking young woman came to the door to call the young man to supper  daylights first thought was that city living had not agreed with her  and then he noted the slight tan and healthy glow that seemed added to her face and he decided that the country was the place for her  declining an invitation to supper he rode on for glen ellen sitting slackkneed in the saddle and softly humming forgotten songs he dropped down the rough winding road through covered pasture with here and there thickets of manzanita and vistas of open glades  he listened greedily to the quail calling and laughed outright once in sheer joy at a tiny chipmunk that fled scolding up a bank slipping on the crumbly surface and falling down then dashing across the road under his horses nose and still scolding scrabbling up a protecting oak  daylight could not persuade himself to keep to the travelled roads that day and another cut across country to glen ellen brought him upon a canon that so blocked his way that he was glad to follow a friendly cowpath  this led him to a small frame cabin  the doors and windows were open and a cat was nursing a litter of kittens in the doorway but no one seemed at home  he descended the trail that evidently crossed the canon  part way down he met an old man coming up through the sunset  in his hand he carried a pail of foamy milk  he wore no hat and in his face framed with snowwhite hair and beard was the ruddy glow and content of the passing summer day  daylight thought that he had never seen so contentedlooking a being  how old are you daddy he queried  eightyfour was the reply  yes sirree eightyfour and spryer than most  you must a taken good care of yourself daylight suggested  i dont know about that  i aint loafed none  i walked across the plains with an oxteam and fit injuns in 51 and i was a family man then with seven youngsters  i reckon i was as old then as you are now or pretty nigh on to it  dont you find it lonely here  the old man shifted the pail of milk and reflected  that all depends he said oracularly  i aint never been lonely except when the old wife died  some fellers are lonely in a crowd and im one of them  thats the only time im lonely is when i go to frisco  but i dont go no more thank you most to death this is good enough for me ive ben right here in this valley since 54one of the first settlers after the spaniards  daylight started his horse saying  well good night daddy  stick with it  you got all the young bloods skinned and i guess youve sure buried a mighty sight of them  the old man chuckled and daylight rode on singularly at peace with himself and all the world  it seemed that the old contentment of trail and camp he had known on the yukon had come back to him  he could not shake from his eyes the picture of the old pioneer coming up the trail through the sunset light  he was certainly going some for eightyfour the thought of following his example entered daylights mind but the big game of san francisco vetoed the idea  well anyway he decided when i get old and quit the game ill settle down in a place something like this and the city can go to hell    chapter ix  instead of returning to the city on monday daylight rented the butchers horse for another day and crossed the bed of the valley to its eastern hills to look at the mine  it was dryer and rockier here than where he had been the day before and the ascending slopes supported mainly chaparral scrubby and dense and impossible to penetrate on horseback  but in the canyons water was plentiful and also a luxuriant forest growth  the mine was an abandoned affair but he enjoyed the halfhours scramble around  he had had experience in quartzmining before he went to alaska and he enjoyed the recrudescence of his old wisdom in such matters  the story was simple to him good prospects that warranted the starting of the tunnel into the sidehill the three months work and the getting short of money the layoff while the men went away and got jobs then the return and a new stretch of work with the pay ever luring and ever receding into the mountain until after years of hope the men had given up and vanished  most likely they were dead by now daylight thought as he turned in the saddle and looked back across the canyon at the ancient dump and dark mouth of the tunnel  as on the previous day just for the joy of it he followed cattletrails at haphazard and worked his way up toward the summits coming out on a wagon road that led upward he followed it for several miles emerging in a small mountainencircled valley where half a dozen poor ranchers farmed the winegrapes on the steep slopes beyond the road pitched upward  dense chaparral covered the exposed hillsides but in the creases of the canons huge spruce trees grew and wild oats and flowers  half an hour later sheltering under the summits themselves he came out on a clearing  here and there in irregular patches where the steep and the soil favored wine grapes were growing daylight could see that it had been a stiff struggle and that wild nature showed fresh signs of winningchaparral that had invaded the clearings patches and parts of patches of vineyard unpruned grassgrown and abandoned and everywhere old stakeandrider fences vainly striving to remain intact  here at a small farmhouse surrounded by large outbuildings the road ended  beyond the chaparral blocked the way  he came upon an old woman forking manure in the barnyard and reined in by the fence  hello mother was his greeting aint you got any menfolk around to do that for you  she leaned on her pitchfork hitched her skirt in at the waist and regarded him cheerfully  he saw that her toilworn weatherexposed hands were like a mans callused largeknuckled and gnarled and that her stockingless feet were thrust into heavy mans brogans  nary a man she answered  and where be you from and all the way up here  wont you stop and hitch and have a glass of wine  striding clumsily but efficiently like a laboringman she led him into the largest building where daylight saw a handpress and all the paraphernalia on a small scale for the making of wine  it was too far and too bad a road to haul the grapes to the valley wineries she explained and so they were compelled to do it themselves  they he learned were she and her daughter the latter a widow of fortyodd it had been easier before the grandson died and before he went away to fight savages in the philippines  he had died out there in battle  daylight drank a full tumbler of excellent riesling talked a few minutes and accounted for a second tumbler  yes they just managed not to starve  her husband and she had taken up this government land in 57 and cleared it and farmed it ever since until he died when she had carried it on  it actually didnt pay for the toil but what were they to do  there was the wine trust and wine was down  that riesling  she delivered it to the railroad down in the valley for twentytwo cents a gallon  and it was a long haul  it took a day for the round trip  her daughter was gone now with a load  daylight knew that in the hotels riesling not quite so good even was charged for at from a dollar and a half to two dollars a quart  and she got twentytwo cents a gallon  that was the game  she was one of the stupid lowly she and her people before herthe ones that did the work drove their oxen across the plains cleared and broke the virgin land toiled all days and all hours paid their taxes and sent their sons and grandsons out to fight and die for the flag that gave them such ample protection that they were able to sell their wine for twentytwo cents  the same wine was served to him at the st francis for two dollars a quart or eight dollars a short gallon  that was it  between her and her handpress on the mountain clearing and him ordering his wine in the hotel was a difference of seven dollars and seventyeight cents  a clique of sleek men in the city got between her and him to just about that amount  and besides them there was a horde of others that took their whack  they called it railroading high finance banking wholesaling real estate and such things but the point was that they got it while she got what was lefttwentytwo cents  oh well a sucker was born every minute he sighed to himself and nobody was to blame it was all a game and only a few could win but it was damned hard on the suckers  how old are you mother he asked  seventynine come next january  worked pretty hard i suppose  sense i was seven  i was bound out in michigan state until i was womangrown  then i married and i reckon the work got harder and harder  when are you going to take a rest  she looked at him as though she chose to think his question facetious and did not reply  do you believe in god  she nodded her head  then you get it all back he assured her but in his heart he was wondering about god that allowed so many suckers to be born and that did not break up the gambling game by which they were robbed from the cradle to the grave  how much of that riesling you got  she ran her eyes over the casks and calculated  just short of eight hundred gallons  he wondered what he could do with all of it and speculated as to whom he could give it away  what would you do if you got a dollar a gallon for it he asked  drop dead i suppose  no speaking seriously  get me some false teeth shingle the house and buy a new wagon the roads mighty hard on wagons  and after that  buy me a coffin  well theyre yours mother coffin and all  she looked her incredulity  no i mean it  and theres fifty to bind the bargain  never mind the receipt  its the rich ones that need watching their memories being so infernal short you know  heres my address youve got to deliver it to the railroad  and now show me the way out of here  i want to get up to the top  on through the chaparral he went following faint cattle trails and working slowly upward till he came out on the divide and gazed down into napa valley and back across to sonoma mountain a sweet land he muttered an almighty sweet land  circling around to the right and dropping down along the cattletrails he quested for another way back to sonoma valley but the cattletrails seemed to fade out and the chaparral to grow thicker with a deliberate viciousness and even when he won through in places the canon and small feeders were too precipitous for his horse and turned him back  but there was no irritation about it  he enjoyed it all for he was back at his old game of bucking nature  late in the afternoon he broke through and followed a welldefined trail down a dry canon here he got a fresh thrill  he had heard the baying of the hound some minutes before and suddenly across the bare face of the hill above him he saw a large buck in flight  and not far behind came the deerhound a magnificent animal  daylight sat tense in his saddle and watched until they disappeared his breath just a trifle shorter as if he too were in the chase his nostrils distended and in his bones the old hunting ache and memories of the days before he came to live in cities  the dry canon gave place to one with a slender ribbon of running water the trail ran into a woodroad and the woodroad emerged across a small flat upon a slightly travelled county road  there were no farms in this immediate section and no houses  the soil was meagre the bedrock either close to the surface or constituting the surface itself  manzanita and scruboak however flourished and walled the road on either side with a jungle growth  and out a runway through this growth a man suddenly scuttled in a way that reminded daylight of a rabbit  he was a little man in patched overalls bareheaded with a cotton shirt open at the throat and down the chest  the sun was ruddybrown in his face and by it his sandy hair was bleached on the ends to peroxide blond  he signed to daylight to halt and held up a letter if youre going to town id be obliged if you mail this  i sure will daylight put it into his coat pocket  do you live hereabouts stranger  but the little man did not answer  he was gazing at daylight in a surprised and steadfast fashion  i know you the little man announced  youre elam harnishburning daylight the papers call you  am i right  daylight nodded  but what under the sun are you doing here in the chaparral  daylight grinned as he answered drumming up trade for a free rural delivery route  well im glad i wrote that letter this afternoon the little man went on or else id have missed seeing you  ive seen your photo in the papers many a time and ive a good memory for faces  i recognized you at once  my names ferguson  do you live hereabouts daylight repeated his query  oh yes ive got a little shack back here in the bush a hundred yards and a pretty spring and a few fruit trees and berry bushes come in and take a look  and that spring is a dandy  you never tasted water like it  come in and try it  walking and leading his horse daylight followed the quickstepping eager little man through the green tunnel and emerged abruptly upon the clearing if clearing it might be called where wild nature and mans earthscratching were inextricably blended  it was a tiny nook in the hills protected by the steep walls of a canon mouth  here were several large oaks evidencing a richer soil  the erosion of ages from the hillside had slowly formed this deposit of fat earth  under the oaks almost buried in them stood a rough unpainted cabin the wide verandah of which with chairs and hammocks advertised an outof doors bedchamber  daylights keen eyes took in every thing  the clearing was irregular following the patches of the best soil and every fruit tree and berry bush and even each vegetable plant had the water personally conducted to it  the tiny irrigation channels were every where and along some of them the water was running  ferguson looked eagerly into his visitors face for signs of approbation  what do you think of it eh  handreared and manicured every blessed tree daylight laughed but the joy and satisfaction that shone in his eyes contented the little man  why dye know i know every one of those trees as if they were sons of mine  i planted them nursed them fed them and brought them up come on and peep at the spring  its sure a hummer was daylights verdict after due inspection and sampling as they turned back for the house  the interior was a surprise  the cooking being done in the small leanto kitchen the whole cabin formed a large living room  a great table in the middle was comfortably littered with books and magazines all the available wall space from floor to ceiling was occupied by filled bookshelves  it seemed to daylight that he had never seen so many books assembled in one place  skins of wildcat coon and deer lay about on the pineboard floor  shot them myself and tanned them too ferguson proudly asserted  the crowning feature of the room was a huge fireplace of rough stones and boulders  built it myself ferguson proclaimed and by god she drew never a wisp of smoke anywhere save in the pointed channel and that during the big southeasters  daylight found himself charmed and made curious by the little man  why was he hiding away here in the chaparral he and his books  he was nobodys fool anybody could see that  then why the whole affair had a tinge of adventure and daylight accepted an invitation to supper half prepared to find his host a rawfruitandnuteater or some similar sort of health faddest at table while eating rice and jackrabbit curry the latter shot by ferguson they talked it over and daylight found the little man had no food views  he ate whatever he liked and all he wanted avoiding only such combinations that experience had taught him disagreed with his digestion  next daylight surmised that he might be touched with religion but quest about as he would in a conversation covering the most divergent topics he could find no hint of queerness or unusualness  so it was when between them they had washed and wiped the dishes and put them away and had settled down to a comfortable smoke that daylight put his question  look here ferguson  ever since we got together ive been casting about to find out whats wrong with you to locate a screw loose somewhere but ill be danged if ive succeeded what are you doing here anyway  what made you come here  what were you doing for a living before you came here  go ahead and elucidate yourself  ferguson frankly showed his pleasure at the questions  first of all he began the doctors wound up by losing all hope for me  gave me a few months at best and that after a course in sanatoriums and a trip to europe and another to hawaii  they tried electricity and forced feeding and fasting i was a graduate of about everything in the curriculum  they kept me poor with their bills while i went from bad to worse the trouble with me was two fold first i was a born weakling and next i was living unnaturallytoo much work and responsibility and strain  i was managing editor of the timestribune  daylight gasped mentally for the timestribune was the biggest and most influential paper in san francisco and always had been so  and i wasnt strong enough for the strain  of course my body went back on me and my mind too for that matter  it had to be bolstered up with whiskey which wasnt good for it any more than was the living in clubs and hotels good for my stomach and the rest of me  that was what ailed me i was living all wrong  he shrugged his shoulders and drew at his pipe  when the doctors gave me up i wound up my affairs and gave the doctors up  that was fifteen years ago  id been hunting through here when i was a boy on vacations from college and when i was all down and out it seemed a yearning came to me to go back to the country  so i quit quit everything absolutely and came to live in the valley of the moonthats the indian name you know for sonoma valley  i lived in the leanto the first year then i built the cabin and sent for my books  i never knew what happiness was before nor health  look at me now and dare to tell me that i look fortyseven  i wouldnt give a day over forty daylight confessed  yet the day i came here i looked nearer sixty and that was fifteen years ago  they talked along and daylight looked at the world from new angles here was a man neither bitter nor cynical who laughed at the citydwellers and called them lunatics a man who did not care for money and in whom the lust for power had long since died  as for the friendship of the citydwellers his host spoke in no uncertain terms  what did they do all the chaps i knew the chaps in the clubs with whom id been cheek by jowl for heaven knows how long  i was not beholden to them for anything and when i slipped out there was not one of them to drop me a line and say how are you old man  anything i can do for you for several weeks it was whats become of ferguson after that i became a reminiscence and a memory  yet every last one of them knew i had nothing but my salary and that id always lived a lap ahead of it  but what do you do now was daylights query  you must need cash to buy clothes and magazines  a weeks work or a months work now and again ploughing in the winter or picking grapes in the fall and theres always odd jobs with the farmers through the summer  i dont need much so i dont have to work much  most of my time i spend fooling around the place  i could do hack work for the magazines and newspapers but i prefer the ploughing and the grape picking just look at me and you can see why im hard as rocks  and i like the work  but i tell you a chaps got to break in to it its a great thing when hes learned to pick grapes a whole long day and come home at the end of it with that tired happy feeling instead of being in a state of physical collapse  that fireplacethose big stonesi was soft then a little anemic alcoholic degenerate with the spunk of a rabbit and about one per cent as much stamina and some of those big stones nearly broke my back and my heart  but i persevered and used my body in the way nature intended it should be usednot bending over a desk and swilling whiskey and well here i am a better man for it and theres the fireplace fine and dandy eh  and now tell me about the klondike and how you turned san francisco upside down with that last raid of yours  youre a bonny fighter you know and you touch my imagination though my cooler reason tells me that you are a lunatic like the rest  the lust for power its a dreadful affliction  why didnt you stay in your klondike  or why dont you clear out and live a natural life for instance like mine you see i can ask questions too  now you talk and let me listen for a while  it was not until ten oclock that daylight parted from ferguson as he rode along through the starlight the idea came to him of buying the ranch on the other side of the valley  there was no thought in his mind of ever intending to live on it  his game was in san francisco but he liked the ranch and as soon as he got back to the office he would open up negotiations with hillard besides the ranch included the claypit and it would give him the whiphand over holdsworthy if he ever tried to cut up any didoes    chapter x  the time passed and daylight played on at the game  but the game had entered upon a new phase  the lust for power in the mere gambling and winning was metamorphosing into the lust for power in order to revenge there were many men in san francisco against whom he had registered black marks and now and again with one of his lightning strokes he erased such a mark  he asked no quarter he gave no quarter  men feared and hated him and no one loved him except larry hegan his lawyer who would have laid down his life for him  but he was the only man with whom daylight was really intimate though he was on terms of friendliest camaraderie with the rough and unprincipled following of the bosses who ruled the riverside club  on the other hand san franciscos attitude toward daylight had undergone a change  while he with his slashing buccaneer methods was a distinct menace to the more orthodox financial gamblers he was nevertheless so grave a menace that they were glad enough to leave him alone  he had already taught them the excellence of letting a sleeping dog lie  many of the men who knew that they were in danger of his big bearpaw when it reached out for the honey vats even made efforts to placate him to get on the friendly side of him  the altapacific approached him confidentially with an offer of reinstatement which he promptly declined  he was after a number of men in that club and whenever opportunity offered he reached out for them and mangled them even the newspapers with one or two blackmailing exceptions ceased abusing him and became respectful  in short he was looked upon as a baldfaced grizzly from the arctic wilds to whom it was considered expedient to give the trail  at the time he raided the steamship companies they had yapped at him and worried him the whole pack of them only to have him whirl around and whip them in the fiercest pitched battle san francisco had ever known  not easily forgotten was the pacific slope seamans strike and the giving over of the municipal government to the labor bosses and grafters  the destruction of charles klinkner and the california and altamont trust company had been a warning  but it was an isolated case they had been confident in strength in numbersuntil he taught them better  daylight still engaged in daring speculations as for instance at the impending outbreak of the japaneserussian war when in the face of the experience and power of the shipping gamblers he reached out and clutched practically a monopoly of available steamercharters  there was scarcely a battered tramp on the seven seas that was not his on time charter  as usual his position was youve got to come and see me which they did and to use another of his phrases they paid through the nose for the privilege  and all his venturing and fighting had now but one motive  some day as he confided to hegan when hed made a sufficient stake he was going back to new york and knock the spots out of messrs dowsett letton and guggenhammer  hed show them what an allaround general buzzsaw he was and what a mistake theyd made ever to monkey with him  but he never lost his head and he knew that he was not yet strong enough to go into deathgrapples with those three early enemies  in the meantime the black marks against them remained for a future easement day  dede mason was still in the office  he had made no more overtures discussed no more books and no more grammar  he had no active interest in her and she was to him a pleasant memory of what had never happened a joy which by his essential nature he was barred from ever knowing  yet while his interest had gone to sleep and his energy was consumed in the endless battles he waged he knew every trick of the light on her hair every quick denote mannerism of movement every line of her figure as expounded by her tailormade gowns  several times six months or so apart he had increased her salary until now she was receiving ninety dollars a month  beyond this he dared not go though he had got around it by making the work easier  this he had accomplished after her return from a vacation by retaining her substitute as an assistant  also he had changed his office suite so that now the two girls had a room by themselves  his eye had become quite critical wherever dede mason was concerned he had long since noted her pride of carriage  it was unobtrusive yet it was there  he decided from the way she carried it that she deemed her body a thing to be proud of to be cared for as a beautiful and valued possession  in this and in the way she carried her clothes he compared her with her assistant with the stenographers he encountered in other offices with the women he saw on the sidewalks  shes sure well put up he communed with himself and she sure knows how to dress and carry it off without being stuck on herself and without laying it on thick  the more he saw of her and the more he thought he knew of her the more unapproachable did she seem to him  but since he had no intention of approaching her this was anything but an unsatisfactory fact  he was glad he had her in his office and hoped shed stay and that was about all  daylight did not improve with the passing years  the life was not good for him  he was growing stout and soft and there was unwonted flabbiness in his muscles  the more he drank cocktails the more he was compelled to drink in order to get the desired result the inhibitions that eased him down from the concert pitch of his operations  and with this went wine too at meals and the long drinks after dinner of scotch and soda at the riverside  then too his body suffered from lack of exercise and from lack of decent human associations his moral fibres were weakening  never a man to hide anything some of his escapades became public such as speeding and of joyrides in his big red motorcar down to san jose with companions distinctly sportyincidents that were narrated as good fun and comically in the newspapers  nor was there anything to save him  religion had passed him by a long time dead was his epitome of that phase of speculation he was not interested in humanity  according to his roughhewn sociology it was all a gamble  god was a whimsical abstract mad thing called luck  as to how one happened to be bornwhether a sucker or a robberwas a gamble to begin with luck dealt out the cards and the little babies picked up the hands allotted them protest was vain those were their cards and they had to play them willynilly hunchbacked or straight backed crippled or cleanlimbed addlepated or clearheaded  there was no fairness in it  the cards most picked up put them into the sucker class the cards of a few enabled them to become robbers  the playing of the cards was lifethe crowd of players society  the table was the earth and the earth in lumps and chunks from loaves of bread to big red motorcars was the stake  and in the end lucky and unlucky they were all a long time dead  it was hard on the stupid lowly for they were coppered to lose from the start but the more he saw of the others the apparent winners the less it seemed to him that they had anything to brag about  they too were a long time dead and their living did not amount to much  it was a wild animal fight the strong trampled the weak and the strong he had already discoveredmen like dowsett and letton and guggenhammerwere not necessarily the best  he remembered his miner comrades of the arctic  they were the stupid lowly they did the hard work and were robbed of the fruit of their toil just as was the old woman making wine in the sonoma hills and yet they had finer qualities of truth and loyalty and squaredealing than did the men who robbed them  the winners seemed to be the crooked ones the unfaithful ones the wicked ones  and even they had no say in the matter  they played the cards that were given them and luck the monstrous madgod thing the owner of the whole shebang looked on and grinned  it was he who stacked the universal carddeck of existence  there was no justice in the deal  the little men that came the little pulpy babies were not even asked if they wanted to try a flutter at the game  they had no choice  luck jerked them into life slammed them up against the jostling table and told them now play damn you play  and they did their best poor little devils  the play of some led to steam yachts and mansions of others to the asylum or the paupers ward  some played the one same card over and over and made wine all their days in the chaparral hoping at the end to pull down a set of false teeth and a coffin  others quit the game early having drawn cards that called for violent death or famine in the barrens or loathsome and lingering disease  the hands of some called for kingship and irresponsible and numerated power other hands called for ambition for wealth in untold sums for disgrace and shame or for women and wine  as for himself he had drawn a lucky hand though he could not see all the cards  somebody or something might get him yet  the mad god luck might be tricking him along to some such end  an unfortunate set of circumstances and in a months time the robber gang might be wardancing around his financial carcass this very day a streetcar might run him down or a sign fall from a building and smash in his skull  or there was disease ever rampant one of lucks grimmest whims  who could say tomorrow or some other day a ptomaine bug or some other of a thousand bugs might jump out upon him and drag him down  there was doctor bascom lee bascom who had stood beside him a week ago and talked and argued a picture of magnificent youth and strength and health  and in three days he was deadpneumonia rheumatism of the heart and heaven knew what elseat the end screaming in agony that could be heard a block away  that had been terrible  it was a fresh raw stroke in daylights consciousness  and when would his own turn come  who could say  in the meantime there was nothing to do but play the cards he could see in his hand and they were battle revenge and cocktails  and luck sat over all and grinned    chapter xi  one sunday late in the afternoon found daylight across the bay in the piedmont hills back of oakland  as usual he was in a big motorcar though not his own the guest of swiftwater bill lucks own darling who had come down to spend the cleanup of the seventh fortune wrung from the frozen arctic gravel  a notorious spender his latest pile was already on the fair road to follow the previous six  he it was in the first year of dawson who had cracked an ocean of champagne at fifty dollars a quart who with the bottom of his goldsack in sight had cornered the eggmarket at twentyfour dollars per dozen to the tune of one hundred and ten dozen in order to pique the ladylove who had jilted him and he it was paying like a prince for speed who had chartered special trains and broken all records between san francisco and new york  and here he was once more the luckpup of hell as daylight called him throwing his latest fortune away with the same oldtime facility  it was a merry party and they had made a merry day of it circling the bay from san francisco around by san jose and up to oakland having been thrice arrested for speeding the third time however on the haywards stretch running away with their captor  fearing that a telephone message to arrest them had been flashed ahead they had turned into the backroad through the hills and now rushing in upon oakland by a new route were boisterously discussing what disposition they should make of the constable  well come out at blair park in ten minutes one of the men announced  look here swiftwater theres a crossroads right ahead with lots of gates but itll take us backcountry clear into berkeley then we can come back into oakland from the other side sneak across on the ferry and send the machine back around tonight with the chauffeur  but swiftwater bill failed to see why he should not go into oakland by way of blair park and so decided  the next moment flying around a bend the backroad they were not going to take appeared  inside the gate leaning out from her saddle and just closing it was a young woman on a chestnut sorrel  with his first glimpse daylight felt there was something strangely familiar about her  the next moment straightening up in the saddle with a movement he could not fail to identify she put the horse into a gallop riding away with her back toward them  it was dede masonhe remembered what morrison had told him about her keeping a riding horse and he was glad she had not seen him in this riotous company swiftwater bill stood up clinging with one hand to the back of the front seat and waving the other to attract her attention his lips were pursed for the piercing whistle for which he was famous and which daylight knew of old when daylight with a hook of his leg and a yank on the shoulder slammed the startled bill down into his seat  you mmmust know the lady swiftwater bill spluttered  i sure do daylight answered so shut up  well i congratulate your good taste daylight  shes a peach and she rides like one too  intervening trees at that moment shut her from view and swiftwater bill plunged into the problem of disposing of their constable while daylight leaning back with closed eyes was still seeing dede mason gallop off down the country road swiftwater bill was right  she certainly could ride  and sitting astride her seat was perfect good for dede  that was an added point her having the courage to ride in the only natural and logical manner  her head as screwed on right that was one thing sure  on monday morning coming in for dictation he looked at her with new interest though he gave no sign of it and the stereotyped business passed off in the stereotyped way  but the following sunday found him on a horse himself across the bay and riding through the piedmont hills  he made a long day of it but no glimpse did he catch of dede mason though he even took the backroad of many gates and rode on into berkeley  here along the lines of multitudinous houses up one street and down another he wondered which of them might be occupied by her morrison had said long ago that she lived in berkeley and she had been headed that way in the late afternoon of the previous sundayevidently returning home  it had been a fruitless day so far as she was concerned and yet not entirely fruitless for he had enjoyed the open air and the horse under him to such purpose that on monday his instructions were out to the dealers to look for the best chestnut sorrel that money could buy  at odd times during the week he examined numbers of chestnut sorrels tried several and was unsatisfied it was not till saturday that he came upon bob  daylight knew him for what he wanted the moment he laid eyes on him  a large horse for a riding animal he was none too large for a big man like daylight  in splendid condition bobs coat in the sunlight was a flame of fire his arched neck a jeweled conflagration  hes a sure winner was daylights comment but the dealer was not so sanguine  he was selling the horse on commission and its owner had insisted on bobs true character being given  the dealer gave it  not what youd call a real vicious horse but a dangerous one full of vinegar and allround cussedness but without malice just as soon kill you as not but in a playful sort of way you understand without meaning to at all  personally i wouldnt think of riding him  but hes a stayer  look at them lungs and look at them legs  not a blemish  hes never been hurt or worked  nobody ever succeeded in taking it out of him  mountain horse too trailbroke and all that being raised in rough country  surefooted as a goat so long as he dont get it into his head to cut up  dont shy  aint really afraid but makes believe  dont buck but rears  got to ride him with a martingale  has a bad trick of whirling around without cause its his idea of a joke on his rider  its all just how he feels one day hell ride along peaceable and pleasant for twenty miles next day before you get started hes wellnigh unmanageable knows automobiles so he can lay down alongside of one and sleep or eat hay out of it  hell let nineteen go by without batting an eye and mebbe the twentieth just because hes feeling frisky hell cut up over like a range cayuse  generally speaking too lively for a gentleman and too unexpected present owner nicknamed him judas iscariot and refuses to sell without the buyer knowing all about him first  there thats about all i know except look at that mane and tail  ever see anything like it  hair as fine as a babys  the dealer was right  daylight examined the mane and found it finer than any horses hair he had ever seen  also its color was unusual in that it was almost auburn  while he ran his fingers through it bob turned his head and playfully nuzzled daylights shoulder  saddle him up and ill try him he told the dealer  i wonder if hes used to spurs  no english saddle mind  give me a good mexican and a curb bitnot too severe seeing as he likes to rear  daylight superintended the preparations adjusting the curb strap and the stirrup length and doing the cinching  he shook his head at the martingale but yielded to the dealers advice and allowed it to go on and bob beyond spirited restlessness and a few playful attempts gave no trouble  nor in the hours ride that followed save for some permissible curveting and prancing did he misbehave  daylight was delighted the purchase was immediately made and bob with riding gear and personal equipment was despatched across the bay forthwith to take up his quarters in the stables of the oakland riding academy  the next day being sunday daylight was away early crossing on the ferry and taking with him wolf the leader of his sled team the one dog which he had selected to bring with him when he left alaska  quest as he would through the piedmont hills and along the manygated backroad to berkeley daylight saw nothing of dede mason and her chestnut sorrel  but he had little time for disappointment for his own chestnut sorrel kept him busy  bob proved a handful of impishness and contrariety and he tried out his rider as much as his rider tried him out  all of daylights horse knowledge and horse sense was called into play while bob in turn worked every trick in his lexicon discovering that his martingale had more slack in it than usual he proceeded to give an exhibition of rearing and hindleg walking  after ten hopeless minutes of it daylight slipped off and tightened the martingale whereupon bob gave an exhibition of angelic goodness  he fooled daylight completely  at the end of half an hour of goodness daylight lured into confidence was riding along at a walk and rolling a cigarette with slack knees and relaxed seat the reins lying on the animals neck  bob whirled abruptly and with lightning swiftness pivoting on his hind legs his fore legs just lifted clear of the ground  daylight found himself with his right foot out of the stirrup and his arms around the animals neck and bob took advantage of the situation to bolt down the road  with a hope that he should not encounter dede mason at that moment daylight regained his seat and checked in the horse  arrived back at the same spot bob whirled again  this time daylight kept his seat but beyond a futile rein across the neck did nothing to prevent the evolution  he noted that bob whirled to the right and resolved to keep him straightened out by a spur on the left  but so abrupt and swift was the whirl that warning and accomplishment were practically simultaneous  well bob he addressed the animal at the same time wiping the sweat from his own eyes im free to confess that youre sure the blamedest allfired quickest creature i ever saw  i guess the way to fix you is to keep the spur just atouchingah you brute  for the moment the spur touched him his left hind leg had reached forward in a kick that struck the stirrup a smart blow several times out of curiosity daylight attempted the spur and each time bobs hoof landed the stirrup  then daylight following the horses example of the unexpected suddenly drove both spurs into him and reached him underneath with the quirt  you aint never had a real licking before he muttered as bob thus rudely jerked out of the circle of his own impish mental processes shot ahead  half a dozen times spurs and quirt bit into him and then daylight settled down to enjoy the mad magnificent gallop  no longer punished at the end of a half mile bob eased down into a fast canter  wolf toiling in the rear was catching up and everything was going nicely  ill give you a few pointers on this whirling game my boy daylight was saying to him when bob whirled  he did it on a gallop breaking the gallop off short by fore legs stiffly planted  daylight fetched up against his steeds neck with clasped arms and at the same instant with fore feet clear of the ground bob whirled around  only an excellent rider could have escaped being unhorsed and as it was daylight was nastily near to it  by the time he recovered his seat bob was in full career bolting the way he had come and making wolf sidejump to the bushes  all right darn you daylight grunted driving in spurs and quirt again and again  backtrack you want to go and backtrack you sure will go till youre dead sick of it  when after a time bob attempted to ease down the mad pace spurs and quirt went into him again with undiminished vim and put him to renewed effort  and when at last daylight decided that the horse had had enough he turned him around abruptly and put him into a gentle canter on the forward track  after a time he reined him in to a stop to see if he were breathing painfully  standing for a minute bob turned his head and nuzzled his riders stirrup in a roguish impatient way as much as to intimate that it was time they were going on  well ill be plumb gosh darned was daylights comment  no illwill no grudge no nothingand after that lambasting youre sure a hummer bob  once again daylight was lulled into fancied security  for an hour bob was all that could be desired of a spirited mount when and as usual without warning he took to whirling and bolting daylight put a stop to this with spurs and quirt running him several punishing miles in the direction of his bolt  but when he turned him around and started forward bob proceeded to feign fright at trees cows bushes wolf his own shadowin short at every ridiculously conceivable object  at such times wolf lay down in the shade and looked on while daylight wrestled it out  so the day passed  among other things bob developed a trick of making believe to whirl and not whirling  this was as exasperating as the real thing for each time daylight was fooled into tightening his leg grip and into a general muscular tensing of all his body  and then after a few makebelieve attempts bob actually did whirl and caught daylight napping again and landed him in the old position with clasped arms around the neck  and to the end of the day bob continued to be up to one trick or another after passing a dozen automobiles on the way into oakland suddenly electing to go mad with fright at a most ordinary little runabout  and just before he arrived back at the stable he capped the day with a combined whirling and rearing that broke the martingale and enabled him to gain a perpendicular position on his hind legs  at this juncture a rotten stirrup leather parted and daylight was all but unhorsed  but he had taken a liking to the animal and repented not of his bargain  he realized that bob was not vicious nor mean the trouble being that he was bursting with high spirits and was endowed with more than the average horses intelligence  it was the spirits and the intelligence combined with inordinate roguishness that made him what he was  what was required to control him was a strong hand with tempered sternness and yet with the requisite touch of brutal dominance  its you or me bob daylight told him more than once that day  and to the stableman that night  my but aint he a looker ever see anything like him  best piece of horseflesh i ever straddled and ive seen a few in my time  and to bob who had turned his head and was up to his playful nuzzling  goodby you little bit of all right  see you again next sunday am and just you bring along your whole basket of tricks you old sonofagun    chapter xii  throughout the week daylight found himself almost as much interested in bob as in dede and not being in the thick of any big deals he was probably more interested in both of them than in the business game bobs trick of whirling was of especial moment to him  how to overcome itthat was the thing  suppose he did meet with dede out in the hills and suppose by some lucky stroke of fate he should manage to be riding alongside of her then that whirl of bobs would be most disconcerting and embarrassing  he was not particularly anxious for her to see him thrown forward on bobs neck  on the other hand suddenly to leave her and go dashing down the backtrack plying quirt and spurs wouldnt do either  what was wanted was a method wherewith to prevent that lightning whirl he must stop the animal before it got around  the reins would not do this  neither would the spurs  remained the quirt  but how to accomplish it  absentminded moments were many that week when sitting in his office chair in fancy he was astride the wonderful chestnut sorrel and trying to prevent an anticipated whirl one such moment toward the end of the week occurred in the middle of a conference with hegan  hegan elaborating a new and dazzling legal vision became aware that daylight was not listening  his eyes had gone lacklustre and he too was seeing with inner vision  got it he cried suddenly  hegan congratulate me  its as simple as rolling off a log  all ive got to do is hit him on the nose and hit him hard  then he explained to the startled hegan and became a good listener again though he could not refrain now and again from making audible chuckles of satisfaction and delight  that was the scheme  bob always whirled to the right  very well  he would double the quirt in his hand and the instant of the whirl that doubled quirt would rap bob on the nose  the horse didnt live after it had once learned the lesson that would whirl in the face of the doubled quirt  more keenly than ever during that week in the office did daylight realize that he had no social nor even human contacts with dede  the situation was such that he could not ask her the simple question whether or not she was going riding next sunday it was a hardship of a new sort this being the employer of a pretty girl  he looked at her often when the routine work of the day was going on the question he could not ask her tickling at the founts of speechwas she going riding next sunday  and as he looked he wondered how old she was and what love passages she had had must have had with those college whippersnappers with whom according to morrison she herded and danced  his mind was very full of her those six days between the sundays and one thing he came to know thoroughly well he wanted her and so much did he want her that his old timidity of the apronstring was put to rout  he who had run away from women most of his life had now grown so courageous as to pursue  some sunday sooner or later he would meet her outside the office somewhere in the hills and then if they did not get acquainted it would be because she did not care to get acquainted  thus he found another card in the hand the mad god had dealt him  how important that card was to become he did not dream yet he decided that it was a pretty good card  in turn he doubted maybe it was a trick of luck to bring calamity and disaster upon him  suppose dede wouldnt have him and suppose he went on loving her more and more harder and harder  all his old generalized terrors of love revived he remembered the disastrous love affairs of men and women he had known in the past  there was bertha doolittle old doolittles daughter who had been madly in love with dartworthy the rich bonanza fraction owner and dartworthy in turn not loving bertha at all but madly loving colonel walthstones wife and eloping down the yukon with her and colonel walthstone himself madly loving his own wife and lighting out in pursuit of the fleeing couple  and what had been the outcome certainly berthas love had been unfortunate and tragic and so had the love of the other three down below minook colonel walthstone and dartworthy had fought it out  dartworthy had been killed  a bullet through the colonels lungs had so weakened him that he died of pneumonia the following spring  and the colonels wife had no one left alive on earth to love  and then there was freda drowning herself in the running mushice because of some man on the other side of the world and hating him daylight because he had happened along and pulled her out of the mushice and back to life  and the virgin the old memories frightened him  if this lovegerm gripped him good and hard and if dede wouldnt have him it might be almost as bad as being gouged out of all he had by dowsett letton and guggenhammer  had his nascent desire for dede been less he might well have been frightened out of all thought of her  as it was he found consolation in the thought that some love affairs did come out right  and for all he knew maybe luck had stacked the cards for him to win  some men were born lucky lived lucky all their days and died lucky  perhaps too he was such a man a born luckpup who could not lose  sunday came and bob out in the piedmont hills behaved like an angel his goodness at times was of the spirited prancing order but otherwise he was a lamb  daylight with doubled quirt ready in his right hand ached for a whirl just one whirl which bob with an excellence of conduct that was tantalizing refused to perform  but no dede did daylight encounter  he vainly circled about among the hill roads and in the afternoon took the steep grade over the divide of the second range and dropped into maraga valley  just after passing the foot of the descent he heard the hoof beats of a cantering horse  it was from ahead and coming toward him  what if it were dede  he turned bob around and started to return at a walk  if it were dede he was born to luck he decided for the meeting couldnt have occurred under better circumstances  here they were both going in the same direction and the canter would bring her up to him just where the stiff grade would compel a walk  there would be nothing else for her to do than ride with him to the top of the divide and once there the equally stiff descent on the other side would compel more walking  the canter came nearer but he faced straight ahead until he heard the horse behind check to a walk  then he glanced over his shoulder  it was dede  the recognition was quick and with her accompanied by surprise  what more natural thing than that partly turning his horse he should wait till she caught up with him and that when abreast they should continue abreast on up the grade  he could have sighed with relief  the thing was accomplished and so easily  greetings had been exchanged here they were side by side and going in the same direction with miles and miles ahead of them  he noted that her eye was first for the horse and next for him  oh what a beauty she had cried at sight of bob  from the shining light in her eyes and the face filled with delight he would scarcely have believed that it belonged to a young woman he had known in the office the young woman with the controlled subdued office face  i didnt know you rode was one of her first remarks  i imagined you were wedded to gettherequick machines  ive just taken it up lately was his answer  beginning to get stout you know and had to take it off somehow  she gave a quick sidewise glance that embraced him from head to heel including seat and saddle and said  but youve ridden before  she certainly had an eye for horses and things connected with horses was his thought as he replied  not for many years  but i used to think i was a regular ripsnorter when i was a youngster up in eastern oregon sneaking away from camp to ride with the cattle and break cayuses and that sort of thing  thus and to his great relief were they launched on a topic of mutual interest  he told her about bobs tricks and of the whirl and his scheme to overcome it and she agreed that horses had to be handled with a certain rational severity no matter how much one loved them there was her mab which she had for eight years and which she had had break of stallkicking  the process had been painful for mab but it had cured her  youve ridden a lot daylight said  i really cant remember the first time i was on a horse she told him  i was born on a ranch you know and they couldnt keep me away from the horses  i must have been born with the love for them  i had my first pony all my own when i was six when i was eight i knew what it was to be all day in the saddle along with daddy  by the time i was eleven he was taking me on my first deer hunts  id be lost without a horse  i hate indoors and without mab here i suppose id have been sick and dead long ago  you like the country he queried at the same moment catching his first glimpse of a light in her eyes other than gray  as much as i detest the city she answered  but a woman cant earn a living in the country  so i make the best of italong with mab  and thereat she told him more of her ranch life in the days before her father died  and daylight was hugely pleased with himself  they were getting acquainted  the conversation had not lagged in the full half hour they had been together  we come pretty close from the same part of the country he said  i was raised in eastern oregon and thats none so far from siskiyou  the next moment he could have bitten out his tongue for her quick question was  how did you know i came from siskiyou  im sure i never mentioned it  i dont know he floundered temporarily  i heard somewhere that you were from thereabouts  wolf sliding up at that moment sleekfooted and like a shadow caused her horse to shy and passed the awkwardness off for they talked alaskan dogs until the conversation drifted back to horses  and horses it was all up the grade and down the other side  when she talked he listened and followed her and yet all the while he was following his own thoughts and impressions as well it was a nervy thing for her to do this riding astride and he didnt know after all whether he liked it or not  his ideas of women were prone to be oldfashioned they were the ones he had imbibed in the earlyday frontier life of his youth when no woman was seen on anything but a sidesaddle  he had grown up to the tacit fiction that women on horseback were not bipeds  it came to him with a shock this sight of her so manlike in her saddle  but he had to confess that the sight looked good to him just then  two other immediate things about her struck him  first there were the golden spots in her eyes  queer that he had never noticed them before perhaps the light in the office had not been right and perhaps they came and went  no they were glows of colora sort of diffused golden light  nor was it golden either but it was nearer that than any color he knew  it certainly was not any shade of yellow  a lovers thoughts are ever colored and it is to be doubted if any one else in the world would have called dedes eyes golden  but daylights mood verged on the tender and melting and he preferred to think of them as golden and therefore they were golden  and then she was so natural  he had been prepared to find her a most difficult young woman to get acquainted with  yet here it was proving so simple  there was nothing highfalutin about her company mannersit was by this homely phrase that he differentiated this dede on horseback from the dede with the office manners whom he had always known  and yet while he was delighted with the smoothness with which everything was going and with the fact that they had found plenty to talk about he was aware of an irk under it all  after all this talk was empty and idle  he was a man of action and he wanted her dede mason the woman he wanted her to love him and to be loved by him and he wanted all this glorious consummation then and there  used to forcing issues used to gripping men and things and bending them to his will he felt now the same compulsive prod of mastery he wanted to tell her that he loved her and that there was nothing else for her to do but marry him and yet he did not obey the prod  women were fluttery creatures and here mere mastery would prove a bungle  he remembered all his hunting guile the long patience of shooting meat in famine when a hit or a miss meant life or death  truly though this girl did not yet mean quite that nevertheless she meant much to himmore now than ever as he rode beside her glancing at her as often as he dared she in her corduroy ridinghabit so bravely manlike yet so essentially and revealingly woman smiling laughing talking her eyes sparkling the flush of a day of sun and summer breeze warm in her cheeks    chapter xiii  another sunday man and horse and dog roved the piedmont hills and again daylight and dede rode together  but this time her surprise at meeting him was tinctured with suspicion or rather her surprise was of another order  the previous sunday had been quite accidental but his appearing a second time among her favorite haunts hinted of more than the fortuitous  daylight was made to feel that she suspected him and he remembering that he had seen a big rock quarry near blair park stated offhand that he was thinking of buying it  his onetime investment in a brickyard had put the idea into his headan idea that he decided was a good one for it enabled him to suggest that she ride along with him to inspect the quarry  so several hours he spent in her company in which she was much the same girl as before natural unaffected lighthearted smiling and laughing a good fellow talking horses with unflagging enthusiasm making friends with the crustytempered wolf and expressing the desire to ride bob whom she declared she was more in love with than ever  at this last daylight demurred  bob was full of dangerous tricks and he wouldnt trust any one on him except his worst enemy  you think because im a girl that i dont know anything about horses she flashed back  but ive been thrown off and bucked off enough not to be overconfident  and im not a fool i wouldnt get on a bucking horse  ive learned better  and im not afraid of any other kind  and you say yourself that bob doesnt buck  but youve never seen him cutting up didoes daylight said  but you must remember ive seen a few others and ive been on several of them myself  i brought mab here to electric cars locomotives and automobiles  she was a raw range colt when she came to me  broken to saddle that was all  besides i wont hurt your horse  against his better judgment daylight gave in and on an unfrequented stretch of road changed saddles and bridles  remember hes greased lightning he warned as he helped her to mount  she nodded while bob pricked up his ears to the knowledge that he had a strange rider on his back  the fun came quickly enoughtoo quickly for dede who found herself against bobs neck as he pivoted around and bolted the other way  daylight followed on her horse and watched  he saw her check the animal quickly to a standstill and immediately with rein across neck and a decisive prod of the left spur whirl him back the way he had come and almost as swiftly  get ready to give him the quirt on the nose daylight called  but too quickly for her bob whirled again though this time by a severe effort she saved herself from the undignified position against his neck  his bolt was more determined but she pulled him into a prancing walk and turned him roughly back with her spurred heel there was nothing feminine in the way she handled him her method was imperative and masculine  had this not been so daylight would have expected her to say she had had enough but that little preliminary exhibition had taught him something of dedes quality  and if it had not a glance at her gray eyes just perceptibly angry with herself and at her firmset mouth would have told him the same thing daylight did not suggest anything while he hung almost gleefully upon her actions in anticipation of what the fractious bob was going to get and bob got it on his next whirl or attempt rather for he was no more than halfway around when the quirt met him smack on his tender nose  there and then in his bewilderment surprise and pain his fore feet just skimming above the road dropped down  great daylight applauded  a couple more will fix him  hes too smart not to know when hes beaten  again bob tried  but this time he was barely quarter around when the doubled quirt on his nose compelled him to drop his fore feet to the road  then with neither rein nor spur but by the mere threat of the quirt she straightened him out  dede looked triumphantly at daylight  let me give him a run she asked  daylight nodded and she shot down the road  he watched her out of sight around the bend and watched till she came into sight returning she certainly could sit her horse was his thought and she was a sure enough hummer  god she was the wife for a man  made most of them look pretty slim  and to think of her hammering all week at a typewriter  that was no place for her she should be a mans wife taking it easy with silks and satins and diamonds his frontier notion of what befitted a wife beloved and dogs and horses and such thingsand well see mr burning daylight what you and me can do about it he murmured to himself and aloud to her  youll do miss mason youll do  theres nothing too good in horseflesh you dont deserve a woman who can ride like that no stay with him and well jog along to the quarry  he chuckled  say he actually gave just the least mite of a groan that last time you fetched him  did you hear it  and did you see the way he dropped his feet to the roadjust like hed struck a stone wall  and hes got savvee enough to know from now on that that same stone wall will be always there ready for him to lam into  when he parted from her that afternoon at the gate of the road that led to berkeley he drew off to the edge of the intervening clump of trees where unobserved he watched her out of sight then turning to ride back into oakland a thought came to him that made him grin ruefully as he muttered and now its up to me to make good and buy that blamed quarry  nothing less than that can give me an excuse for snooping around these hills  but the quarry was doomed to pass out of his plans for a time for on the following sunday he rode alone  no dede on a chestnut sorrel came across the backroad from berkeley that day nor the day a week later daylight was beside himself with impatience and apprehension though in the office he contained himself  he noted no change in her and strove to let none show in himself the same old monotonous routine went on though now it was irritating and maddening  daylight found a big quarrel on his hands with a world that wouldnt let a man behave toward his stenographer after the way of all men and women  what was the good of owning millions anyway  he demanded one day of the deskcalendar as she passed out after receiving his dictation  as the third week drew to a close and another desolate sunday confronted him daylight resolved to speak office or no office and as was his nature he went simply and directly to the point she had finished her work with him and was gathering her note pad and pencils together to depart when he said  oh one thing more miss mason and i hope you wont mind my being frank and straight out  youve struck me right along as a sensibleminded girl and i dont think youll take offence at what im going to say  you know how long youve been in the officeits years now several of them anyway and you know ive always been straight and aboveboard with you  ive never what you callpresumed  because you were in my office ive tried to be more careful than ifif you wasnt in my officeyou understand  but just the same it dont make me any the less human  im a lonely sort of a fellowdont take that as a bid for kindness  what i mean by it is to try and tell you just how much those two rides with you have meant  and now i hope you wont mind my just asking why you havent been out riding the last two sundays  he came to a stop and waited feeling very warm and awkward the perspiration starting in tiny beads on his forehead  she did not speak immediately and he stepped across the room and raised the window higher  i have been riding she answered in other directions  but why  he failed somehow to complete the question  go ahead and be frank with me he urged  just as frank as i am with you  why didnt you ride in the piedmont hills  i hunted for you everywhere  and that is just why  she smiled and looked him straight in the eyes for a moment then dropped her own  surely you understand mr harnish  he shook his head glumly  i do and i dont  i aint used to city ways by a long shot theres things one mustnt do which i dont mind as long as i dont want to do them  but when you do she asked quickly  then i do them his lips had drawn firmly with this affirmation of will but the next instant he was amending the statement that is i mostly do  but what gets me is the things you mustnt do when theyre not wrong and they wont hurt anybodythis riding for instance  she played nervously with a pencil for a time as if debating her reply while he waited patiently  this riding she began its not what they call the right thing i leave it to you  you know the world  you are mr harnish the millionaire  gambler he broke in harshly  she nodded acceptance of his term and went on  and im a stenographer in your office  youre a thousand times better than me he attempted to interpolate but was in turn interrupted  it isnt a question of such things  its a simple and fairly common situation that must be considered  i work for you  and it isnt what you or i might think but what other persons will think  and you dont need to be told any more about that  you know yourself  her cool matteroffact speech belied heror so daylight thought looking at her perturbed feminineness at the rounded lines of her figure the breast that deeply rose and fell and at the color that was now excited in her cheeks  im sorry i frightened you out of your favorite stamping ground he said rather aimlessly  you didnt frighten me she retorted with a touch of fire im not a silly seminary girl  ive taken care of myself for a long time now and ive done it without being frightened  we were together two sundays and im sure i wasnt frightened of bob or you  it isnt that  i have no fears of taking care of myself but the world insists on taking care of one as well thats the trouble  its what the world would have to say about me and my employer meeting regularly and riding in the hills on sundays  its funny but its so  i could ride with one of the clerks without remark but with youno  but the world dont know and dont need to know he cried  which makes it worse in a way feeling guilty of nothing and yet sneaking around backroads with all the feeling of doing something wrong  it would be finer and braver for me publicly  to go to lunch with me on a weekday daylight said divining the drift of her uncompleted argument  she nodded  i didnt have that quite in mind but it will do  id prefer doing the brazen thing and having everybody know it to doing the furtive thing and being found out  not that im asking to be invited to lunch she added with a smile but im sure you understand my position  then why not ride open and aboveboard with me in the hills he urged  she shook her head with what he imagined was just the faintest hint of regret and he went suddenly and almost maddeningly hungry for her  look here miss mason i know you dont like this talking over of things in the office  neither do i  its part of the whole thing i guess a man aint supposed to talk anything but business with his stenographer  will you ride with me next sunday and we can talk it over thoroughly then and reach some sort of a conclusion  out in the hills is the place where you can talk something besides business  i guess youve seen enough of me to know im pretty square  ii do honor and respect you and  and all that and i  he was beginning to flounder and the hand that rested on the desk blotter was visibly trembling he strove to pull himself together  i just want to harder than anything ever in my life before  iii cant explain myself but i do thats all  will youjust next sunday  tomorrow  nor did he dream that her low acquiescence was due as much as anything else to the beads of sweat on his forehead his trembling hand and his all tooevident general distress    chapter xiv  of course theres no way of telling what anybody wants from what they say   daylight rubbed bobs rebellious ear with his quirt and pondered with dissatisfaction the words he had just uttered  they did not say what he had meant them to say  what im driving at is that you say flatfooted that you wont meet me again and you give your reasons but how am i to know they are your real reasons  mebbe you just dont want to get acquainted with me and wont say so for fear of hurting my feelings  dont you see  im the last man in the world to shove in where im not wanted  and if i thought you didnt care a whoop to see anything more of me why id clear out so blamed quick you couldnt see me for smoke  dede smiled at him in acknowledgment of his words but rode on silently  and that smile he thought was the most sweetly wonderful smile he had ever seen  there was a difference in it he assured himself from any smile she had ever given him before  it was the smile of one who knew him just a little bit of one who was just the least mite acquainted with him  of course he checked himself up the next moment it was unconscious on her part  it was sure to come in the intercourse of any two persons  any stranger a business man a clerk anybody after a few casual meetings would show similar signs of friendliness  it was bound to happen but in her case it made more impression on him and besides it was such a sweet and wonderful smile  other women he had known had never smiled like that he was sure of it  it had been a happy day  daylight had met her on the backroad from berkeley and they had had hours together  it was only now with the day drawing to a close and with them approaching the gate of the road to berkeley that he had broached the important subject  she began her answer to his last contention and he listened gratefully  but suppose just suppose that the reasons i have given are the only onesthat there is no question of my not wanting to know you  then id go on urging like sam scratch he said quickly because you see ive always noticed that folks that incline to anything are much more open to hearing the case stated  but if you did have that other reason up your sleeve if you didnt want to know me ifif well if you thought my feelings oughtnt to be hurt just because you had a good job with me  here his calm consideration of a possibility was swamped by the fear that it was an actuality and he lost the thread of his reasoning well anyway all you have to do is to say the word and ill clear out  and with no hard feelings it would be just a case of bad luck for me so be honest miss mason please and tell me if thats the reasoni almost got a hunch that it is  she glanced up at him her eyes abruptly and slightly moist half with hurt half with anger  oh but that isnt fair she cried  you give me the choice of lying to you and hurting you in order to protect myself by getting rid of you or of throwing away my protection by telling you the truth for then you as you said yourself would stay and urge  her cheeks were flushed her lips tremulous but she continued to look him frankly in the eyes  daylight smiled grimly with satisfaction  im real glad miss mason real glad for those words  but they wont serve you she went on hastily  they cant serve you  i refuse to let them  this is our last ride and here is the gate  ranging her mare alongside she bent slid the catch and followed the opening gate  no please no she said as daylight started to follow  humbly acquiescent he pulled bob back and the gate swung shut between them  but there was more to say and she did not ride on  listen miss mason he said in a low voice that shook with sincerity i want to assure you of one thing  im not just trying to fool around with you  i like you i want you and i was never more in earnest in my life  theres nothing wrong in my intentions or anything like that  what i mean is strictly honorable  but the expression of her face made him stop  she was angry and she was laughing at the same time  the last thing you should have said she cried  its like aa matrimonial bureau intentions strictly honorable object matrimony but its no more than i deserved  this is what i suppose you call urging like sam scratch  the tan had bleached out of daylights skin since the time he came to live under city roofs so that the flush of blood showed readily as it crept up his neck past the collar and overspread his face  nor in his exceeding discomfort did he dream that she was looking upon him at that moment with more kindness than at any time that day  it was not in her experience to behold big grownup men who blushed like boys and already she repented the sharpness into which she had been surprised  now look here miss mason he began slowly and stumblingly at first but accelerating into a rapidity of utterance that was almost incoherent im a rough sort of a man i know that and i know i dont know much of anything  ive never had any training in nice things ive never made love before and ive never been in love before eitherand i dont know how to go about it any more than a thundering idiot  what you want to do is get behind my tomfool words and get a feel of the man thats behind them thats me and i mean all right if i dont know how to go about it  dede mason had quick birdlike ways almost flitting from mood to mood and she was all contrition on the instant  forgive me for laughing she said across the gate  it wasnt really laughter  i was surprised off my guard and hurt too you see mr harnish ive not been  she paused in sudden fear of completing the thought into which her birdlike precipitancy had betrayed her  what you mean is that youve not been used to such sort of proposing daylight said a sort of ontherun howdy gladtomakeyouracquaintance wontyoubemine proposition  she nodded and broke into laughter in which he joined and which served to pass the awkwardness away  he gathered heart at this and went on in greater confidence with cooler head and tongue  there you see you prove my case  youve had experience in such matters  i dont doubt youve had slathers of proposals well i havent and im like a fish out of water  besides this aint a proposal  its a peculiar situation thats all and im in a corner ive got enough plain horsesense to know a man aint supposed to argue marriage with a girl as a reason for getting acquainted with her  and right there was where i was in the hole  number one i cant get acquainted with you in the office  number two you say you wont see me out of the office to give me a chance  number three your reason is that folks will talk because you work for me  number four i just got to get acquainted with you and i just got to get you to see that i mean fair and all right  number five there you are on one side the gate getting ready to go and me here on the other side the gate pretty desperate and bound to say something to make you reconsider  number six i said it  and now and finally i just do want you to reconsider  and listening to him pleasuring in the sight of his earnest perturbed face and in the simple homely phrases that but emphasized his earnestness and marked the difference between him and the average run of men she had known she forgot to listen and lost herself in her own thoughts  the love of a strong man is ever a lure to a normal woman and never more strongly did dede feel the lure than now looking across the closed gate at burning daylight  not that she would ever dream of marrying himshe had a score of reasons against it but why not at least see more of him  he was certainly not repulsive to her on the contrary she liked him had always liked him from the day she had first seen him and looked upon his lean indian face and into his flashing indian eyes  he was a figure of a man in more ways than his mere magnificent muscles  besides romance had gilded him this doughty roughhewn adventurer of the north this man of many deeds and many millions who had come down out of the arctic to wrestle and fight so masterfully with the men of the south  savage as a red indian gambler and profligate a man without morals whose vengeance was never glutted and who stamped on the faces of all who opposed himoh yes she knew all the hard names he had been called  yet she was not afraid of him  there was more than that in the connotation of his name  burning daylight called up other things as well  they were there in the newspapers the magazines and the books on the klondike  when all was said burning daylight had a mighty connotationone to touch any womans imagination as it touched hers the gate between them listening to the wistful and impassioned simplicity of his speech  dede was after all a woman with a womans sexvanity and it was this vanity that was pleased by the fact that such a man turned in his need to her  and there was more that passed through her mindsensations of tiredness and loneliness trampling squadrons and shadowy armies of vague feelings and vaguer prompting and deeper and dimmer whisperings and echoings the flutterings of forgotten generations crystallized into being and fluttering anew and always undreamed and unguessed subtle and potent the spirit and essence of life that under a thousand deceits and masks forever makes for life  it was a strong temptation just to ride with this man in the hills  it would be that only and nothing more for she was firmly convinced that his way of life could never be her way  on the other hand she was vexed by none of the ordinary feminine fears and timidities  that she could take care of herself under any and all circumstances she never doubted  then why not  it was such a little thing after all  she led an ordinary humdrum life at best  she ate and slept and worked and that was about all  as if in review her anchorite existence passed before her six days of the week spent in the office and in journeying back and forth on the ferry the hours stolen before bedtime for snatches of song at the piano for doing her own special laundering for sewing and mending and casting up of meagre accounts the two evenings a week of social diversion she permitted herself the other stolen hours and saturday afternoons spent with her brother at the hospital and the seventh day sunday her day of solace on mabs back out among the blessed hills  but it was lonely this solitary riding  nobody of her acquaintance rode  several girls at the university had been persuaded into trying it but after a sunday or two on hired livery hacks they had lost interest  there was madeline who bought her own horse and rode enthusiastically for several months only to get married and go away to live in southern california  after years of it one did get tired of this eternal riding alone  he was such a boy this big giant of a millionaire who had half the rich men of san francisco afraid of him  such a boy  she had never imagined this side of his nature  how do folks get married he was saying  why number one they meet number two like each others looks number three get acquainted and number four get married or not according to how they like each other after getting acquainted  but how in thunder were to have a chance to find out whether we like each other enough is beyond my savvee unless we make that chance ourselves  id come to see you call on you only i know youre just rooming or boarding and that wont do  suddenly with a change of mood the situation appeared to dede ridiculously absurd  she felt a desire to laughnot angrily not hysterically but just jolly  it was so funny  herself the stenographer he the notorious and powerful gambling millionaire and the gate between them across which poured his argument of people getting acquainted and married  also it was an impossible situation on the face of it she could not go on with it  this program of furtive meetings in the hills would have to discontinue  there would never be another meeting  and if denied this he tried to woo her in the office she would be compelled to lose a very good position and that would be an end of the episode  it was not nice to contemplate but the world of men especially in the cities she had not found particularly nice  she had not worked for her living for years without losing a great many of her illusions  we wont do any sneaking or hiding around about it daylight was explaining  well ride around as bold if you please and if anybody sees us why let them  if they talkwell so long as our consciences are straight we neednt worry  say the word and bob will have on his back the happiest man alive  she shook her head pulled in the mare who was impatient to be off for home and glanced significantly at the lengthening shadows  its getting late now anyway daylight hurried on and weve settled nothing after all  just one more sunday anywaythats not asking muchto settle it in  weve had all day she said  but we started to talk it over too late  well tackle it earlier next time  this is a big serious proposition with me i can tell you  say next sunday  are men ever fair she asked  you know thoroughly well that by next sunday you mean many sundays  then let it be many sundays he cried recklessly while she thought that she had never seen him looking handsomer  say the word  only say the word  next sunday at the quarry  she gathered the reins into her hand preliminary to starting  good night she said and  yes he whispered with just the faintest touch of impressiveness  yes she said her voice low but distinct  at the same moment she put the mare into a canter and went down the road without a backward glance intent on an analysis of her own feelings  with her mind made up to say noand to the last instant she had been so resolvedher lips nevertheless had said yes  or at least it seemed the lips  she had not intended to consent  then why had she  her first surprise and bewilderment at so wholly unpremeditated an act gave way to consternation as she considered its consequences she knew that burning daylight was not a man to be trifled with that under his simplicity and boyishness he was essentially a dominant male creature and that she had pledged herself to a future of inevitable stress and storm  and again she demanded of herself why she had said yes at the very moment when it had been farthest from her intention    chapter xv  life at the office went on much the way it had always gone never by word or look did they acknowledge that the situation was in any wise different from what it had always been  each sunday saw the arrangement made for the following sundays ride nor was this ever referred to in the office  daylight was fastidiously chivalrous on this point  he did not want to lose her from the office  the sight of her at her work was to him an undiminishing joy  nor did he abuse this by lingering over dictation or by devising extra work that would detain her longer before his eyes  but over and beyond such sheer selfishness of conduct was his love of fair play  he scorned to utilize the accidental advantages of the situation  somewhere within him was a higher appeasement of love than mere possession  he wanted to be loved for himself with a fair field for both sides  on the other hand had he been the most artful of schemers he could not have pursued a wiser policy  birdlike in her love of individual freedom the last woman in the world to be bullied in her affections she keenly appreciated the niceness of his attitude  she did this consciously but deeper than all consciousness and intangible as gossamer were the effects of this  all unrealizable save for some supreme moment did the web of daylights personality creep out and around her  filament by filament these secret and undreamable bonds were being established  they it was that could have given the cue to her saying yes when she had meant to say no  and in some such fashion in some future crisis of greater moment might she not in violation of all dictates of sober judgment give another unintentional consent  among other good things resulting from his growing intimacy with dede was daylights not caring to drink so much as formerly there was a lessening in desire for alcohol of which even he at last became aware in a way she herself was the needed inhibition  the thought of her was like a cocktail  or at any rate she substituted for a certain percentage of cocktails from the strain of his unnatural city existence and of his intense gambling operations he had drifted on to the cocktail route  a wall must forever be built to give him easement from the high pitch and dede became a part of this wall  her personality her laughter the intonations of her voice the impossible golden glow of her eyes the light on her hair her form her dress her actions on horseback her merest physical mannerismsall pictured over and over in his mind and dwelt upon served to take the place of many a cocktail or long scotch and soda  in spite of their high resolve there was a very measurable degree of the furtive in their meetings  in essence these meetings were stolen they did not ride out brazenly together in the face of the world  on the contrary they met always unobserved she riding across the manygated backroad from berkeley to meet him halfway  nor did they ride on any save unfrequented roads preferring to cross the second range of hills and travel among a churchgoing farmer folk who would scarcely have recognized even daylight from his newspaper photographs  he found dede a good horsewomangood not merely in riding but in endurance  there were days when they covered sixty seventy and even eighty miles nor did dede ever claim any day too long noranother strong recommendation to daylightdid the hardest day ever the slightest chafe of the chestnut sorrels back  a sure enough hummer was daylights stereotyped but ever enthusiastic verdict to himself  they learned much of each other on these long uninterrupted rides they had nothing much to talk about but themselves and while she received a liberal education concerning arctic travel and goldmining he in turn touch by touch painted an ever clearer portrait of her she amplified the ranch life of her girlhood prattling on about horses and dogs and persons and things until it was as if he saw the whole process of her growth and her becoming  all this he was able to trace on through the period of her fathers failure and death when she had been compelled to leave the university and go into office work  the brother too she spoke of and of her long struggle to have him cured and of her now fading hopes  daylight decided that it was easier to come to an understanding of her than he had anticipated though he was always aware that behind and under all he knew of her was the mysterious and baffling woman and sex there he was humble enough to confess to himself was a chartless shoreless sea about which he knew nothing and which he must nevertheless somehow navigate  his lifelong fear of woman had originated out of nonunderstanding and had also prevented him from reaching any understanding  dede on horseback dede gathering poppies on a summer hillside dede taking down dictation in her swift shorthand strokesall this was comprehensible to him  but he did not know the dede who so quickly changed from mood to mood the dede who refused steadfastly to ride with him and then suddenly consented the dede in whose eyes the golden glow forever waxed and waned and whispered hints and messages that were not for his ears  in all such things he saw the glimmering profundities of sex acknowledged their lure and accepted them as incomprehensible  there was another side of her too of which he was consciously ignorant  she knew the books was possessed of that mysterious and awful thing called culture  and yet what continually surprised him was that this culture was never obtruded on their intercourse  she did not talk books nor art nor similar folderols  homely minded as he was himself he found her almost equally homely minded  she liked the simple and the outofdoors the horses and the hills the sunlight and the flowers  he found himself in a partly new flora to which she was the guide pointing out to him all the varieties of the oaks making him acquainted with the madrono and the manzanita teaching him the names habits and habitats of unending series of wild flowers shrubs and ferns  her keen woods eye was another delight to him  it had been trained in the open and little escaped it  one day as a test they strove to see which could discover the greater number of birds nests and he who had always prided himself on his own acutely trained observation found himself hard put to keep his score ahead  at the end of the day he was but three nests in the lead one of which she challenged stoutly and of which even he confessed serious doubt he complimented her and told her that her success must be due to the fact that she was a bird herself with all a birds keen vision and quickflashing ways  the more he knew her the more he became convinced of this birdlike quality in her  that was why she liked to ride he argued  it was the nearest approach to flying  a field of poppies a glen of ferns a row of poplars on a country lane the tawny brown of a hillside the shaft of sunlight on a distant peakall such were provocative of quick joys which seemed to him like so many outbursts of song  her joys were in little things and she seemed always singing  even in sterner things it was the same  when she rode bob and fought with that magnificent brute for mastery the qualities of an eagle were uppermost in her  these quick little joys of hers were sources of joy to him  he joyed in her joy his eyes as excitedly fixed on her as bears were fixed on the object of her attention  also through her he came to a closer discernment and keener appreciation of nature she showed him colors in the landscape that he would never have dreamed were there  he had known only the primary colors  all colors of red were red  black was black and brown was just plain brown until it became yellow when it was no longer brown purple he had always imagined was red something like blood until she taught him better  once they rode out on a high hill brow where windblown poppies blazed about their horses knees and she was in an ecstasy over the lines of the many distances seven she counted and he who had gazed on landscapes all his life for the first time learned what a distance was  after that and always he looked upon the face of nature with a more seeing eye learning a delight of his own in surveying the serried ranks of the upstanding ranges and in slow contemplation of the purple summer mists that haunted the languid creases of the distant hills  but through it all ran the golden thread of love  at first he had been content just to ride with dede and to be on comradely terms with her but the desire and the need for her increased the more he knew of her the higher was his appraisal  had she been reserved and haughty with him or been merely a giggling simpering creature of a woman it would have been different instead she amazed him with her simplicity and wholesomeness with her great store of comradeliness  this latter was the unexpected  he had never looked upon woman in that way  woman the toy woman the harpy woman the necessary wife and mother of the races offspringall this had been his expectation and understanding of woman  but woman the comrade and playfellow and joyfellowthis was what dede had surprised him in  and the more she became worth while the more ardently his love burned unconsciously shading his voice with caresses and with equal unconsciousness flaring up signal fires in his eyes  nor was she blind to it yet like many women before her she thought to play with the pretty fire and escape the consequent conflagration  winter will soon be coming on she said regretfully and with provocation one day and then there wont be any more riding  but i must see you in the winter just the same he cried hastily  she shook her head  we have been very happy and all that she said looking at him with steady frankness  i remember your foolish argument for getting acquainted too but it wont lead to anything it cant i know myself too well to be mistaken  her face was serious even solicitous with desire not to hurt and her eyes were unwavering but in them was the light golden and glowingthe abyss of sex into which he was now unafraid to gaze  ive been pretty good he declared  i leave it to you if i havent its been pretty hard too i can tell you  you just think it over not once have i said a word about love to you and me loving you all the time  thats going some for a man thats used to having his own way  im somewhat of a rusher when it comes to travelling  i reckon id rush god almighty if it came to a race over the ice  and yet i didnt rush you  i guess this fact is an indication of how much i do love you  of course i want you to marry me  have i said a word about it though nary a chirp nary a flutter  ive been quiet and good though its almost made me sick at times this keeping quiet  i havent asked you to marry me  im not asking you now  oh not but what you satisfy me  i sure know youre the wife for me  but how about myself  do you know me well enough know your own mind he shrugged his shoulders  i dont know and i aint going to take chances on it now  youve got to know for sure whether you think you could get along with me or not and im playing a slow conservative game  i aint agoing to lose for overlooking my hand  this was lovemaking of a sort beyond dedes experience  nor had she ever heard of anything like it  furthermore its lack of ardor carried with it a shock which she could overcome only by remembering the way his hand had trembled in the past and by remembering the passion she had seen that very day and every day in his eyes or heard in his voice  then too she recollected what he had said to her weeks before maybe you dont know what patience is he had said and thereat told her of shooting squirrels with a big rifle the time he and elijah davis had starved on the stewart river  so you see he urged just for a square deal weve got to see some more of each other this winter  most likely your mind aint made up yet  but it is she interrupted  i wouldnt dare permit myself to care for you  happiness for me would not lie that way  i like you mr harnish and all that but it can never be more than that  its because you dont like my way of living he charged thinking in his own mind of the sensational joyrides and general profligacy with which the newspapers had credited himthinking this and wondering whether or not in maiden modesty she would disclaim knowledge of it  to his surprise her answer was flat and uncompromising  no i dont  i know ive been brash on some of those rides that got into the papers he began his defense and that ive been travelling with a lively crowd  i dont mean that she said though i know about it too and cant say that i like it  but it is your life in general your business there are women in the world who could marry a man like you and be happy but i couldnt  and the more i cared for such a man the more unhappy i should be  you see my unhappiness in turn would tend to make him unhappy  i should make a mistake and he would make an equal mistake though his would not be so hard on him because he would still have his business  business daylight gasped  whats wrong with my business  i play fair and square  theres nothing under hand about it which cant be said of most businesses whether of the big corporations or of the cheating lying little cornergrocerymen  i play the straight rules of the game and i dont have to lie or cheat or break my word  dede hailed with relief the change in the conversation and at the same time the opportunity to speak her mind  in ancient greece she began pedantically a man was judged a good citizen who built houses planted trees  she did not complete the quotation but drew the conclusion hurriedly  how many houses have you built  how many trees have you planted  he shook his head noncommittally for he had not grasped the drift of the argument  well she went on two winters ago you cornered coal  just locally he grinned reminiscently just locally  and i took advantage of the car shortage and the strike in british columbia  but you didnt dig any of that coal yourself  yet you forced it up four dollars a ton and made a lot of money  that was your business you made the poor people pay more for their coal  you played fair as you said but you put your hands down into all their pockets and took their money away from them  i know  i burn a grate fire in my sittingroom at berkeley  and instead of eleven dollars a ton for rock wells i paid fifteen dollars that winter  you robbed me of four dollars  i could stand it  but there were thousands of the very poor who could not stand it you might call it legal gambling but to me it was downright robbery  daylight was not abashed  this was no revelation to him  he remembered the old woman who made wine in the sonoma hills and the millions like her who were made to be robbed  now look here miss mason youve got me there slightly i grant  but youve seen me in business a long time now and you know i dont make a practice of raiding the poor people  i go after the big fellows theyre my meat  they rob the poor and i rob them  that coal deal was an accident  i wasnt after the poor people in that but after the big fellows and i got them too  the poor people happened to get in the way and got hurt that was all  dont you see he went on the whole game is a gamble everybody gambles in one way or another  the farmer gambles against the weather and the market on his crops  so does the united states steel corporation  the business of lots of men is straight robbery of the poor people  but ive never made that my business  you know that ive always gone after the robbers  i missed my point she admitted wait a minute  and for a space they rode in silence  i see it more clearly than i can state it but its something like this  there is legitimate work and theres work thatwell that isnt legitimate  the farmer works the soil and produces grain  hes making something that is good for humanity  he actually in a way creates something the grain that will fill the mouths of the hungry  and then the railroads and marketriggers and the rest proceed to rob him of that same graindaylight broke in dede smiled and held up her hand  wait a minute  youll make me lose my point  it doesnt hurt if they rob him of all of it so that he starves to death  the point is that the wheat he grew is still in the world  it exists  dont you see the farmer created something say ten tons of wheat and those ten tons exist  the railroads haul the wheat to market to the mouths that will eat it  this also is legitimate  its like some one bringing you a glass of water or taking a cinder out of your eye  something has been done in a way been created just like the wheat  but the railroads rob like sam scratch daylight objected  then the work they do is partly legitimate and partly not  now we come to you  you dont create anything  nothing new exists when youre done with your business  just like the coal  you didnt dig it  you didnt haul it to market  you didnt deliver it  dont you see  thats what i meant by planting the trees and building the houses  you havent planted one tree nor built a single house  i never guessed there was a woman in the world who could talk business like that he murmured admiringly  and youve got me on that point but theres a lot to be said on my side just the same  now you listen to me  im going to talk under three heads  number one we live a short time the best of us and were a long time dead  life is a big gambling game  some are born lucky and some are born unlucky everybody sits in at the table and everybody tries to rob everybody else  most of them get robbed  theyre born suckers  fellow like me comes along and sizes up the proposition  ive got two choices  i can herd with the suckers or i can herd with the robbers as a sucker i win nothing  even the crusts of bread are snatched out of my mouth by the robbers  i work hard all my days and die working and i aint never had a flutter  ive had nothing but work work work  they talk about the dignity of labor  i tell you there aint no dignity in that sort of labor my other choice is to herd with the robbers and i herd with them i play that choice wide open to win  i get the automobiles and the porterhouse steaks and the soft beds  number two there aint much difference between playing halfway robber like the railroad hauling that farmers wheat to market and playing all robber and robbing the robbers like i do  and besides halfway robbery is too slow a game for me to sit in you dont win quick enough for me  but what do you want to win for dede demanded  you have millions and millions already  you cant ride in more than one automobile at a time sleep in more than one bed at a time  number three answers that he said and here it is  men and things are so made that they have different likes  a rabbit likes a vegetarian diet  a lynx likes meat  ducks swim chickens are scairt of water  one man collects postage stamps another man collects butterflies  this man goes in for paintings that man goes in for yachts and some other fellow for hunting big game  one man thinks horseracing is it with a big i and another man finds the biggest satisfaction in actresses they cant help these likes  they have them and what are they going to do about it  now i like gambling  i like to play the game  i want to play it big and play it quick  im just made that way  and i play it  but why cant you do good with all your money  daylight laughed  doing good with your money  its like slapping god in the face as much as to tell him that he dont know how to run his world and that youll be much obliged if hell stand out of the way and give you a chance  thinking about god doesnt keep me sitting up nights so ive got another way of looking at it  aint it funny to go around with brass knuckles and a big club breaking folks heads and taking their money away from them until ive got a pile and then repenting of my ways going around and bandaging up the heads the other robbers are breaking  i leave it to you  thats what doing good with money amounts to  every once in a while some robber turns softhearted and takes to driving an ambulance  thats what carnegie did  he smashed heads in pitched battles at homestead regular wholesale headbreaker he was held up the suckers for a few hundred million and now he goes around dribbling it back to them  funny  i leave it to you  he rolled a cigarette and watched her half curiously half amusedly his replies and harsh generalizations of a harsh school were disconcerting and she came back to her earlier position  i cant argue with you and you know that  no matter how right a woman is men have such a way about them well what they say sounds most convincing and yet the woman is still certain they are wrong but there is one thingthe creative joy  call it gambling if you will but just the same it seems to me more satisfying to create something make something than just to roll dice out of a dicebox all day long  why sometimes for exercise or when ive got to pay fifteen dollars for coal i curry mab and give her a whole half hours brushing  and when i see her coat clean and shining and satiny i feel a satisfaction in what ive done  so it must be with the man who builds a house or plants a tree  he can look at it  he made it  its his handiwork  even if somebody like you comes along and takes his tree away from him still it is there and still did he make it you cant rob him of that mr harnish with all your millions its the creative joy and its a higher joy than mere gambling havent you ever made things yourselfa log cabin up in the yukon or a canoe or raft or something  and dont you remember how satisfied you were how good you felt while you were doing it and after you had it done  while she spoke his memory was busy with the associations she recalled he saw the deserted flat on the river bank by the klondike and he saw the log cabins and warehouses spring up and all the log structures he had built and his sawmills working night and day on three shifts  why doggone it miss mason youre rightin a way  ive built hundreds of houses up there and i remember i was proud and glad to see them go up  im proud now when i remember them and there was ophirthe most godforsaken moosepasture of a creek you ever laid eyes on  i made that into the big ophir why i ran the water in there from the rinkabilly eighty miles away  they all said i couldnt but i did it and i did it by myself  the dam and the flume cost me four million  but you should have seen that ophirpower plants electric lights and hundreds of men on the payroll working night and day  i guess i do get an inkling of what you mean by making a thing  i made ophir and by god she was a sure hummeri beg your pardon  i didnt mean to cuss  but that ophiri sure am proud of her now just as the last time i laid eyes on her  and you won something there that was more than mere money dede encouraged  now do you know what i would do if i had lots of money and simply had to go on playing at business  take all the southerly and westerly slopes of these bare hills  id buy them in and plant eucalyptus on them  id do it for the joy of doing it anyway but suppose i had that gambling twist in me which you talk about why id do it just the same and make money out of the trees  and theres my other point again  instead of raising the price of coal without adding an ounce of coal to the market supply id be making thousands and thousands of cords of firewoodmaking something where nothing was before  and everybody who ever crossed on the ferries would look up at these forested hills and be made glad  who was made glad by your adding four dollars a ton to rock wells  it was daylights turn to be silent for a time while she waited an answer  would you rather i did things like that he asked at last  it would be better for the world and better for you she answered noncommittally    chapter xvi  all week every one in the office knew that something new and big was afoot in daylights mind  beyond some deals of no importance he had not been interested in anything for several months  but now he went about in an almost unbroken brown study made unexpected and lengthy trips across the bay to oakland or sat at his desk silent and motionless for hours  he seemed particularly happy with what occupied his mind  at times men came in and conferred with himand with new faces and differing in type from those that usually came to see him  on sunday dede learned all about it  ive been thinking a lot of our talk he began and ive got an idea id like to give it a flutter and ive got a proposition to make your hair stand up  its what you call legitimate and at the same time its the goshdangdest gamble a man ever went into  how about planting minutes wholesale and making two minutes grow where one minute grew before  oh yes and planting a few trees toosay several million of them  you remember the quarry i made believe i was looking at  well im going to buy it  im going to buy these hills too clear from here around to berkeley and down the other way to san leandro  i own a lot of them already for that matter  but mum is the word  ill be buying a long time to come before anything much is guessed about it and i dont want the market to jump up out of sight  you see that hill over there its my hill running clear down its slopes through piedmont and halfway along those rolling hills into oakland  and its nothing to all the things im going to buy  he paused triumphantly  and all to make two minutes grow where one grew before dede queried at the same time laughing heartily at his affectation of mystery  he stared at her fascinated  she had such a frank boyish way of throwing her head back when she laughed  and her teeth were an unending delight to him  not small yet regular and firm without a blemish he considered then the healthiest whitest prettiest teeth he had ever seen  and for months he had been comparing them with the teeth of every woman he met  it was not until her laughter was over that he was able to continue  the ferry system between oakland and san francisco is the worst onehorse concern in the united states  you cross on it every day six days in the week  thats say twentyfive days a month or three hundred a year  now long does it take you one way forty minutes if youre lucky  im going to put you across in twenty minutes  if that aint making two minutes grow where one grew before knock off my head with little apples  ill save you twenty minutes each way  thats forty minutes a day times three hundred equals twelve thousand minutes a year just for you just for one person  lets see thats two hundred whole hours suppose i save two hundred hours a year for thousands of other folksthats farming some aint it  dede could only nod breathlessly  she had caught the contagion of his enthusiasm though she had no clew as to how this great timesaving was to be accomplished  come on he said  lets ride up that hill and when i get you out on top where you can see something ill talk sense  a small footpath dropped down to the dry bed of the canon which they crossed before they began the climb  the slope was steep and covered with matted brush and bushes through which the horses slipped and lunged  bob growing disgusted turned back suddenly and attempted to pass mab  the mare was thrust sidewise into the denser bush where she nearly fell  recovering she flung her weight against bob  both riders legs were caught in the consequent squeeze and as bob plunged ahead down hill dede was nearly scraped off  daylight threw his horse on to its haunches and at the same time dragged dede back into the saddle showers of twigs and leaves fell upon them and predicament followed predicament until they emerged on the hilltop the worse for wear but happy and excited  here no trees obstructed the view  the particular hill on which they were outjutted from the regular line of the range so that the sweep of their vision extended over threequarters of the circle  below on the flat land bordering the bay lay oakland and across the bay was san francisco  between the two cities they could see the white ferryboats on the water  around to their right was berkeley and to their left the scattered villages between oakland and san leandro  directly in the foreground was piedmont with its desultory dwellings and patches of farming land and from piedmont the land rolled down in successive waves upon oakland  look at it said daylight extending his arm in a sweeping gesture a hundred thousand people there and no reason there shouldnt be half a million  theres the chance to make five people grow where one grows now  heres the scheme in a nutshell  why dont more people live in oakland  no good service with san francisco and besides oakland is asleep its a whole lot better place to live in than san francisco now suppose i buy in all the street railways of oakland berkeley alameda san leandro and the restbring them under one head with a competent management  suppose i cut the time to san francisco onehalf by building a big pier out there almost to goat island and establishing a ferry system with modern uptodate boats  why folks will want to live over on this side  very good  theyll need land on which to build  so first i buy up the land  but the lands cheap now  why because its in the country no electric roads no quick communication nobody guessing that the electric roads are coming  ill build the roads that will make the land jump up  then ill sell the land as fast as the folks will want to buy because of the improved ferry system and transportation facilities  you see i give the value to the land by building the roads then i sell the land and get that value back and after that theres the roads all carrying folks back and forth and earning big money  cant lose  and theres all sorts of millions in it  im going to get my hands on some of that water front and the tidelands  take between where im going to build my pier and the old pier  its shallow water  i can fill and dredge and put in a system of docks that will handle hundreds of ships  san franciscos water front is congested  no more room for ships with hundreds of ships loading and unloading on this side right into the freight cars of three big railroads factories will start up over here instead of crossing to san francisco  that means factory sites  that means me buying in the factory sites before anybody guesses the cat is going to jump much less which way  factories mean tens of thousands of workingmen and their families  that means more houses and more land and that means me for ill be there to sell them the land  and tens of thousands of families means tens of thousands of nickels every day for my electric cars  the growing population will mean more stores more banks more everything  and thatll mean me for ill be right there with business property as well as home property  what do you think of it  therefore she could answer he was off again his minds eye filled with this new city of his dream which he builded on the alameda hills by the gateway to the orient  do you knowive been looking it upthe firth of clyde where all the steel ships are built isnt half as wide as oakland creek down there where all those old hulks lie  why aint it a firth of clyde because the oakland city council spends its time debating about prunes and raisins  what is needed is somebody to see things and after that organization  thats me  i didnt make ophir for nothing  and once things begin to hum outside capital will pour in  all i do is start it going  gentlemen i say heres all the natural advantages for a great metropolis god almighty put them advantages here and he put me here to see them  do you want to land your tea and silk from asia and ship it straight east  heres the docks for your steamers and heres the railroads  do you want factories from which you can ship direct by land or water  heres the site and heres the modern uptodate city with the latest improvements for yourselves and your workmen to live in  then theres the water  ill come pretty close to owning the watershed  why not the waterworks too  theres two water companies in oakland now fighting like cats and dogs and both about broke  what a metropolis needs is a good water system they cant give it  theyre stickinthemuds  ill gobble them up and deliver the right article to the city  theres money there toomoney everywhere  everything works in with everything else  each improvement makes the value of everything else pump up  its people that are behind the value  the bigger the crowd that herds in one place the more valuable is the real estate  and this is the very place for a crowd to herd  look at it just look at it  you could never find a finer site for a great city all it needs is the herd and ill stampede a couple of hundred thousand people in here inside two years  and whats more it wont be one of these wild cat land booms  it will be legitimate  twenty years for now therell be a million people on this side the bay  another thing is hotels  there isnt a decent one in the town  ill build a couple of uptodate ones thatll make them sit up and take notice  i wont care if they dont pay for years  their effect will more than give me my money back out of the other holdings  and oh yes im going to plant eucalyptus millions of them on these hills  but how are you going to do it dede asked  you havent enough money for all that youve planned  ive thirty million and if i need more i can borrow on the land and other things  interest on mortgages wont anywhere near eat up the increase in land values and ill be selling land right along  in the weeks that followed daylight was a busy man  he spent most of his time in oakland rarely coming to the office  he planned to move the office to oakland but as he told dede the secret preliminary campaign of buying had to be put through first  sunday by sunday now from this hilltop and now from that they looked down upon the city and its farming suburbs and he pointed out to her his latest acquisitions at first it was patches and sections of land here and there but as the weeks passed it was the unowned portions that became rare until at last they stood as islands surrounded by daylights land  it meant quick work on a colossal scale for oakland and the adjacent country was not slow to feel the tremendous buying  but daylight had the ready cash and it had always been his policy to strike quickly before the others could get the warning of the boom he quietly accomplished many things  at the same time that his agents were purchasing corner lots and entire blocks in the heart of the business section and the waste lands for factory sites day was rushing franchises through the city council capturing the two exhausted water companies and the eight or nine independent street railways and getting his grip on the oakland creek and the bay tidelands for his dock system  the tidelands had been in litigation for years and he took the bull by the hornsbuying out the private owners and at the same time leasing from the city fathers  by the time that oakland was aroused by this unprecedented activity in every direction and was questioning excitedly the meaning of it daylight secretly bought the chief republican newspaper and the chief democratic organ and moved boldly into his new offices  of necessity they were on a large scale occupying four floors of the only modern office building in the townthe only building that wouldnt have to be torn down later on as daylight put it  there was department after department a score of them and hundreds of clerks and stenographers as he told dede ive got more companies than you can shake a stick at  theres the alameda  contra costa land syndicate the consolidated street railways the yerba buena ferry company the united water company the piedmont realty company the fairview and portola hotel company and half a dozen more that ive got to refer to a notebook to remember  theres the piedmont laundry farm and redwood consolidated quarries  starting in with our quarry i just kept agoing till i got them all  and theres the shipbuilding company i aint got a name for yet  seeing as i had to have ferryboats i decided to build them myself  theyll be done by the time the pier is ready for them  phew  it all sure beats poker  and ive had the fun of gouging the robber gangs as well  the water company bunches are squealing yet  i sure got them where the hair was short  they were just about all in when i came along and finished them off  but why do you hate them so dede asked  because theyre such cowardly skunks  but you play the same game they do  yes but not in the same way  daylight regarded her thoughtfully when i say cowardly skunks i mean just thatcowardly skunks  they set up for a lot of gamblers and there aint one in a thousand of them thats got the nerve to be a gambler  theyre fourflushers if you know what that means theyre a lot of little cottontail rabbits making believe theyre big ripsnorting timber wolves  they set out to everlastingly eat up some proposition but at the first sign of trouble they turn tail and stampede for the brush  look how it works  when the big fellows wanted to unload little copper they sent jakey fallow into the new york stock exchange to yell out ill buy all or any part of little copper at fifty five little copper being at fiftyfour and in thirty minutes them cottontailsfinanciers some folks call thembid up little copper to sixty and an hour after that stampeding for the brush they were throwing little copper overboard at fortyfive and even forty  theyre catspaws for the big fellows  almost as fast as they rob the suckers the big fellows come along and hold them up  or else the big fellows use them in order to rob each other  thats the way the chattanooga coal and iron company was swallowed up by the trust in the last panic  the trust made that panic  it had to break a couple of big banking companies and squeeze half a dozen big fellows too and it did it by stampeding the cottontails  the cottontails did the rest all right and the trust gathered in chattanooga coal and iron  why any man with nerve and savvee can start them cottontails jumping for the brush  i dont exactly hate them myself but i havent any regard for chickenhearted fourflushers    chapter xvii  for months daylight was buried in work  the outlay was terrific and there was nothing coming in  beyond a general rise in land values oakland had not acknowledged his irruption on the financial scene  the city was waiting for him to show what he was going to do and he lost no time about it  the best skilled brains on the market were hired by him for the different branches of the work  initial mistakes he had no patience with and he was determined to start right as when he engaged wilkinson almost doubling his big salary and brought him out from chicago to take charge of the street railway organization  night and day the road gangs toiled on the streets  and night and day the piledrivers hammered the big piles down into the mud of san francisco bay  the pier was to be three miles long and the berkeley hills were denuded of whole groves of mature eucalyptus for the piling  at the same time that his electric roads were building out through the hills the hayfields were being surveyed and broken up into city squares with here and there according to best modern methods winding boulevards and strips of park  broad streets well graded were made with sewers and waterpipes ready laid and macadamized from his own quarries  cement sidewalks were also laid so that all the purchaser had to do was to select his lot and architect and start building  the quick service of daylights new electric roads into oakland made this big district immediately accessible and long before the ferry system was in operation hundreds of residences were going up  the profit on this land was enormous  in a day his onslaught of wealth had turned open farming country into one of the best residential districts of the city  but this money that flowed in upon him was immediately poured back into his other investments  the need for electric cars was so great that he installed his own shops for building them  and even on the rising land market he continued to buy choice factory sites and building properties  on the advice of wilkinson practically every electric road already in operation was rebuilt  the light old fashioned rails were torn out and replaced by the heaviest that were manufactured corner lots on the sharp turns of narrow streets were bought and ruthlessly presented to the city in order to make wide curves for his tracks and high speed for his cars  then too there were the mainline feeders for his ferry system tapping every portion of oakland alameda and berkeley and running fast expresses to the pier end  the same largescale methods were employed in the water system service of the best was needed if his huge land investment was to succeed  oakland had to be made into a worthwhile city and that was what he intended to do  in addition to his big hotels he built amusement parks for the common people and art galleries and clubhouse country inns for the more finicky classes  even before there was any increase in population a marked increase in streetrailway traffic took place  there was nothing fanciful about his schemes  they were sound investments  what oakland wants is a first class theatre he said and after vainly trying to interest local capital he started the building of the theatre himself for he alone had vision for the two hundred thousand new people that were coming to the town  but no matter what pressure was on daylight his sundays he reserved for his riding in the hills  it was not the winter weather however that brought these rides with dede to an end one saturday afternoon in the office she told him not to expect to meet her next day and when he pressed for an explanation  ive sold mab  daylight was speechless for the moment  her act meant one of so many serious things that he couldnt classify it  it smacked almost of treachery  she might have met with financial disaster  it might be her way of letting him know she had seen enough of him or  whats the matter he managed to ask  i couldnt afford to keep her with hay fortyfive dollars a ton dede answered  was that your only reason he demanded looking at her steadily for he remembered her once telling him how she had brought the mare through one winter five years before when hay had gone as high as sixty dollars a ton  no  my brothers expenses have been higher as well and i was driven to the conclusion that since i could not afford both id better let the mare go and keep the brother  daylight felt inexpressibly saddened  he was suddenly aware of a great emptiness  what would a sunday be without dede  and sundays without end without her  he drummed perplexedly on the desk with his fingers  who bought her he asked  dedes eyes flashed in the way long since familiar to him when she was angry  dont you dare buy her back for me she cried  and dont deny that that was what you had in mind  i wont deny it  it was my idea to a tee  but i wouldnt have done it without asking you first and seeing how you feel about it i wont even ask you  but you thought a heap of that mare and its pretty hard on you to lose her  im sure sorry  and im sorry too that you wont be riding with me tomorrow  ill be plumb lost  i wont know what to do with myself  neither shall i dede confessed mournfully except that i shall be able to catch up with my sewing  but i havent any sewing  daylights tone was whimsically plaintive but secretly he was delighted with her confession of loneliness  it was almost worth the loss of the mare to get that out of her  at any rate he meant something to her  he was not utterly unliked  i wish you would reconsider miss mason he said softly  not alone for the mares sake but for my sake  money dont cut any ice in this for me to buy that mare wouldnt mean as it does to most men to send a bouquet of flowers or a box of candy to a young lady  and ive never sent you flowers or candy  he observed the warning flash of her eyes and hurried on to escape refusal  ill tell you what well do suppose i buy the mare and own her myself and lend her to you when you want to ride theres nothing wrong in that  anybody borrows a horse from anybody you know  agin he saw refusal and headed her off  lots of men take women buggyriding  theres nothing wrong in that and the man always furnishes the horse and buggy well now whats the difference between my taking you buggyriding and furnishing the horse and buggy and taking you horsebackriding and furnishing the horses  she shook her head and declined to answer at the same time looking at the door as if to intimate that it was time for this unbusinesslike conversation to end  he made one more effort  do you know miss mason i havent a friend in the world outside you i mean a real friend man or woman the kind you chum with you know and that youre glad to be with and sorry to be away from  hegan is the nearest man i get to and hes a million miles away from me outside business we dont hitch  hes got a big library of books and some crazy kind of culture and he spends all his off times reading things in french and german and other outlandish lingoeswhen he aint writing plays and poetry theres nobody i feel chummy with except you and you know how little weve chummedonce a week if it didnt rain on sunday ive grown kind of to depend on you  youre a sort ofofof  a sort of habit she said with a smile  thats about it  and that mare and you astride of her coming along the road under the trees or through the sunshinewhy with both you and the mare missing there wont be anything worth waiting  through the week for  if youd just let me buy her back  no no i tell you no  dede rose impatiently but her eyes were moist with the memory of her pet  please dont mention her to me again  if you think it was easy to part with her you are mistaken but ive seen the last of her and i want to forget her  daylight made no answer and the door closed behind him  half an hour later he was conferring with jones the erstwhile elevator boy and rabid proletarian whom daylight long before had grubstaked to literature for a year  the resulting novel had been a failure editors and publishers would not look at it and now daylight was using the disgruntled author in a little private secret service system he had been compelled to establish for himself  jones who affected to be surprised at nothing after his crushing experience with railroad freight rates on firewood and charcoal betrayed no surprise now when the task was given to him to locate the purchaser of a certain sorrel mare  how high shall i pay for her he asked  any price  youve got to get her thats the point  drive a sharp bargain so as not to excite suspicion but buy her  then you deliver her to that address up in sonoma county  the mans the caretaker on a little ranch i have there  tell him hes to take whacking good care of her  and after that forget all about it dont tell me the name of the man you buy her from  dont tell me anything about it except that youve got her and delivered her savvee  but the week had not passed when daylight noted the flash in dedes eyes that boded trouble  somethings gone wrongwhat is it he asked boldly  mab she said  the man who bought her has sold her already if i thought you had anything to do with it  i dont even know who you sold her to was daylights answer and whats more im not bothering my head about her  she was your mare and its none of my business what you did with her you havent got her thats sure and worse luck  and now while were on touchy subjects im going to open another one with you and you neednt get touchy about it for its not really your business at all  she waited in the pause that followed eyeing him almost suspiciously  its about that brother of yours  he needs more than you can do for him  selling that mare of yours wont send him to germany and thats what his own doctors say he needsthat crack german specialist who rips a mans bones and muscles into pulp and then molds them all over again  well i want to send him to germany and give that crack a flutter thats all  if it were only possible she said half breathlessly and wholly without anger  only it isnt and you know it isnt  i cant accept money from you  hold on now he interrupted  wouldnt you accept a drink of water from one of the twelve apostles if you was dying of thirst or would you be afraid of his evil intentionsshe made a gesture of dissent or of what folks might say about it  but thats different she began  now look here miss mason  youve got to get some foolish notions out of your head  this money notion is one of the funniest things ive seen suppose you was falling over a cliff wouldnt it be all right for me to reach out and hold you by the arm  sure it would  but suppose you ended another sort of helpinstead of the strength of arm the strength of my pocket that would be all and thats what they all say  but why do they say it  because the robber gangs want all the suckers to be honest and respect money  if the suckers werent honest and didnt respect money where would the robbers be  dont you see the robbers dont deal in armholds they deal in dollars therefore armholds are just common and ordinary while dollars are sacredso sacred that you didnt let me lend you a hand with a few  or heres another way he continued spurred on by her mute protest its all right for me to give the strength of my arm when youre falling over a cliff  but if i take that same strength of arm and use it at pickandshovel work for a day and earn two dollars you wont have anything to do with the two dollars  yet its the same old strength of arm in a new form thats all  besides in this proposition it wont be a claim on you  it aint even a loan to you its an armhold im giving your brotherjust the same sort of armhold as if he was falling over a cliff  and a nice one you are to come running out and yell stop at me and let your brother go on over the cliff what he needs to save his legs is that crack in germany and thats the armhold im offering  wish you could see my rooms  walls all decorated with horsehair bridlesscores of themhundreds of them  theyre no use to me and they cost like sam scratch  but theres a lot of convicts making them and i go on buying  why ive spent more money in a single night on whiskey than would get the best specialists and pay all the expenses of a dozen cases like your brothers  and remember youve got nothing to do with this  if your brother wants to look on it as a loan all right  its up to him and youve got to stand out of the way while i pull him back from that cliff  still dede refused and daylights argument took a more painful turn  i can only guess that youre standing in your brothers way on account of some mistaken idea in your head that this is my idea of courting well it aint  you might as well think im courting all those convicts i buy bridles from  i havent asked you to marry me and if i do i wont come trying to buy you into consenting  and there wont be anything underhand when i come aasking  dedes face was flushed and angry  if you knew how ridiculous you are youd stop she blurted out  you can make me more uncomfortable than any man i ever knew  every little while you give me to understand that you havent asked me to marry you yet im not waiting to be asked and i warned you from the first that you had no chance  and yet you hold it over my head that some time some day youre going to ask me to marry you  go ahead and ask me now and get your answer and get it over and done with  he looked at her in honest and pondering admiration  i want you so bad miss mason that i dont dast to ask you now he said with such whimsicality and earnestness as to make her throw her head back in a frank boyish laugh  besides as i told you im green at it  i never went acourting before and i dont want to make any mistakes  but youre making them all the time she cried impulsively no man ever courted a woman by holding a threatened proposal over her head like a club  i wont do it any more he said humbly  and anyway were off the argument  my straight talk a minute ago still holds  youre standing in your brothers way  no matter what notions youve got in your head youve got to get out of the way and give him a chance  will you let me go and see him and talk it over with him  ill make it a hard and fast business proposition  ill stake him to get well thats all and charge him interest  she visibly hesitated  and just remember one thing miss mason its his leg not yours  still she refrained from giving her answer and daylight went on strengthening his position  and remember i go over to see him alone  hes a man and i can deal with him better without womenfolks around  ill go over tomorrow afternoon    chapter xviii  daylight had been wholly truthful when he told dede that he had no real friends  on speaking terms with thousands on fellowship and drinking terms with hundreds he was a lonely man  he failed to find the one man or group of several men with whom he could be really intimate cities did not make for comradeship as did the alaskan trail  besides the types of men were different scornful and contemptuous of business men on the one hand on the other his relations with the san francisco bosses had been more an alliance of expediency than anything else  he had felt more of kinship for the franker brutality of the bosses and their captains but they had failed to claim any deep respect  they were too prone to crookedness  bonds were better than mens word in this modern world and one had to look carefully to the bonds  in the old yukon days it had been different  bonds didnt go  a man said he had so much and even in a poker game his appeasement was accepted  larry hegan who rose ably to the largest demands of daylights operations and who had few illusions and less hypocrisy might have proved a chum had it not been for his temperamental twist strange genius that he was a napoleon of the law with a power of visioning that far exceeded daylights he had nothing in common with daylight outside the office  he spent his time with books a thing daylight could not abide  also he devoted himself to the endless writing of plays which never got beyond manuscript form and though daylight only sensed the secret taint of it was a confirmed but temperate eater of hasheesh hegan lived all his life cloistered with books in a world of agitation  with the outofdoor world he had no understanding nor tolerance  in food and drink he was abstemious as a monk while exercise was a thing abhorrent  daylights friendships in lieu of anything closer were drinking friendships and roistering friendships and with the passing of the sunday rides with dede he fell back more and more upon these for diversion  the cocktail wall of inhibition he reared more assiduously than ever  the big red motorcar was out more frequently now while a stable hand was hired to give bob exercise  in his early san francisco days there had been intervals of easement between his deals but in this present biggest deal of all the strain was unremitting not in a month or two or three could his huge land investment be carried to a successful consummation  and so complete and widereaching was it that complications and knotty situations constantly arose  every day brought its problems and when he had solved them in his masterful way he left the office in his big car almost sighing with relief at anticipation of the approaching double martini  rarely was he made tipsy  his constitution was too strong for that  instead he was that direst of all drinkers the steady drinker deliberate and controlled who averaged a far higher quantity of alcohol than the irregular and violent drinker  for six weeks hardrunning he had seen nothing of dede except in the office and there he resolutely refrained from making approaches  but by the seventh sunday his hunger for her overmastered him  it was a stormy day  a heavy southeast gale was blowing and squall after squall of rain and wind swept over the city  he could not take his mind off of her and a persistent picture came to him of her sitting by a window and sewing feminine fripperies of some sort  when the time came for his first preluncheon cocktail to be served to him in his rooms he did not take it  filled with a daring determination he glanced at his note book for dedes telephone number and called for the switch  at first it was her landladys daughter who was raised but in a minute he heard the voice he had been hungry to hear  i just wanted to tell you that im coming out to see you he said i didnt want to break in on you without warning that was all  has something happened came her voice  ill tell you when i get there he evaded  he left the red car two blocks away and arrived on foot at the pretty threestoried shingled berkeley house  for an instant only he was aware of an inward hesitancy but the next moment he rang the bell  he knew that what he was doing was in direct violation of her wishes and that he was setting her a difficult task to receive as a sunday caller the multimillionaire and notorious elam harnish of newspaper fame  on the other hand the one thing he did not expect of her was what he would have termed silly female capers  and in this he was not disappointed  she came herself to the door to receive him and shake hands with him he hung his mackintosh and hat on the rack in the comfortable square hall and turned to her for direction  they are busy in there she said indicating the parlor from which came the boisterous voices of young people and through the open door of which he could see several college youths  so you will have to come into my rooms  she led the way through the door opening out of the hall to the right and once inside he stood awkwardly rooted to the floor gazing about him and at her and all the time trying not to gaze in his perturbation he failed to hear and see her invitation to a seat  so these were her quarters  the intimacy of it and her making no fuss about it was startling but it was no more than he would have expected of her  it was almost two rooms in one the one he was in evidently the sittingroom and the one he could see into the bedroom  beyond an oaken dressingtable with an orderly litter of combs and brushes and dainty feminine knickknacks there was no sign of its being used as a bedroom the broad couch with a cover of old rose and banked high with cushions he decided must be the bed but it was farthest from any experience of a civilized bed he had ever had  not that he saw much of detail in that awkward moment of standing  his general impression was one of warmth and comfort and beauty  there were no carpets and on the hardwood floor he caught a glimpse of several wolf and coyote skins  what captured and perceptibly held his eye for a moment was a crouched venus that stood on a steinway upright against a background of mountainlion skin on the wall  but it was dede herself that smote most sharply upon sense and perception  he had always cherished the idea that she was very much a womanthe lines of her figure her hair her eyes her voice and birdlike laughing ways had all contributed to this but here in her own rooms clad in some flowing clinging gown the emphasis of sex was startling  he had been accustomed to her only in trim tailor suits and shirtwaists or in riding costume of velvet corduroy and he was not prepared for this new revelation  she seemed so much softer so much more pliant and tender and lissome  she was a part of this atmosphere of quietude and beauty  she fitted into it just as she had fitted in with the sober office furnishings  wont you sit down she repeated  he felt like an animal long denied food  his hunger for her welled up in him and he proceeded to wolf the dainty morsel before him  here was no patience no diplomacy  the straightest direct way was none too quick for him and had he known it the least unsuccessful way he could have chosen  look here he said in a voice that shook with passion theres one thing i wont do and thats propose to you in the office  thats why im here  dede mason i want you  i just want you  while he spoke he advanced upon her his black eyes burning with bright fire his aroused blood swarthy in his cheek  so precipitate was he that she had barely time to cry out her involuntary alarm and to step back at the same time catching one of his hands as he attempted to gather her into his arms  in contrast to him the blood had suddenly left her cheeks  the hand that had warded his off and that still held it was trembling  she relaxed her fingers and his arm dropped to his side  she wanted to say something do something to pass on from the awkwardness of the situation but no intelligent thought nor action came into her mind she was aware only of a desire to laugh  this impulse was party hysterical and partly spontaneous humorthe latter growing from instant to instant  amazing as the affair was the ridiculous side of it was not veiled to her she felt like one who had suffered the terror of the onslaught of a murderous footpad only to find out that it was an innocent pedestrian asking the time  daylight was the quicker to achieve action  oh i know im a sure enough fool he said  ii guess ill sit down  dont be scairt miss mason  im not real dangerous  im not afraid she answered with a smile slipping down herself into a chair beside which on the floor stood a sewingbasket from which daylight noted some white fluffy thing of lace and muslin overflowed  again she smiled  though i confess you did startle me for the moment  its funny daylight sighed almost with regret here i am strong enough to bend you around and tie knots in you  here i am used to having my will with man and beast and anything  and here i am sitting in this chair as weak and helpless as a little lamb  you sure take the starch out of me  dede vainly cudgeled her brains in quest of a reply to these remarks instead her thought dwelt insistently upon the significance of his stepping aside in the middle of a violent proposal in order to make irrelevant remarks  what struck her was the mans certitude  so little did he doubt that he would have her that he could afford to pause and generalize upon love and the effects of love  she noted his hand unconsciously slipping in the familiar way into the side coat pocket where she knew he carried his tobacco and brown papers  you may smoke if you want to she said  he withdrew his hand with a jerk as if something in the pocket had stung him  no i wasnt thinking of smoking  i was thinking of you whats a man to do when he wants a woman but ask her to marry him  thats all that im doing  i cant do it in style  i know that  but i can use straight english and thats good enough for me  i sure want you mighty bad miss mason  youre in my mind most all the time now and what i want to know iswell do you want me  thats all  ii wish you hadnt asked she said softly  mebbe its best you should know a few things before you give me an answer he went on ignoring the fact that the answer had already been given  i never went after a woman before in my life all reports to the contrary not withstanding  the stuff you read about me in the papers and books about me being a ladykiller is all wrong theres not an iota of truth in it  i guess ive done more than my share of cardplaying and whiskeydrinking but women ive let alone  there was a woman that killed herself but i didnt know she wanted me that bad or else id have married hernot for love but to keep her from killing herself  she was the best of the boiling but i never gave her any encouragement  im telling you all this because youve read about it and i want you to get it straight from me  ladykiller he snorted  why miss mason i dont mind telling you that ive sure been scairt of women all my life youre the first one ive not been afraid of  thats the strange thing about it  i just plumb worship you and yet im not afraid of you  mebbe its because youre different from the women i know  youve never chased me ladykiller  why ive been running away from ladies ever since i can remember and i guess all that saved me was that i was strong in the wind and that i never fell down and broke a leg or anything  i didnt ever want to get married until after i met you and until a long time after i met you  i cottoned to you from the start but i never thought it would get as bad as marriage  why i cant get to sleep nights thinking of you and wanting you  he came to a stop and waited  she had taken the lace and muslin from the basket possibly to settle her nerves and wits and was sewing upon it  as she was not looking at him he devoured her with his eyes  he noted the firm efficient handshands that could control a horse like bob that could run a typewriter almost as fast as a man could talk that could sew on dainty garments and that doubtlessly could play on the piano over there in the corner  another ultrafeminine detail he noticedher slippers  they were small and bronze  he had never imagined she had such a small foot  street shoes and riding boots were all that he had ever seen on her feet and they had given no advertisement of this  the bronze slippers fascinated him and to them his eyes repeatedly turned  a knock came at the door which she answered  daylight could not help hearing the conversation  she was wanted at the telephone  tell him to call up again in ten minutes he heard her say and the masculine pronoun caused in him a flashing twinge of jealousy  well he decided whoever it was burning daylight would give him a run for his money  the marvel to him was that a girl like dede hadnt been married long since  she came back smiling to him and resumed her sewing  his eyes wandered from the efficient hands to the bronze slippers and back again and he swore to himself that there were mighty few stenographers like her in existence  that was because she must have come of pretty good stock and had a pretty good raising nothing else could explain these rooms of hers and the clothes she wore and the way she wore them  those ten minutes are flying he suggested  i cant marry you she said  you dont love me  she shook her head  do you like methe littlest bit  this time she nodded at the same time allowing the smile of amusement to play on her lips  but it was amusement without contempt  the humorous side of a situation rarely appealed in vain to her  well thats something to go on he announced  youve got to make a start to get started  i just liked you at first and look what its grown into  you recollect you said you didnt like my way of life well ive changed it a heap  i aint gambling like i used to  ive gone into what you called the legitimate making two minutes grow where one grew before three hundred thousand folks where only a hundred thousand grew before  and this time next year therell be two million eucalyptus growing on the hills  say do you like me more than the littlest bit  she raised her eyes from her work and looked at him as she answered  i like you a great deal but  he waited a moment for her to complete the sentence failing which he went on himself  i havent an exaggerated opinion of myself so i know i aint bragging when i say ill make a pretty good husband  youd find i was no hand at nagging and faultfinding i can guess what it must be for a woman like you to be independent  well youd be independent as my wife  no strings on you  you could follow your own sweet will and nothing would be too good for you  id give you everything your heart desired  except yourself she interrupted suddenly almost sharply  daylights astonishment was momentary  i dont know about that  id be straight and square and live true i dont hanker after divided affections  i dont mean that she said  instead of giving yourself to your wife you would give yourself to the three hundred thousand people of oakland to your street railways and ferryroutes to the two million trees on the hills to everything businessandand to all that that means  id see that i didnt he declared stoutly  id be yours to command  you think so but it would turn out differently  she suddenly became nervous  we must stop this talk  it is too much like attempting to drive a bargain  how much will you give  ill give so much i want more and all that  i like you but not enough to marry you and ill never like you enough to marry you  how do you know that he demanded  because i like you less and less  daylight sat dumfounded  the hurt showed itself plainly in his face  oh you dont understand she cried wildly beginning to lose selfcontrolits not that way i mean  i do like you the more ive known you the more ive liked you  and at the same time the more ive known you the less would i care to marry you  this enigmatic utterance completed daylights perplexity  dont you see she hurried on  i could have far easier married the elam harnish fresh from klondike when i first laid eyes on him long ago than marry you sitting before me now  he shook his head slowly  thats one too many for me  the more you know and like a man the less you want to marry him familiarity breeds contempti guess thats what you mean  no no she cried but before she could continue a knock came on the door  the ten minutes is up daylight said  his eyes quick with observation like an indians darted about the room while she was out  the impression of warmth and comfort and beauty predominated though he was unable to analyze it while the simplicity delighted himexpensive simplicity he decided and most of it leftovers from the time her father went broke and died  he had never before appreciated a plain hardwood floor with a couple of wolfskins it sure beat all the carpets in creation  he stared solemnly at a bookcase containing a couple of hundred books  there was mystery  he could not understand what people found so much to write about  writing things and reading things were not the same as doing things and himself primarily a man of action doing things was alone comprehensible  his gaze passed on from the crouched venus to a little teatable with all its fragile and exquisite accessories and to a shining copper kettle and copper chafingdish  chafing dishes were not unknown to him and he wondered if she concocted suppers on this one for some of those university young men he had heard whispers about  one or two watercolors on the wall made him conjecture that she had painted them herself  there were photographs of horses and of old masters and the trailing purple of a burial of christ held him for a time  but ever his gaze returned to that crouched venus on the piano  to his homely frontiertrained mind it seemed curious that a nice young woman should have such a bold if not sinful object on display in her own room but he reconciled himself to it by an act of faith  since it was dede it must be eminently all right  evidently such things went along with culture  larry hegan had similar casts and photographs in his bookcluttered quarters  but then larry hegan was different  there was that hint of unhealth about him that daylight invariably sensed in his presence while dede on the contrary seemed always so robustly wholesome radiating an atmosphere compounded of the sun and wind and dust of the open road  and yet if such a clean healthy woman as she went in for naked women crouching on her piano it must be all right dede made it all right  she could come pretty close to making anything all right  besides he didnt understand culture anyway  she reentered the room and as she crossed it to her chair he admired the way she walked while the bronze slippers were maddening  id like to ask you several questions he began immediately are you thinking of marrying somebody  she laughed merrily and shook her head  do you like anybody else more than you like methat man at the phone just now for instance  there isnt anybody else  i dont know anybody i like well enough to marry  for that matter i dont think i am a marrying woman  office work seems to spoil one for that  daylight ran his eyes over her from her face to the tip of a bronze slipper in a way that made the color mantle in her cheeks  at the same time he shook his head sceptically  it strikes me that youre the most marryingest woman that ever made a man sit up and take notice  and now another question you see ive just got to locate the lay of the land  is there anybody you like as much as you like me  but dede had herself well in hand  thats unfair she said  and if you stop and consider you will find that you are doing the very thing you disclaimednamely nagging i refuse to answer any more of your questions  let us talk about other things how is bob  half an hour later whirling along through the rain on telegraph avenue toward oakland daylight smoked one of his brownpaper cigarettes and reviewed what had taken place  it was not at all bad was his summing up though there was much about it that was baffling  there was that liking him the more she knew him and at the same time wanting to marry him less  that was a puzzler  but the fact that she had refused him carried with it a certain elation  in refusing him she had refused his thirty million dollars that was going some for a ninety dollaramonth stenographer who had known better ties  she wasnt after money that was patent  every woman he had encountered had seemed willing to swallow him down for the sake of his money  why he had doubled his fortune made fifteen millions since the day she first came to work for him and behold any willingness to marry him she might have possessed had diminished as his money had increased  gosh he muttered  if i clean up a hundred million on this land deal she wont even be on speaking terms with me  but he could not smile the thing away  it remained to baffle him that enigmatic statement of hers that she could more easily have married the elam harnish fresh from the klondike than the present elam harnish well he concluded the thing to do was for him to become more like that oldtime daylight who had come down out of the north to try his luck at the bigger game  but that was impossible  he could not set back the flight of time wishing wouldnt do it and there was no other way  he might as well wish himself a boy again  another satisfaction he cuddled to himself from their interview he had heard of stenographers before who refused their employers and who invariably quit their positions immediately afterward  but dede had not even hinted at such a thing  no matter how baffling she was there was no nonsensical silliness about her  she was level headed  but also he had been levelheaded and was partly responsible for this  he hadnt taken advantage of her in the office  true he had twice overstepped the bounds but he had not followed it up and made a practice of it  she knew she could trust him  but in spite of all this he was confident that most young women would have been silly enough to resign a position with a man they had turned down  and besides after he had put it to her in the right light she had not been silly over his sending her brother to germany  gee he concluded as the car drew up before his hotel  if id only known it as i do now id have popped the question the first day she came to work  according to her sayso that would have been the proper moment  she likes me more and more and the more she likes me the less shed care to marry me  now what do you think of that  she sure must be fooling    chapter xix  once again on a rainy sunday weeks afterward daylight proposed to dede  as on the first time he restrained himself until his hunger for her overwhelmed him and swept him away in his red automobile to berkeley  he left the machine several blocks away and proceeded to the house on foot  but dede was out the landladys daughter told him and added on second thought that she was out walking in the hills furthermore the young lady directed him where dedes walk was most likely to extend  daylight obeyed the girls instructions and soon the street he followed passed the last house and itself ceased where began the first steep slopes of the open hills  the air was damp with the oncoming of rain for the storm had not yet burst though the rising wind proclaimed its imminence  as far as he could see there was no sign of dede on the smooth grassy hills  to the right dipping down into a hollow and rising again was a large fullgrown eucalyptus grove here all was noise and movement the lofty slender trunked trees swaying back and forth in the wind and clashing their branches together  in the squalls above all the minor noises of creaking and groaning arose a deep thrumming note as of a mighty harp  knowing dede as he did daylight was confident that he would find her somewhere in this grove where the storm effects were so pronounced  and find her he did across the hollow and on the exposed crest of the opposing slope where the gale smote its fiercest blows  there was something monotonous though not tiresome about the way daylight proposed  guiltless of diplomacy subterfuge he was as direct and gusty as the gale itself  he had time neither for greeting nor apology  its the same old thing he said  i want you and ive come for you youve just got to have me dede for the more i think about it the more certain i am that youve got a sneaking liking for me thats something more than just ordinary liking  and you dont dast say that it isnt now dast you  he had shaken hands with her at the moment he began speaking and he had continued to hold her hand  now when she did not answer she felt a light but firmly insistent pressure as of his drawing her to him involuntarily she halfyielded to him her desire for the moment stronger than her will  then suddenly she drew herself away though permitting her hand still to remain in his  you sure aint afraid of me he asked with quick compunction  no  she smiled woefully  not of you but of myself  you havent taken my dare he urged under this encouragement  please please she begged  we can never marry so dont let us discuss it  then i copper your bet to lose  he was almost gay now for success was coming faster than his fondest imagining  she liked him without a doubt and without a doubt she liked him well enough to let him hold her hand well enough to be not repelled by the nearness of him  she shook her head  no it is impossible  you would lose your bet  for the first time a dark suspicion crossed daylights minda clew that explained everything  say you aint been let in for some one of these secret marriages have you  the consternation in his voice and on his face was too much for her and her laugh rang out merry and spontaneous as a burst of joy from the throat of a bird  daylight knew his answer and vexed with himself decided that action was more efficient than speech  so he stepped between her and the wind and drew her so that she stood close in the shelter of him  an unusually stiff squall blew about them and thrummed overhead in the treetops and both paused to listen  a shower of flying leaves enveloped them and hard on the heel of the wind came driving drops of rain  he looked down on her and on her hair windblown about her face and because of her closeness to him and of a fresher and more poignant realization of what she meant to him he trembled so that she was aware of it in the hand that held hers  she suddenly leaned against him bowing her head until it rested lightly upon his breast  and so they stood while another squall with flying leaves and scattered drops of rain rattled past with equal suddenness she lifted her head and looked at him  do you know she said i prayed last night about you  i prayed that you would fail that you would lose everything everything  daylight stared his amazement at this cryptic utterance  that sure beats me  i always said i got out of my depth with women and youve got me out of my depth now  why you want me to lose everything seeing as you like me  i never said so  you didnt dast say you didnt  so as i was saying liking me why youd want me to go broke is clean beyond my simple understanding its right in line with that other puzzler of yours the moreyoulikemethelessyouwanttomarryme one well youve just got to explain thats all  his arms went around her and held her closely and this time she did not resist  her head was bowed and he had not see her face yet he had a premonition that she was crying  he had learned the virtue of silence and he waited her will in the matter  things had come to such a pass that she was bound to tell him something now  of that he was confident  i am not romantic she began again looking at him as he spoke  it might be better for me if i were  then i could make a fool of myself and be unhappy for the rest of my life  but my abominable common sense prevents  and that doesnt make me a bit happier either  im still out of my depth and swimming feeble daylight said after waiting vainly for her to go on  youve got to show me and you aint shown me yet  your common sense and praying that id go broke is all up in the air to me  little woman i just love you mighty hard and i want you to marry me  thats straight and simple and right off the bat  will you marry me  she shook her head slowly and then as she talked seemed to grow angry sadly angry and daylight knew that this anger was against him  then let me explain and just as straight and simply as you have asked  she paused as if casting about for a beginning  you are honest and straightforward  do you want me to be honest and straightforward as a woman is not supposed to beto tell you things that will hurt youto make confessions that ought to shame me  to behave in what many men would think was an unwomanly manner  the arm around her shoulder pressed encouragement but he did not speak  i would dearly like to marry you but i am afraid  i am proud and humble at the same time that a man like you should care for me  but you have too much money  theres where my abominable common sense steps in  even if we did marry you could never be my manmy lover and my husband  you would be your moneys man i know i am a foolish woman but i want my man for myself  you would not be free for me your money possesses you taking your time your thoughts your energy everything bidding you go here and go there do this and do that dont you see  perhaps its pure silliness but i feel that i can love much give muchgive all and in return though i dont want all i want muchand i want much more than your money would permit you to give me  and your money destroys you it makes you less and less nice i am not ashamed to say that i love you because i shall never marry you  and i loved you much when i did not know you at all when you first came down from alaska and i first went into the office  you were my hero  you were the burning daylight of the golddiggings the daring traveler and miner  and you looked it i dont see how any woman could have looked at you without loving youthen  but you dont look it now  please please forgive me for hurting you  you wanted straight talk and i am giving it to you  all these last years you have been living unnaturally  you a man of the open have been cooping yourself up in the cities with all that that means  you are not the same man at all and your money is destroying you you are becoming something different something not so healthy not so clean not so nice  your money and your way of life are doing it  you know it  you havent the same body now that you had then  you are putting on flesh and it is not healthy flesh you are kind and genial with me i know but you are not kind and genial to all the world as you were then  you have become harsh and cruel  and i know  remember i have studied you six days a week month after month year after year and i know more about the most insignificant parts of you than you know of all of me the cruelty is not only in your heart and thoughts but it is there in face  it has put its lines there  i have watched them come and grow  your money and the life it compels you to lead have done all this  you are being brutalized and degraded  and this process can only go on and on until you are hopelessly destroyed  he attempted to interrupt but she stopped him herself breathless and her voice trembling  no no let me finish utterly  i have done nothing but think think think all these months ever since you came riding with me and now that i have begun to speak i am going to speak all that i have in me i do love you but i cannot marry you and destroy love  you are growing into a thing that i must in the end despise  you cant help it  more than you can possibly love me do you love this business game  this businessand its all perfectly useless so far as you are concernedclaims all of you  i sometimes think it would be easier to share you equitably with another woman than to share you with this business  i might have half of you at any rate  but this business would claim not half of you but ninetenths of you or ninetynine hundredths  remember the meaning of marriage to me is not to get a mans money to spend  i want the man  you say you want me  and suppose i consented but gave you only onehundredth part of me suppose there was something else in my life that took the other ninetynine parts and furthermore that ruined my figure that put pouches under my eyes and crowsfeet in the corners that made me unbeautiful to look upon and that made my spirit unbeautiful  would you be satisfied with that onehundredth part of me  yet that is all you are offering me of yourself  do you wonder that i wont marry youthat i cant  daylight waited to see if she were quite done and she went on again  it isnt that i am selfish  after all love is giving not receiving but i see so clearly that all my giving could not do you any good  you are like a sick man  you dont play business like other men  you play it heart and and all of you  no matter what you believed and intended a wife would be only a brief diversion  there is that magnificent bob eating his head off in the stable  you would buy me a beautiful mansion and leave me in it to yawn my head off or cry my eyes out because of my helplessness and inability to save you  this disease of business would be corroding you and marring you all the time  you play it as you have played everything else as in alaska you played the life of the trail  nobody could be permitted to travel as fast and as far as you to work as hard or endure as much  you hold back nothing you put all youve got into whatever you are doing  limit is the sky he grunted grim affirmation  but if you would only play the loverhusband that way  her voice faltered and stopped and a blush showed in her wet cheeks as her eyes fell before his  and now i wont say another word she added ive delivered a whole sermon  she rested now frankly and fairly in the shelter of his arms and both were oblivious to the gale that rushed past them in quicker and stronger blasts  the big downpour of rain had not yet come but the mistlike squalls were more frequent  daylight was openly perplexed and he was still perplexed when he began to speak  im stumped  im up a tree  im clean flabbergasted miss masonor dede because i love to call you that name  im free to confess theres a mighty big heap in what you say  as i understand it your conclusion is that youd marry me if i hadnt a cent and if i wasnt getting fat  no no im not joking  i acknowledge the corn and thats just my way of boiling the matter down and summing it up  if i hadnt a cent and if i was living a healthy life with all the time in the world to love you and be your husband instead of being awash to my back teeth in business and all the restwhy youd marry me  thats all as clear as print and youre correcter than i ever guessed before  youve sure opened my eyes a few  but im stuck  what can i do  my business has sure roped thrown and branded me  im tied hand and foot and i cant get up and meander over green pastures  im like the man that got the bear by the tail  i cant let go and i want you and ive got to let go to get you  i dont know what to do but somethings sure got to happeni cant lose you  i just cant  and im not going to  why youre running business a close second right now  business never kept me awake nights  youve left me no argument  i know im not the same man that came from alaska  i couldnt hit the trail with the dogs as i did in them days  im soft in my muscles and my minds gone hard  i used to respect men  i despise them now  you see i spent all my life in the open and i reckon im an openair man why ive got the prettiest little ranch you ever laid eyes on up in glen ellen  thats where i got stuck for that brickyard you recollect handling the correspondence  i only laid eyes on the ranch that one time and i so fell in love with it that i bought it there and then  i just rode around the hills and was happy as a kid out of school  id be a better man living in the country  the city doesnt make me better youre plumb right there  i know it  but suppose your prayer should be answered and id go clean broke and have to work for days wages  she did not answer though all the body of her seemed to urge consent  suppose i had nothing left but that little ranch and was satisfied to grow a few chickens and scratch a living somehowwould you marry me then dede  why wed be together all the time she cried  but id have to be out ploughing once in a while he warned or driving to town to get the grub  but there wouldnt be the office at any rate and no man to see and men to see without end  but it is all foolish and impossible and well have to be starting back now if were to escape the rain  then was the moment among the trees where they began the descent of the hill that daylight might have drawn her closely to him and kissed her once  but he was too perplexed with the new thoughts she had put into his head to take advantage of the situation  he merely caught her by the arm and helped her over the rougher footing  its darn pretty country up there at glen ellen he said meditatively  i wish you could see it  at the edge of the grove he suggested that it might be better for them to part there  its your neighborhood and folks is liable to talk  but she insisted that he accompany her as far as the house  i cant ask you in she said extending her hand at the foot of the steps  the wind was humming wildly in sharply recurrent gusts but still the rain held off  do you know he said taking it by and large its the happiest day of my life  he took off his hat and the wind rippled and twisted his black hair as he went on solemnly and im sure grateful to god or whoever or whatever is responsible for your being on this earth  for you do like me heaps  its been my joy to hear you say so today its he left the thought arrested and his face assumed the familiar whimsical expression as he murmured dede dede weve just got to get married  its the only way and trust to luck for its coming out all right  but the tears were threatening to rise in her eyes again as she shook her head and turned and went up the steps    chapter xx  when the ferry system began to run and the time between oakland and san francisco was demonstrated to be cut in half the tide of daylights terrific expenditure started to turn  not that it really did turn for he promptly went into further investments thousands of lots in his residence tracts were sold and thousands of homes were being built  factory sites also were selling and business properties in the heart of oakland  all this tended to a steady appreciation in value of daylights huge holdings  but as of old he had his hunch and was riding it already he had begun borrowing from the banks  the magnificent profits he made on the land he sold were turned into more land into more development and instead of paying off old loans he contracted new ones  as he had pyramided in dawson city he now pyramided in oakland but he did it with the knowledge that it was a stable enterprise rather than a risky placermining boom  in a small way other men were following his lead buying and selling land and profiting by the improvement work he was doing but this was to be expected and the small fortunes they were making at his expense did not irritate him  there was an exception however  one simon dolliver with money to go in with and with cunning and courage to back it up bade fair to become a several times millionaire at daylights expense dolliver too pyramided playing quickly and accurately and keeping his money turning over and over  more than once daylight found him in the way as he himself had got in the way of the guggenhammers when they first set their eyes on ophir creek  work on daylights dock system went on apace yet was one of those enterprises that consumed money dreadfully and that could not be accomplished as quickly as a ferry system  the engineering difficulties were great the dredging and filling a cyclopean task the mere item of piling was anything but small a good average pile by the time it was delivered on the ground cost a twentydollar gold piece and these piles were used in unending thousands  all accessible groves of mature eucalyptus were used and as well great rafts of pine piles were towed down the coast from peugeot sound  not content with manufacturing the electricity for his street railways in the oldfashioned way in powerhouses daylight organized the sierra and salvador power company  this immediately assumed large proportions  crossing the san joaquin valley on the way from the mountains and plunging through the contra costa hills there were many towns and even a robust city that could be supplied with power also with light and it became a street and houselighting project as well as soon as the purchase of power sites in the sierras was rushed through the survey parties were out and building operations begun  and so it went  there were a thousand maws into which he poured unceasing streams of money  but it was all so sound and legitimate that daylight born gambler that he was and with his clear wide vision could not play softly and safely  it was a big opportunity and to him there was only one way to play it and that was the big way nor did his one confidential adviser larry hegan aid him to caution on the contrary it was daylight who was compelled to veto the wilder visions of that able hasheesh dreamer  not only did daylight borrow heavily from the banks and trust companies but on several of his corporations he was compelled to issue stock  he did this grudgingly however and retained most of his big enterprises of his own  among the companies in which he reluctantly allowed the investing public to join were the golden gate dock company and recreation parks company the united water company the uncial shipbuilding company and the sierra and salvador power company nevertheless between himself and hegan he retained the controlling share in each of these enterprises  his affair with dede mason only seemed to languish  while delaying to grapple with the strange problem it presented his desire for her continued to grow  in his gambling simile his conclusion was that luck had dealt him the most remarkable card in the deck and that for years he had overlooked it  love was the card and it beat them all love was the king card of trumps the fifth ace the joker in a game of tenderfoot poker it was the card of cards and play it he would to the limit when the opening came  he could not see that opening yet the present game would have to play to some sort of a conclusion first  yet he could not shake from his brain and vision the warm recollection of those bronze slippers that clinging gown and all the feminine softness and pliancy of dede in her pretty berkeley rooms  once again on a rainy sunday he telephoned that he was coming  and as has happened ever since man first looked upon woman and called her good again he played the blind force of male compulsion against the womans secret weakness to yield  not that it was daylights way abjectly to beg and entreat  on the contrary he was masterful in whatever he did but he had a trick of whimsical wheedling that dede found harder to resist than the pleas of a suppliant lover  it was not a happy scene in its outcome for dede in the throes of her own desire desperate with weakness and at the same time with her better judgment hating her weakness cried out  you urge me to try a chance to marry you now and trust to luck for it to come out right  and life is a gamble say  very well let us gamble  take a coin and toss it in the air  if it comes heads ill marry you  if it doesnt you are forever to leave me alone and never mention marriage again  a fire of mingled love and the passion of gambling came into daylights eyes  involuntarily his hand started for his pocket for the coin then it stopped and the light in his eyes was troubled  go on she ordered sharply  dont delay or i may change my mind and you will lose the chance  little woman  his similes were humorous but there was no humor in their meaning  his thought was as solemn as his voice little woman id gamble all the way from creation to the day of judgment id gamble a golden harp against another mans halo id toss for pennies on the front steps of the new jerusalem or set up a faro layout just outside the pearly gates but ill be everlastingly damned if ill gamble on love  loves too big to me to take a chance on  loves got to be a sure thing and between you and me it is a sure thing  if the odds was a hundred to one on my winning this flip just the same nary a flip  in the spring of the year the great panic came on  the first warning was when the banks began calling in their unprotected loans  daylight promptly paid the first several of his personal notes that were presented then he divined that these demands but indicated the way the wind was going to blow and that one of those terrific financial storms he had heard about was soon to sweep over the united states  how terrific this particular storm was to be he did not anticipate nevertheless he took every precaution in his power and had no anxiety about his weathering it out  money grew tighter  beginning with the crash of several of the greatest eastern banking houses the tightness spread until every bank in the country was calling in its credits  daylight was caught and caught because of the fact that for the first time he had been playing the legitimate business game  in the old days such a panic with the accompanying extreme shrinkage of values would have been a golden harvest time for him  as it was he watched the gamblers who had ridden the wave of prosperity and made preparation for the slump getting out from under and safely scurrying to cover or proceeding to reap a double harvest  nothing remained for him but to stand fast and hold up  he saw the situation clearly  when the banks demanded that he pay his loans he knew that the banks were in sore need of the money  but he was in sorer need  and he knew that the banks did not want his collateral which they held  it would do them no good  in such a tumbling of values was no time to sell  his collateral was good all of it eminently sound and worth while yet it was worthless at such a moment when the one unceasing cry was money money money  finding him obdurate the banks demanded more collateral and as the money pinch tightened they asked for two and even three times as much as had been originally accepted  sometimes daylight yielded to these demands but more often not and always battling fiercely  he fought as with clay behind a crumbling wall  all portions of the wall were menaced and he went around constantly strengthening the weakest parts with clay  this clay was money and was applied a sop here and a sop there as fast as it was needed but only when it was directly needed  the strength of his position lay in the yerba buena ferry company the consolidated street railways and the united water company though people were no longer buying residence lots and factory and business sites they were compelled to ride on his cars and ferryboats and to consume his water  when all the financial world was clamoring for money and perishing through lack of it the first of each month many thousands of dollars poured into his coffers from the waterrates and each day ten thousand dollars in dime and nickels came in from his street railways and ferries  cash was what was wanted and had he had the use of all this steady river of cash all would have been well with him  as it was he had to fight continually for a portion of it improvement work ceased and only absolutely essential repairs were made  his fiercest fight was with the operating expenses and this was a fight that never ended there was never any letup in his turning the thumbscrews of extended credit and economy  from the big wholesale suppliers down through the salary list to office stationery and postage stamps he kept the thumbscrews turning  when his superintendents and heads of departments performed prodigies of cutting down he patted them on the back and demanded more  when they threw down their hands in despair he showed them how more could be accomplished  you are getting eight thousand dollars a year he told matthewson its better pay than you ever got in your life before  your fortune is in the same sack with mine  youve got to stand for some of the strain and risk  youve got personal credit in this town  use it stand off butcher and baker and all the rest  savvee  youre drawing down something like six hundred and sixty dollars a month  i want that cash  from now on stand everybody off and draw down a hundred  ill pay you interest on the rest till this blows over  two weeks later with the payroll before them it was  matthewson whos this bookkeeper rogers  your nephew  i thought so  hes pulling down eightyfive a month  afterthis let him draw thirtyfive  the forty can ride with me at interest  impossible matthewson cried  he cant make ends meet on his salary as it is and he has a wife and two kids  daylight was upon him with a mighty oath  cant impossible  what in hell do you think im running  a home for feebleminded  feeding and dressing and wiping the little noses of a lot of idiots that cant take care of themselves  not on your life im hustling and nows the time that everybody that works for me has got to hustle  i want no fairweather birds holding down my office chairs or anything else  this is nasty weather damn nasty weather and theyve got to buck into it just like me  there are ten thousand men out of work in oakland right now and sixty thousand more in san francisco  your nephew and everybody else on your payroll can do as i say right now or quit  savvee  if any of them get stuck you go around yourself and guarantee their credit with the butchers and grocers  and you trim down that payroll accordingly  ive been carrying a few thousand folks thatll have to carry themselves for a while now thats all  you say this filters got to be replaced he told his chief of the waterworks  well see about it  let the people of oakland drink mud for a change  itll teach them to appreciate good water  stop work at once  get those men off the payroll cancel all orders for material the contractors will sue  let em sue and be damned  well be busted highern a kite or on easy street before they can get judgment  and to wilkinson  take off that owl boat  let the public roar and come home early to its wife  and theres that last car that connects with the 1245 boat at twentysecond and hastings  cut it out  i cant run it for two or three passengers  let them take an earlier boat home or walk  this is no time for philanthropy  and you might as well take off a few more cars in the rush hours  let the straphangers pay  its the straphangers thatll keep us from going under  and to another chief who broke down under the excessive strain of retrenchment  you say i cant do that and cant do this  ill just show you a few of the latest patterns in the canandcant line  youll be compelled to resign  all right if you think so i never saw the man yet that i was hard up for  and when any man thinks i cant get along without him i just show him the latest pattern in that line of goods and give him his walkingpapers  and so he fought and drove and bullied and even wheedled his way along it was fight fight fight and no letup from the first thing in the morning till nightfall  his private office saw throngs every day  all men came to see him or were ordered to come  now it was an optimistic opinion on the panic a funny story a serious business talk or a straight takeitorleaveit blow from the shoulder  and there was nobody to relieve him  it was a case of drive drive drive and he alone could do the driving  and this went on day after day while the whole business world rocked around him and house after house crashed to the ground  its all right old man he told hegan every morning and it was the same cheerful word that he passed out all day long except at such times when he was in the thick of fighting to have his will with persons and things  eight oclock saw him at his desk each morning  by ten oclock it was into the machine and away for a round of the banks  and usually in the machine with him was the ten thousand and more dollars that had been earned by his ferries and railways the day before  this was for the weakest spot in the financial dike and with one bank president after another similar scenes were enacted  they were paralyzed with fear and first of all he played his role of the big vital optimist  times were improving  of course they were  the signs were already in the air  all that anybody had to do was to sit tight a little longer and hold on  that was all  money was already more active in the east look at the trading on wall street of the last twentyfour hours  that was the straw that showed the wind  hadnt ryan said so and so and wasnt it reported that morgan was preparing to do this and that  as for himself werent the streetrailway earnings increasing steadily  in spite of the panic more and more people were coming to oakland right along  movements were already beginning in real estate he was dickering even then to sell over a thousand of his suburban acres  of course it was at a sacrifice but it would ease the strain on all of them and bolster up the fainthearted  that was the troublethe fainthearts  had there been no fainthearts there would have been no panic  there was that eastern syndicate negotiating with him now to take the majority of the stock in the sierra and salvador power company off his hands  that showed confidence that better times were at hand  and if it was not cheery discourse but prayer and entreaty or show down and fight on the part of the banks daylight had to counter in kind  if they could bully he could bully  if the favor he asked were refused it became the thing he demanded and when it came down to raw and naked fighting with the last veil of sentiment or illusion torn off he could take their breaths away  but he knew also how and when to give in  when he saw the wall shaking and crumbling irretrievably at a particular place he patched it up with sops of cash from his three cashearning companies  if the banks went he went too  it was a case of their having to hold out if they smashed and all the collateral they held of his was thrown on the chaotic market it would be the end  and so it was as the time passed that on occasion his red motorcar carried in addition to the daily cash the most giltedged securities he possessed namely the ferry company united water and consolidated railways  but he did this reluctantly fighting inch by inch  as he told the president of the merchants san antonio who made the plea of carrying so many others  theyre small fry  let them smash  im the king pin here youve got more money to make out of me than them  of course youre carrying too much and youve got to choose thats all its root hog or die for you or them  im too strong to smash you could only embarrass me and get yourself tangled up  your way out is to let the small fry go and ill lend you a hand to do it  and it was daylight also in this time of financial anarchy who sized up simon dollivers affairs and lent the hand that sent that rival down in utter failure  the golden gate national was the keystone of dollivers strength and to the president of that institution daylight said  here ive been lending you a hand and you now in the last ditch with dolliver riding on you and me all the time  it dont go  you hear me it dont go  dolliver couldnt cough up eleven dollars to save you let him get off and walk and ill tell you what ill do  ill give you the railway nickels for four daysthats forty thousand cash  and on the sixth of the month you can count on twenty thousand more from the water company he shrugged his shoulders  take it or leave it thems my terms  its dog eat dog and i aint overlooking any meat thats floating around daylight proclaimed that afternoon to hegan and simon dolliver went the way of the unfortunate in the great panic who were caught with plenty of paper and no money  daylights shifts and devices were amazing  nothing however large or small passed his keen sight unobserved the strain he was under was terrific  he no longer ate lunch  the days were too short and his noon hours and his office were as crowded as at any other time  by the end of the day he was exhausted and as never before he sought relief behind his wall of alcoholic inhibition  straight to his hotel he was driven and straight to his rooms he went where immediately was mixed for him the first of a series of double martinis  by dinner his brain was well clouded and the panic forgotten  by bedtime with the assistance of scotch whiskey he was fullnot violently nor uproariously full nor stupefied but merely well under the influence of a pleasant and mild anesthetic  next morning he awoke with parched lips and mouth and with sensations of heaviness in his head which quickly passed away by eight oclock he was at his desk buckled down to the fight by ten oclock on his personal round of the banks and after that without a moments cessation till nightfall he was handling the knotty tangles of industry finance and human nature that crowded upon him  and with nightfall it was back to the hotel the double martinis and the scotch and this was his program day after day until the days ran into weeks    chapter xxi  though daylight appeared among his fellows hearty voiced inexhaustible spilling over with energy and vitality deep down he was a very weary man  and sometime under the liquor drug snatches of wisdom came to him far more lucidity than in his sober moments as for instance one night when he sat on the edge of the bed with one shoe in his hand and meditated on dedes aphorism to the effect that he could not sleep in more than one bed at a time  still holding the shoe he looked at the array of horsehair bridles on the walls  then carrying the shoe he got up and solemnly counted them journeying into the two adjoining rooms to complete the tale  then he came back to the bed and gravely addressed his shoe  the little womans right  only one bed at a time  one hundred and forty hair bridles and nothing doing with ary one of them one bridle at a time  i cant ride one horse at a time  poor old bob  id better be sending you out to pasture  thirty million dollars and a hundred million or nothing in sight and what have i got to show for it  theres lots of things money cant buy  it cant buy the little woman  it cant buy capacity  whats the good of thirty millions when i aint got room for more than a quart of cocktails a day  if i had a hundredquartcocktail thirst itd be different  but one quartone measly little quart  here i am a thirty times over millionaire slaving harder every day than any dozen men that work for me and all i get is two meals that dont taste good one bed a quart of martini and a hundred and forty hair bridles to look at on the wall  he stared around at the array disconsolately  mr shoe im sizzled good night  far worse than the controlled steady drinker is the solitary drinker and it was this that daylight was developing into  he rarely drank sociably any more but in his own room by himself returning weary from each days unremitting effort he drugged himself to sleep knowing that on the morrow he would rise up with a dry and burning mouth and repeat the program  but the country did not recover with its wonted elasticity money did not become freer though the casual reader of daylights newspapers as well as of all the other owned and subsidised newspapers in the country could only have concluded that the money tightness was over and that the panic was past history  all public utterances were cheery and optimistic but privately many of the utters were in desperate straits  the scenes enacted in the privacy of daylights office and of the meetings of his boards of directors would have given the lie to the editorials in his newspapers as for instance when he addressed the big stockholders in the sierra and salvador power company the united water company and the several other stock companies  youve got to dig  youve got a good thing but youll have to sacrifice in order to hold on  there aint no use spouting hard times explanations  dont i know the hard times is on  aint that what youre here for  as i said before youve got to dig i run the majority stock and its come to a case of assess its that or smash if ever i start going you wont know what struck you ill smash that hard  the small fry can let go but you big ones cant  this ship wont sink as long as you stay with her  but if you start to leave her down youll sure go before you can get to shore  this assessment has got to be met thats all  the big wholesale supply houses the caterers for his hotels and all the crowd that incessantly demanded to be paid had their hot halfhours with him  he summoned them to his office and displayed his latest patterns of can and cant and will and wont  by god youve got to carry me he told them  if you think this is a pleasant little game of parlor whist and that you can quit and go home whenever you want youre plumb wrong  look here watkins you remarked five minutes ago that you wouldnt stand for it  now let me tell you a few  youre going to stand for it and keep on standins for it  youre going to continue supplying me and taking my paper until the pinch is over  how youre going to do it is your trouble not mine  you remember what i did to klinkner and the altamont trust company  i know the inside of your business better than you do yourself and if you try to drop me ill smash you  even if id be going to smash myself id find a minute to turn on you and bring you down with me  its sink or swim for all of us and i reckon youll find it to your interest to keep me on top the puddle  perhaps his bitterest fight was with the stockholders of the united water company for it was practically the whole of the gross earnings of this company that he voted to lend to himself and used to bolster up his wide battle front  yet he never pushed his arbitrary rule too far compelling sacrifice from the men whose fortunes were tied up with his nevertheless when any one of them was driven to the wall and was in dire need daylight was there to help him back into the line  only a strong man could have saved so complicated a situation in such time of stress and daylight was that man  he turned and twisted schemed and devised bludgeoned and bullied the weaker ones kept the fainthearted in the fight and had no mercy on the deserter  and in the end when early summer was on everything began to mend came a day when daylight did the unprecedented  he left the office an hour earlier than usual and for the reason that for the first time since the panic there was not an item of work waiting to be done  he dropped into hegans private office before leaving for a chat and as he stood up to go he said  hegan were all hunkadory  were pulling out of the financial pawnshop in fine shape and well get out without leaving one unredeemed pledge behind  the worst is over and the end is in sight just a tight rein for a couple more weeks just a bit of a pinch or a flurry or so now and then and we can let go and spit on our hands  for once he varied his program  instead of going directly to his hotel he started on a round of the bars and cafes drinking a cocktail here and a cocktail there and two or three when he encountered men he knew  it was after an hour or so of this that he dropped into the bar of the parthenon for one last drink before going to dinner  by this time all his being was pleasantly warmed by the alcohol and he was in the most genial and best of spirits  at the corner of the bar several young men were up to the old trick of resting their elbows and attempting to force each others hands down  one broadshouldered young giant never removed his elbow but put down every hand that came against him  daylight was interested  its slosson the barkeeper told him in answer to his query hes the heavyhammer thrower at the uc  broke all records this year and the worlds record on top of it  hes a husky all right all right  daylight nodded and went over to him placing his own arm in opposition  id like to go you a flutter son on that proposition he said  the young man laughed and locked hands with him and to daylights astonishment it was his own hand that was forced down on the bar  hold on he muttered  just one more flutter  i reckon i wasnt just ready that time  again the hands locked  it happened quickly  the offensive attack of daylights muscles slipped instantly into defense and resisting vainly his hand was forced over and down  daylight was dazed  it had been no trick  the skill was equal or if anything the superior skill had been his  strength sheer strength had done it  he called for the drinks and still dazed and pondering held up his own arm and looked at it as at some new strange thing  he did not know this arm  it certainly was not the arm he had carried around with him all the years the old arm  why it would have been play to turn down that young huskys  but this armhe continued to look at it with such dubious perplexity as to bring a roar of laughter from the young men  this laughter aroused him  he joined in it at first and then his face slowly grew grave  he leaned toward the hammerthrower  son he said let me whisper a secret  get out of here and quit drinking before you begin  the young fellow flushed angrily but daylight held steadily on  you listen to your dad and let him say a few  im a young man myself only i aint  let me tell you several years ago for me to turn your hand down would have been like committing assault and battery on a kindergarten  slosson looked his incredulity while the others grinned and clustered around daylight encouragingly  son i aint given to preaching  this is the first time i ever come to the penitent form and you put me there yourselfhard ive seen a few in my time and i aint fastidious so as you can notice it  but let me tell you right not that im worth the devil alone knows how many millions and that id sure give it all right here on the bar to turn down your hand  which means id give the whole shooting match just to be back where i was before i quit sleeping under the stars and come into the hencoops of cities to drink cocktails and lift up my feet and ride son thats thats the matter with me and thats the way i feel about it  the game aint worth the candle  you just take care of yourself and roll my advice over once in a while  good night  he turned and lurched out of the place the moral effect of his utterance largely spoiled by the fact that he was so patently full while he uttered it  still in a daze daylight made to his hotel accomplished his dinner and prepared for bed  the damned young whippersnapper he muttered  put my hand down easy as you please  my hand  he held up the offending member and regarded it with stupid wonder the hand that had never been beaten  the hand that had made the circle city giants wince  and a kid from college with a laugh on his face had put it downtwice  dede was right  he was not the same man  the situation would bear more serious looking into than he had ever given it  but this was not the time  in the morning after a good sleep he would give it consideration    chapter xxii  daylight awoke with the familiar parched mouth and lips and throat took a long drink of water from the pitcher beside his bed and gathered up the train of thought where he had left it the night before he reviewed the easement of the financial strain  things were mending at last  while the going was still rough the greatest dangers were already past  as he had told hegan a tight rein and careful playing were all that was needed now  flurries and dangers were bound to come but not so grave as the ones they had already weathered  he had been hit hard but he was coming through without broken bones which was more than simon dolliver and many another could say  and not one of his business friends had been ruined  he had compelled them to stay in line to save himself and they had been saved as well  his mind moved on to the incident at the corner of the bar of the parthenon when the young athlete had turned his hand down  he was no longer stunned by the event but he was shocked and grieved as only a strong man can be at this passing of his strength  and the issue was too clear for him to dodge even with himself  he knew why his hand had gone down  not because he was an old man  he was just in the first flush of his prime and by rights it was the hand of the hammerthrower which should have gone down  daylight knew that he had taken liberties with himself  he had always looked upon this strength of his as permanent and here for years it had been steadily oozing from him  as he had diagnosed it he had come in from under the stars to roost in the coops of cities  he had almost forgotten how to walk he had lifted up his feet and been ridden around in automobiles cabs and carriages and electric cars  he had not exercised and he had dryrotted his muscles with alcohol  and was it worth it  what did all his money mean after all dede was right  it could buy him no more than one bed at a time and at the same time it made him the abjectest of slaves  it tied him fast  he was tied by it right now  even if he so desired he could not lie abed this very day  his money called him  the office whistle would soon blow and he must answer it the early sunshine was streaming through his windowa fine day for a ride in the hills on bob with dede beside him on her mab yet all his millions could not buy him this one day one of those flurries might come along and he had to be on the spot to meet it  thirty millions  and they were powerless to persuade dede to ride on mabmab whom he had bought and who was unused and growing fat on pasture  what were thirty millions when they could not buy a man a ride with the girl he loved  thirty millionsthat made him come here and go there that rode upon him like so many millstones that destroyed him while they grew that put their foot down and prevented him from winning this girl who worked for ninety dollars a month  which was better  he asked himself  all this was dedes own thought it was what she had meant when she prayed he would go broke  he held up his offending right arm  it wasnt the same old arm  of course she could not love that arm and that body as she had loved the strong clean arm and body of years before  he didnt like that arm and body himself  a young whippersnapper had been able to take liberties with it  it had gone back on him  he sat up suddenly  no by god he had gone back on it he had gone back on himself  he had gone back on dede  she was right a thousand times right and she had sense enough to know it sense enough to refuse to marry a money slave with a whiskeyrotted carcass  he got out of bed and looked at himself in the long mirror on the wardrobe door  he wasnt pretty  the oldtime lean cheeks were gone these were heavy seeming to hang down by their own weight  he looked for the lines of cruelty dede had spoken of and he found them and he found the harshness in the eyes as well the eyes that were muddy now after all the cocktails of the night before and of the months and years before  he looked at the clearly defined pouches that showed under his eyes and theyve shocked him  he rolled up the sleeve of his pajamas  no wonder the hammerthrower had put his hand down those werent muscles  a rising tide of fat had submerged them  he stripped off the pajama coat  again he was shocked this time but the bulk of his body  it wasnt pretty  the lean stomach had become a paunch  the ridged muscles of chest and shoulders and abdomen had broken down into rolls of flesh  he sat down on the bed and through his mind drifted pictures of his youthful excellence of the hardships he had endured over other men of the indians and dogs he had run off their legs in the heartbreaking days and nights on the alaskan trail of the feats of strength that had made him king over a husky race of frontiersmen  and this was age  then there drifted across the field of vision of his minds eye the old man he had encountered at glen ellen corning up the hillside through the fires of sunset whiteheaded and whitebearded eightyfour in his hand the pail of foaming milk and in his face all the warm glow and content of the passing summer day  that had been age  yes siree eightyfour and spryer than most he could hear the old man say  and i aint loafed none i walked across the plains with an oxteam and fit injuns in 51 and i was a family man then with seven youngsters  next he remembered the old woman of the chaparral pressing grapes in her mountain clearing and ferguson the little man who had scuttled into the road like a rabbit the onetime managing editor of a great newspaper who was content to live in the chaparral along with his spring of mountain water and his handreared and manicured fruit trees ferguson had solved a problem  a weakling and an alcoholic he had run away from the doctors and the chickencoop of a city and soaked up health like a thirsty sponge  well daylight pondered if a sick man whom the doctors had given up could develop into a healthy farm laborer what couldnt a merely stout man like himself do under similar circumstances  he caught a vision of his body with all its youthful excellence returned and thought of dede and sat down suddenly on the bed startled by the greatness of the idea that had come to him  he did not sit long  his mind working in its customary way like a steel trap canvassed the idea in all its bearings  it was bigbigger than anything he had faced before  and he faced it squarely picked it up in his two hands and turned it over and around and looked at it the simplicity of it delighted him  he chuckled over it reached his decision and began to dress midway in the dressing he stopped in order to use the telephone  dede was the first he called up  dont come to the office this morning he said  im coming out to see you for a moment  he called up others  he ordered his motorcar to jones he gave instructions for the forwarding of bob and wolf to glen ellen  hegan he surprised by asking him to look up the deed of the glen ellen ranch and make out a new one in dede masons name who hegan demanded  dede mason daylight replied imperturbably the phone must be indistinct this morning  dede mas on  got it  half an hour later he was flying out to berkeley  and for the first time the big red car halted directly before the house dede offered to receive him in the parlor but he shook his head and nodded toward her rooms  in there he said  no other place would suit  as the door closed his arms went out and around her  then he stood with his hands on her shoulders and looking down into her face  dede if i tell you flat and straight that im going up to live on that ranch at glen ellen that i aint taking a cent with me that im going to scratch for every bite i eat and that i aint going to play ary a card at the business game again will you come along with me  she gave a glad little cry and he nestled her in closely  but the next moment she had thrust herself out from him to the old position at arms length  ii dont understand she said breathlessly  and you aint answered my proposition though i guess no answer is necessary  were just going to get married right away and start  ive sent bob and wolf along already  when will you be ready  dede could not forbear to smile  my what a hurricane of a man it is im quite blown away  and you havent explained a word to me  daylight smiled responsively  look here dede this is what cardsharps call a showdown  no more philandering and frills and longdistance sparring between you and me were just going to talk straight out in meetingthe truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth  now you answer some questions for me and then ill answer yours  he paused  well ive got only one question after all do you love me enough to marry me  but she began  no buts he broke in sharply  this is a showdown  when i say marry i mean what i told you at first that wed go up and live on the ranch  do you love me enough for that  she looked at him for a moment then her lids dropped and all of her seemed to advertise consent  come on then lets start  the muscles of his legs tensed involuntarily as if he were about to lead her to the door  my autos waiting outside  theres nothing to delay excepting getting on your hat  he bent over her i reckon its allowable he said as he kissed her  it was a long embrace and she was the first to speak  you havent answered my questions  how is this possible  how can you leave your business  has anything happened  no nothings happened yet but its going to blame quick ive taken your preaching to heart and ive come to the penitent form  you are my lord god and im sure going to serve you  the rest can go to thunder  you were sure right  ive been the slave to my money and since i cant serve two masters im letting the money slide  id sooner have you than all the money in the world thats all  again he held her closely in his arms  and ive sure got you dede  ive sure got you  and i want to tell you a few more  ive taken my last drink youre marrying a whiskeysoak but your husband wont be that hes going to grow into another man so quick you wont know him a couple of months from now up there in glen ellen youll wake up some morning and find youve got a perfect stranger in the house with you and youll have to get introduced to him all over again  youll say im mrs harnish who are you and ill say im elam harnishs younger brother  ive just arrived from alaska to attend the funeral what funeral youll say  and ill say why the funeral of that goodfornothing gambling whiskeydrinking burning daylightthe man that died of fatty degeneration of the heart from sitting in night and day at the business game yes maam ill say hes sure a gone coon but ive come to take his place and make you happy  and now maam if youll allow me ill just meander down to the pasture and milk the cow while youre getting breakfast  again he caught her hand and made as if to start with her for the door when she resisted he bent and kissed her again and again  im sure hungry for you little woman he murmured you make thirty millions look like thirty cents  do sit down and be sensible she urged her cheeks flushed the golden light in her eyes burning more golden than he had ever seen it before  but daylight was bent on having his way and when he sat down it was with her beside him and his arm around her  yes maam ill say burning daylight was a pretty good cuss but its better that hes gone  he quit rolling up in his rabbitskins and sleeping in the snow and went to living in a chickencoop  he lifted up his legs and quit walking and working and took to existing on martini cocktails and scotch whiskey  he thought he loved you maam and he did his best but he loved his cocktails more and he loved his money more and himself more and most everything else more than he did you and then ill say maam you just run your eyes over me and see how different i am  i aint got a cocktail thirst and all the money i got is a dollar and forty cents and ive got to buy a new ax the last one being plumb wore out and i can love you just about eleven times as much as your first husband did  you see maam he went all to fat  and there aint ary ounce of fat on me and ill roll up my sleeve and show you and say mrs harnish after having experience with being married to that old fat moneybags do youall mind marrying a slim young fellow like me and youll just wipe a tear away for poor old daylight and kind of lean toward me with a willing expression in your eye and then ill blush maybe some being a young fellow and put my arm around you like that and thenwhy then ill up and marry my brothers widow and go out and do the chores while shes cooking a bite to eat  but you havent answered my questions she reproached him as she emerged rosy and radiant from the embrace that had accompanied the culmination of his narrative  now just what do you want to know he asked  i want to know how all this is possible  how you are able to leave your business at a time like this  what you meant by saying that something was going to happen quickly  i she hesitated and blushed i answered your question you know  lets go and get married he urged all the whimsicality of his utterance duplicated in his eyes  you know ive got to make way for that husky young brother of mine and i aint got long to live  she made an impatient moue and he continued seriously  you see its like this dede  ive been working like forty horses ever since this blamed panic set in and all the time some of those ideas youd given me were getting ready to sprout well they sprouted this morning thats all  i started to get up expecting to go to the office as usual  but i didnt go to the office  all that sprouting took place there and then  the sun was shining in the window and i knew it was a fine day in the hills  and i knew i wanted to ride in the hills with you just about thirty million times more than i wanted to go to the office  and i knew all the time it was impossible  and why because of the office  the office wouldnt let me  all my money reared right up on its hind legs and got in the way and wouldnt let me  its a way that blamed money has of getting in the way you know that yourself  and then i made up my mind that i was to the dividing of the ways one way led to the office  the other way led to berkeley and i took the berkeley road  im never going to set foot in the office again thats all gone finished over and done with and im letting it slide clean to smash and then some  my minds set on this  you see ive got religion and its sure the oldtime religion its love and you and its older than the oldest religion in the world  its it thats what it isit with a capital it  she looked at him with a sudden startled expression  you mean she began  i mean just that  im wiping the slate clean  im letting it all go to smash  when them thirty million dollars stood up to my face and said i couldnt go out with you in the hills today i knew the time had come for me to put my foot down  and im putting it down  ive got you and my strength to work for you and that little ranch in sonoma  thats all i want and thats all im going to save out along with bob and wolf a suit case and a hundred and forty hair bridles all the rest goes and good riddance  its that much junk  but dede was insistent  then thisthis tremendous loss is all unnecessary she asked  just what i havent been telling you  it is necessary  if that money thinks it can stand up right to my face and say i cant go riding with you  no no be serious dede broke in  i dont mean that and you know it  what i want to know is from a standpoint of business is this failure necessary  he shook his head  you bet it isnt necessary  thats the point of it  im not letting go of it because im licked to a standstill by the panic and have got to let go  im firing it out when ive licked the panic and am winning hands down  that just shows how little i think of it  its you that counts little woman and i make my play accordingly  but she drew away from his sheltering arms  you are mad elam  call me that again he murmured ecstatically  its sure sweeter than the chink of millions  all this she ignored  its madness  you dont know what you are doing  oh yes i do he assured her  im winning the dearest wish of my heart  why your little finger is worth more  do be sensible for a moment  i was never more sensible in my lie  i know what i want and im going to get it  i want you and the open air  i want to get my foot off the pavingstones and my ear away from the telephone i want a little ranchhouse in one of the prettiest bits of country god ever made and i want to do the chores around that ranchhousemilk cows and chop wood and curry horses and plough the ground and all the rest of it and i want you there in the ranchhouse with me  im plumb tired of everything else and clean wore out  and im sure the luckiest man alive for ive got what money cant buy  ive got you and thirty millions couldnt buy you nor three thousand millions nor thirty cents  a knock at the door interrupted him and he was left to stare delightedly at the crouched venus and on around the room at dedes dainty possessions while she answered the telephone  it is mr hegan she said on returning  he is holding the line he says it is important  daylight shook his head and smiled  please tell mr hegan to hang up  im done with the office and i dont want to hear anything about anything  a minute later she was back again  he refuses to hang up  he told me to tell you that unwin is in the office now waiting to see you and harrison too  mr hegan said that grimshaw and hodgkins are in trouble  that it looks as if they are going to break  and he said something about protection  it was startling information  both unwin and harrison represented big banking corporations and daylight knew that if the house of grimshaw and hodgkins went it would precipitate a number of failures and start a flurry of serious dimensions  but daylight smiled and shook his head and mimicked the stereotyped office tone of voice as he said  miss mason you will kindly tell mr hegan that there is nothing doing and to hang up  but you cant do this she pleaded  watch me he grimly answered  elam  say it again he cried  say it again and a dozen grimshaws and hodgkins can smash  he caught her by the hand and drew her to him  you let hegan hang on to that line till hes tired  we cant be wasting a second on him on a day like this  hes only in love with books and things but ive got a real live woman in my arms thats loving me all the time shes kicking over the traces    chapter xxiii  but i know something of the fight you have been making dede contended  if you stop now all the work you have done everything will be destroyed  you have no right to do it  you cant do it  daylight was obdurate  he shook his head and smiled tantalizingly  nothing will be destroyed dede nothing  you dont understand this business game  its done on paper  dont you see  wheres the gold i dug out of klondike  why its in twentydollar gold pieces in gold watches in wedding rings  no matter what happens to me the twentydollar pieces the watches and the wedding rings remain suppose i died right now  it wouldnt affect the gold one iota  its sure the same with this present situation  all i stand for is paper ive got the paper for thousands of acres of land  all right  burn up the paper and burn me along with it  the land remains dont it  the rain falls on it the seeds sprout in it the trees grow out of it the houses stand on it the electric cars run over it  its paper that business is run on  i lose my paper or i lose my life its all the same it wont alter one grain of sand in all that land or twist one blade of grass around sideways  nothing is going to be lostnot one pile out of the docks not one railroad spike not one ounce of steam out of the gauge of a ferryboat  the cars will go on running whether i hold the paper or somebody else holds it  the tide has set toward oakland  people are beginning to pour in  were selling building lots again  there is no stopping that tide  no matter what happens to me or the paper them three hundred thousand folks are coming in the same  and therell be cars to carry them around and houses to hold them and good water for them to drink and electricity to give them light and all the rest  by this time hegan had arrived in an automobile  the honk of it came in through the open window and they saw it stop alongside the big red machine  in the car were unwin and harrison while jones sat with the chauffeur  ill see hegan daylight told dede  theres no need for the rest they can wait in the machine  is he drunk hegan whispered to dede at the door  she shook her head and showed him in  good morning larry was daylights greeting  sit down and rest your feet  you sure seem to be in a flutter  i am the little irishman snapped back  grimshaw and hodgkins are going to smash if something isnt done quick  why didnt you come to the office  what are you going to do about it  nothing daylight drawled lazily  except let them smash i guess  but  ive had no dealings with grimshaw and hodgkins  i dont owe them anything  besides im going to smash myself  look here larry you know me  you know when i make up my mind i mean it well ive sure made up my mind  im tired of the whole game im letting go of it as fast as i can and a smash is the quickest way to let go  hegan stared at his chief then passed his horrorstricken gaze on to dede who nodded in sympathy  so let her smash larry daylight went on  all youve got to do is to protect yourself and all our friends  now you listen to me while i tell you what to do  everything is in good shape to do it  nobody must get hurt  everybody that stood by me must come through without damage  all the back wages and salaries must be paid pronto  all the money ive switched away from the water company the street cars and the ferries must be switched back  and you wont get hurt yourself none  every company you got stock in will come through  you are crazy daylight the little lawyer cried out  this is all babbling lunacy  what is the matter with you  you havent been eating a drug or something  i sure have daylight smiled reply  and im now coughing it up im sick of living in a city and playing businessim going off to the sunshine and the country and the green grass  and dede here is going with me  so youve got the chance to be the first to congratulate me  congratulate thethe devil hegan spluttered  im not going to stand for this sort of foolishness  oh yes you are because if you dont therell be a bigger smash and some folks will most likely get hurt  youre worth a million or more yourself now and if you listen to me you come through with a whole skin  i want to get hurt and get hurt to the limit  thats what im looking for and theres no man or bunch of men can get between me and what im looking for savvee hegan  savvee  what have you done to him hegan snarled at dede  hold on there larry  for the first time daylights voice was sharp while all the old lines of cruelty in his face stood forth  miss mason is going to be my wife and while i dont mind your talking to her all you want youve got to use a different tone of voice or youll be heading for a hospital which will sure be an unexpected sort of smash  and let me tell you one other thing  thisall is my doing she says im crazy too  hegan shook his head in speechless sadness and continued to stare  therell be temporary receiverships of course daylight advised but they wont bother none or last long  what you must do immediately is to save everybodythe men that have been letting their wages ride with me all the creditors and all the concerns that have stood by theres the wad of land that new jersey crowd has been dickering for theyll take all of a couple of thousand acres and will close now if you give them half a chance  that fairmount section is the cream of it and theyll dig up as high as a thousand dollars an acre for a part of it thatll help out some  that fivehundred acre tract beyond youll be lucky if they pay two hundred an acre  dede who had been scarcely listening seemed abruptly to make up her mind and stepped forward where she confronted the two men her face was pale but set with determination so that daylight looking at it was reminded of the day when she first rode bob  wait she said  i want to say something  elam if you do this insane thing i wont marry you  i refuse to marry you  hegan in spite of his misery gave her a quick grateful look  ill take my chance on that daylight began  wait she again interrupted  and if you dont do this thing i will marry you  let me get this proposition clear  daylight spoke with exasperating slowness and deliberation  as i understand it if i keep right on at the business game youll sure marry me youll marry me if i keep on working my head off and drinking martinis  after each question he paused while she nodded an affirmation  and youll marry me right away  yes  today  now  yes  he pondered for a moment  no little woman i wont do it  it wont work and you know it yourself  i want youall of you and to get it ill have to give you all of myself and therell be darn little of myself left over to give if i stay with the business game  why dede with you on the ranch with me im sure of youand of myself im sure of you anyway  you can talk will or wont all you want but youre sure going to marry me just the same  and now larry youd better be going  ill be at the hotel in a little while and since im not going a step into the office again bring all papers to sign and the rest over to my rooms  and you can get me on the phone there any time  this smash is going through savvee  im quit and done  he stood up as a sign for hegan to go  the latter was plainly stunned he also rose to his feet but stood looking helplessly around  sheer downright absolute insanity he muttered  daylight put his hand on the others shoulder  buck up larry  youre always talking about the wonders of human nature and here i am giving you another sample of it and you aint appreciating it  im a bigger dreamer than you are thats all and im sure dreaming whats coming true  its the biggest best dream i ever had and im going after it to get it  by losing all youve got hegan exploded at him  sureby losing all ive got that i dont want  but im hanging on to them hundred and forty hair bridles just the same now youd better hustle out to unwin and harrison and get on down town  ill be at the hotel and you can call me up any time  he turned to dede as soon as hegan was gone and took her by the hand  and now little woman you neednt come to the office any more consider yourself discharged  and remember i was your employer so youve got to come to me for recommendation and if youre not real good i wont give you one  in the meantime you just rest up and think about what things you want to pack because well just about have to set up housekeeping on your stuffleastways the front part of the house  but elam i wont i wont if you do this mad thing i never will marry you  she attempted to take her hand away but he closed on it with a protecting fatherly clasp  will you be straight and honest  all right here goes  which would you sooner haveme and the money or me and the ranch  but she began  no buts  me and the money  she did not answer  me and the ranch  still she did not answer and still he was undisturbed  you see i know your answer dede and theres nothing more to say heres where you and i quit and hit the high places for sonoma  you make up your mind what you want to pack and ill have some men out here in a couple of days to do it for you  it will be about the last work anybody else ever does for us  you and i will do the unpacking and the arranging ourselves  she made a last attempt  elam wont you be reasonable  there is time to reconsider  i can telephone down and catch mr hegan as soon as he reaches the office  why im the only reasonable man in the bunch right now he rejoined look at meas calm as you please and as happy as a king while theyre fluttering around like a lot of cranky hens whose heads are liable to be cut off  id cry if i thought it would do any good she threatened  in which case i reckon id have to hold you in my arms some more and sort of soothe you down he threatened back  and now im going to go  its too bad you got rid of mab  you could have sent her up to the ranch  but see youve got a mare to ride of some sort or other  as he stood at the top of the steps leaving she said  you neednt send those men  there will be no packing because i am not going to marry you  im not a bit scared he answered and went down the steps    chapter xxiv  three days later daylight rode to berkeley in his red car  it was for the last time for on the morrow the big machine passed into anothers possession  it had been a strenuous three days for his smash had been the biggest the panic had precipitated in california  the papers had been filled with it and a great cry of indignation had gone up from the very men who later found that daylight had fully protected their interests  it was these facts coming slowly to light that gave rise to the widely repeated charge that daylight had gone insane  it was the unanimous conviction among business men that no sane man could possibly behave in such fashion  on the other hand neither his prolonged steady drinking nor his affair with dede became public so the only conclusion attainable was that the wild financier from alaska had gone lunatic  and daylight had grinned and confirmed the suspicion by refusing to see the reporters  he halted the automobile before dedes door and met her with his same rushing tactics enclosing her in his arms before a word could be uttered  not until afterward when she had recovered herself from him and got him seated did he begin to speak  ive done it he announced  youve seen the newspapers of course im plumb cleaned out and ive just called around to find out what day you feel like starting for glen ellen  itll have to be soon for its real expensive living in oakland these days  my board at the hotel is only paid to the end of the week and i cant afford to stay after that  and beginning with tomorrow ive got to use the street cars and they sure eat up the nickels  he paused and waited and looked at her  indecision and trouble showed on her face  then the smile he knew so well began to grow on her lips and in her eyes until she threw back her head and laughed in the old forthright boyish way  when are those men coming to pack for me she asked  and again she laughed and simulated a vain attempt to escape his bearlike arms  dear elam she whispered dear elam  and of herself for the first time she kissed him  she ran her hand caressingly through his hair  your eyes are all gold right now he said  i can look in them and tell just how much you love me  they have been all gold for you elam for a long time  i think on our little ranch they will always be all gold  your hair has gold in it too a sort of fiery gold  he turned her face suddenly and held it between his hands and looked long into her eyes  and your eyes were full of gold only the other day when you said you wouldnt marry me  she nodded and laughed  you would have your will she confessed  but i couldnt be a party to such madness  all that money was yours not mine  but i was loving you all the time elam for the great big boy you are breaking the thirtymillion toy with which you had grown tired of playing  and when i said no i knew all the time it was yes  and i am sure that my eyes were golden all the time  i had only one fear and that was that you would fail to lose everything  because dear i knew i should marry you anyway and i did so want just you and the ranch and bob and wolf and those horsehair bridles  shall i tell you a secret  as soon as you left i telephoned the man to whom i sold mab  she hid her face against his breast for an instant and then looked at him again gladly radiant  you see elam in spite of what my lips said my mind was made up then  ii simply had to marry you  but i was praying you would succeed in losing everything  and so i tried to find what had become of mab  but the man had sold her and did not know what had become of her  you see i wanted to ride with you over the glen ellen hills on mab and you on bob just as i had ridden with you through the piedmont hills  the disclosure of mabs whereabouts trembled on daylights lips but he forbore  ill promise you a mare that youll like just as much as mab he said  but dede shook her head and on that one point refused to be comforted  now ive got an idea daylight said hastening to get the conversation on less perilous ground  were running away from cities and you have no kith nor kin so it dont seem exactly right that we should start off by getting married in a city  so heres the idea ill run up to the ranch and get things in shape around the house and give the caretaker his walkingpapers  you follow me in a couple of days coming on the morning train  ill have the preacher fixed and waiting  and heres another idea you bring your riding togs in a suit case  and as soon as the ceremonys over you can go to the hotel and change  then out you come and you find me waiting with a couple of horses and well ride over the landscape so as you can see the prettiest parts of the ranch the first thing  and shes sure pretty that ranch  and now that its settled ill be waiting for you at the morning train day after tomorrow  dede blushed as she spoke  you are such a hurricane  well maam he drawled i sure hate to burn daylight and you and i have burned a heap of daylight  weve been scandalously extravagant we might have been married years ago  two days later daylight stood waiting outside the little glen ellen hotel  the ceremony was over and he had left dede to go inside and change into her ridinghabit while he brought the horses  he held them now bob and mab and in the shadow of the wateringtrough wolf lay and looked on  already two days of ardent california sun had touched with new fires the ancient bronze in daylights face  but warmer still was the glow that came into his cheeks and burned in his eyes as he saw dede coming out the door ridingwhip in hand clad in the familiar corduroy skirt and leggings of the old piedmont days  there was warmth and glow in her own face as she answered his gaze and glanced on past him to the horses  then she saw mab  but her gaze leaped back to the man  oh elam she breathed  it was almost a prayer but a prayer that included a thousand meanings daylight strove to feign sheepishness but his heart was singing too wild a song for mere playfulness  all things had been in the naming of his namereproach refined away by gratitude and all compounded of joy and love  she stepped forward and caressed the mare and again turned and looked at the man and breathed  oh elam  and all that was in her voice was in her eyes and in them daylight glimpsed a profundity deeper and wider than any speech or thoughtthe whole vast inarticulate mystery and wonder of sex and love  again he strove for playfulness of speech but it was too great a moment for even love fractiousness to enter in  neither spoke she gathered the reins and bending daylight received her foot in his hand  she sprang as he lifted and gained the saddle the next moment he was mounted and beside her and with wolf sliding along ahead in his typical wolftrot they went up the hill that led out of towntwo lovers on two chestnut sorrel steeds riding out and away to honeymoon through the warm summer day  daylight felt himself drunken as with wine  he was at the topmost pinnacle of life  higher than this no man could climb nor had ever climbed  it was his day of days his lovetime and his matingtime and all crowned by this virginal possession of a mate who had said oh elam as she had said it and looked at him out of her soul as she had looked  they cleared the crest of the hill and he watched the joy mount in her face as she gazed on the sweet fresh land  he pointed out the group of heavily wooded knolls across the rolling stretches of ripe grain  theyre ours he said  and theyre only a sample of the ranch wait till you see the big canon  there are coons down there and back here on the sonoma there are mink  and deerwhy that mountains sure thick with them and i reckon we can scare up a mountainlion if we want to real hard  and say theres a little meadowwell i aint going to tell you another word  you wait and see for yourself  they turned in at the gate where the road to the claypit crossed the fields and both sniffed with delight as the warm aroma of the ripe hay rose in their nostrils  as on his first visit the larks were uttering their rich notes and fluttering up before the horses until the woods and the flowerscattered glades were reached when the larks gave way to blue jays and woodpeckers  were on our land now he said as they left the hayfield behind it runs right across country over the roughest parts just you wait and see  as on the first day he turned aside from the claypit and worked through the woods to the left passing the first spring and jumping the horses over the ruined remnants of the stakeandrider fence  from here on dede was in an unending ecstasy  by the spring that gurgled among the redwoods grew another great wild lily bearing on its slender stalk the prodigious outburst of white waxen bells  this time he did not dismount but led the way to the deep canon where the stream had cut a passage among the knolls  he had been at work here and a steep and slippery horse trail now crossed the creek so they rode up beyond through the somber redwood twilight and farther on through a tangled wood of oak and madrono  they came to a small clearing of several acres where the grain stood waist high  ours daylight said  she bent in her saddle plucked a stalk of the ripe grain and nibbled it between her teeth  sweet mountain hay she cried  the kind mab likes  and throughout the ride she continued to utter cries and ejaculations of surprise and delight  and you never told me all this she reproached him as they looked across the little clearing and over the descending slopes of woods to the great curving sweep of sonoma valley  come he said and they turned and went back through the forest shade crossed the stream and came to the lily by the spring  here also where the way led up the tangle of the steep hill he had cut a rough horse trail  as they forced their way up the zigzags they caught glimpses out and down through the sea of foliage  yet always were their farthest glimpses stopped by the closing vistas of green and yet always as they climbed did the forest roof arch overhead with only here and there rifts that permitted shattered shafts of sunlight to penetrate  and all about them were ferns a score of varieties from the tiny goldbacks and maidenhair to huge brakes six and eight feet tall  below them as they mounted they glimpsed great gnarled trunks and branches of ancient trees and above them were similar great gnarled branches  dede stopped her horse and sighed with the beauty of it all  it is as if we are swimmers she said rising out of a deep pool of green tranquillity  up above is the sky and the sun but this is a pool and we are fathoms deep  they started their horses but a dogtooth violet shouldering amongst the maidenhair caught her eye and made her rein in again  they cleared the crest and emerged from the pool as if into another world for now they were in the thicket of velvettrunked young madronos and looking down the open sunwashed hillside across the nodding grasses to the drifts of blue and white nemophilae that carpeted the tiny meadow on either side the tiny stream  dede clapped her hands  its sure prettier than office furniture daylight remarked  it sure is she answered  and daylight who knew his weakness in the use of the particular word sure knew that she had repeated it deliberately and with love  they crossed the stream and took the cattle track over the low rocky hill and through the scrub forest of manzanita till they emerged on the next tiny valley with its meadowbordered streamlet  if we dont run into some quail pretty soon ill be surprised some daylight said  and as the words left his lips there was a wild series of explosive thrumming as the old quail arose from all about wolf while the young ones scuttled for safety and disappeared miraculously before the spectators very eyes  he showed her the hawks nest he had found in the lightningshattered top of the redwood and she discovered a woodrats nest which he had not seen before  next they took the old woodroad and came out on the dozen acres of clearing where the wine grapes grew in the winecolored volcanic soil  then they followed the cowpath through more woods and thickets and scattered glades and dropped down the hillside to where the farmhouse poised on the lip of the big canon came into view only when they were right upon it  dede stood on the wide porch that ran the length of the house while daylight tied the horses  to dede it was very quiet  it was the dry warm breathless calm of california midday  all the world seemed dozing  from somewhere pigeons were cooing lazily with a deep sigh of satisfaction wolf who had drunk his fill at all the streams along the way dropped down in the cool shadow of the porch  she heard the footsteps of daylight returning and caught her breath with a quick intake  he took her hand in his and as he turned the doorknob felt her hesitate  then he put his arm around her the door swung open and together they passed in    chapter xxv  many persons themselves citybred and cityreared have fled to the soil and succeeded in winning great happiness  in such cases they have succeeded only by going through a process of savage disillusionment but with dede and daylight it was different they had both been born on the soil and they knew its naked simplicities and rawer ways  they were like two persons after far wandering who had merely come home again  there was less of the unexpected in their dealings with nature while theirs was all the delight of reminiscence  what might appear sordid and squalid to the fastidiously reared was to them eminently wholesome and natural  the commerce of nature was to them no unknown and untried trade  they made fewer mistakes  they already knew and it was a joy to remember what they had forgotten  and another thing they learned was that it was easier for one who has gorged at the fleshpots to content himself with the meagerness of a crust than for one who has known only the crust  not that their life was meagre  it was that they found keener delights and deeper satisfactions in little things  daylight who had played the game in its biggest and most fantastic aspects found that here on the slopes of sonoma mountain it was still the same old game  man had still work to perform forces to combat obstacles to overcome  when he experimented in a small way at raising a few pigeons for market he found no less zest in calculating in squabs than formerly when he had calculated in millions  achievement was no less achievement while the process of it seemed more rational and received the sanction of his reason  the domestic cat that had gone wild and that preyed on his pigeons he found by the comparative standard to be of no less paramount menace than a charles klinkner in the field of finance trying to raid him for several millions  the hawks and weasels and coons were so many dowsetts lettons and guggenhammers that struck at him secretly  the sea of wild vegetation that tossed its surf against the boundaries of all his clearings and that sometimes crept in and flooded in a single week was no mean enemy to contend with and subdue  his fatsoiled vegetablegarden in the nook of hills that failed of its best was a problem of engrossing importance and when he had solved it by putting in draintile the joy of the achievement was ever with him  he never worked in it and found the soil unpacked and tractable without experiencing the thrill of accomplishment  there was the matter of the plumbing  he was enabled to purchase the materials through a lucky sale of a number of his hair bridles  the work he did himself though more than once he was forced to call in dede to hold tight with a pipewrench  and in the end when the bathtub and the stationary tubs were installed and in working order he could scarcely tear himself away from the contemplation of what his hands had wrought  the first evening missing him dede sought and found him lamp in hand staring with silent glee at the tubs  he rubbed his hand over their smooth wooden lips and laughed aloud and was as shamefaced as any boy when she caught him thus secretly exulting in his own prowess  it was this adventure in woodworking and plumbing that brought about the building of the little workshop where he slowly gathered a collection of loved tools  and he who in the old days out of his millions could purchase immediately whatever he might desire learned the new joy of the possession that follows upon rigid economy and desire long delayed  he waited three months before daring the extravagance of a yankee screwdriver and his glee in the marvelous little mechanism was so keen that dede conceived forthright a great idea  for six months she saved her eggmoney which was hers by right of allotment and on his birthday presented him with a turninglathe of wonderful simplicity and multifarious efficiencies  and their mutual delight in the tool which was his was only equalled by their delight in mabs first foal which was dedes special private property  it was not until the second summer that daylight built the huge fireplace that outrivalled fergusons across the valley  for all these things took time and dede and daylight were not in a hurry  theirs was not the mistake of the average citydweller who flees in ultramodern innocence to the soil  they did not essay too much neither did they have a mortgage to clear nor did they desire wealth they wanted little in the way of food and they had no rent to pay  so they planned unambiguously reserving their lives for each other and for the compensations of countrydwelling from which the average countrydweller is barred  from fergusons example too they profited much  here was a man who asked for but the plainest fare who ministered to his own simple needs with his own hands who worked out as a laborer only when he needed money to buy books and magazines and who saw to it that the major portion of his waking time was for enjoyment  he loved to loaf long afternoons in the shade with his books or to be up with the dawn and away over the hills  on occasion he accompanied dede and daylight on deer hunts through the wild canons and over the rugged steeps of hood mountain though more often dede and daylight were out alone this riding was one of their chief joys  every wrinkle and crease in the hills they explored and they came to know every secret spring and hidden dell in the whole surrounding wall of the valley  they learned all the trails and cowpaths but nothing delighted them more than to essay the roughest and most impossible rides where they were glad to crouch and crawl along the narrowest deerruns bob and mab struggling and forcing their way along behind  back from their rides they brought the seeds and bulbs of wild flowers to plant in favoring nooks on the ranch  along the foot trail which led down the side of the big canon to the intake of the waterpipe they established their fernery  it was not a formal affair and the ferns were left to themselves  dede and daylight merely introduced new ones from time to time changing them from one wild habitat to another  it was the same with the wild lilac which daylight had sent to him from mendocino county  it became part of the wildness of the ranch and after being helped for a season was left to its own devices they used to gather the seeds of the california poppy and scatter them over their own acres so that the orangecolored blossoms spangled the fields of mountain hay and prospered in flaming drifts in the fence corners and along the edges of the clearings  dede who had a fondness for cattails established a fringe of them along the meadow stream where they were left to fight it out with the watercress  and when the latter was threatened with extinction daylight developed one of the shaded springs into his watercress garden and declared war upon any invading cattail  on her wedding day dede had discovered a long dogtooth violet by the zigzag trail above the redwood spring and here she continued to plant more and more  the open hillside above the tiny meadow became a colony of mariposa lilies this was due mainly to her efforts while daylight who rode with a shorthandled ax on his saddlebow cleared the little manzanita wood on the rocky hill of all its dead and dying and overcrowded weaklings  they did not labor at these tasks  nor were they tasks  merely in passing they paused from time to time and lent a hand to nature these flowers and shrubs grew of themselves and their presence was no violation of the natural environment  the man and the woman made no effort to introduce a flower or shrub that did not of its own right belong  nor did they protect them from their enemies  the horses and the colts and the cows and the calves ran at pasture among them or over them and flower or shrub had to take its chance  but the beasts were not noticeably destructive for they were few in number and the ranch was large  on the other hand daylight could have taken in fully a dozen horses to pasture which would have earned him a dollar and a half per head per month  but this he refused to do because of the devastation such close pasturing would produce  ferguson came over to celebrate the housewarming that followed the achievement of the great stone fireplace  daylight had ridden across the valley more than once to confer with him about the undertaking and he was the only other present at the sacred function of lighting the first fire  by removing a partition daylight had thrown two rooms into one and this was the big livingroom where dedes treasures were placedher books and paintings and photographs her piano the crouched venus the chafingdish and all its glittering accessories already in addition to her own wildanimal skins were those of deer and coyote and one mountainlion which daylight had killed  the tanning he had done himself slowly and laboriously in frontier fashion  he handed the match to dede who struck it and lighted the fire the crisp manzanita wood crackled as the flames leaped up and assailed the dry bark of the larger logs  then she leaned in the shelter of her husbands arm and the three stood and looked in breathless suspense when ferguson gave judgment it was with beaming face and extended hand  she draws  by crickey she draws he cried  he shook daylights hand ecstatically and daylight shook his with equal fervor and bending kissed dede on the lips  they were as exultant over the success of their simple handiwork as any great captain at astonishing victory  in fergusons eyes was actually a suspicious moisture while the woman pressed even more closely against the man whose achievement it was  he caught her up suddenly in his arms and whirled her away to the piano crying out come on dede the gloria the gloria  and while the flames in the fireplace that worked the triumphant strains of the twelfth mass rolled forth    chapter xxvi  daylight had made no assertion of total abstinence though he had not taken a drink for months after the day he resolved to let his business go to smash  soon he proved himself strong enough to dare to take a drink without taking a second  on the other hand with his coming to live in the country had passed all desire and need for drink  he felt no yearning for it and even forgot that it existed  yet he refused to be afraid of it and in town on occasion when invited by the storekeeper would reply all right son  if my taking a drink will make you happy here goes whiskey for mine  but such a drink began no desire for a second  it made no impression he was too profoundly strong to be affected by a thimbleful  as he had prophesied to dede burning daylight the city financier had died a quick death on the ranch and his younger brother the daylight from alaska had taken his place the threatened inundation of fat had subsided and all his oldtime indian leanness and of muscle had returned  so likewise did the old slight hollows in his cheeks come back for him they indicated the pink of physical condition  he became the acknowledged strong man of sonoma valley the heaviest lifter and hardest winded among a husky race of farmer folk  and once a year he celebrated his birthday in the oldfashioned frontier way challenging all the valley to come up the hill to the ranch and be put on its back and a fair portion of the valley responded brought the womenfolk and children along and picnicked for the day  at first when in need of ready cash he had followed fergusons example of working at days labor but he was not long in gravitating to a form of work that was more stimulating and more satisfying and that allowed him even more time for dede and the ranch and the perpetual riding through the hills  having been challenged by the blacksmith in a spirit of banter to attempt the breaking of a certain incorrigible colt he succeeded so signally as to earn quite a reputation as a horsebreaker  and soon he was able to earn whatever money he desired at this to him agreeable work  a sugar king whose breeding farm and training stables were at caliente three miles away sent for him in time of need and before the year was out offered him the management of the stables  but daylight smiled and shook his head  furthermore he refused to undertake the breaking of as many animals as were offered  im sure not going to die from overwork he assured dede and he accepted such work only when he had to have money later he fenced off a small run in the pasture where from time to time he took in a limited number of incorrigibles  weve got the ranch and each other he told his wife and id sooner ride with you to hood mountain any day than earn forty dollars  you cant buy sunsets and loving wives and cool spring water and such folderols with forty dollars and forty million dollars cant buy back for me one day that i didnt ride with you to hood mountain  his life was eminently wholesome and natural  early to bed he slept like an infant and was up with the dawn  always with something to do and with a thousand little things that enticed but did not clamor he was himself never overdone  nevertheless there were times when both he and dede were not above confessing tiredness at bedtime after seventy or eighty miles in the saddle  sometimes when he had accumulated a little money and when the season favored they would mount their horses with saddlebags behind and ride away over the wall of the valley and down into the other valleys when night fell they put up at the first convenient farm or village and on the morrow they would ride on without definite plan merely continuing to ride on day after day until their money gave out and they were compelled to return  on such trips they would be gone anywhere from a week to ten days or two weeks and once they managed a three weeks trip  they even planned ambitiously some day when they were disgracefully prosperous to ride all the way up to daylights boyhood home in eastern oregon stopping on the way at dedes girlhood home in siskiyou  and all the joys of anticipation were theirs a thousand times as they contemplated the detailed delights of this grand adventure  one day stopping to mail a letter at the glen ellen post office they were hailed by the blacksmith  say daylight he said a young fellow named slosson sends you his regards  he came through in an auto on the way to santa rosa  he wanted to know if you didnt live hereabouts but the crowd with him was in a hurry  so he sent you his regards and said to tell you hed taken your advice and was still going on breaking his own record  daylight had long since told dede of the incident  slosson he meditated slosson  that must be the hammerthrower he put my hand down twice the young scamp he turned suddenly to dede  say its only twelve miles to santa rosa and the horses are fresh  she divined what was in his mind of which his twinkling eyes and sheepish boyish grin gave sufficient advertisement and she smiled and nodded acquiescence  well cut across by bennett valley he said  its nearer that way  there was little difficulty once in santa rosa of finding slosson he and his party had registered at the oberlin hotel and daylight encountered the young hammerthrower himself in the office  look here son daylight announced as soon as he had introduced dede ive come to go you another flutter at that hand game  heres a likely place  slosson smiled and accepted  the two men faced each other the elbows of their right arms on the counter the hands clasped slossons hand quickly forced backward and down  youre the first man that ever succeeded in doing it he said lets try it again  sure daylight answered  and dont forget son that youre the first man that put mine down  thats why i lit out after you today  again they clasped hands and again slossons hand went down  he was a broadshouldered heavymuscled young giant at least half a head taller than daylight and he frankly expressed his chagrin and asked for a third trial  this time he steeled himself to the effort and for a moment the issue was in doubt  with flushed face and set teeth he met the others strength till his crackling muscles failed him  the air exploded sharply from his tensed lungs as he relaxed in surrender and the hand dropped limply down  youre too many for me he confessed  i only hope youll keep out of the hammerthrowing game  daylight laughed and shook his head  we might compromise and each stay in his own class  you stick to hammerthrowing and ill go on turning down hands  but slosson refused to accept defeat  say he called out as daylight and dede astride their horses were preparing to depart  saydo you mind if i look you up next year id like to tackle you again  sure son  youre welcome to a flutter any time  though i give you fair warning that youll have to go some  youll have to train up for im ploughing and chopping wood and breaking colts these days  now and again on the way home dede could hear her big boyhusband chuckling gleefully  as they halted their horses on the top of the divide out of bennett valley in order to watch the sunset he ranged alongside and slipped his arm around her waist  little woman he said youre sure responsible for it all and i leave it to you if all the money in creation is worth as much as one arm like that when its got a sweet little woman like this to go around  for of all his delights in the new life dede was his greatest as he explained to her more than once he had been afraid of love all his life only in the end to come to find it the greatest thing in the world  not alone were the two well mated but in coming to live on the ranch they had selected the best soil in which their love would prosper  in spite of her books and music there was in her a wholesome simplicity and love of the open and natural while daylight in every fiber of him was essentially an openair man  of one thing in dede daylight never got over marveling about and that was her efficient handsthe hands that he had first seen taking down flying shorthand notes and ticking away at the typewriter the hands that were firm to hold a magnificent brute like bob that wonderfully flashed over the keys of the piano that were unhesitant in household tasks and that were twin miracles to caress and to run rippling fingers through his hair but daylight was not unduly uxorious  he lived his mans life just as she lived her womans life  there was proper division of labor in the work they individually performed  but the whole was entwined and woven into a fabric of mutual interest and consideration  he was as deeply interested in her cooking and her music as she was in his agricultural adventures in the vegetable garden  and he who resolutely declined to die of overwork saw to it that she should likewise escape so dire a risk  in this connection using his mans judgment and putting his mans foot down he refused to allow her to be burdened with the entertaining of guests  for guests they had especially in the warm long summers and usually they were her friends from the city who were put to camp in tents which they cared for themselves and where like true campers they had also to cook for themselves  perhaps only in california where everybody knows camp life would such a program have been possible  but daylights steadfast contention was that his wife should not become cook waitress and chambermaid because she did not happen to possess a household of servants  on the other hand chafingdish suppers in the big livingroom for their camping guests were a common happening at which times daylight allotted them their chores and saw that they were performed  for one who stopped only for the night it was different  likewise it was different with her brother back from germany and again able to sit a horse  on his vacations he became the third in the family and to him was given the building of the fires the sweeping and the washing of the dishes  daylight devoted himself to the lightening of dedes labors and it was her brother who incited him to utilize the splendid waterpower of the ranch that was running to waste  it required daylights breaking of extra horses to pay for the materials and the brother devoted a three weeks vacation to assisting and together they installed a pelting wheel  besides sawing wood and turning his lathe and grindstone daylight connected the power with the churn but his great triumph was when he put his arm around dedes waist and led her out to inspect a washingmachine run by the pelton wheel which really worked and really washed clothes  dede and ferguson between them after a patient struggle taught daylight poetry so that in the end he might have been often seen sitting slack in the saddle and dropping down the mountain trails through the sunflecked woods chanting aloud kiplings tomlinson or when sharpening his ax singing into the whirling grindstone henleys song of the sword  not that he ever became consummately literary in the way his two teachers were  beyond fra lippo lippi and caliban and setebos he found nothing in browning while george meredith was ever his despair  it was of his own initiative however that he invested in a violin and practised so assiduously that in time he and dede beguiled many a happy hour playing together after night had fallen  so all went well with this wellmated pair  time never dragged there were always new wonderful mornings and still cool twilights at the end of day and ever a thousand interests claimed him and his interests were shared by her  more thoroughly than he knew had he come to a comprehension of the relativity of things  in this new game he played he found in little things all the intensities of gratification and desire that he had found in the frenzied big things when he was a power and rocked half a continent with the fury of the blows he struck  with head and hand at risk of life and limb to bit and break a wild colt and win it to the service of man was to him no less great an achievement  and this new table on which he played the game was clean neither lying nor cheating nor hypocrisy was here  the other game had made for decay and death while this new one made for clean strength and life  and so he was content with dede at his side to watch the procession of the days and seasons from the farmhouse perched on the canonlip to ride through crisp frosty mornings or under burning summer suns and to shelter in the big room where blazed the logs in the fireplace he had built while outside the world shuddered and struggled in the stormclasp of a southeaster  once only dede asked him if he ever regretted and his answer was to crush her in his arms and smother her lips with his  his answer a minute later took speech  little woman even if you did cost thirty millions you are sure the cheapest necessity of life i ever indulged in  and then he added yes i do have one regret and a monstrous big one too  id sure like to have the winning of you all over again id like to go sneaking around the piedmont hills looking for you  id like to meander into those rooms of yours at berkeley for the first time  and theres no use talking im plumb soaking with regret that i cant put my arms around you again that time you leaned your head on my breast and cried in the wind and rain    chapter xxvii  but there came the day one year in early april when dede sat in an easy chair on the porch sewing on certain small garments while daylight read aloud to her  it was in the afternoon and a bright sun was shining down on a world of new green  along the irrigation channels of the vegetable garden streams of water were flowing and now and again daylight broke off from his reading to run out and change the flow of water  also he was teasingly interested in the certain small garments on which dede worked while she was radiantly happy over them though at times when his tender fun was too insistent she was rosily confused or affectionately resentful  from where they sat they could look out over the world  like the curve of a skirting blade the valley of the moon stretched before them dotted with farmhouses and varied by pasturelands hayfields and vineyards  beyond rose the wall of the valley every crease and wrinkle of which dede and daylight knew and at one place where the sun struck squarely the white dump of the abandoned mine burned like a jewel  in the foreground in the paddock by the barn was mab full of pretty anxieties for the early spring foal that staggered about her on tottery legs  the air shimmered with heat and altogether it was a lazy basking day  quail whistled to their young from the thicketed hillside behind the house  there was a gentle cooing of pigeons and from the green depths of the big canon arose the sobbing wood note of a mourning dove  once there was a warning chorus from the foraging hens and a wild rush for cover as a hawk high in the blue cast its drifting shadow along the ground  it was this perhaps that aroused old hunting memories in wolf at any rate dede and daylight became aware of excitement in the paddock and saw harmlessly reenacted a grim old tragedy of the younger world curiously eager velvetfooted and silent as a ghost sliding and gliding and crouching the dog that was mere domesticated wolf stalked the enticing bit of young life that mab had brought so recently into the world  and the mare her own ancient instincts aroused and quivering circled ever between the foal and this menace of the wild young days when all her ancestry had known fear of him and his hunting brethren  once she whirled and tried to kick him but usually she strove to strike him with her forehoofs or rushed upon him with open mouth and ears laid back in an effort to crunch his backbone between her teeth  and the wolfdog with ears flattened down and crouching would slide silkily away only to circle up to the foal from the other side and give cause to the mare for new alarm  then daylight urged on by dedes solicitude uttered a low threatening cry and wolf drooping and sagging in all the body of him in token of his instant return to mans allegiance slunk off behind the barn  it was a few minutes later that daylight breaking off from his reading to change the streams of irrigation found that the water had ceased flowing  he shouldered a pick and shovel took a hammer and a pipewrench from the toolhouse and returned to dede on the porch  i reckon ill have to go down and dig the pipe out he told her its that slide thats threatened all winter  i guess shes come down at last  dont you read ahead now he warned as he passed around the house and took the trail that led down the wall of the canon  halfway down the trail he came upon the slide  it was a small affair only a few tons of earth and crumbling rock but starting from fifty feet above it had struck the water pipe with force sufficient to break it at a connection  before proceeding to work he glanced up the path of the slide and he glanced with the eye of the earthtrained miner and he saw what made his eyes startle and cease for the moment from questing farther  hello he communed aloud look whos here  his glance moved on up the steep broken surface and across it from side to side  here and there in places small twisted manzanitas were rooted precariously but in the main save for weeds and grass that portion of the canon was bare  there were signs of a surface that had shifted often as the rains poured a flow of rich eroded soil from above over the lip of the canon  a true fissure vein or i never saw one he proclaimed softly  and as the old hunting instincts had aroused that day in the wolfdog so in him recrudesced all the old hot desire of goldhunting  dropping the hammer and pipewrench but retaining pick and shovel he climbed up the slide to where a vague line of outputting but mostly soilcovered rock could be seen  it was all but indiscernible but his practised eye had sketched the hidden formation which it signified here and there along this wall of the vein he attacked the crumbling rock with the pick and shoveled the encumbering soil away  several times he examined this rock  so soft was some of it that he could break it in his fingers  shifting a dozen feet higher up he again attacked with pick and shovel  and this time when he rubbed the soil from a chunk of rock and looked he straightened up suddenly gasping with delight  and then like a deer at a drinking pool in fear of its enemies he flung a quick glance around to see if any eye were gazing upon him  he grinned at his own foolishness and returned to his examination of the chunk  a slant of sunlight fell on it and it was all aglitter with tiny specks of unmistakable free gold  from the grass roots down he muttered in an awestricken voice as he swung his pick into the yielding surface  he seemed to undergo a transformation  no quart of cocktails had ever put such a flame in his cheeks nor such a fire in his eyes as he worked he was caught up in the old passion that had ruled most of his life  a frenzy seized him that markedly increased from moment to moment  he worked like a madman till he panted from his exertions and the sweat dripped from his face to the ground  he quested across the face of the slide to the opposite wall of the vein and back again and midway he dug down through the red volcanic earth that had washed from the disintegrating hill above until he uncovered quartz rotten quartz that broke and crumbled in his hands and showed to be alive with free gold  sometimes he started small slides of earth that covered up his work and compelled him to dig again  once he was swept fifty feet down the canonside but he floundered and scrambled up again without pausing for breath  he hit upon quartz that was so rotten that it was almost like clay and here the gold was richer than ever  it was a veritable treasure chamber  for a hundred feet up and down he traced the walls of the vein  he even climbed over the canonlip to look along the brow of the hill for signs of the outcrop  but that could wait and he hurried back to his find  he toiled on in the same mad haste until exhaustion and an intolerable ache in his back compelled him to pause  he straightened up with even a richer piece of goldladen quartz stooping the sweat from his forehead had fallen to the ground it now ran into his eyes blinding him  he wiped it from him with the back of his hand and returned to a scrutiny of the gold  it would run thirty thousand to the ton fifty thousand anythinghe knew that  and as he gazed upon the yellow lure and panted for air and wiped the sweat away his quick vision leaped and set to work  he saw the spurtrack that must run up from the valley and across the upland pastures and he ran the grades and built the bridge that would span the canon until it was real before his eyes  across the canon was the place for the mill and there he erected it and he erected also the endless chain of buckets suspended from a cable and operated by gravity that would carry the ore across the canon to the quartzcrusher likewise the whole mine grew before him and beneath himtunnels shafts and galleries and hoisting plants  the blasts of the miners were in his ears and from across the canon he could hear the roar of the stamps  the hand that held the lump of quartz was trembling and there was a tired nervous palpitation apparently in the pit of his stomach  it came to him abruptly that what he wanted was a drinkwhiskey cocktails anything a drink  and even then with this new hot yearning for the alcohol upon him he heard faint and far drifting down the green abyss of the canon dedes voice crying  here chick chick chick chick chick  here chick chick chick  he was astounded at the lapse of time  she had left her sewing on the porch and was feeding the chickens preparatory to getting supper  the afternoon was gone  he could not conceive that he had been away that long  again came the call here chick chick chick chick chick here chick chick chick  it was the way she always calledfirst five and then three  he had long since noticed it  and from these thoughts of her arose other thoughts that caused a great fear slowly to grow in his face  for it seemed to him that he had almost lost her  not once had he thought of her in those frenzied hours and for that much at least had she truly been lost to him  he dropped the piece of quartz slid down the slide and started up the trail running heavily  at the edge of the clearing he eased down and almost crept to a point of vantage whence he could peer out himself unseen  she was feeding the chickens tossing to them handfuls of grain and laughing at their antics  the sight of her seemed to relieve the panic fear into which he had been flung and he turned and ran back down the trail  again he climbed the slide but this time he climbed higher carrying the pick and shovel with him  and again he toiled frenziedly but this time with a different purpose  he worked artfully loosing slide after slide of the red soil and sending it streaming down and covering up all he had uncovered hiding from the light of day the treasure he had discovered  he even went into the woods and scooped armfuls of last years fallen leaves which he scattered over the slide  but this he gave up as a vain task and he sent more slides of soil down upon the scene of his labor until no sign remained of the outjutting walls of the vein  next he repaired the broken pipe gathered his tools together and started up the trail  he walked slowly feeling a great weariness as of a man who had passed through a frightful crisis  he put the tools away took a great drink of the water that again flowed through the pipes and sat down on the bench by the open kitchen door  dede was inside preparing supper and the sound of her footsteps gave him a vast content  he breathed the balmy mountain air in great gulps like a diver freshrisen from the sea  and as he drank in the air he gazed with all his eyes at the clouds and sky and valley as if he were drinking in that too along with the air  dede did not know he had come back and at times he turned his head and stole glances in at herat her efficient hands at the bronze of her brown hair that smouldered with fire when she crossed the path of sunshine that streamed through the window at the promise of her figure that shot through him a pang most strangely sweet and sweetly dear  he heard her approaching the door and kept his head turned resolutely toward the valley  and next he thrilled as he had always thrilled when he felt the caressing gentleness of her fingers through his hair  i didnt know you were back she said  was it serious  pretty bad that slide he answered still gazing away and thrilling to her touch  more serious than i reckoned  but ive got the plan do you know what im going to doim going to plant eucalyptus all over it  theyll hold it  ill plant them thick as grass so that even a hungry rabbit cant squeeze between them and when they get their roots agoing nothing in creation will ever move that dirt again  why is it as bad as that  he shook his head  nothing exciting  but id sure like to see any blamed old slide get the best of me thats all  im going to seal that slide down so that itll stay there for a million years  and when the last trump sounds and sonoma mountain and all the other mountains pass into nothingness that old slide will be still astanding there held up by the roots  he passed his arm around her and pulled her down on his knees  say little woman you sure miss a lot by living here on the ranchmusic and theatres and such things  dont you ever have a hankering to drop it all and go back  so great was his anxiety that he dared not look at her and when she laughed and shook her head he was aware of a great relief also he noted the undiminished youth that rang through that same oldtime boyish laugh of hers  say he said with sudden fierceness dont you go fooling around that slide until after i get the trees in and rooted its mighty dangerous and i sure cant afford to lose you now  he drew her lips to his and kissed her hungrily and passionately  what a lover she said and pride in him and in her own womanhood was in her voice  look at that dede  he removed one encircling arm and swept it in a wide gesture over the valley and the mountains beyond the valley of the moona good name a good name  do you know when i look out over it all and think of you and of all it means it kind of makes me ache in the throat and i have things in my heart i cant find the words to say and i have a feeling that i can almost understand browning and those other highflying poetfellows  look at hood mountain there just where the suns striking  it was down in that crease that we found the spring  and that was the night you didnt milk the cows till ten oclock she laughed  and if you keep me here much longer supper wont be any earlier than it was that night  both arose from the bench and daylight caught up the milkpail from the nail by the door  he paused a moment longer to look out over the valley  its sure grand he said  its sure grand she echoed laughing joyously at him and with him and herself and all the world as she passed in through the door  and daylight like the old man he once had met himself went down the hill through the fires of sunset with a milk pail on his arm
