     chapter xxiii  cattle show      chapter xxiv   down the river      jack and jill       jack and jill went up the hill     to coast with fun and laughter     jack fell down and broke his crown     and jill came tumbling after     chapter i the catastrophe   clear the lulla was the general cry on a bright december afternoon when all the boys and girls of harmony village were out enjoying the first good snow of the season up and down three long coasts they went as fast as legs and sleds could carry them one smooth path led into the meadow and here the little folk congregated one swept across the pond where skaters were darting about like waterbugs and the third from the very top of the steep hill ended abruptly at a rail fence on the high bank above the road there was a group of lads and lasses sitting or leaning on this fence to rest after an exciting race and as they reposed they amused themselves with criticising their mates still absorbed in this most delightful of outdoor sports  here comes frank minot looking as solemn as a judge cried one as a tall fellow of sixteen spun by with a set look about the mouth and a keen sparkle of the eyes fixed on the distant goal with a doordie expression    heres molly loo   and little boo  sang out another and down came a girl with flying hair carrying a small boy behind her so fat that his short legs stuck out from the sides and his round face looked over her shoulder like a full moon  theres gus burton doesnt he go it and such a very long boy whizzed by that it looked almost as if his heels were at the top of the hill when his head was at the bottom  hurrah for ed devlin and a general shout greeted a sweetfaced lad with a laugh on his lips a fine color on his brown cheek and a gay word for every girl he passed  laura and lotty keep to the safe coast into the meadow and molly loo is the only girl that dares to try this long one to the pond i wouldnt for the world the ice cant be strong yet though it is cold enough to freeze ones nose off said a timid damsel who sat hugging a post and screaming whenever a mischievous lad shook the fence  no she isnt heres jack and jill going like fury    clear the track   for jolly jack  sang the boys who had rhymes and nicknames for nearly every one  down came a gay red sled bearing a boy who seemed all smile and sunshine so white were his teeth so golden was his hair so bright and happy his whole air behind him clung a little gypsy of a girl with black eyes and hair cheeks as red as her hood and a face full of fun and sparkle as she waved jacks blue tippet like a banner with one hand and held on with the other  jill goes wherever jack does and he lets her hes such a goodnatured chap he cant say no  to a girl slyly added one of the boys who had wished to borrow the red sled and had been politely refused because jill wanted it  hes the nicest boy in the world for he never gets mad said the timid young lady recalling the many times jack had shielded her from the terrors which beset her path to school in the shape of cows dogs and boys who made faces and called her fraidcat  he doesnt dare to get mad with jill for shed take his head off in two minutes if he did growled joe flint still smarting from the rebuke jill had given him for robbing the little ones of their safe coast because he fancied it  she wouldnt shes a dear you neednt sniff at her because she is poor shes ever so much brighter than you are or she wouldnt always be at the head of your class old joe cried the girls standing by their friend with a unanimity which proved what a favorite she was  joe subsided with as scornful a curl to his nose as its chilly state permitted and merry grant introduced a subject of general interest by asking abruptly  who is going to the candyscrape tonight  all of us frank invited the whole set and we shall have a tiptop time we always do at the minots cried sue the timid trembler  jack said there was a barrel of molasses in the house so there would be enough for all to eat and some to carry away they know how to do things handsomely and the speaker licked his lips as if already tasting the feast in store for him  mrs minot is a mother worth having said molly loo coming up with boo on the sled and she knew what it was to need a mother for she had none and tried to care for the little brother with maternal love and patience  she is just as sweet as she can be declared merry enthusiastically  especially when she has a candyscrape said joe trying to be amiable lest he should be left out of the party  whereat they all laughed and went gayly away for a farewell frolic as the sun was setting and the keen wind nipped fingers and toes as well as noses  down they went one after another on the various coastssolemn frank long gus gallant ed flyaway molly loo pretty laura and lotty grumpy joe sweetfaced merry with sue shrieking wildly behind her gay jack and gypsy jill always togetherone and all bubbling over with the innocent jollity born of healthful exercise people passing in the road below looked up and smiled involuntarily at the redcheeked lads and lasses filling the frosty air with peals of laughter and cries of triumph as they flew by in every conceivable attitude for the fun was at its height now and the oldest and gravest observers felt a glow of pleasure as they looked remembering their own young days  jack take me down that coast joe said i wouldnt dare to do it so i must commanded jill as they paused for breath after the long trudge up hill jill of course was not her real name but had been given because of her friendship with jack who so admired janey pecqs spirit and fun  i guess i wouldnt it is very bumpy and ends in a big drift not half so nice as this one hop on and well have a good spin across the pond and jack brought thunderbolt round with a skilful swing and an engaging air that would have won obedience from anybody but wilful jill  it is very nice but i wont be told i dont dare by any boy in the world if you are afraid ill go alone and before he could speak she had snatched the rope from his hand thrown herself upon the sled and was off helterskelter down the most dangerous coast on the hillside  she did not get far however for starting in a hurry she did not guide her steed with care and the red charger landed her in the snow halfway down where she lay laughing till jack came to pick her up  if you will go ill take you down all right im not afraid for ive done it a dozen times with the other fellows but we gave it up because it is short and bad he said still goodnatured though a little hurt at the charge of cowardice for jack was as brave as a little lion and with the best sort of braverythe courage to do right  so it is but i must do it a few times or joe will plague me and spoil my fun tonight answered jill shaking her skirts and rubbing her blue hands wet and cold with the snow  here put these on i never use them keep them if they fit i only carry them to please mother and jack pulled out a pair of red mittens with the air of a boy used to giving away  they are lovely warm and they do fit must be too small for your paws so ill knit you a new pair for christmas and make you wear them too said jill putting on the mittens with a nod of thanks and ending her speech with a stamp of her rubber boots to enforce her threat  jack laughed and up they trudged to the spot whence the three coasts diverged  now which will you have he asked with a warning look in the honest blue eyes which often unconsciously controlled naughty jill against her will  that one and the red mitten pointed firmly to the perilous path just tried  you will do it  i will  come on then and hold tight  jacks smile was gone now and he waited without a word while jill tucked herself up then took his place in front and off they went on the brief breathless trip straight into the drift by the fence below  i dont see anything very awful in that come up and have another joe is watching us and id like to show him that we arent afraid of anything said jill with a defiant glance at a distant boy who had paused to watch the descent  it is a regular gobang if that is what you like answered jack as they plowed their way up again  it is you boys think girls like little mean coasts without any fun or danger in them as if we couldnt be brave and strong as well as you give me three gobangs and then well stop my tumble doesnt count so give me two more and then ill be good  jill took her seat as she spoke and looked up with such a rosy pleading face that jack gave in at once and down they went again raising a cloud of glittering snowdust as they reined up in fine style with their feet on the fence  its just splendid now one more cried jill excited by the cheers of a sleighing party passing below  proud of his skill jack marched back resolved to make the third go the crowning achievement of the afternoon while jill pranced after him as lightly as if the big boots were the famous sevenleagued ones and chattering about the candyscrape and whether there would be nuts or not  so full were they of this important question that they piled on haphazard and started off still talking so busily that jill forgot to hold tight and jack to steer carefully alas for the candyscrape that never was to be alas for poor thunderbolt blindly setting forth on the last trip he ever made and oh alas for jack and jill who wilfully chose the wrong road and ended their fun for the winter no one knew how it happened but instead of landing in the drift or at the fence there was a great crash against the bars a dreadful plunge off the steep bank a sudden scattering of girl boy sled fence earth and snow all about the road two cries and then silence  i knew theyd do it and standing on the post where he had perched joe waved his arms and shouted smashup smashup run run like a raven croaking over a battlefield when the fight was done  down rushed boys and girls ready to laugh or cry as the case might be for accidents will happen on the bestregulated coastinggrounds they found jack sitting up looking about him with a queer dazed expression while an ugly cut on the forehead was bleeding in a way which sobered the boys and frightened the girls half out of their wits  hes killed hes killed wailed sue hiding her face and beginning to cry  no im not ill be all right when i get my breath wheres jill asked jack stoutly though still too giddy to see straight  the group about him opened and his comrade in misfortune was discovered lying quietly in the snow with all the pretty color shocked out of her face by the fall and winking rapidly as if half stunned but no wounds appeared and when asked if she was dead she answered in a vague sort of way  i guess not is jack hurt  broken his head croaked joe stepping aside that she might behold the fallen hero vainly trying to look calm and cheerful with red drops running down his cheek and a lump on his forehead  jill shut her eyes and waved the girls away saying faintly  never mind me go and see to him  dont im all right and jack tried to get up in order to prove that headers off a bank were mere trifles to him but at the first movement of the left leg he uttered a sharp cry of pain and would have fallen if gus had not caught and gently laid him down  what is it old chap asked frank kneeling beside him really alarmed now the hurts seeming worse than mere bumps which were common affairs among baseball players and not worth much notice  i lit on my head but i guess ive broken my leg dont frighten mother and jack held fast to franks arm as he looked into the anxious face bent over him for though the elder tyrannized over the younger the brothers loved one another dearly  lift his head frank while i tie my handkerchief round to stop the bleeding said a quiet voice as ed devlin laid a handful of soft snow on the wound and jacks face brightened as he turned to thank the one big boy who never was rough with the small ones  better get him right home advised gus who stood by looking on with his little sisters laura and lotty clinging to him  take jill too for its my opinion she has broken her back she cant stir one bit announced molly loo with a droll air of triumph as if rather pleased than otherwise to have her patient hurt the worse for jacks wound was very effective and molly had a taste for the tragic  this cheerful statement was greeted with a wail from susan and howls from boo who had earned that name from the ease with which on all occasions he could burst into a dismal roar without shedding a tear and stop as suddenly as he began  oh i am so sorry it was my fault i shouldnt have let her do it said jack distressfully  it was all my fault i made him if id broken every bone ive got it would serve me right dont help me anybody im a wicked thing and i deserve to lie here and freeze and starve and die cried jill piling up punishments in her remorseful anguish of mind and body  but we want to help you and we can settle about blame by and by whispered merry with a kiss for she adored dashing jill and never would own that she did wrong  here come the woodsleds just in time ill cut away and tell one of them to hurry up and freeing himself from his sisters gus went off at a great pace proving that the long legs carried a sensible head as well as a kind heart  as the first sled approached an air of relief pervaded the agitated party for it was driven by mr grant a big benevolentlooking farmer who surveyed the scene with the sympathetic interest of a man and a father  had a little accident have you well thats a pretty likely place for a spill tried it once myself and broke the bridge of my nose he said tapping that massive feature with a laugh which showed that fifty years of farming had not taken all the boy out of him now then lets see about this little chore and lively too for its late and these parties ought to be housed he added throwing down his whip pushing back his cap and nodding at the wounded with a reassuring smile  jill first please sir said ed the gentle squire of dames spreading his overcoat on the sled as eagerly as ever raleigh laid down his velvet cloak for a queen to walk upon  all right just lay easy my dear and i wont hurt you a mite if i can help it  careful as mr grant was jill could have screamed with pain as he lifted her but she set her lips and bore it with the courage of a little indian for all the lads were looking on and jill was proud to show that a girl could bear as much as a boy she hid her face in the coat as soon as she was settled to hide the tears that would come and by the time jack was placed beside her she had quite a little cistern of salt water stored up in eds coatpocket  then the mournful procession set forth mr grant driving the oxen the girls clustering about the interesting invalids on the sled while the boys came behind like a guard of honor leaving the hill deserted by all but joe who had returned to hover about the fatal fence and poor thunderbolt split asunder lying on the bank to mark the spot where the great catastrophe occurred     chapter ii two penitents   jack and jill never cared to say much about the night which followed the first coasting party of the season for it was the saddest and the hardest their short lives had ever known jack suffered most in body for the setting of the broken leg was such a painful job that it wrung several sharp cries from him and made frank who helped quite weak and white with sympathy when it was over the wounded head ached dreadfully and the poor boy felt as if bruised all over for he had the worst of the fall dr whiting spoke cheerfully of the case and made so light of broken legs that jack innocently asked if he should not be up in a week or so  well no it usually takes twentyone days for bones to knit and young ones make quick work of it answered the doctor with a last scientific tuck to the various bandages which made jack feel like a hapless chicken trussed for the spit  twentyone days three whole weeks in bed i shouldnt call that quick work groaned the dismayed patient whose experience of illness had been limited  it is a forty days job young man and you must make up your mind to bear it like a hero we will do our best but next time look before you leap and save your bones goodnight youll feel better in the morning no jigs remember and off went the busy doctor for another look at jill who had been ordered to bed and left to rest till the other case was attended to  any one would have thought jacks plight much the worse but the doctor looked more sober over jills hurt back than the boys compound fractures and the poor little girl had a very bad quarter of an hour while he was trying to discover the extent of the injury  keep her quiet and time will show how much damage is done was all he said in her hearing but if she had known that he told mrs pecq he feared serious consequences she would not have wondered why her mother cried as she rubbed the numb limbs and placed the pillows so tenderly  jill suffered most in her mind for only a sharp stab of pain now and then reminded her of her body but her remorseful little soul gave her no peace for thinking of jack whose bruises and breakages her lively fancy painted in the darkest colors  oh dont be good to me mammy i made him go and now hes hurt dreadfully and may die and it is all my fault and everybody ought to hate me sobbed poor jill as a neighbor left the room after reporting in a minute manner how jack screamed when his leg was set and how frank was found white as a sheet with his head under the pump while gus restored the tone of his friends nerves by pumping as if the house was on fire  whist my lass and go to sleep take a sup of the good wine mrs minot sent for you are as cold as a clod and it breaks my heart to see my janey so  i cant go to sleep i dont see how jacks mother could send me anything when ive half killed him i want to be cold and ache and have horrid things done to me oh if i ever get out of this bed ill be the best girl in the world to pay for this see if i aint and jill gave such a decided nod that her tears flew all about the pillow like a shower  youd better begin at once for you wont get out of that bed for a long while im afraid my lamb sighed her mother unable to conceal the anxiety that lay so heavy on her heart  am i hurt badly mammy  i fear it lass  im glad of it i ought to be worse than jack and i hope i am ill bear it well and be good right away sing mammy and ill try to go to sleep to please you  jill shut her eyes with sudden and unusual meekness and before her mother had crooned half a dozen verses of an old ballad the little black head lay still upon the pillow and repentant jill was fast asleep with a red mitten in her hand  mrs pecq was an englishwoman who had left montreal at the death of her husband a french canadian and had come to live in the tiny cottage which stood near mrs minots big house separated only by an arborvitae hedge a sad silent person who had seen better days but said nothing about them and earned her bread by sewing nursing work in the factory or anything that came in her way being anxious to educate her little girl now as she sat beside the bed in the small poor room that hope almost died within her for here was the child laid up for months probably and the one ambition and pleasure of the solitary womans life was to see janey pecqs name over all the high marks in the schoolreports she proudly brought home  shell win through please heaven and ill see my lass a gentlewoman yet thanks to the good friend in yonder who will never let her want for care thought the poor soul looking out into the gloom where a long ray of light streamed from the great house warm and comfortable upon the cottage like the spirit of kindness which made the inmates friends and neighbors  meantime that other mother sat by her boys bed as anxious but with better hope for mrs minot made trouble sweet and helpful by the way in which she bore it and her boys were learning of her how to find silver linings to the clouds that must come into the bluest skies  jack lay wide awake with hot cheeks and throbbing head and all sorts of queer sensations in the broken leg the soothing potion he had taken did not affect him yet and he tried to beguile the weary time by wondering who came and went below gentle rings at the front door and mysterious tappings at the back had been going on all the evening for the report of the accident had grown astonishingly in its travels and at eight oclock the general belief was that jack had broken both legs fractured his skull and lay at the point of death while jill had dislocated one shoulder and was bruised black and blue from top to toe such being the case it is no wonder that anxious playmates and neighbors haunted the doorsteps of the two houses and that offers of help poured in  frank having tied up the bell and put a notice in the lighted sidewindow saying go to the back door sat in the parlor supported by his chum gus while ed played softly on the piano hoping to lull jack to sleep it did soothe him for a very sweet friendship existed between the tall youth and the lad of thirteen ed went with the big fellows but always had a kind word for the smaller boys and affectionate jack never ashamed to show his love was often seen with his arm round eds shoulder as they sat together in the pleasant red parlors where all the young people were welcome and frank was king  is the pain any easier my darling asked mrs minot leaning over the pillow where the golden head lay quiet for a moment  not much i forget it listening to the music dear old ed is playing all my favorite tunes and it is very nice i guess he feels pretty sorry about me  they all do frank could not talk of it gus wouldnt go home to tea he was so anxious to do something for us joe brought back the bits of your poor sled because he didnt like to leave them lying round for any one to carry off he said and you might like them to remember your fall by  jack tried to laugh but it was rather a failure though he managed to say cheerfully  that was good of old joe i wouldnt lend him thunderbolt for fear hed hurt it couldnt have smashed it up better than i did could he dont think i want any pieces to remind me of that fall i just wish youd seen us mother it must have been a splendid spill to look at any way  no thank you id rather not even try to imagine my precious boy going heels over head down that dreadful hill no more pranks of that sort for some time jacky and mrs minot looked rather pleased on the whole to have her venturesome bird safe under her maternal wing  no coasting till some time in january what a fool i was to do it gobangs always are dangerous and thats the fun of the thing oh dear  jack threw his arms about and frowned darkly but never said a word of the wilful little baggage who had led him into mischief he was too much of a gentleman to tell on a girl though it cost him an effort to hold his tongue because mammas good opinion was very precious to him and he longed to explain she knew all about it however for jill had been carried into the house reviling herself for the mishap and even in the midst of her own anxiety for her boy mrs minot understood the state of the case without more words so she now set his mind at rest by saying quietly  foolish fun as you see dear another time stand firm and help jill to control her headstrong will when you learn to yield less and she more there will be no scrapes like this to try us all  ill remember mother i hate not to be obliging but i guess it would have saved us lots of trouble if id said no in the beginning i tried to but she would go poor jill ill take better care of her next time is she very ill mamma  i can tell you better tomorrow she does not suffer much and we hope there is no great harm done  i wish she had a nice place like this to be sick in it must be very poky in those little rooms said jack as his eye roved round the large chamber where he lay so cosey warm and pleasant with the gay chintz curtains draping doors and windows the rosy carpet comfortable chairs and a fire glowing in the grate  i shall see that she suffers for nothing so dont trouble your kind heart about her tonight but try to sleep thats what you need answered his mother wetting the bandage on his forehead and putting a cool hand on the flushed cheeks  jack obediently closed his eyes and listened while the boys sang the sweet by and by softening their rough young voices for his sake till the music was as soft as a lullaby he lay so still his mother thought he was off but presently a tear slipped out and rolled down the red cheek wetting her hand as it passed  my blessed boy what is it she whispered with a touch and a tone that only mothers have  the blue eyes opened wide and jacks own sunshiny smile broke through the tears that filled them as he said with a sniff  everybody is so good to me i cant help making a noodle of myself  you are not a noodle cried mamma resenting the epithet one of the sweet things about pain and sorrow is that they show us how well we are loved how much kindness there is in the world and how easily we can make others happy in the same way when they need help and sympathy dont forget that little son  dont see how i can with you to show me how nice it is kiss me goodnight and then ill be good as jill says  nestling his head upon his mothers arm jack lay quiet till lulled by the music of his mates he drowsed away into the dreamless sleep which is nurse natures healthiest soothing sirup for weary souls and bodies     chapter iii ward no 1   for some days nothing was seen and little was heard of the dear sufferers as the old ladies called them but they were not forgotten the first words uttered when any of the young people met were how is jack seen jill yet and all waited with impatience for the moment when they could be admitted to their favorite mates more than ever objects of interest now  meantime the captives spent the first few days in sleep pain and trying to accept the hard fact that school and play were done with for months perhaps but young spirits are wonderfully elastic and soon cheer up and healthy young bodies heal fast or easily adapt themselves to new conditions so our invalids began to mend on the fourth day and to drive their nurses distracted with efforts to amuse them before the first week was over  the most successful attempt originated in ward no 1 as mrs minot called jacks apartment and we will give our sympathizing readers some idea of this place which became the stage whereon were enacted many varied and remarkable scenes  each of the minot boys had his own room and there collected his own treasures and trophies arranged to suit his convenience and taste franks was full of books maps machinery chemical messes and geometrical drawings which adorned the walls like intricate cobwebs a big chair where he read and studied with his heels higher than his head a basket of apples for refreshment at all hours of the day or night and an immense inkstand in which several pens were always apparently bathing their feet were the principal ornaments of his scholastic retreat  jacks hobby was athletic sports for he was bent on having a strong and active body for his happy little soul to live and enjoy itself in so a severe simplicity reigned in his apartment in summer especially for then his floor was bare his windows were uncurtained and the chairs uncushioned the bed being as narrow and hard as napoleons the only ornaments were dumbbells whips bats rods skates boxinggloves a big bathpan and a small library consisting chiefly of books on games horses health hunting and travels in winter his mother made things more comfortable by introducing rugs curtains and a fire jack also relented slightly in the severity of his training occasionally indulging in the national buckwheat cake instead of the prescribed oatmeal porridge for breakfast omitting his cold bath when the thermometer was below zero and dancing at night instead of running a given distance by day  now however he was a helpless captive given over to all sorts of coddling laziness and luxury and there was a droll mixture of mirth and melancholy in his face as he lay trussed up in bed watching the comforts which had suddenly robbed his room of its spartan simplicity a delicious couch was there with frank reposing in its depths half hidden under several folios which he was consulting for a history of the steamengine the subject of his next composition  a whitecovered table stood near with all manner of dainties set forth in a way to tempt the sternest principles vases of flowers bloomed on the chimneypiecegifts from anxious young ladies left with their love frivolous storybooks and picturepapers strewed the bed now shrouded in effeminate chintz curtains beneath which jack lay like a wounded warrior in his tent but the saddest sight for our crippled athlete was a glimpse through a halfopened door at the beloved dumbbells bats balls boxinggloves and snowshoes all piled ignominiously away in the bathpan mournfully recalling the fact that their day was over now at least for some time  he was about to groan dismally when his eye fell on a sight which made him swallow the groan and cough instead as if it choked him a little the sight was his mothers face as she sat in a low chair rolling bandages with a basket beside her in which were piles of old linen lint plaster and other matters needed for the dressing of wounds as he looked jack remembered how steadily and tenderly she had stood by him all through the hard times just past and how carefully she had bathed and dressed his wound each day in spite of the effort it cost her to give him pain or even see him suffer  thats a better sort of strength than swinging twentypound dumbbells or running races i guess ill try for that kind too and not howl or let her see me squirm when the doctor hurts thought the boy as he saw that gentle face so pale and tired with much watching and anxiety yet so patient serene and cheerful that it was like sunshine  lie down and take a good nap mother dear i feel firstrate and frank can see to me if i want anything do now he added with a persuasive nod toward the couch and a boyish relish in stirring up his lazy brother  after some urging mamma consented to go to her room for forty winks leaving jack in the care of frank begging him to be as quiet as possible if the dear boy wished to sleep and to amuse him if he did not  being worn out mrs minot lengthened her forty winks into a three hours nap and as the dear boy scorned repose mr frank had his hands full while on guard  ill read to you heres watt arkwright fulton and a lot of capital fellows with pictures that will do your heart good have a bit will you asked the new nurse flapping the leaves invitinglyfor frank had a passion for such things and drew steamengines all over his slate as tommy traddles drew hosts of skeletons when low in his spirits  i dont want any of your old boilers and stokers and whirligigs im tired of reading and want something regularly jolly answered jack who had been chasing white buffaloes with the hunters of the west till he was a trifle tired and fractious  play cribbage euchre anything you like and frank obligingly disinterred himself from under the folios feeling that it was hard for a fellow to lie flat a whole week  no fun just two of us wish school was over so the boys would come in doctor said i might see them now  theyll be along by and by and ill hail them till then what shall we do im your man for anything only put a name to it  just wish i had a telegraph or a telephone so i could talk to jill wouldnt it be fun to pipe across and get an answer  ill make either you say and frank looked as if trifles of that sort were to be had for the asking  could you really  well start the telegraph first then you can send things over if you like said frank prudently proposing the surest experiment  go ahead then id like that and so would jill for i know she wants to hear from me  theres one trouble though i shall have to leave you alone for a few minutes while i rig up the ropes and frank looked sober for he was a faithful boy and did not want to desert his post  oh never mind i wont want anything if i do i can pound for ann  and wake mother ill fix you a better way than that and full of inventive genius our young edison spliced the poker to part of a fishingrod in a jiffy making a longhandled hook which reached across the room  theres an arm for you now hook away and lets see how it works he said handing over the instrument to jack who proceeded to show its unexpected capabilities by hooking the cloth off the table in attempting to get his handkerchief catching frank by the hair when fishing for a book and breaking a pane of glass in trying to draw down the curtain  its so everlasting long i cant manage it laughed jack as it finally caught in his bedhangings and nearly pulled them ring and all down upon his head  let it alone unless you need something very much and dont bother about the glass its just what we want for the telegraph wire or rope to go through keep still and ill have the thing running in ten minutes and delighted with the job frank hurried away leaving jack to compose a message to send as soon as it was possible  what in the world is that flying across the minots yarda brown hen or a boys kite exclaimed old miss hopkins peering out of her window at the singular performances going on in her opposite neighbors garden  first frank appeared with a hatchet and chopped a clear space in the hedge between his own house and the cottage next a clothes line was passed through this aperture and fastened somewhere on the other side lastly a small covered basket slung on this rope was seen hitching along drawn either way by a set of strings then as if satisfied with his job frank retired whistling hail columbia  its those children at their pranks again i thought broken bones wouldnt keep them out of mischief long said the old lady watching with great interest the mysterious basket travelling up and down the rope from the big house to the cottage  if she had seen what came and went over the wires of the great international telegraph she would have laughed till her spectacles flew off her roman nose a letter from jack with a large orange went first explaining the new enterprise  dear jillits too bad you cant come over to see me i am pretty well but awful tired of keeping still i want to see you ever so much frank has fixed us a telegraph so we can write and send things wont it be jolly i cant look out to see him do it but when you pull your string my little bell rings and i know a message is coming i send you an orange do you like gorver jelly people send in lots of goodies and we will go halves goodby  jack  away went the basket and in fifteen minutes it came back from the cottage with nothing in it but the orange  hullo is she mad asked jack as frank brought the despatch for him to examine  but at the first touch the hollow peel opened and out fell a letter two gumdrops and an owl made of a peanut with round eyes drawn at the end where the stem formed a funny beak two bits of straw were the legs and the face looked so like dr whiting that both boys laughed at the sight  thats so like jill shed make fun if she was half dead lets see what she says and jack read the little note which showed a sad neglect of the spellingbook  dear jackyi cant stir and its horrid the telly graf is very nice and we will have fun with it i never ate any gorver jelly the orange was first rate send me a book to read all about bears and ships and crockydiles the doctor was coming to see you so i sent him the quickest way molly loo says it is dreadful lonesome at school without us yours truly  jill  jack immediately despatched the book and a sample of guava jelly which unfortunately upset on the way to the great detriment of the wild beasts of asia and africa jill promptly responded with the loan of a tiny black kitten who emerged spitting and scratching to jacks great delight and he was cudgelling his brains as to how a fat white rabbit could be transported when a shrill whistle from without saved jill from that inconvenient offering  its the fellows do you want to see them asked frank gazing down with calm superiority upon the three eager faces which looked up at him  guess i do and jack promptly threw the kitten overboard scorning to be seen by any manly eye amusing himself with such girlish toys  bang went the front door tramp tramp tramp came six booted feet up the stairs and as frank threw wide the door three large beings paused on the threshold to deliver the courteous hullo which is the established greeting among boys on all social occasions  come along old fellows im ever so glad to see you cried the invalid with such energetic demonstrations of the arms that he looked as if about to fly or crow like an excited young cockerel  how are you major  does the leg ache much jack  mr phipps says youll have to pay for the new rails  with these characteristic greetings the gentlemen cast away their hats and sat down all grinning cheerfully and all with eyes irresistibly fixed upon the dainties which proved too much for the politeness of everhungry boys  help yourselves said jack with a hospitable wave all the dear old ladies in town have been sending in nice things and i cant begin to eat them up lend a hand and clear away this lot or we shall have to throw them out of the window bring on the doughnuts and the tarts and the shaky stuff in the entry closet frank and lets have a lark  no sooner said than done gus took the tarts joe the doughnuts ed the jelly and frank suggested spoons all round for the italian cream a few trifles in the way of custard fruit and wafer biscuits were not worth mentioning but every dish was soon emptied and jack said as he surveyed the scene of devastation with great satisfaction  call again tomorrow gentlemen and we will have another bout free lunches at 5 pm till further notice now tell me all the news  for half an hour five tongues went like mill clappers and there is no knowing when they would have stopped if the little bell had not suddenly rung with a violence that made them jump  thats jill see what she wants frank and while his brother sent off the basket jack told about the new invention and invited his mates to examine and admire  they did so and shouted with merriment when the next despatch from jill arrived a pasteboard jumpingjack with one leg done up in cottonwool to preserve the likeness and a great lump of molasses candy in a brown paper with accompanying note  dear siri saw the boys go in and know you are having a nice time so i send over the candy molly loo and merry brought me mammy says i cant eat it and it will all melt away if i keep it also a picture of jack minot who will dance on one leg and waggle the other and make you laugh i wish i could come too dont you hate grewel i doin haste  jp  lets all send her a letter proposed jack and out came pens ink paper and the lamp and every one fell to scribbling a droll collection was the result for frank drew a picture of the fatal fall with broken rails flying in every direction jack with his head swollen to the size of a balloon and jill in two pieces while the various boys and girls were hit off with a sly skill that gave gus legs like a stork molly loo hair several yards long and boo a series of visible howls coming out of an immense mouth in the shape of os the oxen were particularly good for their horns branched like those of the moose and mr grant had a patriarchal beard which waved in the breeze as he bore the wounded girl to a sled very like a funeral pyre the stakes being crowned with big mittens like torches  you ought to be an artist i never saw such a dabster as you are thats the very moral of joe all in a bunch on the fence with a blot to show how purple his nose was said gus holding up the sketch for general criticism and admiration  id rather have a red nose than legs like a grasshopper so you neednt twit daddy growled joe quite unconscious that a blot actually did adorn his nose as he labored over a brief despatch  the boys enjoyed the joke and one after the other read out his message to the captive lady  dear jillsorry you aint here great fun jack pretty lively laura and lot would send love if they knew of the chance fly round and get well  gus  dear gilliflowerhope you are pretty comfortable in your dungeon cell would you like a serenade when the moon comes hope you will soon be up again for we miss you very much shall be very happy to help in any way i can love to your mother your true friend  ed  miss pecq  dear madami am happy to tell you that we are all well and hope you are the same i gave jem cox a licking because he went to your desk you had better send for your books you wont have to pay for the sled or the fence jack says he will see to it we have been having a spread over here firstrate things i wouldnt mind breaking a leg if i had such good grub and no chores to do no more now from yours with esteem  joseph p flint  joe thought that an elegant epistle having copied portions of it from the letter writer and proudly read it off to the boys who assured him that jill would be much impressed  now jack hurry up and let us send the lot off for we must go said gus as frank put the letters in the basket and the clatter of teathings was heard below  im not going to show mine its private and you mustnt look answered jack patting down an envelope with such care that no one had a chance to peep  but joe had seen the little note copied and while the others were at the window working the telegraph he caught up the original carelessly thrust by jack under the pillow and read it aloud before any one knew what he was about  my deari wish i could send you some of my good times as i cant i send you much love and i hope you will try and be patient as i am going to for it was our fault and we must not make a fuss now aint mothers sweet mine is coming over tomorrow to see you and tell me how you are this round thing is a kiss for goodnight  your jack  isnt that spoony youd better hide your face i think hes getting to be a regular mollycoddle isnt he jeered joe as the boys laughed and then grew sober seeing jacks head buried in the bedclothes after sending a pillow at his tormentor  it nearly hit mrs minot coming in with her patients tea on a tray and at sight of her the guests hurriedly took leave joe nearly tumbling downstairs to escape from frank who would have followed if his mother had not said quickly stay and tell me what is the matter  only teasing jack a bit dont be mad old boy joe didnt mean any harm and it was rather soft now wasnt it asked frank trying to appease the wounded feelings of his brother  i charged you not to worry him those boys were too much for the poor dear and i ought not to have left him said mamma as she vainly endeavored to find and caress the yellow head burrowed so far out of sight that nothing but one red ear was visible  he liked it and we got on capitally till joe roughed him about jill ah joes getting it now i thought gus and ed would do that little job for me added frank running to the window as the sound of stifled cries and laughter reached him  the red ear heard also and jack popped up his head to ask with interest  what are they doing to him  rolling him in the snow and hes howling like fun  serves him right muttered jack with a frown then as a wail arose suggestive of an unpleasant mixture of snow in the mouth and thumps on the back he burst out laughing and said goodnaturedly go and stop them frank i wont mind only tell him it was a mean trick hurry gus is so strong he doesnt know how his pounding hurts  off ran frank and jack told his wrongs to his mother she sympathized heartily and saw no harm in the affectionate little note which would please jill and help her to bear her trials patiently  it isnt silly to be fond of her is it she is so nice and funny and tries to be good and likes me and i wont be ashamed of my friends if folks do laugh protested jack with a rap of his teaspoon  no dear it is quite kind and proper and id rather have you play with a merry little girl than with rough boys till you are big enough to hold your own answered mamma putting the cup to his lips that the reclining lad might take his broma without spilling  pooh i dont mean that im strong enough now to take care of myself cried jack stoutly i can thrash joe any day if i like just look at my arm theres muscle for you and up went a sleeve to the great danger of overturning the tray as the boy proudly displayed his biceps and expanded his chest both of which were very fine for a lad of his years if id been on my legs he wouldnt have dared to insult me and it was cowardly to hit a fellow when he was down  mrs minot wanted to laugh at jacks indignation but the bell rang and she had to go and pull in the basket much amused at the new game  burning to distinguish herself in the eyes of the big boys jill had sent over a tall red flannel nightcap which she had been making for some proposed christmas plays and added the following verse for she was considered a gifted rhymester at the game parties    when it comes night   we put out the light   some blow with a puff   some turn down and snuff   but neat folks prefer   a nice extinguisher   so here i send you back   one to put on mr jack  now i call that regularly smart not one of us could do it and i just wish joe was here to see it i want to send once more something good for tea she hates gruel so and the last despatch which the great international telegraph carried that day was a baked apple and a warm muffin with j ms best regards     chapter iv ward no 2   things were not so gay in ward no 2 for mrs pecq was very busy and jill had nothing to amuse her but flying visits from the girls and such little plays as she could invent for herself in bed fortunately she had a lively fancy and so got on pretty well till keeping still grew unbearable and the active child ached in every limb to be up and out that however was impossible for the least attempt to sit or stand brought on the pain that took her breath away and made her glad to lie flat again the doctor spoke cheerfully but looked sober and mrs pecq began to fear that janey was to be a cripple for life she said nothing but jills quick eyes saw an added trouble in the always anxious face and it depressed her spirits though she never guessed half the mischief the fall had done  the telegraph was a great comfort and the two invalids kept up a lively correspondence not to say traffic in light articles for the great international was the only aerial express in existence but even this amusement flagged after a time neither had much to tell and when the daily health bulletins had been exchanged messages gave out and the baskets travels grew more and more infrequent neither could read all the time games were soon used up their mates were at school most of the day and after a week or two the poor children began to get pale and fractious with the confinement always so irksome to young people  i do believe the child will fret herself into a fever mem and im clean distraught to know what to do for her she never used to mind trifles but now she frets about the oddest things and i cant change them this wallpaper is well enough but she has taken a fancy that the spots on it look like spiders and it makes her nervous ive no other warm place to put her and no money for a new paper poor lass there are hard times before her im fearing  mrs pecq said this in a low voice to mrs minot who came in as often as she could to see what her neighbor needed for both mothers were anxious and sympathy drew them to one another while one woman talked the other looked about the little room not wondering in the least that jill found it hard to be contented there it was very neat but so plain that there was not even a picture on the walls nor an ornament upon the mantel except the necessary clock lamp and matchbox the paper was ugly being a deep buff with a brown figure that did look very like spiders sprawling over it and might well make one nervous to look at day after day  jill was asleep in the folding chair dr whiting had sent with a mattress to make it soft the back could be raised or lowered at will but only a few inches had been gained as yet and the thin hair pillow was all she could bear she looked very pretty as she lay with dark lashes against the feverish cheeks lips apart and a cloud of curly black locks all about the face pillowed on one arm she seemed like a brilliant little flower in that dull placefor the french blood in her veins gave her a color warmth and grace which were very charming her natural love of beauty showed itself in many ways a red ribbon had tied up her hair a gay but faded shawl was thrown over the bed and the gifts sent her were arranged with care upon the table by her side among her own few toys and treasures there was something pathetic in this childish attempt to beautify the poor place and mrs minots eyes were full as she looked at the tired woman whose one joy and comfort lay there in such sad plight  my dear soul cheer up and we will help one another through the hard times she said with a soft hand on the rough one and a look that promised much  please god we will mem with such good friends i never should complain i try not to do it but it breaks my heart to see my little lass spoiled for life most like and mrs pecq pressed the kind hand with a despondent sigh  we wont say or even think that yet everything is possible to youth and health like janeys we must keep her happy and time will do the rest im sure let us begin at once and have a surprise for her when she wakes  as she spoke mrs minot moved quietly about the room pinning the pages of several illustrated papers against the wall at the foot of the bed and placing to the best advantage the other comforts she had brought  keep up your heart neighbor i have an idea in my head which i think will help us all if i can carry it out she said cheerily as she went leaving mrs pecq to sew on jacks new nightgowns with swift fingers and the grateful wish that she might work for these good friends forever  as if the whispering and rustling had disturbed her jill soon began to stir and slowly opened the eyes which had closed so wearily on the dull december afternoon the bare wall with its brown spiders no longer confronted her but the colored print of a little girl dancing to the tune her father was playing on a guitar while a stately lady with satin dress ruff and powder stood looking on well pleased the quaint figure in its belaced frock quilted petticoat and redheeled shoes seemed to come tripping toward her in such a lifelike way that she almost saw the curls blow back heard the rustle of the rich brocade and caught the sparkle of the little maids bright eyes  oh how pretty who sent them asked jill eagerly as her eye glanced along the wall seeing other new and interesting things beyond an elephanthunt a ship in full sail a horserace and a ballroom  the good fairy who never comes emptyhanded look round a bit and you will see more pretties all for you my dearie and her mother pointed to a bunch of purple grapes in a green leaf plate a knot of bright flowers pinned on the white curtain and a gay little double gown across the foot of the bed  jill clapped her hands and was enjoying her new pleasures when in came merry and molly loo with boo of course trotting after her like a fat and amiable puppy then the good times began the gown was put on the fruit tasted and the pictures were studied like famous works of art  its a splendid plan to cover up that hateful wall id stick pictures all round and have a gallery that reminds me up in the garret at our house is a box full of old fashionbooks my aunt left i often look at them on rainy days and they are very funny ill go this minute and get every one we can pin them up or make paper dolls and away rushed molly loo with the small brother waddling behind for when he lost sight of her he was desolate indeed  the girls had fits of laughter over the queer costumes of years gone by and put up a splendid procession of ladies in full skirts towering hats pointed slippers powdered hair simpering faces and impossible waists  i do think this bride is perfectly splendid the long train and veil are so sweet said jill revelling in fine clothes as she turned from one plate to another  i like the elephants best and id give anything to go on a hunt like that cried molly loo who rode cows drove any horse she could get had nine cats and was not afraid of the biggest dog that ever barked  i fancy the dancing lesson it is so sort of splendid with the great windows gold chairs and fine folks oh i would like to live in a castle with a father and mother like that said merry who was romantic and found the old farmhouse on the hill a sad trial to her highflown ideas of elegance  now that ship setting out for some faraway place is more to my mind i weary for home now and then and mean to see it again some day and mrs pecq looked longingly at the english ship though it was evidently outward bound then as if reproaching herself for discontent she added it looks like those i used to see going off to india with a load of missionaries i came near going myself once with a lady bound for siam but i went to canada with her sister and here i am  id like to be a missionary and go where folks throw their babies to the crocodiles id watch and fish them out and have a school and bring them up and convert all the people till they knew better said warmhearted molly loo who befriended every abused animal and forlorn child she met  we neednt go to africa to be missionaries they have em nearer home and need em too in all the big cities there are a many and they have their hands full with the poor the wicked and the helpless one can find that sort of work anywhere if one has a mind said mrs pecq  i wish we had some to do here id so like to go round with baskets of tea and rice and give out tracts and talk to people wouldnt you girls asked molly much taken with the new idea  it would be rather nice to have a society all to ourselves and have meetings and resolutions and things answered merry who was fond of little ceremonies and always went to the sewing circle with her mother  we wouldnt let the boys come in wed have it a secret society as they do their temperance lodge and wed have badges and passwords and grips it would be fun if we can only get some heathen to work at cried jill ready for fresh enterprises of every sort  i can tell you someone to begin on right away said her mother nodding at her as wild a little savage as id wish to see take her in hand and make a prettymannered lady of her begin at home my lass and youll find missionary work enough for a while  now mammy you mean me well i will begin and ill be so good folks wont know me being sick makes naughty children behave in storybooks ill see if live ones cant and jill put on such a sanctified face that the girls laughed and asked for their missions also thinking they would be the same  you merry might do a deal at home helping mother and setting the big brothers a good example one little girl in a house can do pretty much as she will especially if she has a mind to make plain things nice and comfortable and not long for castles before she knows how to do her own tasks well was the first unexpected reply  merry colored but took the reproof sweetly resolving to do what she could and surprised to find how many ways seemed open to her after a few minutes thought  where shall i begin im not afraid of a dozen crocodiles after miss bat and molly loo looked about her with a fierce air having had practice in battles with the old lady who kept her fathers house  well dear you havent far to look for as nice a little heathen as youd wish and mrs pecq glanced at boo who sat on the floor staring hard at them attracted by the dread word crocodile he had a cold and no handkerchief his little hands were red with chilblains his clothes shabby he had untidy darns in the knees of his stockings and a head of tight curls that evidently had not been combed for some time  yes i know he is and i try to keep him decent but i forget and he hates to be fixed and miss bat doesnt care and father laughs when i talk about it  poor molly loo looked much ashamed as she made excuses trying at the same time to mend matters by seizing boo and dusting him all over with her handkerchief giving a pull at his hair as if ringing bells and then dumping him down again with the despairing exclamation yes were a pair of heathens and theres no one to save us if i dont  that was true enough for mollys father was a busy man careless of everything but his mills miss bat was old and lazy and felt as if she might take life easy after serving the motherless children for many years as well as she knew how molly was beginning to see how much amiss things were at home and old enough to feel mortified though as yet she had done nothing to mend the matter except be kind to the little boy  you will my dear answered mrs pecq encouragingly for she knew all about it now youve each got a mission let us see how well you will get on keep it secret if you like and report once a week ill be a member and well do great things yet  we wont begin till after christmas there is so much to do we never shall have time for any more dont tell and well start fair at new years if not before said jill taking the lead as usual then they went on with the gay ladies who certainly were heathen enough in dress to be in sad need of conversionto commonsense at least  i feel as if i was at a party said jill after a pause occupied in surveying her gallery with great satisfaction for dress was her delight and here she had every conceivable style and color  talking of parties isnt it too bad that we must give up our christmas fun cant get on without you and jack so we are not going to do a thing but just have our presents said merry sadly as they began to fit different heads and bodies together to try droll effects  i shall be all well in a fortnight i know but jack wont for it will take more than a month to mend his poor leg may be they will have a dance in the boys big room and he can look on suggested jill with a glance at the dancing damsel on the wall for she dearly loved it and never guessed how long it would be before her light feet would keep time to music again  youd better give jack a hint about the party send over some smart ladies and say they have come to his christmas ball proposed audacious molly loo always ready for fun  so they put a preposterous green bonnet topheavy with plumes on a little lady in yellow who sat in a carriage the lady beside her in winter costume of velvet pelisse and ermine boa was fitted to a brides head with its orange flowers and veil and these works of art were sent over to jack labelled miss laura and lotty burton going to the minots christmas balla piece of naughtiness on jills part for she knew jack liked the pretty sisters whose gentle manners made her own wild ways seem all the more blamable  no answer came for a long time and the girls had almost forgotten their joke in a game of letters when tingle tangle went the bell and the basket came in heavily laden a roll of colored papers was tied outside and within was a box that rattled a green and silver horn a roll of narrow ribbons a spool of strong thread some large needles and a note from mrs minot  dear jilli think of having a christmas tree so that our invalids can enjoy it and all your elegant friends are cordially invited knowing that you would like to help i send some paper for sugarplum horns and some beads for necklaces they will brighten the tree and please the girls for themselves or their dolls jack sends you a horn for a pattern and will you make a laddernecklace to show him how let me know if you need anything  yours in haste  anna minot  she knew what the child would like bless her kind heart said mrs pecq to herself and something brighter than the most silvery bead shone on jacks shirtsleeve as she saw the rapture of jill over the new work and the promised pleasure  joyful cries greeted the opening of the box for bunches of splendid large bugles appeared in all colors and a lively discussion went on as to the best contrasts jill could not refuse to let her friends share the pretty work and soon three necklaces glittered on three necks as each admired her own choice  id be willing to hurt my back dreadfully if i could lie and do such lovely things all day said merry as she reluctantly put down her needle at last for home duties waited to be done and looked more than ever distasteful after this new pleasure  so would i oh do you think mrs minot will let you fill the horns when they are done id love to help you then be sure you send for me cried molly loo arching her neck like a proud pigeon to watch the glitter of her purple and gold necklace on her brown gown  im afraid you couldnt be trusted you love sweeties so and im sure boo couldnt but ill see about it replied jill with a responsible air  the mention of the boy recalled him to their minds and looking round they found him peacefully absorbed in polishing up the floor with mollys pockethandkerchief and oil from the little machinecan being torn from this congenial labor he was carried off shining with grease and roaring lustily  but jill did not mind her loneliness now and sang like a happy canary while she threaded her sparkling beads or hung the gay horns to dry ready for their cargoes of sweets so mrs minots recipe for sunshine proved successful and motherwit made the wintry day a bright and happy one for both the little prisoners     chapter v secrets   there were a great many clubs in harmony village but as we intend to interest ourselves with the affairs of the young folks only we need not dwell upon the intellectual amusements of the elders in summer the boys devoted themselves to baseball the girls to boating and all got rosy stout and strong in these healthful exercises in winter the lads had their debating club the lasses a dramatic ditto at the former astonishing bursts of oratory were heard at the latter everything was boldly attempted from romeo and juliet to mother gooses immortal melodies the two clubs frequently met and mingled their attractions in a really entertaining manner for the speakers made good actors and the young actresses were most appreciative listeners to the eloquence of each budding demosthenes  great plans had been afoot for christmas or new year but when the grand catastrophe put an end to the career of one of the best spouters and caused the retirement of the favorite singing chambermaid the affair was postponed till february when washingtons birthday was always celebrated by the patriotic town where the father of his country once put on his nightcap or took off his boots as that ubiquitous hero appears to have done in every part of the united states  meantime the boys were studying revolutionary characters and the girls rehearsing such dramatic scenes as they thought most appropriate and effective for the 22d in both of these attempts they were much helped by the sense and spirit of ralph evans a youth of nineteen who was a great favorite with the young folks not only because he was a good industrious fellow who supported his grandmother but also full of talent fun and ingenuity it was no wonder every one who really knew him liked him for he could turn his hand to anything and loved to do it if the girls were in despair about a fireplace when acting the cricket on the hearth he painted one and put a gaslog in it that made the kettle really boil to their great delight if the boys found the interest of their club flagging ralph would convulse them by imitations of the member from cranberry centre or fire them with speeches of famous statesmen charity fairs could not get on without him and in the store where he worked he did many an ingenious job which made him valued for his mechanical skill as well as for his energy and integrity  mrs minot liked to have him with her sons because they also were to paddle their own canoes by and by and she believed that rich or poor boys make better men for learning to use the talents they possess not merely as ornaments but tools with which to carve their own fortunes and the best help toward this end is an example of faithful work high aims and honest living so ralph came often and in times of trouble was a real rainyday friend jack grew very fond of him during his imprisonment for the good youth ran in every evening to get commissions amuse the boy with droll accounts of the days adventures or invent lifts bedtables and footrests for the impatient invalid frank found him a sure guide through the mechanical mysteries which he loved and spent many a useful halfhour discussing cylinders pistons valves and balancewheels jill also came in for her share of care and comfort the poor little back lay all the easier for the aircushion ralph got her and the weary headaches found relief from the spray atomizer which softly distilled its scented dew on the hot forehead till she fell asleep  round the beds of jack and jill met and mingled the schoolmates of whom our story treats never probably did invalids have gayer times than our two after a week of solitary confinement for school gossip crept in games could not be prevented and christmas secrets were concocted in those rooms till they were regular conspirators dens when they were not little bedlams  after the horn and bead labors were over the stringing of popcorn on red and cranberries on white threads came next and jack and jill often looked like a new kind of spider in the pretty webs hung about them till reeled off to bide their time in the christmas closet paper flowers followed and gay garlands and bouquets blossomed regardless of the snow and frost without then there was a great scribbling of names verses and notes to accompany the steadily increasing store of odd parcels which were collected at the minots for gifts from every one were to ornament the tree and contributions poured in as the day drew near  but the secret which most excited the young people was the deep mystery of certain proceedings at the minot house no one but frank ralph and mamma knew what it was and the two boys nearly drove the others distracted by the tantalizing way in which they hinted at joys to come talked strangely about birds went measuring round with footrules and shut themselves up in the boys den as a certain large room was called this seemed to be the centre of operations but beyond the fact of the promised tree no ray of light was permitted to pass the jealously guarded doors strange men with pastepots and ladders went in furniture was dragged about and all sorts of boyish lumber was sent up garret and down cellar mrs minot was seen pondering over heaps of green stuff hammering was heard singular bundles were smuggled upstairs flowering plants betrayed their presence by whiffs of fragrance when the door was opened and mrs pecq was caught smiling all by herself in a back bedroom which usually was shut up in winter  they are going to have a play after all and that green stuff was the curtain said molly loo as the girls talked it over one day when they sat with their backs turned to one another putting last stitches in certain bits of work which had to be concealed from all eyes though it was found convenient to ask one anothers taste as to the color materials and sizes of these mysterious articles  i think it is going to be a dance i heard the boys doing their steps when i went in last evening to find out whether jack liked blue or yellow best so i could put the bow on his penwiper declared merry knitting briskly away at the last of the pair of pretty white bedsocks she was making for jill right under her inquisitive little nose  they wouldnt have a party of that kind without jack and me it is only an extra nice tree you see if it isnt answered jill from behind the pillows which made a temporary screen to hide the toilet mats she was preparing for all her friends  every one of you is wrong and youd better rest easy for you wont find out the best part of it try as you may and mrs pecq actually chuckled as she too worked away at some bits of muslin with her back turned to the very unsociallooking group  well i dont care weve got a secret all our own and wont ever tell will we cried jill falling back on the home missionary society though it was not yet begun  never answered the girls and all took great comfort in the idea that one mystery would not be cleared up even at christmas  jack gave up guessing in despair after he had suggested a new diningroom where he could eat with the family a private school in which his lessons might go on with a tutor or a theatre for the production of the farces in which he delighted  it is going to be used to keep something in that you are very fond of said mamma taking pity on him at last  ducks asked jack with a half pleased half puzzled air not quite seeing where the water was to come from  frank exploded at the idea and added to the mystification by saying  there will be one little duck and one great donkey in it then fearing he had told the secret he ran off quacking and braying derisively  it is to be used for creatures that i too am fond of and you know neither donkeys nor ducks are favorites of mine said mamma with a demure expression as she sat turning over old clothes for the bundles that always went to poor neighbors with a little store of goodies at this time of the year  i know i know it is to be a new ward for more sick folks isnt it now cried jack with what he thought a great proof of shrewdness  i dont see how i could attend to many more patients till this one is off my hands answered mamma with a queer smile adding quickly as if she too was afraid of letting the cat out of the bag that reminds me of a christmas i once spent among the hospitals and poorhouses of a great city with a good lady who for thirty years had made it her mission to see that these poor little souls had one merry day we gave away two hundred dolls several great boxes of candy and toys besides gay pictures and new clothes to orphan children sick babies and halfgrown innocents ah my boy that was a day to remember all my life to make me doubly grateful for my blessings and very glad to serve the helpless and afflicted as that dear woman did  the look and tone with which the last words were uttered effectually turned jacks thoughts from the great secret and started another small one for he fell to planning what he would buy with his pocketmoney to surprise the little pats and biddies who were to have no christmas tree     chapter vi surprises   is it pleasant was the question jill asked before she was fairly awake on christmas morning  yes dear as bright as heart could wish now eat a bit and then ill make you nice for the days pleasure i only hope it wont be too much for you answered mrs pecq bustling about happy yet anxious for jill was to be carried over to mrs minots and it was her first attempt at going out since the accident  it seemed as if nine oclock would never come and jill with wraps all ready lay waiting in a fever of impatience for the doctors visit as he wished to superintend the moving at last he came found all promising and having bundled up his small patient carried her with franks help in her chairbed to the oxsled which was drawn to the next door and miss jill landed in the boys den before she had time to get either cold or tired mrs minot took her things off with a cordial welcome but jill never said a word for after one exclamation she lay staring about her dumb with surprise and delight at what she saw  the great room was entirely changed for now it looked like a garden or one of the fairy scenes children love where indoors and outofdoors are pleasantly combined the ceiling was pale blue like the sky the walls were covered with a paper like a rustic trellis up which climbed morningglories so naturally that the manycolored bells seemed dancing in the wind birds and butterflies flew among them and here and there through arches in the trellis one seemed to look into a sunny summer world contrasting curiously with the wintry landscape lying beyond the real windows festooned with evergreen garlands and curtained only by stands of living flowers a green drugget covered the floor like grass rustic chairs from the garden stood about and in the middle of the room a handsome hemlock waited for its pretty burden a yulelog blazed on the wide hearth and over the chimneypiece framed in holly shone the words that set all hearts to dancing merry christmas  do you like it dear this is our surprise for you and jack and here we mean to have good times together said mrs minot who had stood quietly enjoying the effect of her work  oh it is so lovely i dont know what to say and jill put up both arms as words failed her and grateful kisses were all she had to offer  can you suggest anything more to add to the pleasantness asked the gentle lady holding the small hands in her own and feeling well repaid by the childs delight  only jack and jills laugh was good to hear as she glanced up with merry yet wistful eyes  you are right well have him in at once or he will come hopping on one leg and away hurried his mother laughing too for whistles shouts thumps and violent demonstrations of all kinds had been heard from the room where jack was raging with impatience while he waited for his share of the surprise  jill could hardly lie still when she heard the roll of another chairbed coming down the hall its passage enlivened with cries of starboard port easy now pull away from ralph and frank as they steered the recumbent columbus on his first voyage of discovery  well i call that handsome was jacks exclamation when the full beauty of the scene burst upon his view then he forgot all about it and gave a whoop of pleasure for there beside the fire was an eager face two hands beckoning and jills voice crying joyfully  im here im here oh do come quick down the long room rattled the chair jack cheering all the way and brought up beside the other one as the longparted friends exclaimed with one accord  isnt this jolly  it certainly did look so for ralph and frank danced a wild sort of fandango round the tree dr whiting stood and laughed while the two mothers beamed from the doorway and the children not knowing whether to laugh or to cry compromised the matter by clapping their hands and shouting merry christmas to everybody like a pair of little maniacs  then they all sobered down and the busy ones went off to the various duties of the day leaving the young invalids to repose and enjoy themselves together  how nice you look said jill when they had duly admired the pretty room  so do you gallantly returned jack as he surveyed her with unusual interest  they did look very nice though happiness was the principal beautifier jill wore a red wrapper with the most brilliant of all the necklaces sparkling at her throat over a nicely crimped frill her mother had made in honor of the day all the curly black hair was gathered into a red net and a pair of smart little moccasins covered the feet that had not stepped for many a weary day jack was not so gay but had made himself as fine as circumstances would permit a gray dressinggown with blue cuffs and collar was very becoming to the blonde youth an immaculate shirt best studs sleevebuttons blue tie and handkerchief wet with cologne sticking out of the breastpocket gave an air of elegance in spite of the afghan spread over the lower portions of his manly form the yellow hair was brushed till it shone and being parted in the middle to hide the black patch made two engaging little quirls on his forehead the summer tan had faded from his cheeks but his eyes were as blue as the wintry sky and nearly every white tooth was visible as he smiled on his partner in misfortune saying cheerily  im ever so glad to see you again guess we are over the worst of it now and can have good times wont it be fun to stay here all the while and amuse one another  yes indeed but one day is so short it will be stupider than ever when i go home tonight answered jill looking about her with longing eyes  but you are not going home tonight you are to stay ever so long didnt mamma tell you  no oh how splendid am i really where will i sleep what will mammy do without me and jill almost sat up she was so delighted with the new surprise  that room in there is all fixed for you i made frank tell me so much mamma said i might tell you but i didnt think she would be able to hold in if she saw you first your mother is coming too and we are all going to have larks together till we are well  the splendor of this arrangement took jills breath away and before she got it again in came frank and ralph with two clothesbaskets of treasures to be hung upon the tree while they wired on the candles the children asked questions and found out all they wanted to know about the new plans and pleasures  who fixed all this  mamma thought of it and ralph and i did it hes the man for this sort of thing you know he proposed cutting out the arches and sticking on birds and butterflies just where they looked best i put those canaries over there they looked so well against the blue and frank proudly pointed out some queer orangecolored fowls looking as if they were having fits in the air but very effective nevertheless  your mother said you might call this the bird room we caught a scarlettanager for you to begin with didnt we jack and ralph threw a bonbon at jill who looked very like a bright little bird in a warm nest  good for you yes and we are going to keep her in this pretty cage till we can both fly off together i say jill where shall we be in our classes when we do get back and jacks merry face fell at the thought  at the foot if we dont study and keep up doctor said i might study sometimes if id lie still as long as he thought best and molly brought home my books and merry says she will come in every day and tell me where the lessons are i dont mean to fall behind if my backbone is cracked said jill with a decided nod that made several black rings fly out of the net to dance on her forehead  frank said hed pull me along in my latin but ive been lazy and havent done a thing lets go at it and start fair for new year proposed jack who did not love study as the bright girl did but was ashamed to fall behind her in anything  all right theyve been reviewing so we can keep up when they begin if we work next week while the rest have a holiday oh dear i do miss school dreadfully and jill sighed for the old desk every blot and notch of which was dear to her  there come our things and pretty nice they look too said jack and his mother began to dress the tree hanging up the gay horns the gilded nuts red and yellow apples and oranges and festooning long strings of popcorn and scarlet cranberries from bough to bough with the glittering necklaces hung where the light would show their colors best  i never saw such a splendid tree before im glad we could help though we were ill is it all done now asked jill when the last parcel was tied on and everybody stood back to admire the pretty sight  one thing more hand me that box frank and be very careful that you fasten this up firmly ralph answered mrs minot as she took from its wrappings the waxen figure of a little child the rosy limbs were very lifelike so was the smiling face under the locks of shining hair both plump arms were outspread as if to scatter blessings over all and downy wings seemed to flutter from the dimpled shoulders making an angel of the baby  is it st nicholas asked jill who had never seen that famous personage and knew but little of christmas festivities  it is the christchild whose birthday we are celebrating i got the best i could find for i like the idea better than old santa claus though we may have him too said mamma holding the little image so that both could see it well  it looks like a real baby and jack touched the rosy foot with the tip of his finger as if expecting a crow from the halfopen lips  it reminds me of the saints in the chapel of the sacred heart in montreal one little st john looked like this only he had a lamb instead of wings said jill stroking the flaxen hair and wishing she dared ask for it to play with  he is the childrens saint to pray to love and imitate for he never forgot them but blessed and healed and taught them all his life this is only a poor image of the holiest baby ever born but i hope it will keep his memory in your minds all day because this is the day for good resolutions happy thoughts and humble prayers as well as play and gifts and feasting  while she spoke mrs minot touching the little figure as tenderly as if it were alive had tied a broad white ribbon round it and handing it to ralph bade him fasten it to the hook above the treetop where it seemed to float as if the downy wings supported it  jack and jill lay silently watching with a sweet sort of soberness in their young faces and for a moment the room was very still as all eyes looked up at the blessed child the sunshine seemed to grow more golden as it flickered on the little head the flames glanced about the glittering tree as if trying to climb and kiss the baby feet and without a chime of bells rang sweetly calling people to hear again the lovely story of the life begun on christmas day  only a minute but it did them good and presently when the pleasant work was over and the workers gone the boys to church and mamma to see about lunch for the invalids jack said gravely to jill  i think we ought to be extra good every one is so kind to us and we are getting well and going to have such capital times dont see how we can do anything else to show we are grateful  it isnt easy to be good when one is sick said jill thoughtfully i fret dreadfully i get so tired of being still i want to scream sometimes but i dont because it would scare mammy so i cry do you cry jack  men never do i want to tramp round when things bother me but i cant so i kick and say hang it and when i get very bad i pitch into frank and he lets me i tell you jill hes a good brother and jack privately resolved then and there to invite frank to take it out of him in any form he pleased as soon as health would permit  i rather think we shall grow good in this pretty place for i dont see how we can be bad if we want to it is all so nice and sort of pious here said jill with her eyes on the angel over the tree  a fellow can be awfully hungry i know that i didnt half eat breakfast i was in such a hurry to see you and know all about the secrets frank kept saying i couldnt guess that you had come and i never would be ready till finally i got mad and fired an egg at him and made no end of a mess  jack and jill went off into a gale of laughter at the idea of dignified frank dodging the egg that smashed on the wall leaving an indelible mark of jacks besetting sin impatience  just then mrs minot came in well pleased to hear such pleasant sounds and to see two merry faces where usually one listless one met her anxious eyes  the new medicine works well neighbor she said to mrs pecq who followed with the lunch tray  indeed it does mem i feel as if id taken a sup myself im that easy in my mind  and she looked so too for she seemed to have left all her cares in the little house when she locked the door behind her and now stood smiling with a clean apron on so fresh and cheerful that jill hardly knew her own mother  things taste better when you have someone to eat with you observed jack as they devoured sandwiches and drank milk out of little mugs with rosebuds on them  dont eat too much or you wont be ready for the next surprise said his mother when the plates were empty and the last drop gone down throats dry with much chatter  more surprises oh what fun cried jill and all the rest of the morning in the intervals of talk and play they tried to guess what it could be  at two oclock they found out for dinner was served in the bird room and the children revelled in the simple feast prepared for them the two mothers kept the little bedtables well supplied and fed their nurslings like maternal birds while frank presided over the feast with great dignity and ate a dinner which would have astonished mamma if she had not been too busy to observe how fast the mince pie vanished  the girls said christmas was spoiled because of us but i dont think so and they wont either when they see this splendid place and know all about our nice plans said jill luxuriously eating the nutmeats jack picked out for her as they lay in eastern style at the festive board  i call this broken bones made easy i never had a better christmas have a raisin heres a good fat one and jack made a long arm to jills mouth which began to sing little jack horner as an appropriate return  it would have been a lonesome one to all of us im thinking but for your mother boys my duty and hearty thanks to you mem put in grateful mrs pecq bowing over her coffeecup as she had seen ladies bow over their wineglasses at dinner parties in old england  i rise to propose a health our mothers and frank stood up with a goblet of water for not even at christmas time was wine seen on that table  hip hip hurrah called jack baptizing himself with a good sprinkle as he waved his glass and drank the toast with a look that made his mothers eyes fill with happy tears  jill threw her mother a kiss feeling very grown up and elegant to be dining out in such style then they drank every ones health with much merriment till frank declared that jack would float off on the deluge of water he splashed about in his enthusiasm and mamma proposed a rest after the merrymaking  now the best fun is coming and we have not long to wait said the boy when naps and rides about the room had whiled away the brief interval between dinner and dusk for the evening entertainment was to be an early one to suit the invalids bedtime  i hope the girls will like their things i helped to choose them and each has a nice present i dont know mine though and im in a twitter to see it said jill as they lay waiting for the fun to begin  i do i chose it so i know you will like one of them any way  have i got more than one  i guess youll think so when they are handed down the bell was going all day yesterday and the girls kept bringing in bundles for you i see seven now and jack rolled his eyes from one mysterious parcel to another hanging on the laden boughs  i know something too that square bundle is what you want ever so much i told frank and he got it for his present it is all red and gold outside and every sort of color inside youll hurrah when you see it that roundish one is yours too i made them cried jill pointing to a flat package tied to the stem of the tree and a neat little roll in which were the blue mittens that she had knit for him  i can wait but the boys eyes shone with eagerness and he could not resist firing two or three popcorns at it to see whether it was hard or soft  that barking dog is for boo and the little yellow sled so molly can drag him to school he always tumbles down so when it is slippery continued jill proud of her superior knowledge as she showed a small spotted animal hanging by its tail with a red tongue displayed as if about to taste the sweeties in the horn below  dont talk about sleds for mercys sake i never want to see another and you wouldnt either if you had to lie with a flatiron tied to your ankle as i do said jack with a kick of the well leg and an ireful glance at the weight attached to the other that it might not contract while healing  well i think plasters and liniment and rubbing as bad as flatirons any day i dont believe you have ached half so much as i have though it sounds worse to break legs than to sprain your back protested jill eager to prove herself the greater sufferer as invalids are apt to be  i guess you wouldnt think so if youd been pulled round as i was when they set my leg caesar how it did hurt and jack squirmed at the recollection of it  you didnt faint away as i did when the doctor was finding out if my vertebrums were hurt so now cried jill bound to carry her point though not at all clear what vertebrae were  pooh girls always faint men are braver and i didnt faint a bit in spite of all that horrid agony  you howled frank told me so doctor said i was a brave girl so you neednt brag for youll have to go on a crutch for a while i know that  you may have to use two of them for years may be i heard the doctor tell my mother so i shall be up and about long before you will now then  both children were getting excited for the various pleasures of the day had been rather too much for them and there is no knowing but they would have added the sad surprise of a quarrel to the pleasant ones of the day if a cheerful whistle had not been heard as ralph came in to light the candles and give the last artistic touches to the room  well young folks how goes it had a merry time so far he asked as he fixed the steps and ran up with a lighted match in his hand  very nice thank you answered a prim little voice from the dusk below for only the glow of the fire filled the room just then  jack said nothing and two red sulky faces were hidden in the dark watching candle after candle sputter brighten and twinkle till the trembling shadows began to flit away like imps afraid of the light  now he will see my face and i know it is cross thought jill as ralph went round the last circle leaving another line of sparks among the hemlock boughs  jack thought the same and had just got the frown smoothed out of his forehead when frank brought a fresh log and a glorious blaze sprung up filling every corner of the room and dancing over the figures in the long chairs till they had to brighten whether they liked it or not presently the bell began to ring and gay voices to sound below then jill smiled in spite of herself as molly loos usual cry of oh dear where is that child reached her and jack could not help keeping time to the march ed played while frank and gus marshalled the procession  ready cried mrs minot at last and up came the troop of eager lads and lasses brave in holiday suits with faces to match a unanimous o o o burst from twenty tongues as the full splendor of the tree the room and its inmates dawned upon them for not only did the pretty christchild hover above but santa claus himself stood below furclad whitebearded and powdered with snow from the dredgingbox  ralph was a good actor and when the first raptures were over he distributed the presents with such droll speeches jokes and gambols that the room rang with merriment and passersby paused to listen sure that here at least christmas was merry it would be impossible to tell about all the gifts or the joy of the receivers but every one was satisfied and the king and queen of the revels so overwhelmed with little tokens of goodwill that their beds looked like booths at a fair jack beamed over the handsome postagestamp book which had long been the desire of his heart and jill felt like a millionaire with a silver fruitknife a pretty workbasket and ohcoals of fire on her heada ring from jack  a simple little thing enough with one tiny turquoise forgetmenot but something like a dewdrop fell on it when no one was looking and she longed to say im sorry i was cross forgive me jack but it could not be done then so she turned to admire merrys bedshoes the pots of pansies hyacinths and geranium which gus and his sisters sent for her window garden mollys queer christmas pie and the zither ed promised to teach her how to play upon  the tree was soon stripped and popcorns strewed the floor as the children stood about picking them off the red threads when candy gave out with an occasional cranberry by way of relish boo insisted on trying the new sled at once and enlivened the trip by the squeaking of the spotted dog the toot of a tin trumpet and shouts of joy at the splendor of the turnout  the girls all put on their necklaces and danced about like fine ladies at a ball the boys fell to comparing skates balls and cuffbuttons on the spot while the little ones devoted all their energies to eating everything eatable they could lay their hands on  games were played till nine oclock and then the party broke up after they had taken hands round the tree and sung a song written by one whom you all knowso faithfully and beautifully does she love and labor for children the world over  the blessed day    what shall little children bring     on christmas day on christmas day   what shall little children bring     on christmas day in the morning   this shall little children bring     on christmas day on christmas day   love and joy to christ their king     on christmas day in the morning    what shall little children sing     on christmas day on christmas day   what shall little children sing     on christmas day in the morning   the grand old carols shall they sing     on christmas day on christmas day   with all their hearts their offerings bring     on christmas day in the morning  jack was carried off to bed in such haste that he had only time to call out goodnight before he was rolled away gaping as he went jill soon found herself tucked up in the great white bed she was to share with her mother and lay looking about the pleasant chamber while mrs pecq ran home for a minute to see that all was safe there for the night  after the merry din the house seemed very still with only a light step now and then the murmur of voices not far away or the jingle of sleighbells from without and the little girl rested easily among the pillows thinking over the pleasures of the day too wideawake for sleep there was no lamp in the chamber but she could look into the pretty bird room where the firelight still shone on flowery walls deserted tree and christchild floating above the green jills eyes wandered there and lingered till they were full of regretful tears because the sight of the little angel recalled the words spoken when it was hung up the good resolution she had taken then and how soon it was broken  i said i couldnt be bad in that lovely place and i was a cross ungrateful girl after all theyve done for mammy and me poor jack was hurt the worst and he was brave though he did scream i wish i could go and tell him so and hear him say all right oh me ive spoiled the day  a great sob choked more words and jill was about to have a comfortable cry when someone entered the other room and she saw frank doing something with a long cord and a thing that looked like a tiny drum quiet as a brighteyed mouse jill peeped out wondering what it was and suspecting mischief for the boy was laughing to himself as he stretched the cord and now and then bent over the little object in his hand touching it with great care  may be its a torpedo to blow up and scare me jack likes to play tricks well ill scream loud when it goes off so he will be satisfied that im dreadfully frightened thought jill little dreaming what the last surprise of the day was to be  presently a voice whispered  i say are you awake  yes  any one there but you  no  catch this then hold it to your ear and see what youll get  the little drum came flying in and catching it jill with some hesitation obeyed franks order judge of her amazement when she caught in broken whispers these touching words  sorry i was cross forgive and forget start fair tomorrow all right jack  jill was so delighted with this handsome apology that she could not reply for a moment then steadied her voice and answered back in her sweetest tone  im sorry too never never will again feel much better now goodnight you dear old thing  satisfied with the success of his telephone frank twitched back the drum and vanished leaving jill to lay her cheek upon the hand that wore the little ring and fall asleep saying to herself with a farewell glance at the childrens saint dimly seen in the soft gloom i will not forget i will be good     chapter vii jills mission   the good times began immediately and very little studying was done that week in spite of the virtuous resolutions made by certain young persons on christmas day but dear me how was it possible to settle down to lessons in the delightful bird room with not only its own charms to distract one but all the new gifts to enjoy and a dozen calls a day to occupy ones time  i guess wed better wait till the others are at school and just go in for fun this week said jack who was in great spirits at the prospect of getting up for the splints were off and he hoped to be promoted to crutches very soon  i shall keep my speller by me and take a look at it every day for that is what im most backward in but i intend to devote myself to you jack and be real kind and useful ive made a plan to do it and i mean to carry it out any way answered jill who had begun to be a missionary and felt that this was a field of labor where she could distinguish herself  heres a home mission all ready for you and you can be paying your debts beside doing yourself good mrs pecq said to her in private having found plenty to do herself  now jill made one great mistake at the outsetshe forgot that she was the one to be converted to good manners and gentleness and devoted her efforts to looking after jack finding it much easier to cure other peoples faults than her own jack was a most engaging heathen and needed very little instruction therefore jill thought her task would be an easy one but three or four weeks of petting and play had rather demoralized both children so jills speller though tucked under the sofa pillow every day was seldom looked at and jack shirked his latin shamefully both read all the storybooks they could get held daily levees in the bird room and all their spare minutes were spent in teaching snowdrop the great angora cat to bring the ball when they dropped it in their game so saturday came and both were rather the worse for so much idleness since daily duties and studies are the wholesome bread which feeds the mind better than the dyspeptic plumcake of sensational reading or the unsubstantial bonbons of frivolous amusement  it was a stormy day so they had few callers and devoted themselves to arranging the album for these books were all the rage just then and boys met to compare discuss buy sell and swap stamps with as much interest as men on change gamble in stocks jack had a nice little collection and had been saving up pocketmoney to buy a book in which to preserve his treasures now thanks to jills timely suggestion frank had given him a fine one and several friends had contributed a number of rare stamps to grace the large inviting pages jill wielded the gumbrush and fitted on the little flaps as her fingers were skilful at this nice work and jack put each stamp in its proper place with great rustling of leaves and comparing of marks returning after a brief absence mrs minot beheld the countenances of the workers adorned with gay stamps giving them a very curious appearance  my dears what new play have you got now are you wild indians or letters that have gone round the world before finding the right address she asked laughing at the ridiculous sight for both were as sober as judges and deeply absorbed in some doubtful specimen  oh we just stuck them there to keep them safe they get lost if we leave them lying round its very handy for i can see in a minute what i want on jills face and she on mine and put our fingers on the right chap at once answered jack adding with an anxious gaze at his friends variegated countenance where the dickens is my new granada its rare and i wouldnt lose it for a dollar  why there it is on your own nose dont you remember you put it there because you said mine was not big enough to hold it laughed jill tweaking a large orange square off the round nose of her neighbor causing it to wrinkle up in a droll way as the gum made the operation slightly painful  so i did and gave you little bolivar on yours now ill have alsace and lorraine 1870 there are seven of them so hold still and see how you like it returned jack picking the large pale stamps one by one from jills forehead which they crossed like a band  she bore it without flinching saying to herself with a secret smile as she glanced at the hot fire which scorched her if she kept near enough to jack to help him this really is being like a missionary with a tattooed savage to look after i have to suffer a little as the good folks did who got speared and roasted sometimes but i wont complain a bit though my forehead smarts my arms are tired and one cheek is as red as fire  the roman states make a handsome page dont they asked jack little dreaming of the part he was playing in jills mind oh i say isnt corea a beauty im ever so proud of that and he gazed fondly on a big blue stamp the sole ornament of one page  i dont see why the cape of good hope has pyramids they ought to go in egypt the sandwich islands are all right with heads of the black kings and queens on them said jill feeling that they were very appropriate to her private play  turkey has crescents australia swans and spain womens heads with black bars across them frank says it is because they keep women shut up so but that was only his fun id rather have a good honest green united states with washington on it or a blue onecenter with old franklin than all their eagles and lions and kings and queens put together added the democratic boy with a disrespectful slap on a crowned head as he settled heligoland in its place  why does austria have mercury on the stamp i wonder do they wear helmets like that asked jill with the brushhandle in her mouth as she cut a fresh batch of flaps  may be he was postman to the gods so he is put on stamps now the prussians wear helmets but they have spikes like the old roman fellows i like prussians ever so much they fight splendidly and always beat austrians have a handsome uniform though  talking of romans reminds me that i have not heard your latin for two days come lazybones brace up and let us have it now ive done my compo and shall have just time before i go out for a tramp with gus said frank putting by a neat page to dry for he studied every day like a conscientious lad as he was  dont know it not going to try till next week grind away over your old greek as much as you like but dont bother me answered jack frowning at the mere thought of the detested lesson  but frank adored his xenophon and would not see his old friend caesar neglected without an effort to defend him so he confiscated the gumpot and effectually stopped the stamp business by whisking away at one fell swoop all that lay on jills table  now then young man you will quit this sort of nonsense and do your lesson or you wont see these fellows again in a hurry you asked me to hear you and im going to do it heres the book  franks tone was the dictatorial one which jack hated and always found hard to obey especially when he knew he ought to do it usually when his patience was tried he strode about the room or ran off for a race round the garden coming back breathless but goodtempered now both these vents for irritation were denied him and he had fallen into the way of throwing things about in a pet he longed to send caesar to perpetual banishment in the fire blazing close by but resisted the temptation and answered honestly though gruffly i know i did but i dont see any use in pouncing on a fellow when he isnt ready i havent got my lesson and dont mean to worry about it so you may just give me back my things and go about your business  ill give you back a stamp for every perfect lesson you get and you wont see them on any other terms and thrusting the treasures into his pocket frank caught up his rubber boots and went off swinging them like a pair of clubs feeling that he would give a trifle to be able to use them on his lazy brother  at this highhanded proceeding and the threat which accompanied it jacks patience gave out and catching up caesar as he thought sent him flying after the retreating tyrant with the defiant declaration  keep them then and your old book too i wont look at it till you give all my stamps back and say you are sorry so now  it was all over before mamma could interfere or jill do more than clutch and cling to the gumbrush frank vanished unharmed but the poor book dashed against the wall to fall half open on the floor its gay cover loosened and its smooth leaves crushed by the blow  its the album o jack how could you cried jill dismayed at sight of the precious book so maltreated by the owner  thought it was the other guess it isnt hurt much didnt mean to hit him any way he does provoke me so muttered jack very red and shamefaced as his mother picked up the book and laid it silently on the table before him he did not know what to do with himself and was thankful for the stamps still left him finding great relief in making faces as he plucked them one by one from his mortified countenance jill looked on half glad half sorry that her savage showed such signs of unconverted ferocity and mrs minot went on writing letters wearing the grave look her sons found harder to bear than another persons scolding no one spoke for a moment and the silence was becoming awkward when gus appeared in a rubber suit bringing a book to jack from laura and a note to jill from lotty  look here you just trundle me into my den please im going to have a nap its so dull today i dont feel like doing much said jack when gus had done his errands trying to look as if he knew nothing about the fracas  jack folded his arms and departed like a warrior borne from the battlefield to be chaffed unmercifully for a pepperpot while gus made him comfortable in his own room  i heard once of a boy who threw a fork at his brother and put his eye out but he didnt mean to and the brother forgave him and he never did so any more observed jill in a pensive tone wishing to show that she felt all the dangers of impatience but was sorry for the culprit  did the boy ever forgive himself asked mrs minot  no m i suppose not but jack didnt hit frank and feels real sorry i know  he might have and hurt him very much our actions are in our own hands but the consequences of them are not remember that my dear and think twice before you do anything  yes m i will and jill composed herself to consider what missionaries usually did when the natives hurled tomahawks and boomerangs at one another and defied the rulers of the land  mrs minot wrote one page of a new letter then stopped pushed her papers about thought a little and finally got up saying as if she found it impossible to resist the yearning of her heart for the naughty boy  i am going to see if jack is covered up he is so helpless and liable to take cold dont stir till i come back  no m i wont  away went the tender parent to find her son studying caesar for dear life and all the more amiable for the little gust which had blown away the temporary irritability the brothers were often called thunder and lightning because frank lowered and growled and was a good while clearing up while jacks temper came and went like a flash and the air was all the clearer for the escape of dangerous electricity of course mamma had to stop and deliver a little lecture illustrated by sad tales of petulant boys and punctuated with kisses which took off the edge of these afflicting narratives  jill meantime meditated morally on the superiority of her own good temper over the hasty one of her dear playmate and just when she was feeling unusually uplifted and secure alas like so many of us she fell in the most deplorable manner  glancing about the room for something to do she saw a sheet of paper lying exactly out of reach where it had fluttered from the table unperceived at first her eye rested on it as carelessly as it did on the stray stamp frank had dropped then as if one thing suggested the other she took it into her head that the paper was franks composition or better still a note to annette for the two corresponded when absence or weather prevented the daily meeting at school  wouldnt it be fun to keep it till he gives back jacks stamps it would plague him so if it was a note and i do believe it is for compos dont begin with two words on one side ill get it and jack and i will plan some way to pay him off cross thing  forgetting her promise not to stir also how dishonorable it was to read other peoples letters jill caught up the longhandled hook often in use now and tried to pull the paper nearer it would not come at once for a seam in the carpet held it and jill feared to tear or crumple it if she was not very careful the hook was rather heavy and long for her to manage and jack usually did the fishing so she was not very skilful and just as she was giving a particularly quick jerk she lost her balance fell off the sofa and dropped the pole with a bang  oh my back was all she could think or say as she felt the jar all through her little body and a corresponding fear in her guilty little mind that someone would come and find out the double mischief she had been at for a moment she lay quite still to recover from the shock then as the pain passed she began to wonder how she should get back and looked about her to see if she could do it alone she thought she could as the sofa was near and she had improved so much that she could sit up a little if the doctor would have let her she was gathering herself together for the effort when within arms reach now she saw the tempting paper and seized it with glee for in spite of her predicament she did want to tease frank a glance showed that it was not the composition nor a note but the beginning of a letter from mrs minot to her sister and jill was about to lay it down when her own name caught her eye and she could not resist reading it hard words to write of one so young doubly hard to read and impossible to forget  dear lizziejack continues to do very well and will soon be up again but we begin to fear that the little girl is permanently injured in the back she is here and we do our best for her but i never look at her without thinking of lucinda snow who you remember was bedridden for twenty years owing to a fall at fifteen poor little janey does not know yet and i hopethere it ended and poor little janeys punishment for disobedience began that instant she thought she was getting well because she did not suffer all the time and every one spoke cheerfully about by and by now she knew the truth and shut her eyes with a shiver as she said low to herself  twenty years i couldnt bear it oh i couldnt bear it  a very miserable jill lay on the floor and for a while did not care who came and found her then the last words of the letteri hopeseemed to shine across the blackness of the dreadful twenty years and cheer her up a bit for despair never lives long in young hearts and jill was a brave child  that is why mammy sighs so when she dresses me and every one is so good to me perhaps mrs minot doesnt really know after all she was dreadfully scared about jack and he is getting well id like to ask doctor but he might find out about the letter oh dear why didnt i keep still and let the horrid thing alone  as she thought that jill pushed the paper away pulled herself up and with much painful effort managed to get back to her sofa where she laid herself down with a groan feeling as if the twenty years had already passed over her since she tumbled off  ive told a lie for i said i wouldnt stir ive hurt my back ive done a mean thing and ive got paid for it a nice missionary i am id better begin at home as mammy told me to and jill groaned again remembering her mothers words now ive got another secret to keep all alone for id be ashamed to tell the girls i guess ill turn round and study my spelling then no one will see my face  jill looked the picture of a good industrious child as she lay with her back to the large table her book held so that nothing was to be seen but one cheek and a pair of lips moving busily fortunately it is difficult for little sinners to act a part and even if the face is hidden something in the body seems to betray the internal remorse and shame usually jill lay flat and still now her back was bent in a peculiar way as she leaned over her book and one foot wagged nervously while on the visible cheek was a spanish stamp with a womans face looking through the black bars very suggestively if she had known it how long the minutes seemed till some one came and what a queer little jump her heart gave when mrs minots voice said cheerfully jack is all right and i declare so is jill i really believe there is a telegraph still working somewhere between you two and each knows what the other is about without words  i didnt have any other book handy so i thought id study awhile answered jill feeling that she deserved no praise for her seeming industry  she cast a sidelong glance as she spoke and seeing that mrs minot was looking for the letter hid her face and lay so still she could hear the rustle of the paper as it was taken from the floor it was well she did not also see the quick look the lady gave her as she turned the letter and found a red stamp sticking to the under side for this unlucky little witness told the story  mrs minot remembered having seen the stamp lying close to the sofa when she left the room for she had had half a mind to take it to jack but did not thinking franks plan had some advantages she also recollected that a paper flew off the table but being in haste she had not stopped to see what it was now the stamp and the letter could hardly have come together without hands for they lay a yard apart and here also on the unwritten portion of the page was the mark of a small green thumb jill had been winding wool for a stripe in her new afghan and the green ball lay on her sofa these signs suggested and confirmed what mrs minot did not want to believe so did the voice attitude and air of jill all very unlike her usual open alert ways  the kind lady could easily forgive the reading of her letter since the girl had found such sad news there but the dangers of disobedience were serious in her case and a glance showed that she was suffering either in mind or bodyperhaps both  i will wait for her to tell me she is an honest child and the truth will soon come out thought mrs minot as she took a clean sheet and jill tried to study  shall i hear your lesson dear jack means to recite his like a good boy so suppose you follow his example she said presently  i dont know as i can say it but ill try  jill did try and got on bravely till she came to the word permanent there she hesitated remembering where she saw it last  do you know what that means asked her teacher thinking to help her on by defining the word  alwaysfor a great whileor something like that doesnt it faltered jill with a tight feeling in her throat and the color coming up as she tried to speak easily yet felt so shamestricken she could not  are you in pain my child never mind the lesson tell me and ill do something for you  the kind words the soft hand on her hot cheek and the pity in the eyes that looked at her were too much for jill a sob came first and then the truth told with hidden face and tears that washed the blush away and set free the honest little soul that could not hide its fault from such a friend  i knew it all before and was sure you would tell me else you would not be the child i love and like to help so well  then while she soothed jills trouble mrs minot told her story and showed the letter wishing to lessen if possible some part of the pain it had given  sly old stamp to go and tell on me when i meant to own up and get some credit if i could after being so mean and bad said jill smiling through her tears when she saw the telltale witnesses against her  you had better stick it in your book to remind you of the bad consequences of disobedience then perhaps this lesson will leave a permanent impression on your mind and memory answered mrs minot glad to see her natural gayety coming back and hoping that she had forgotten the contents of the unfortunate letter but she had not and presently when the sad affair had been talked over and forgiven jill asked slowly as she tried to put on a brave look  please tell me about lucinda snow if i am to be like her i might as well know how she managed to bear it so long  im sorry you ever heard of her and yet perhaps it may help you to bear your trial dear which i hope will never be as heavy a one as hers this lucinda i knew for years and though at first i thought her fate the saddest that could be i came at last to see how happy she was in spite of her affliction how good and useful and beloved  why how could she be what did she do cried jill forgetting her own troubles to look up with an open eager face again  she was so patient other people were ashamed to complain of their small worries so cheerful that her own great one grew lighter so industrious that she made both money and friends by pretty things she worked and sold to her many visitors and best of all so wise and sweet that she seemed to get good out of everything and make her poor room a sort of chapel where people went for comfort counsel and an example of a pious life so you see lucinda was not so very miserable after all  well if i could not be as i was id like to be a woman like that only i hope i shall not answered jill thoughtfully at first then coming out so decidedly with the last words that it was evident the life of a bedridden saint was not at all to her mind  so do i and i mean to believe that you will not meantime we can try to make the waiting as useful and pleasant as possible this painful little back will be a sort of conscience to remind you of what you ought to do and leave undone and so you can be learning obedience then when the body is strong it will have formed a good habit to make duty easier and my lucinda can be a sweet example even while lying here if she chooses  can i and jills eyes were full of softer tears as the comfortable cheering words sank into her heart to blossom slowly by and by into her life for this was to be a long lesson hard to learn but very useful in the years to come  when the boys returned after the latin was recited and peace restored jack showed her a recovered stamp promptly paid by frank who was as just as he was severe and jill asked for the old red one though she did not tell why she wanted it nor show it put away in the spellingbook a little seal upon a promise made to be kept     chapter viii merry and molly   now let us see how the other missionaries got on with their tasks  farmer grant was a thrifty welltodo man anxious to give his children greater advantages than he had enjoyed and to improve the fine place of which he was justly proud mrs grant was a notable housewife as ambitious and industrious as her husband but too busy to spend any time on the elegancies of life though always ready to help the poor and sick like a good neighbor and christian woman the three sonstom dick and harrywere big fellows of seventeen nineteen and twentyone the first two on the farm and the elder in a store just setting up for himself kindhearted but roughmannered youths who loved merry very much but teased her sadly about her fine lady airs as they called her dainty ways and love of beauty  merry was a thoughtful girl full of innocent fancies refined tastes and romantic dreams in which no one sympathized at home though she was the pet of the family it did seem to an outsider as if the delicate little creature had got there by mistake for she looked very like a tearose in a field of clover and dandelions whose highest aim in life was to feed cows and help make root beer  when the girls talked over the new society it pleased merry very much and she decided not only to try and love work better but to convert her family to a liking for pretty things as she called her own more cultivated tastes  i will begin at once and show them that i dont mean to shirk my duty though i do want to be nice thought she as she sat at supper one night and looked about her planning her first move  not a very cheering prospect for a lover of the beautiful certainly for the big kitchen though as neat as wax had nothing lovely in it except a red geranium blooming at the window nor were the people all that could be desired in some respects as they sat about the table shovelling in pork and beans with their knives drinking tea from their saucers and laughing out with a hearty haw haw when anything amused them yet the boys were handsome strong specimens the farmer a hale benevolentlooking man the housewife a pleasant sharpeyed matron who seemed to find comfort in looking often at the bright face at her elbow with the broad forehead clear eyes sweet mouth and quiet voice that came like music in among the loud masculine ones or the quick nervous tones of a woman always in a hurry  merrys face was so thoughtful that evening that her father observed it for when at home he watched her as one watches a kitten glad to see anything so pretty young and happy at its play  little daughter has got something on her mind i mistrust come and tell father all about it he said with a sounding slap on his broad knee as he turned his chair from the table to the ugly stove where three pairs of wet boots steamed underneath and a great kettle of cider applesauce simmered above  when ive helped clear up ill come and talk now mother you sit down and rest roxy and i can do everything answered merry patting the old rockingchair so invitingly that the tired woman could not resist especially as watching the kettle gave her an excuse for obeying  well i dont care if i do for ive been on my feet since five oclock be sure you cover things up and shut the buttery door and put the cat down cellar and sift your meal ill see to the buckwheats last thing before i go to bed  mrs grant subsided with her knitting for her hands were never idle tom tilted his chair back against the wall and picked his teeth with his penknife dick got out a little pot of grease to make the boots watertight and harry sat down at the small table to look over his accounts with an important airfor every one occupied this room and the work was done in the outkitchen behind  merry hated clearing up but dutifully did every distasteful task and kept her eye on careless roxy till all was in order then she gladly went to perch on her fathers knee seeing in all the faces about her the silent welcome they always wore for the little one  yes i do want something but i know you will say it is silly she began as her father pinched her blooming cheek with the wish that his peaches would ever look half as well  shouldnt wonder if it was a doll now and mr grant stroked her head with an indulgent smile as if she was about six instead of fifteen  why father you know i dont i havent played with dollies for years and years no i want to fix up my room pretty like jills ill do it all myself and only want a few things for i dont expect it to look as nice as hers  indignation gave merry courage to state her wishes boldly though she knew the boys would laugh they did and her mother said in a tone of surprise  why child what more can you want im sure your room is always as neat as a new pin thanks to your bringing up and i told you to have a fire there whenever you wanted to  let me have some old things out of the garret and ill show you what i want it is neat but so bare and ugly i hate to be there i do so love something pretty to look at and merry gave a little shiver of disgust as she turned her eyes away from the large greasy boot dick was holding up to be sure it was well lubricated all round  so do i and thats a fact i couldnt get on without my pretty girl here any way why she touches up the old place better than a dozen flowerpots in full blow said the farmer as his eye went from the scarlet geranium to the bright young face so near his own  i wish i had a dozen in the sittingroom window mother says they are not tidy but id keep them neat and i know youd like it broke in merry glad of the chance to get one of the longdesired wishes of her heart fulfilled  ill fetch you some next time i go over to ballads tell me what you want and well have a posy bed somewhere round see if we dont said her father dimly understanding what she wanted  now if mother says i may fix my room i shall be satisfied and ill do my chores without a bit of fuss to show how grateful i am said the girl thanking her father with a kiss and smiling at her mother so wistfully that the good woman could not refuse  you may have anything you like out of the blue chest theres a lot of things there that the moths got at after grandma died and i couldnt bear to throw or give em away trim up your room as you like and mind you dont forget your part of the bargain answered mrs grant seeing profit in the plan  i wont ill work all the morning tomorrow and in the afternoon ill get ready to show you what i call a nice pretty room answered merry looking so pleased it seemed as if another flower had blossomed in the large bare kitchen  she kept her word and the very stormy afternoon when jill got into trouble merry was working busily at her little bower in the blue chest she found a variety of treasures and ignoring the moth holes used them to the best advantage trying to imitate the simple comfort with a touch of elegance which prevailed in mrs minots back bedroom  three faded redmoreen curtains went up at the windows over the chilly paper shades giving a pleasant glow to the bare walls a red quilt with white stars rather the worse for many washings covered the bed and a gay cloth the table where a judicious arrangement of books and baskets concealed the spots the little airtight stove was banished and a pair of ancient andirons shone in the firelight grandmas last and largest braided rug lay on the hearth and her brass candlesticks adorned the bureau over the mirror of which was festooned a white muslin skirt tied up with merrys red sash this piece of elegance gave the last touch to her room she thought and she was very proud of it setting forth all her small store of trinkets in a large shell with an empty scent bottle and a clean tidy over the pincushion on the walls she hung three oldfashioned pictures which she ventured to borrow from the garret till better could be found one a mourning piece with a very tall lady weeping on an urn in a grove of willows and two small boys in knee breeches and funny little square tails to their coats looking like cherubs in large frills the other was as good as a bonfire being an eruption of vesuvius and very lurid indeed for the bay of naples was boiling like a pot the red sky raining rocks and a few distracted people lying flat upon the shore the third was a really pretty scene of children dancing round a maypole for though nearly a hundred years old the little maids smiled and the boys pranced as gayly as if the flowers they carried were still alive and sweet  now ill call them all to see and say that it is pretty then ill enjoy it and come here when things look dismal and bare everywhere else said merry when at last it was done she had worked all the afternoon and only finished at supper time so the candles had to be lighted that the toilette might look its best and impress the beholders with an idea of true elegance unfortunately the fire smoked a little and a window was set ajar to clear the room an evildisposed gust blew in wafting the thin drapery within reach of the light and when merry threw open the door proudly thinking to display her success she was horrified to find the room in a blaze and half her labor all in vain  the conflagration was over in a minute however for the boys tore down the muslin and stamped out the fire with much laughter while mrs grant bewailed the damage to her carpet and poor merry took refuge in her fathers arms refusing to be comforted in spite of his kind commendation of grandmas fixins  the third little missionary had the hardest time of all and her first efforts were not much more satisfactory nor successful than the others her father was away from morning till night and then had his paper to read books to keep or a man to see down town so that after a hasty word at tea he saw no more of the children till another evening as they were seldom up at his early breakfast he thought they were well taken care of for miss bathsheba dawes was an energetic middleaged spinster when she came into the family and had been there fifteen years so he did not observe what a woman would have seen at once that miss bat was getting old and careless and everything about the house was at sixes and sevens she took good care of him and thought she had done her duty if she got three comfortable meals nursed the children when they were ill and saw that the house did not burn up so maria louisa and napoleon bonaparte got on as they could without the tender cares of a mother molly had been a happygolucky child contented with her pets her freedom and little boo to love but now she was just beginning to see that they were not like other children and to feel ashamed of it  papa is busy but miss bat ought to see to us she is paid for it and goodness knows she has an easy time now for if i ask her to do anything she groans over her bones and tells me young folks should wait on themselves i take all the care of boo off her hands but i cant wash my own things and he hasnt a decent trouser to his blessed little legs id tell papa but it wouldnt do any good hed only say yes child yes ill attend to it and never do a thing  this used to be mollys lament when some especially trying event occurred and if the girls were not there to condole with her she would retire to the shedchamber call her nine cats about her and sitting in the old bushel basket pull her hair about her ears and scold all alone the cats learned to understand this habit and nobly did their best to dispel the gloom which now and then obscured the sunshine of their little mistress some of them would creep into her lap and purr till the comfortable sound soothed her irritation the sedate elders sat at her feet blinking with such wise and sympathetic faces that she felt as if half a dozen solomons were giving her the sagest advice while the kittens frisked about cutting up their drollest capers till she laughed in spite of herself when the laugh came the worst of the fit was over and she soon cheered up dismissing the consolers with a pat all round a feast of good things from miss bats larder and the usual speech  well dears its of no use to worry i guess we shall get along somehow if we dont fret  with which wise resolution molly would leave her retreat and freshen up her spirits by a row on the river or a romp with boo which always finished the case now however she was bound to try the new plan and do something toward reforming not only the boys condition but the disorder and discomfort of home  ill play it is siam and this the house of a native and im come to show the folks how to live nicely miss bat wont know what to make of it and i cant tell her so i shall get some fun out of it any way thought molly as she surveyed the diningroom the day her mission began  the prospect was not cheering and if the natives of siam live in such confusion it is high time they were attended to the breakfasttable still stood as it was left with slops of coffee on the cloth bits of bread eggshells and potatoskins lay about and one lonely sausage was cast away in the middle of a large platter the furniture was dusty stove untidy and the carpet looked as if crumbs had been scattered to chickens who declined their breakfast boo was sitting on the sofa with his arm through a hole in the cover hunting for some lost treasure put away there for safe keeping like a little magpie as he was molly fancied she washed and dressed him well enough but today she seemed to see more clearly and sighed as she thought of the hard job in store for her if she gave him the thorough washing he needed and combed out that curly mop of hair  ill clear up first and do that by and by i ought to have a nice little tub and good towels like mrs minot and i will too if i buy them myself she said piling up cups with an energy that threatened destruction to handles  miss bat who was trailing about the kitchen with her head pinned up in a little plaid shawl was so surprised by the demand for a pan of hot water and four clean towels that she nearly dropped her snuffbox chief comfort of her lazy soul  what new whimsey now generally the dishes stand round till i have time to pick em up and you are off coasting or careering somewhere well this tidy fit wont last long so i may as well make the most of it said miss bat as she handed out the required articles and then pushed her spectacles from the tip of her sharp nose to her sharper black eyes for a good look at the girl who stood primly before her with a clean apron on and her hair braided up instead of flying wildly about her shoulders  umph was all the comment that miss bat made on this unusual neatness and she went on scraping her saucepans while molly returned to her work very well pleased with the effect of her first step for she felt that the bewilderment of miss bat would be a constant inspiration to fresh efforts  an hour of hard work produced an agreeable change in the abode of the native for the table was cleared room swept and dusted fire brightened and the holes in the sofacovering were pinned up till time could be found to mend them to be sure rolls of lint lay in corners smears of ashes were on the stove hearth and dust still lurked on chair rounds and table legs but too much must not be expected of a new convert so the young missionary sat down to rest well pleased and ready for another attempt as soon as she could decide in what direction it should be made she quailed before boo as she looked at the unconscious innocent peacefully playing with the spotted dog now bereft of his tail and the lone sausage with which he was attempting to feed the hungry animal whose red mouth always gaped for more  it will be an awful job and he is so happy i wont plague him yet guess ill go and put my room to rights first and pick up some clean clothes to put on him if he is alive after i get through with him thought molly foreseeing a stormy passage for the boy who hated a bath as much as some people hate a trip across the atlantic  up she went and finding the fire out felt discouraged thought she would rest a little more so retired under the blankets to read one of the christmas books the dinnerbell rang while she was still wandering happily in nellys silver mine and she ran down to find that boo had laid out a railroad all across her neat room using bits of coal for sleepers and books for rails over which he was dragging the yellow sled laden with a dismayed kitten the tailless dog and the remains of the sausage evidently on its way to the tomb for boo took bites at it now and then no other lunch being offered him  oh dear why cant boys play without making such a mess sighed molly picking up the feathers from the duster with which boo had been trying to make a cockydoo of the hapless dog ill wash him right after dinner and that will keep him out of mischief for a while she thought as the young engineer unsuspiciously proceeded to ornament his already crocky countenance with squash cranberry sauce and gravy till he looked more like a fiji chief in full warpaint than a christian boy  i want two pails of hot water please miss bat and the big tub said molly as the ancient handmaid emptied her fourth cup of tea for she dined with the family and enjoyed her own good cooking in its prime  what are you going to wash now  booim sure he needs it enough and molly could not help laughing as the victim added to his brilliant appearance by smearing the colors all together with a rub of two grimy hands making a fine turner of himself  now maria louisa bemis you aint going to cut up no capers with that child the idea of a hot bath in the middle of the day and him full of dinner and croupy into the bargain wet a corner of a towel at the kettlespout and polish him off if you like but you wont risk his life in no bathtubs this cold day  miss bats word was law in some things so molly had to submit and took boo away saying loftily as she left the room  i shall ask father and do it tonight for i will not have my brother look like a pig  my patience how the siamese do leave their things round she exclaimed as she surveyed her room after making up the fire and polishing off boo ill put things in order and then mend up my rags if i can find my thimble now let me see and she went to exploring her closet bureau and table finding such disorder everywhere that her courage nearly gave out  she had clothes enough but all needed care even her best dress had two buttons off and her sunday hat but one string shoes skirts books and toys lay about and her drawers were a perfect chaos of soiled ruffles odd gloves old ribbons boot lacings and bits of paper  oh my heart what a muddle mrs minot wouldnt think much of me if she could see that said molly recalling how that lady once said she could judge a good deal of a little girls character and habits by a peep at her top drawer and went on with great success to guess how each of the schoolmates kept her drawer  come missionary clear up and dont let me find such a gloryhole again or ill report you to the society said molly tipping the whole drawerfull out upon the bed and beguiling the tiresome job by keeping up the new play  twilight came before it was done and a great pile of things loomed up on her table with no visible means of repairfor mollys workbasket was full of nuts and her thimble down a hole in the shedfloor where the cats had dropped it in their play  ill ask bat for hooks and tape and papa for some money to buy scissors and things for i dont know where mine are glad i cant do any more now being neat is such hard work and molly threw herself down on the rug beside the old wooden cradle in which boo was blissfully rocking with a cargo of toys aboard  she watched her time and as soon as her father had done supper she hastened to say before he got to his desk  please papa i want a dollar to get some brass buttons and things to fix boos clothes with he wore a hole in his new trousers coasting down the kembles steps and cant i wash him he needs it and miss bat wont let me have a tub  certainly child certainly do what you like only dont keep me i must be off or i shall miss jackson and hes the man i want and throwing down two dollars instead of one mr bemis hurried away with a vague impression that boo had swallowed a dozen brass buttons and miss bat had been coasting somewhere in a bathpan but catching jackson was important so he did not stop to investigate  armed with the paternal permission molly carried her point and oh what a dreadful evening poor boo spent first he was decoyed upstairs an hour too soon then put in a tub by main force and sternly scrubbed in spite of shrieks that brought miss bat to the locked door to condole with the sufferer scold the scrubber and depart darkly prophesying croup before morning  he always howls when he is washed but i shall do it since you wont and he must get used to it i will not have people tell me hes neglected if i can help it cried molly working away with tears in her eyesfor it was as hard for her as for boo but she meant to be thorough for once in her life no matter what happened  when the worst was over she coaxed him with candy and stories till the long task of combing out the curls was safely done then in the clean nightgown with a blue button newly sewed on she laid him in bed worn out but sweet as a rose  now say your prayers darling and go to sleep with the nice red blanket all tucked round so you wont get cold said molly rather doubtful of the effect of the wet head  no i wont going to sleep now and boo shut his eyes wearily feeling that his late trials had not left him in a prayerful mood  then youll be a real little heathen as mrs pecq called you and i dont know what i shall do with you said molly longing to cuddle rather than scold the little fellow whose soul needed looking after as well as his body  no no i wont be a heevin i dont want to be frowed to the trockindiles i will say my prayers oh i will and rising in his bed boo did so with the devotion of an infant samuel for he remembered the talk when the society was formed  molly thought her labors were over for that night and soon went to bed tired with her first attempts but toward morning she was wakened by the hoarse breathing of the boy and was forced to patter away to miss bats room humbly asking for the squills and confessing that the prophecy had come to pass  i knew it bring the child to me and dont fret ill see to him and next time you do as i say was the consoling welcome she received as the old lady popped up a sleepy but anxious face in a large flannel cap and shook the bottle with the air of a general who had routed the foe before and meant to do it again  leaving her little responsibility in miss bats arms molly retired to wet her pillow with a few remorseful tears and to fall asleep wondering if real missionaries ever killed their pupils in the process of conversion  so the girls all failed in the beginning but they did not give up and succeeded better next time as we shall see     chapter ix the debating club   look here old man we ought to have a meeting holidays are over and we must brace up and attend to business said frank to gus as they strolled out of the schoolyard one afternoon in january apparently absorbed in conversation but in reality waiting for a blue cloud and a scarlet feather to appear on the steps  all right when where and what asked gus who was a man of few words  tonight our house subject shall girls go to college with us mother said we had better be making up our minds because every one is talking about it and we shall have to be on one side or the other so we may as well settle it now answered frank for there was an impression among the members that all vexed questions would be much helped by the united eloquence and wisdom of the club  very good ill pass the word and be there hullo neddy the dc meets tonight at minots seven sharp coed c added gus losing no time as a third boy came briskly round the corner with a little bag in his hand  ill come got home an hour earlier tonight and thought id look you up as i went by responded ed devlin as he took possession of the third post with a glance toward the schoolhouse to see if a sealskin cap with a long yellow braid depending therefrom was anywhere in sight  very good of you im sure said gus ironically not a bit deceived by this polite attention  the longest way round is sometimes the shortest way home hey ed and frank gave him a playful poke that nearly sent him off his perch  then they all laughed at some joke of their own and gus added no girls coming to hear us tonight dont think it my son  mores the pity and ed shook his head regretfully over the downfall of his hopes  cant help it the other fellows say they spoil the fun so we have to give in sometimes for the sake of peace and quietness dont mind having them a bit myself said frank in such a tone of cheerful resignation that they laughed again for the triangle as the three chums were called always made merry music  we must have a game party next week the girls like that and so do i candidly observed gus whose pleasant parlors were the scene of many such frolics  and so do your sisters and your cousins and your aunts hummed ed for gus was often called admiral because he really did possess three sisters two cousins and four aunts besides mother and grandmother all living in the big house together  the boys promptly joined in the popular chorus and other voices all about the yard took it up for the pinafore epidemic raged fearfully in harmony village that winter  hows business asked gus when the song ended for ed had not returned to school in the autumn but had gone into a store in the city  dull things will look up toward spring they say i get on well enough but i miss you fellows dreadfully and ed put a hand on the broad shoulder of each friend as if he longed to be a schoolboy again  better give it up and go to college with me next year said frank who was preparing for boston university while gus fitted for harvard  no ive chosen business and i mean to stick to it so dont you unsettle my mind have you practised that march asked ed turning to a gayer subject for he had his little troubles but always looked on the bright side of things  skating is so good i dont get much time come early and well have a turn at it  i will must run home now  pretty cold loafing here  mail is in by this time  and with these artless excuses the three boys leaped off the posts as if one spring moved them as a group of girls came chattering down the path the blue cloud floated away beside frank the scarlet feather marched off with the admiral while the fur cap nodded to the gray hat as two happy faces smiled at each other  the same thing often happened for twice aday the streets were full of young couples walking to and from school together smiled at by the elders and laughed at by the less susceptible boys and girls who went alone or trooped along in noisy groups the prudent mothers had tried to stop this guileless custom but found it very difficult as the fathers usually sympathized with their sons and dismissed the matter with the comfortable phrase never mind boys will be boys not forever returned the anxious mammas seeing the tall lads daily grow more manly and the pretty daughters fast learning to look demure when certain names were mentioned  it could not be stopped without great parental sternness and the danger of deceit for coeducation will go on outside of school if not inside and the safest way is to let sentiment and study go hand in hand with teachers and parents to direct and explain the great lesson all are the better for learning soon or late so the elders had to give in acknowledging that this sudden readiness to go to school was a comfort that the new sort of gentle emulation worked wonders in lazy girls and boys and that watching these primrose friendships bud blossom and die painless deaths gave a little touch of romance to their own workaday lives  on the whole id rather have my sons walking playing and studying with bright wellmannered girls than always knocking about with rough boys said mrs minot at one of the mothers meetings where the good ladies met to talk over their children and help one another to do their duty by them  i find that gus is more gentle with his sisters since juliet took him in hand for he wants to stand well with her and they report him if he troubles them i really see no harm in the little friendship though i never had any such when i was a girl said mrs burton who adored her one boy and was his confidante  my merry seems to be contented with her brothers so far but i shouldnt wonder if i had my hands full by and by added mrs grant who already foresaw that her sweet little daughter would be sought after as soon as she should lengthen her skirts and turn up her bonny brown hair  molly loo had no mother to say a word for her but she settled matters for herself by holding fast to merry and declaring that she would have no escort but faithful boo  it is necessary to dwell a moment upon this new amusement because it was not peculiar to harmony village but appears everywhere as naturally as the game parties and croquet which have taken the place of the husking frolics and applebees of olden times and it is impossible to dodge the subject if one attempts to write of boys and girls as they really are nowadays  here my hero see how you like this if it suits you will be ready to march as soon as the doctor gives the word said ralph coming into the bird room that evening with a neat little crutch under his arm  ha ha that looks fine id like to try it right off but i wont till i get leave did you make it yourself ral asked jack handling it with delight as he sat bolt upright with his leg on a rest for he was getting on capitally now  mostly rather a neat job i flatter myself  i should say so what a clever fellow you are any new inventions lately asked frank coming up to examine and admire  only an antisnoring machine and an elbowpad answered ralph with a twinkle in his eye as if reminded of something funny  go on and tell about them i never heard of an antisnorer jack better have one said frank interested at once  well a rich old lady kept her family awake with that lively music so she sent to shirtman and codleff for something to stop it they thought it was a good joke and told me to see what i could do i thought it over and got up the nicest little affair you ever saw it went over the mouth and had a tube to fit the ear so when the lady snored she woke herself up and stopped it it suited exactly i think of taking out a patent concluded ralph joining in the boys laugh at the droll idea  what was the pad asked frank returning to the small model of an engine he was making  oh that was a mere trifle for a man who had a tender elbowjoint and wanted something to protect it i made a little pad to fit on and his crazybone was safe  i planned to have you make me a new leg if this one was spoilt said jack sure that his friend could invent anything under the sun  id do my best for you i made a hand for a fellow once and that got me my place you know answered ralph who thought little of such mechanical trifles and longed to be painting portraits or modelling busts being an artist as well as an inventor  here gus ed and several other boys came in and the conversation became general grif chick and brickbat were three young gentlemen whose own respectable names were usually ignored and they cheerfully answered to these nicknames  as the clock struck seven frank who ruled the club with a rod of iron when chairman took his place behind the study table seats stood about it and a large shabby book lay before gus who was secretary and kept the records with a lavish expenditure of ink to judge by the blots the members took their seats and nearly all tilted back their chairs and put their hands in their pockets to keep them out of mischief for as every one knows it is impossible for two lads to be near each other and refrain from tickling or pinching frank gave three raps with an old croquetmallet set on a short handle and with much dignity opened the meeting  gentlemen the business of the club will be attended to and then we will discuss the question shall girls go to our colleges the secretary will now read the report of the last meeting  clearing his throat gus read the following brief and elegant report  club met december 18th at the house of g burton esq subject is summer or winter best fun a lively powwow about evenly divided j flint fined five cents for disrespect to the chair a collection of forty cents taken up to pay for breaking a pane of glass during a free fight of the members on the doorstep e devlin was chosen secretary for the coming year and a new book contributed by the chairman  thats all  is there any other business before the meeting asked frank as the reader closed the old book with a slam and shoved the new one across the table  ed rose and glancing about him with an appealing look said as if sure his proposition would not be well received i wish to propose the name of a new member bob walker wants to join and i think we ought to let him he is trying to behave well and i am sure we could help him cant we  all the boys looked sober and joe otherwise brickbat said bluntly i wont hes a bad lot and we dont want any such here let him go with chaps of his own sort  that is just what i want to keep him from hes a goodhearted boy enough only no one looks after him so he gets into scrapes as we should if we were in his place i dare say he wants to come here and would be so proud if he was let in i know hed behave come now lets give him a chance and ed looked at gus and frank sure that if they stood by him he should carry his point  but gus shook his head as if doubtful of the wisdom of the plan and frank said gravely you know we made the rule that the number should never be over eight and we cannot break it  you neednt i cant be here half the time so i will resign and let bob have my place began ed but he was silenced by shouts of no no you shant we wont let you off club would go to smash if you back out  let him have my place im the youngest and you wont miss me cried jack bound to stand by ed at all costs  we might do that said frank who did object to small boys though willing to admit this particular one  better make a new rule to have ten members and admit both bob and tom grant said ralph whereat grif grinned and joe scowled for one lad liked merrys big brother and the other did not  thats a good idea put it to vote said gus too kindhearted to shut the door on any one  first i want to ask if all you fellows are ready to stand by bob out of the club as well as in for it wont do much good to be kind to him here and cut him at school and in the street said ed heartily in earnest about the matter  i will cried jack ready to follow where his beloved friend led and the others nodded unwilling to be outdone by the youngest member  good with all of us to lend a hand we can do a great deal and i tell you boys it is time if we want to keep poor bob straight we all turn our backs on him so he loafs round the tavern and goes with fellows we dont care to know but he isnt bad yet and we can keep him up im sure if we just try i hope to get him into the lodge and that will be half the battle wont it frank added ed sure that this suggestion would have weight with the honorable chairman  bring him along im with you answered frank making up his mind at once for he had joined the temperance lodge four years ago and already six boys had followed his example  he is learning to smoke but well make him drop it before it leads to worse you can help him there admiral if you only will added ed giving a grateful look at one friend and turning to the other  im your man and gus looked as if he knew what he promised for he had given up smoking to oblige his father and kept his word like a hero  you other fellows can do a good deal by just being kind and not twitting him with old scrapes and ill do anything i can for you all to pay for this and ed sat down with a beaming smile feeling that his cause was won  the vote was taken and all hands went up for even surly joe gave in so bob and tom were duly elected and proved their gratitude for the honor done them by becoming worthy members of the club it was only boys play now but the kind heart and pure instincts of one lad showed the others how to lend a helping hand to a comrade in danger and win him away from temptation to the safer pastimes of their more guarded lives  well pleased with themselvesfor every genuine act or word no matter how trifling it seems leaves a sweet and strengthening influence behindthe members settled down to the debate which was never very long and often only an excuse for fun of all sorts  ralph gus and ed are for and brickbat grif and chick against i suppose said frank surveying his company like a general preparing for battle  no sir i believe in coeverything cried chick a mild youth who loyally escorted a chosen damsel home from school every day  a laugh greeted this bold declaration and chick sat down red but firm  ill speak for two since the chairman cant and jack wont go against those who pet him most to death said joe who not being a favorite with the girls considered them a nuisance and lost no opportunity of telling them so  fire away then since you are up commanded frank  well began joe feeling too late how much he had undertaken i dont know a great deal about it and i dont care but i do not believe in having girls at college they dont belong there nobody wants em and theyd better be at home darning their stockings  yours too put in ralph who had heard that argument so often he was tired of it  of course thats what girls are for i dont mind em at school but id just as soon they had a room to themselves we should get on better  you would if mabel wasnt in your class and always ahead of you observed ed whose friend was a fine scholar and he very proud of the fact  look here if you fellows keep interrupting i wont sit down for half an hour said joe well knowing that eloquence was not his gift but bound to have his say out  deep silence reigned for that threat quelled the most impatient member and joe prosed on using all the arguments he had ever heard and paying off several old scores by sly hits of a personal nature as older orators often do  it is clear to my mind that boys would get on better without any girls fooling round as for their being as smart as we are it is all nonsense for some of em cry over their lessons every day or go home with headaches or get mad and scold all recess because something isnt fair no sir girls aint meant to know much and they cant wise folks say so and i believe em havent got any sisters myself and i dont want any for they dont seem to amount to much according to those who do have em  groans from gus and ed greeted the closing remarks of the ungallant joe who sat down feeling that he had made somebody squirm up jumped grif the delight of whose life was practical jokes which amiable weakness made him the terror of the girls though they had no other fault to find with the merry lad  mr chairman the ground i take is this girls have not the strength to go to college with us they couldnt row a race go on a lark or take care of themselves as we do they are all well enough at home and i like them at parties but for real fun and go i wouldnt give a cent for them began grif whose views of a collegiate life were confined to the enjoyments rather than the studies of that festive period i have tried them and they cant stand anything they scream if you tell them there is a mouse in the room and run if they see a big dog i just put a cockroach in mollys desk one day and when she opened it she jumped as if she was shot  so did the gentlemen of the club for at that moment halfadozen firecrackers exploded under the chair grif had left and flew wildly about the room order was with difficulty restored the mischievous party summarily chastised and commanded to hold his tongue under penalty of ejectment from the room if he spoke again firmly grasping that red and unruly member grif composed himself to listen with his nose in the air and his eyes shining like black beads  ed was always the peacemaker and now when he rose with his engaging smile his voice fell like oil upon the troubled waters and his bright face was full of the becoming bashfulness which afflicts youths of seventeen when touching upon such subjects of newly acquired interest as girls and their pleasant but perplexing ways  it seems to me we have hardly considered the matter enough to be able to say much but i think that school would be awfully dry and dismal withoutahemany young ladies to make it nice i wouldnt give a pin to go if there was only a crowd of fellows though i like a good game as well as any man i pity any boy who has no sisters continued ed warming up as he thought of his own who loved him dearly as well they might for a better brother never lived home wouldnt be worth having without them to look after a fellow to keep him out of scrapes help him with his lessons and make things jolly for his friends i tell you we cant do without girls and im not ashamed to say that i think the more we see of them and try to be like them in many ways the better men we shall be by and by  hear hear cried frank in his deepest tone for he heartily agreed to that having talked the matter over with his mother and received much light upon things which should always be set right in young heads and hearts and who can do this so wisely and well as mothers if they only will  feeling that his sentiments had been approved and he need not be ashamed of the honest color in his cheeks ed sat down amid the applause of his side especially of jack who pounded so vigorously with his crutch that mrs pecq popped in her head to see if anything was wanted  no thank you maam we were only cheering ed said gus now upon his legs and rather at a loss what to say till mrs pecqs appearance suggested an idea and he seized upon it  my honored friend has spoken so well that i have little to add i agree with him and if you want an example of what girls can do why look at jill shes young i know but a firstrate scholar for her age as for pluck she is as brave as a boy and almost as smart at running rowing and so on of course she cant play ballno girl can their arms are not made right to throwbut she can catch remarkably well ill say that for her now if she and mabelandandsome others i could name are so clever and strong at the beginning i dont see why they shouldnt keep up and go along with us all through im willing and will do what i can to help other fellows sisters as id like to have them help mine and ill punch their heads if they dont and gus subsided assured by a burst of applause that his manly way of stating the case met with general approval  we shall be happy to hear from our senior member if he will honor us with a few remarks said frank with a bow to ralph  no one ever knew whom he would choose to personate for he never spoke in his own character now he rose slowly put one hand in his bosom and fixing his eye sternly on grif who was doing something suspicious with a pin gave them a touch of sergeant buzfuz from the pickwick trial thinking that the debate was not likely to throw much light on the subject under discussion in the midst of this appeal to me lud and gentlemen of the jury he suddenly paused smoothed his hair down upon his forehead rolled up his eyes and folding his hands droned out mr chadbands sermon on peace delivered over poor jo and ending with the famous lines    oh running stream of sparkling joy   to be a glorious human boy  then setting his hair erect with one comprehensive sweep he caught up his coatskirts over his arm and assuming a parliamentary attitude burst into a comical medley composed of extracts from jefferson bricks and lafayette kettles speeches and elijah pograms defiance from martin chuzzlewit gazing at gus who was convulsed with suppressed merriment he thundered forth  in the name of our common country sir in the name of that righteous cause in which we are jined and in the name of the starspangled banner i thank you for your eloquent and categorical remarks you sir are a model of a man fresh from naturs mould a trueborn child of this free hemisphere verdant as the mountains of our land bright and flowin as our mineral licks unspiled by fashion as air our boundless perearers rough you may be so air our barrs wild you may be so air our buffalers but sir you air a child of freedom and your proud answer to the tyrant is that your bright home is in the settin sun and sir if any man denies this fact though it be the british lion himself i defy him let me have him heresmiting the table and causing the inkstand to skiphere upon this sacred altar here upon the ancestral ashes cemented with the glorious blood poured out like water on the plains of chickabiddy lick alone i dare that lion and tell him that freedoms hand once twisted in his mane he rolls a corse before me and the eagles of the great republic scream ha ha  by this time the boys were rolling about in fits of laughter even sober frank was red and breathless and jack lay back feebly squealing as he could laugh no more in a moment ralph was as meek as a quaker and sat looking about him with a mildly astonished air as if inquiring the cause of such unseemly mirth a knock at the door produced a lull and in came a maid with apples  times up fall to and make yourselves comfortable was the summary way in which the club was released from its sterner duties and permitted to unbend its mighty mind for a social halfhour chiefly devoted to whist with an indian wardance as a closing ceremony     chapter x the dramatic club   while jack was hopping gayly about on his crutches poor jill was feeling the effects of her second fall and instead of sitting up as she hoped to do after six weeks of rest she was ordered to lie on a board for two hours each day not an easy penance by any means for the board was very hard and she could do nothing while she lay there as it did not slope enough to permit her to read without great fatigue of both eyes and hands so the little martyr spent her first hour of trial in sobbing the second in singing for just as her mother and mrs minot were deciding in despair that neither she nor they could bear it jill suddenly broke out into a merry chorus she used to hear her father sing    faut jouer le mirliton   faut jouer le mirlitir   faut jouer le mirliter   mirliton  the sound of the brave little voice was very comforting to the two mothers hovering about her and jack said with a look of mingled pity and admiration as he brandished his crutch over the imaginary foes  thats right sing away and well play you are an indian captive being tormented by your enemies and too proud to complain ill watch the clock and the minute time is up ill rush in and rescue you  jill laughed but the fancy pleased her and she straightened herself out under the gay afghan while she sang in a plaintive voice another little french song her father taught her    javais une colombe blanche   javais un blanc petit pigeon   tous deux volaient de branche en branche   jusquau faîte de mon dongeon   mais comme un coup de vent dautomne   sest abattu là lépervier   et ma colombe si mignonne   ne revient plus au colombier  my poor jean had a fine voice and always hoped the child would take after him it would break his heart to see her lying there trying to cheer her pain with the songs he used to sing her to sleep with said mrs pecq sadly  she really has a great deal of talent and when she is able she shall have some lessons for music is a comfort and a pleasure sick or well answered mrs minot who had often admired the fresh voice with its pretty accent  here jill began the canadian boatsong with great vigor as if bound to play her part of indian victim with spirit and not disgrace herself by any more crying all knew the air and joined in especially jack who came out strong on the row brothers row but ended in a squeak on a high note so drolly that the rest broke down so the hour that began with tears ended with music and laughter and a new pleasure to think of for the future  after that day jill exerted all her fortitude for she liked to have the boys call her brave and admire the cheerful way in which she endured two hours of discomfort she found she could use her zither as it lay upon her breast and every day the pretty music began at a certain hour and all in the house soon learned to love and listen for it even the old cook set open her kitchen door saying pitifully poor darlint hear how purty shes singin wid the pain on that crewel boord its a little saint she is may her bed above be aisy  frank would lift her gently on and off with a kind word that comforted her immensely and gentle ed would come and teach her new bits of music while the other fellows were frolicking below ralph added his share to her amusement for he asked leave to model her head in clay and set up his work in a corner coming to pat scrape and mould whenever he had a spare minute amusing her by his lively chat and showing her how to shape birds rabbits and queer faces in the soft clay when the songs were all sung and her fingers tired of the zither  the girls sympathized very heartily with her new trial and brought all manner of gifts to cheer her captivity merry and molly made a gay screen by pasting pictures on the black cambric which covered the folding frame that stood before her to keep the draughts from her as she lay on her board bright birds and flowers figures and animals covered one side and on the other they put mottoes bits of poetry anecdotes and short stories so that jill could lie and look or read without the trouble of holding a book it was not all done at once but grew slowly and was a source of instruction as well as amusement to them all as they read carefully that they might make good selections  but the thing that pleased jill most was something jack did for he gave up going to school and stayed at home nearly a fortnight after he might have gone all for her sake the day the doctor said he might try it if he would be very careful he was in great spirits and limped about looking up his books and planning how he would astonish his mates by the rapidity of his recovery when he sat down to rest he remembered jill who had been lying quietly behind the screen while he talked with his mother busy putting fresh covers on the books  she is so still i guess she is asleep thought jack peeping round the corner  no not asleep but lying with her eyes fixed on the sunny window beyond which the bright winter world sparkled after a fresh snowfall the jingle of sleighbells could be heard the laughter of boys and girls on their way to school all the pleasant stir of a new day of happy work and play for the rest of the world more lonely quiet and wearisome than ever to her since her friend and fellowprisoner was set free and going to leave her  jack understood that patient wistful look and without a word went back to his seat staring at the fire so soberly that his mother presently asked what are you thinking of so busily with that pucker in your forehead  ive about made up my mind that i wont go to school just yet answered jack slowly lifting his head for it cost him something to give up the longexpected pleasure  why not and mrs minot looked much surprised till jack pointed to the screen and making a sad face to express jills anguish answered in a cheerful tone well im not sure that it is best doctor did not want me to go but said i might because i teased i shall be sure to come to grief and then every one will say i told you so and that is so provoking id rather keep still a week longer hadnt i better  his mother smiled and nodded as she said sewing away at muchabused old caesar as if she loved him do as you think best dear i always want you at home but i dont wonder you are rather tired of it after this long confinement  i say jill should i be in your way if i didnt go to school till the first of february called jack laughing to himself at the absurdity of the question  not much answered a glad voice from behind the screen and he knew the sorrowful eyes were shining with delight though he could not see them  well i guess i may as well and get quite firm on my legs before i start another week or so will bring me up if i study hard so i shall not lose my time ill tackle my latin as soon as its ready mother  jack got a hearty kiss with the neatly covered book and mamma loved him for the little sacrifice more than if he had won a prize at school he did get a reward for in five minutes from the time he decided jill was singing like a bobolink and such a medley of merry music came from behind the screen that it was a regular morning concert she did not know then that he stayed for her sake but she found it out soon after and when the time came did as much for him as we shall see  it proved a wise decision for the last part of january was so stormy jack could not have gone half the time so while the snow drifted and bitter winds raged he sat snugly at home amusing jill and getting on bravely with his lessons for frank took great pains with him to show his approbation of the little kindness and somehow the memory of it seemed to make even the detested latin easier  with february fair weather set in and jack marched happily away to school with jills new mittens on his hands mamma nodding from the doorstep and frank ready to give him a lift on the new sled if the way proved too long or too rough  i shall not have time to miss him now for we are to be very busy getting ready for the twentysecond the dramatic club meets tonight and would like to come here if they may so i can help said jill as mrs minot came up expecting to find her rather low in her mind  certainly and i have a basket of old finery i looked up for the club when i was rummaging out bits of silk for your blue quilt answered the good lady who had set up a new employment to beguile the hours of jacks absence  when the girls arrived that evening they found mrs chairwoman surrounded by a strew of theatrical properties enjoying herself very much all brought such contributions as they could muster and all were eager about a certain tableau which was to be the gem of the whole they thought jill of course was not expected to take any part but her taste was good so all consulted her as they showed their old silks laces and flowers asking who should be this and who that all wanted to be the sleeping beauty for that was the chosen scene with the slumbering court about the princess and the prince in the act of awakening her jack was to be the hero brave in his mothers velvet cape red boots and a real sword while the other boys were to have parts of more or less splendor  mabel should be the beauty because her hair is so lovely said juliet who was quite satisfied with her own part of the queen  no merry ought to have it as she is the prettiest and has that splendid veil to wear answered molly who was to be the maid of honor cuffing the little page boo  i dont care a bit but my feather would be fine for the princess and i dont know as emma would like to have me lend it to any one else said annette waving a long white plume over her head with girlish delight in its grace  i should think the white silk dress the veil and the feather ought to go together with the scarlet crape shawl and these pearls that would be sweet and just what princesses really wear advised jill who was stringing a quantity of old roman pearls  we all want to wear the nice things so let us draw lots wouldnt that be the fairest way asked merry looking like a rosy little bride under a great piece of illusion which had done duty in many plays  the prince is light so the princess must be darkish we ought to choose the girl who will look best as it is a picture i heard miss delano say so when the ladies got up the tableaux last winter and every one wanted to be cleopatra said jill decidedly  you choose and then if we cant agree we will draw lots proposed susy who being plain knew there was little hope of her getting a chance in any other way  so all stood in a row and jill from her sofa surveyed them critically feeling that the one jack would really prefer was not among the number  i choose that one for juliet wants to be queen molly would make faces and the others are too big or too light pronounced jill pointing to merry who looked pleased while mabels face darkened and susy gave a disdainful sniff  youd better draw lots and then there will be no fuss ju and i are out of the fight but you three can try and let this settle the matter said molly handing jill a long strip of paper  all agreed to let it be so and when the bits were ready drew in turn this time fate was evidently on merrys side and no one grumbled when she showed the longest paper  go and dress then come back and well plan how we are to be placed before we call up the boys commanded jill who was manager since she could be nothing else  the girls retired to the bedroom and began to rig up as they called it but discontent still lurked among them and showed itself in sharp words envious looks and disobliging acts  am i to have the white silk and the feather asked merry delighted with the silvery shimmer of the one and the graceful droop of the other though both were rather shabby  you can use your own dress i dont see why you should have everything answered susy who was at the mirror putting a wreath of scarlet flowers on her red head bound to be gay since she could not be pretty  i think id better keep the plume as i havent anything else that is nice and im afraid emma wouldnt like me to lend it added annette who was disappointed that mabel was not to be the beauty  i dont intend to act at all declared mabel beginning to braid up her hair with a jerk out of humor with the whole affair  i think you are a set of cross selfish girls to back out and keep your nice things just because you cant all have the best part im ashamed of you scolded molly standing by merry who was sadly surveying her mothers old purple silk which looked like brown in the evening  im going to have miss delanos red brocade for the queen and i shall ask her for the yellowsatin dress for merry when i go to get mine and tell her how mean you are said juliet frowning under her giltpaper crown as she swept about in a red tablecloth for train till the brocade arrived  perhaps youd like to have mabel cut her hair off so merry can have that too cried susy with whom hair was a tender point  light hair isnt wanted so ju will have to give hers or youd better borrow miss bats frisette added mabel with a scornful laugh  i just wish miss bat was here to give you girls a good shaking do let someone else have a chance at the glass you peacock exclaimed molly loo pushing susy aside to arrange her own blue turban out of which she plucked the pink pompon to give merry  dont quarrel about me i shall do well enough and the scarlet shawl will hide my ugly dress said merry from the corner where she sat waiting for her turn at the mirror  as she spoke of the shawl her eye went in search of it and something that she saw in the other room put her own disappointment out of her head jill lay there all alone rather tired with the lively chatter and the effort it cost her not to repine at being shut out from the great delight of dressing up and acting  her eyes were closed her net was off and all the pretty black curls lay about her shoulders as one hand idly pulled them out while the other rested on the red shawl as if she loved its glowing color and soft texture she was humming to herself the little song of the dove and the donjon and something in the plaintive voice the solitary figure went straight to merrys gentle heart  poor jilly cant have any of the fun was the first thought then came a second that made merry start and smile and in a minute whisper so that all but jill could hear her girls im not going to be the princess but ive thought of a splendid one  who asked the rest staring at one another much surprised by this sudden announcement  hush speak low or you will spoil it all look in the bird room and tell me if that isnt a prettier princess than i could make  they all looked but no one spoke and merry added with sweet eagerness it is the only thing poor jill can be and it would make her so happy jack would like it and it would please every one i know perhaps she will never walk again so we ought to be very good to her poor dear  the last words whispered with a little quiver in the voice settled the matter better than hours of talking for girls are tenderhearted creatures and not one of these but would have gladly given all the pretty things she owned to see jill dancing about well and strong again like a ray of sunshine the kind thought touched and brightened every face envy impatience vanity and discontent flew away like imps at the coming of the good fairy and with one accord they all cried  it will be lovely let us go and tell her  forgetting their own adornment out they trooped after merry who ran to the sofa saying with a smile which was reflected in all the other faces jill dear we have chosen another princess and i know youll like her  who is it asked jill languidly opening her eyes without the least suspicion of the truth  ill show you and taking the cherished veil from her own head merry dropped it like a soft cloud over jill annette added the long plume susy laid the white silk dress about her while juliet and mabel lifted the scarlet shawl to spread it over the foot of the sofa and molly tore the last ornament from her turban a silver star to shine on jills breast then they all took hands and danced round the couch singing as they laughed at her astonishment there she is there she is princess jill as fine as you please  do you really mean it but can i is it fair how sweet of you come here and let me hug you all cried jill in a rapture at the surprise and the pretty way in which it was done  the grand scene on the twentysecond was very fine indeed but the little tableau of that minute was infinitely better though no one saw it as jill tried to gather them all in her arms for that nosegay of girlish faces was the sweeter because each one had sacrificed her own little vanity to please a friend and her joy was reflected in the eyes that sparkled round the happy princess  oh you dear kind things to think of me and give me all your best clothes i never shall forget it and ill do anything for you yes ill write and ask mrs piper to lend us her ermine cloak for the king see if i dont  shrieks of delight hailed this noble offer for no one had dared to borrow the muchcoveted mantle but all agreed that the old lady would not refuse jill it was astonishing how smoothly everything went after this for each was eager to help admire and suggest in the friendliest way and when all were dressed the boys found a party of very gay ladies waiting for them round the couch where lay the brightest little princess ever seen  oh jack im to act wasnt it dear of the girls to choose me dont they look lovely arent you glad cried jill as the lads stared and the lasses blushed and smiled well pleased at the frank admiration the boyish faces showed  i guess i am you are a set of trumps and well give you a firstclass spread after the play to pay for it wont we fellows answered jack much gratified and feeling that now he could act his own part capitally  we will it was a handsome thing to do and we think well of you for it hey gus and frank nodded approvingly at all though he looked only at annette  as king of this crowd i call it to order said gus retiring to the throne where juliet sat laughing in her red tablecloth  well have the fair one with golden locks next time i promise you that whispered ed to mabel whose shining hair streamed over her blue dress like a mantle of goldcolored silk  girls are pretty nice things arent they kind of em to take jill in dont molly look fine though and grifs black eyes twinkled as he planned to pin her skirts to merrys at the first opportunity  susy looks as gay as a featherduster i like her she never snubs a fellow said joe much impressed with the splendor of the court ladies  the boys costumes were not yet ready but they posed well and all had a merry time ending with a game of blindmansbuff in which every one caught the right person in the most singular way and all agreed as they went home in the moonlight that it had been an unusually jolly meeting  so the fairy play woke the sleeping beauty that lies in all of us and makes us lovely when we rouse it with a kiss of unselfish goodwill for though the girls did not know it then they had adorned themselves with pearls more precious than the waxen ones they decked their princess in     chapter xi down brakes   the greatest people have their weak points and the bestbehaved boys now and then yield to temptation and get into trouble as everybody knows frank was considered a remarkably wellbred and proper lad and rather prided himself on his good reputation for he never got into scrapes like the other fellows well hardly ever for we must confess that at rare intervals his besetting sin overcame his prudence and he proved himself an erring human boy steamengines had been his idols for years and they alone could lure him from the path of virtue once in trying to investigate the mechanism of a toy specimen which had its little boiler and ran about whistling and puffing in the most delightful way he nearly set the house afire by the sparks that dropped on the straw carpet another time in trying experiments with the kitchen teakettle he blew himself up and the scars of that explosion he still carried on his hands  he was long past such childish amusements now but his favorite haunt was the enginehouse of the new railroad where he observed the habits of his pets with neverfailing interest and cultivated the goodwill of stokers and brakemen till they allowed him many liberties and were rather flattered by the admiration expressed for their iron horses by a young gentleman who liked them better even than his greek and latin  there was not much business doing on this road as yet and the two cars of the passengertrains were often nearly empty though full freighttrains rolled from the factory to the main road of which this was only a branch so things went on in a leisurely manner which gave frank many opportunities of pursuing his favorite pastime he soon knew all about no 11 his pet engine and had several rides on it with bill the engineer so that he felt at home there and privately resolved that when he was a rich man he would have a road of his own and run trains as often as he liked  gus took less interest than his friend in the study of steam but usually accompanied him when he went over after school to disport himself in the enginehouse interview the stoker or see if there was anything new in the way of brakes  one afternoon they found no 11 on the sidetrack puffing away as if enjoying a quiet smoke before starting no cars were attached and no driver was to be seen for bill was off with the other men behind the stationhouse helping the expressman whose horse had backed down a bank and upset the wagon  good chance for a look at the old lady said frank speaking of the engine as bill did and jumping aboard with great satisfaction followed by gus  id give ten dollars if i could run her up to the bend and back he added fondly touching the bright brass knobs and glancing at the fire with a critical eye  you couldnt do it alone answered gus sitting down on the grimy little perch willing to indulge his mates amiable weakness  give me leave to try steam is up and i could do it as easy as not and frank put his hand on the throttlevalve as if daring gus to give the word  fire up and make her hum laughed gus quoting bills frequent order to his mate but with no idea of being obeyed  all right ill just roll her up to the switch and back again ive often done it with bill and frank cautiously opened the throttlevalve threw back the lever and the great thing moved with a throb and a puff  steady old fellow or youll come to grief here dont open that shouted gus for just at that moment joe appeared at the switch looking ready for mischief  wish he would no train for twenty minutes and we could run up to the bend as well as not said frank getting excited with the sense of power as the monster obeyed his hand so entirely that it was impossible to resist prolonging the delight  by george he has stop her back her hold on frank cried gus as joe only catching the words open that obeyed without the least idea that they would dare to leave the siding  but they did for frank rather lost his head for a minute and out upon the main track rolled no 11 as quietly as a welltrained horse taking a familiar road  now youve done it ill give you a good thrashing when i get back roared gus shaking his fist at joe who stood staring halfpleased halfscared at what he had done  are you really going to try it asked gus as they glided on with increasing speed and he too felt the charm of such a novel adventure though the consequences bid fair to be serious  yes i am answered frank with the grim look he always wore when his strong will got the upper hand bill will give it to us any way so we may as well have our fun out if you are afraid ill slow down and you can jump off and his brown eyes sparkled with the double delight of getting his hearts desire and astonishing his friend at the same time by his skill and coolness  go ahead ill jump when you do and gus calmly sat down again bound in honor to stand by his mate till the smash came though rather dismayed at the audacity of the prank  dont you call this just splendid exclaimed frank as they rolled along over the crossing past the bridge toward the curve a mile from the station  not bad they are yelling like mad after us better go back if you can said gus who was anxiously peering out and in spite of his efforts to seem at ease not enjoying the trip a particle  let them yell i started to go to the curve and ill do it if it costs me a hundred dollars no danger theres no train under twenty minutes i tell you and frank pulled out his watch but the sun was in his eyes and he did not see clearly or he would have discovered that it was later than he thought  on they went and were just rounding the bend when a shrill whistle in front startled both boys and drove the color out of their cheeks  its the factory train cried gus in a husky tone as he sprang to his feet  no its the fiveforty on the other road answered frank with a queer thrill all through him at the thought of what might happen if it was not both looked straight ahead as the last tree glided by and the long track lay before them with the freight train slowly coming down for an instant the boys stood as if paralyzed  jump said gus looking at the steep bank on one side and the river on the other undecided which to try  sit still commanded frank collecting his wits as he gave a warning whistle to retard the oncoming train while he reversed the engine and went back faster than he came  a crowd of angry men was waiting for them and bill stood at the open switch in a towering passion as no 11 returned to her place unharmed but bearing two pale and frightened boys who stepped slowly and silently down without a word to say for themselves while the freight train rumbled by on the main track  frank and gus never had a very clear idea as to what occurred during the next few minutes but vaguely remembered being well shaken sworn at questioned threatened with direful penalties and finally ordered off the premises forever by the wrathful depotmaster joe was nowhere to be seen and as the two culprits walked away trying to go steadily while their heads spun round and all the strength seemed to have departed from their legs frank said in an exhausted tone  come down to the boathouse and rest a minute  both were glad to get out of sight and dropped upon the steps red rumpled and breathless after the late exciting scene gus generously forebore to speak though he felt that he was the least to blame and frank after eating a bit of snow to moisten his dry lips said handsomely  now dont you worry old man ill pay the damages for it was my fault joe will dodge but i wont so make your mind easy  we shant hear the last of this in a hurry responded gus relieved yet anxious as he thought of the reprimand his father would give him  i hope mother wont hear of it till i tell her quietly myself she will be so frightened and think im surely smashed up if she is told in a hurry and frank gave a shiver as all the danger he had run came over him suddenly  i thought we were done for when we saw that train guess we should have been if you had not had your wits about you i always said you were a cool one and gus patted franks back with a look of great admiration for now that it was all over he considered it a very remarkable performance  which do you suppose it will be fine or imprisonment asked frank after sitting in a despondent attitude for a moment  shouldnt wonder if it was both running off with an engine is no joke you know  what did possess me to be such a fool groaned frank repenting all too late of yielding to the temptation which assailed him  bear up old fellow ill stand by you and if the worst comes ill call as often as the rules of the prison allow said gus consolingly as he gave his afflicted friend an arm and they walked away both feeling that they were marked men from that day forth  meantime joe as soon as he recovered from the shock of seeing the boys actually go off ran away as fast as his legs could carry him to prepare mrs minot for the loss of her son for the idea of their coming safely back never occurred to him his knowledge of engines being limited a loud ring at the bell brought mrs pecq who was guarding the house while mrs minot entertained a parlor full of company  franks run off with no 11 and hell be killed sure thought id come up and tell you stammered joe all out of breath and looking wild  he got no further for mrs pecq clapped one hand over his mouth caught him by the collar with the other and hustled him into the anteroom before any one else could hear the bad news  tell me all about it and dont shout whats come to the boy she demanded in a tone that reduced joe to a whisper at once  go right back and see what has happened to him then come and tell me quietly ill wait for you here i wouldnt have his mother startled for the world said the good soul when she knew all  oh i darsnt i opened the switch as they told me to and bill will half kill me when he knows it cried joe in a panic as the awful consequences of his deed rose before him showing both boys mortally injured and several trains wrecked  then take yourself off home and hold your tongue ill watch the door for i wont have any more ridiculous boys tearing in to disturb my lady  mrs pecq often called this good neighbor my lady when speaking of her for mrs minot was a true gentlewoman and much pleasanter to live with than the titled mistress had been  joe scudded away as if the constable was after him and presently frank was seen slowly approaching with an unusually sober face and a pair of very dirty hands  thank heaven hes safe and softly opening the door mrs pecq actually hustled the young master into the anteroom as unceremoniously as she had hustled joe  i beg pardon but the parlor is full of company and that fool of a joe came roaring in with a cockandbull story that gave me quite a turn what is it mr frank she asked eagerly seeing that something was amiss  he told her in a few words and she was much relieved to find that no harm had been done  ah the danger is to come said frank darkly as he went away to wash his hands and prepare to relate his misdeeds  it was a very bad quarter of an hour for the poor fellow who so seldom had any grave faults to confess but he did it manfully and his mother was so grateful for the safety of her boy that she found it difficult to be severe enough and contented herself with forbidding any more visits to the too charming no 11  what do you suppose will be done to me asked frank on whom the idea of imprisonment had made a deep impression  i dont know dear but i shall go over to see mr burton right after tea he will tell us what to do and what to expect gus must not suffer for your fault  hell come off clear enough but joe must take his share for if he hadnt opened that confounded switch no harm would have been done but when i saw the way clear i actually couldnt resist going ahead said frank getting excited again at the memory of that blissful moment when he started the engine  here jack came hurrying in having heard the news and refused to believe it from any lips but franks when he could no longer doubt he was so much impressed with the daring of the deed that he had nothing but admiration for his brother till a sudden thought made him clap his hands and exclaim exultingly  his runaway beats mine all hollow and now he cant crow over me wont that be a comfort the good boy has got into a scrape hooray  this was such a droll way of taking it that they had to laugh and frank took his humiliation so meekly that jack soon fell to comforting him instead of crowing over him  jill thought it a most interesting event and when frank and his mother went over to consult mr burton she and jack planned out for the dear culprit a dramatic trial which would have convulsed the soberest of judges his sentence was ten years imprisonment and such heavy fines that the family would have been reduced to beggary but for the sums made by jills fancy work and jacks success as a champion pedestrian  they found such comfort and amusement in this sensational programme that they were rather disappointed when frank returned reporting that a fine would probably be all the penalty exacted as no harm had been done and he and gus were such respectable boys what would happen to joe he could not tell but he thought a good whipping ought to be added to his share  of course the affair made a stir in the little world of children and when frank went to school feeling that his character for good behavior was forever damaged he found himself a lion and was in danger of being spoiled by the admiration of his comrades who pointed him out with pride as the fellow who ran off with a steamengine  but an interview with judge kemble a fine of twentyfive dollars and lectures from all the grown people of his acquaintance prevented him from regarding his escapade as a feat to boast of he discovered also how fickle a thing is public favor for very soon those who had praised began to tease and it took all his courage patience and pride to carry him through the next week or two the lads were never tired of alluding to no 11 giving shrill whistles in his ear asking if his watch was right and drawing locomotives on the blackboard whenever they got a chance  the girls too had sly nods and smiles hints and jokes of a milder sort which made him color and fume and once lose his dignity entirely molly loo who dearly loved to torment the big boys and dared attack even solemn frank left one of boos old tin trains on the doorstep directed to conductor minot who i regret to say could not refrain from kicking it into the street and slamming the door with a bang that shook the house shrieks of laughter from wicked molly and her coadjutor grif greeted this explosion of wrath which did no good however for half an hour later the same cars all in a heap were on the steps again with two headless dolls tumbling out of the cab and the dilapidated engine labelled no 11 after the collision  no one ever saw that ruin again and for days frank was utterly unconscious of mollys existence as propriety forbade his having it out with her as he had with grif then annette made peace between them and the approach of the twentysecond gave the wags something else to think of  but it was long before frank forgot that costly prank for he was a thoughtful boy who honestly wanted to be good so he remembered this episode humbly and whenever he felt the approach of temptation he made the strong will master it saying to himself down brakes thus saving the precious freight he carried from many of the accidents which befall us when we try to run our trains without orders and so often wreck ourselves as well as others     chapter xii the twentysecond of february   of course the young ladies and gentlemen had a ball on the evening of that day but the boys and girls were full of excitement about their scenes from the life of washington and other brilliant tableaux as the programme announced the bird room was the theatre being very large with four doors conveniently placed ralph was in his element putting up a little stage drilling boys arranging groups and uniting in himself carpenter scenepainter manager and gas man mrs minot permitted the house to be turned topsyturvy and mrs pecq flew about lending a hand everywhere jill was costumer with help from miss delano who did not care for balls and kindly took charge of the girls jack printed tickets programmes and placards of the most imposing sort and the work went gayly on till all was ready  when the evening came the bird room presented a fine appearance one end was curtained off with red drapery and real footlights with tin shades gave a truly theatrical air to the little stage rows of chairs filled with mammas and little people occupied the rest of the space the hall and franks room were full of amused papas uncles and old gentlemen whose patriotism brought them out in spite of rheumatism there was a great rustling of skirts fluttering of fans and much lively chat till a bell rang and the orchestra struck up  yes there really was an orchestra for ed declared that the national airs must be played or the whole thing would be a failure so he had exerted himself to collect all the musical talent he could find a horn a fiddle and a flute with drum and fife for the martial scenes ed looked more beaming than ever as he waved his baton and led off with yankee doodle as a safe beginning for every one knew that it was fun to see little johnny cooper bang away on a big drum and old mr munson who had been a fifer all his days blow till he was as red as a lobster while every one kept time to the music which put them all in good spirits for the opening scene  up went the curtain and several trees in tubs appeared then a stately gentleman in small clothes cocked hat gray wig and an imposing cane came slowly walking in it was gus who had been unanimously chosen not only for washington but for the father of the hero also that the family traits of long legs and a somewhat massive nose might be preserved  ahem my trees are doing finely observed mr w senior strolling along with his hands behind him casting satisfied glances at the dwarf orange oleander abutilon and little pine that represented his orchard  suddenly he starts pauses frowns and after examining the latter shrub which displayed several hacks in its stem and a broken limb with six redvelvet cherries hanging on it he gave a thump with his cane that made the little ones jump and cried out  can it have been my son  he evidently thought it was for he called in tones of thunder  george george washington come hither this moment  great suspense on the part of the audience then a general burst of laughter as boo trotted in a perfect miniature of his honored parent knee breeches cocked hat shoe buckles and all he was so fat that the little tails of his coat stuck out in the drollest way his chubby legs could hardly carry the big buckles and the rosy face displayed when he took his hat off with a dutiful bow was so solemn the real george could not have looked more anxious when he gave the immortal answer  sirrah did you cut that tree demanded the papa with another rap of the cane and such a frown that poor boo looked dismayed till molly whispered put your hand up dear then he remembered his part and putting one finger in his mouth looked down at his squaretoed shoes the image of a shamestricken boy  my son do not deceive me if you have done this deed i shall chastise you for it is my duty not to spare the rod lest i spoil the child but if you lie about it you disgrace the name of washington forever  this appeal seemed to convulse george with inward agony for he squirmed most effectively as he drew from his pocket a toy hatchet which would not have cut a straw then looking straight up into the aweinspiring countenance of his parent he bravely lisped  papa i tannot tell a lie i did tut it with my little hanchet  noble boycome to my arms i had rather you spoilt all my cherry trees than tell one lie cried the delighted gentleman catching his son in an embrace so close that the fat legs kicked convulsively and the little coattails waved in the breeze while cane and hatchet fell with a dramatic bang  the curtain descended on this affecting tableau but the audience called out both washingtons and they came hand in hand bowing with the cocked hats pressed to their breasts the elder smiling blandly while the younger still flushed by his exertions nodded to his friends asking with engaging frankness wasnt it nice  the next was a marine piece for a boat was seen surrounded by tumultuous waves of blue cambric and rowed by a party of stalwart men in regimentals who with difficulty kept their seats for the boat was only a painted board and they sat on boxes or stools behind it but few marked the rowers for in their midst tall straight and steadfast as a mast stood one figure in a cloak with folded arms high boots and under the turnedup hat a noble countenance stern with indomitable courage a sword glittered at his side and a banner waved over him but his eye was fixed on the distant shore and he was evidently unconscious of the roaring billows the blocks of ice the discouragement of his men or the danger and death that might await him napoleon crossing the alps was not half so sublime and with one voice the audience cried washington crossing the delaware while the band burst forth with see the conquering hero comes all out of tune but bound to play it or die in the attempt  it would have been very successful if all of a sudden one of the rowers had not caught a crab with disastrous consequences the oars were not moving but a veteran who looked very much like joe dropped the one he held and in trying to turn and pummel the blackeyed warrior behind him he tumbled off his seat upsetting two other men and pulling the painted boat upon them as they lay kicking in the cambric deep shouts of laughter greeted this mishap but george washington never stirred grasping the banner he stood firm when all else went down in the general wreck and the icy waves engulfed his gallant crew leaving him erect amid a chaos of wildly tossing boots entangled oars and redfaced victims such godlike dignity could not fail to impress the frivolous crowd of laughers and the curtain fell amid a round of applause for him alone  quite exciting wasnt it didnt know gus had so much presence of mind said mr burton well pleased with his boy  if we did not know that washington died in his bed december 14 1799 i should fear that wed seen the last of him in that shipwreck laughed an old gentleman proud of his memory for dates  much confusion reigned behind the scenes ralph was heard scolding and joe set every one off again by explaining audibly that grif tickled him and he couldnt stand it a pretty oldfashioned picture of the daughters of liberty followed for the girls were determined to do honor to the brave and patient women who so nobly bore their part in the struggle yet are usually forgotten when those days are celebrated the damsels were charming in the big caps flowered gowns and highheeled shoes of their greatgrandmothers as they sat about a spiderlegged table talking over the tax and pledging themselves to drink no more tea till it was taken off molly was on her feet proposing liberty forever and down with all tyrants to judge from her flashing eyes as she held her eggshell cup aloft while the others lifted theirs to drink the toast and merry as hostess sat with her hand on an antique teapot labelled sage ready to fill again when the patriotic ladies were ready for a second dish  this was much applauded and the curtain went up again for the proud parents enjoyed seeing their pretty girls in the faded finery of a hundred years ago the band played auld lang syne as a gentle hint that our foremothers should be remembered as well as the forefathers  it was evident that something very martial was to follow for a great tramping clashing and flying about took place behind the scenes while the teaparty was going on after some delay the surrender of cornwallis was presented in the most superb manner as you can believe when i tell you that the stage was actually lined with a glittering array of washington and his generals lafayette kosciusko rochambeau and the rest all in astonishing uniforms with swords which were evidently the pride of their lives fife and drum struck up a march and in came cornwallis much cast down but full of manly resignation as he surrendered his sword and stood aside with averted eyes while his army marched past piling their arms at the heros feet  this scene was the delight of the boys for the rifles of company f had been secured and at least a dozen soldiers kept filing in and out in british uniform till washingtons august legs were hidden by the heaps of arms rattled down before him the martial music the steady tramp and the patriotic memories awakened caused this scene to be enthusiastically encored and the boys would have gone on marching till midnight if ralph had not peremptorily ordered down the curtain and cleared the stage for the next tableau  this had been artfully slipped in between two brilliant ones to show that the father of his country had to pay a high price for his glory the darkened stage represented what seemed to be a camp in a snowstorm and a very forlorn camp too for on the cold cold ground a reckless display of cotton batting lay ragged soldiers sleeping without blankets their wornout boots turned up pathetically and no sign of food or fire to be seen a very shabby sentinel with feet bound in bloody cloths and his face as pale as chalk could make it gnawed a dry crust as he kept his watch in the wintry night  a tent at the back of the stage showed a solitary figure sitting on a log of wood poring over the map spread upon his knee by the light of one candle stuck in a bottle there could be no doubt who this was for the buffandblue coat the legs the nose the attitude all betrayed the great george laboring to save his country in spite of privations discouragements and dangers which would have daunted any other man  valley forge said someone and the room was very still as old and young looked silently at this little picture of a great and noble struggle in one of its dark hours the crust the wounded feet the rags the snow the loneliness the indomitable courage and endurance of these men touched the hearts of all for the mimic scene grew real for a moment and when a childs voice broke the silence asking pitifully oh mamma was it truly as dreadful as that a general outburst answered as if every one wanted to cheer up the brave fellows and bid them fight on for victory was surely coming  in the next scene it did come and washington at trenton was prettily done an arch of flowers crossed the stage with the motto the defender of the mothers will be the preserver of the daughters and as the hero with his generals advanced on one side a troop of girls in oldfashioned muslin frocks came to scatter flowers before him singing the song of long ago    welcome mighty chief once more   welcome to this grateful shore   now no mercenary foe   aims again the fatal blow   aims at thee the fatal blow    virgins fair and matrons grave   those thy conquering arm did save   build for thee triumphal bowers   strew ye fair his way with flowers   strew your heros way with flowers  and they did singing with all their hearts as they flung artificial roses and lilies at the feet of the great men who bowed with benign grace jack who did lafayette with a limp covered himself with glory by picking up one of the bouquets and pressing it to his heart with all the gallantry of a frenchman and when washington lifted the smallest of the maids and kissed her the audience cheered couldnt help it you know it was so pretty and inspiring  the washington family after the famous picture came next with annette as the serene and sensible martha in a very becoming cap the general was in uniform there being no time to change but his attitude was quite correct and the custis boy and girl displayed the wide sash and ruffled collar with historic fidelity the band played home and every one agreed that it was sweet  now i dont see what more they can have except the deathbed and that would be rather out of place in this gay company said the old gentleman to mr burton as he mopped his heated face after pounding so heartily he nearly knocked the ferule off his cane  no they gave that up for my boy wouldnt wear a nightgown in public i cant tell secrets but i think they have got a very clever little finale for the first parta pretty compliment to one person and a pleasant surprise to all answered mr burton who was in great spirits being fond of theatricals and very justly proud of his children for the little girls had been among the trenton maids and the mimic general had kissed his own small sister nelly very tenderly  a great deal of interest was felt as to what this surprise was to be and a general oh greeted the minute man standing motionless upon his pedestal it was frank and ralph had done his best to have the figure as perfect as possible for the maker of the original had been a good friend to him and while the young sculptor was dancing gayly at the ball this copy of his work was doing him honor among the children frank looked it very well for his firmset mouth was full of resolution his eyes shone keen and courageous under the threecornered hat and the muscles stood out upon the bare arm that clutched the old gun even the buttons on the gaiters seemed to flash defiance as the sturdy legs took the first step from the furrow toward the bridge where the young farmer became a hero when he fired the shot heard round the world  that is splendid as like to the original as flesh can be to bronze how still he stands hell fight when the time comes and die hard wont he hush you make the statue blush these very audible remarks certainly did for the color rose visibly as the modest lad heard himself praised though he saw but one face in all the crowd his mothers far back but full of love and pride as she looked up at her young minute man waiting for the battle which often calls us when we least expect it and for which she had done her best to make him ready  if there had been any danger of frank being puffed up by the success of his statue it was counteracted by irrepressible grif who just at the most interesting moment when all were gazing silently gave a whistle followed by a choo choo choo and all aboard so naturally that no one could mistake the joke especially as another laughing voice added now then no 11 which brought down the house and the curtain too  frank was so angry it was very difficult to keep him on his perch for the last scene of all he submitted however rather than spoil the grand finale hoping that its beauty would efface that illtimed pleasantry from the public mind so when the agreeable clamor of hands and voices called for a repetition the minute man reappeared grimmer than before but not alone for grouped all about his pedestal were washington and his generals the matrons and maids with a background of troops shouldering arms grif and joe doing such rash things with their muskets that more than one hero received a poke in his august back before the full richness of this picture had been taken in ed gave a rap and all burst out with hail columbia in such an inspiring style that it was impossible for the audience to refrain from joining which they did all standing and all singing with a heartiness that made the walls ring the fife shrilled the horn blew sweet and clear the fiddle was nearly drowned by the energetic boom of the drum and out into the starry night through open windows rolled the song that stirs the coldest heart with patriotic warmth and tunes every voice to music  america we must have america pipe up ed this is too good to end without one song more cried mr burton who had been singing like a trumpet and hardly waiting to get their breath off they all went again with the national hymn singing as they never had sung it before for somehow the little scenes they had just acted or beheld seemed to show how much this dear america of ours had cost in more than one revolution how full of courage energy and virtue it was in spite of all its faults and what a privilege as well as duty it was for each to do his part toward its safety and its honor in the present as did those brave men and women in the past  so the scenes from the life of washington were a great success and when the songs were over people were glad of a brief recess while they had raptures and refreshed themselves with lemonade  the girls had kept the secret of who the princess was to be and when the curtain rose a hum of surprise and pleasure greeted the pretty group jill lay asleep in all her splendor the bonny prince just lifting the veil to wake her with a kiss and all about them the court in its nap of a hundred years the king and queen dozing comfortably on the throne the maids of honor like a garland of nodding flowers about the couch the little page unconscious of the blow about to fall and the fool dreaming with his mouth wide open  it was so pretty people did not tire of looking till jacks lame leg began to tremble and he whispered drop her or i shall pitch down went the curtain but it rose in a moment and there was the court after the awakening the king and queen looking about them with sleepy dignity the maids in various attitudes of surprise the fool grinning from ear to ear and the princess holding out her hand to the prince as if glad to welcome the right lover when he came at last  molly got the laugh this time for she could not resist giving poor boo the cuff which had been hanging over him so long she gave it with unconscious energy and boo cried ow so naturally that all the children were delighted and wanted it repeated but boo declined and the scenes which followed were found quite as much to their taste having been expressly prepared for the little people  mother gooses reception was really very funny for ralph was the old lady and had hired a representation of the immortal bird from a real theatre for this occasion there they stood the dame in her pointed hat red petticoat cap and cane with the noble fowl a good deal larger than life beside her and grif inside enjoying himself immensely as he flapped the wings moved the yellow legs and waved the long neck about while unearthly quacks issued from the bill that was a great surprise for the children and they got up in their seats to gaze their fill many of them firmly believing that they actually beheld the blessed old woman who wrote the nursery songs they loved so well  then in came one after another the best of the characters she has made famous while a voice behind the scenes sang the proper rhyme as each made their manners to the interesting pair mistress mary and her pretty maids all in a row passed by to their places in the background king cole and his fiddlers three made a goodly show so did the royal couple who followed the great pie borne before them with the fourandtwenty blackbirds popping their heads out in the most delightful way little bopeep led a woolly lamb and wept over its lost tail for not a sign of one appeared on the poor thing simple simon followed the pieman gloating over his wares with the drollest antics the little wife came trundling by in a wheelbarrow and was not upset neither was the lady with rings on her fingers and bells on her toes as she cantered along on a rockinghorse bobby shaftos yellow hair shone finely as he led in the maid whom he came back from sea to marry miss muffet bowl in hand ran away from an immense black spider which waggled its long legs in a way so lifelike that some of the children shook in their little shoes the beggars who came to town were out in full force rags tags and velvet gowns quite true to life boy blue rubbed his eyes with hay sticking in his hair and tooted on a tin horn as if bound to get the cows out of the corn molly with a longhandled fryingpan made a capital queen in a tuckedup gown checked apron and high crown to good king arthur who very properly did not appear after stealing the barleymeal which might be seen in the pan tied up in a pudding like a cannonball ready to fry  but tobias mollys black cat covered himself with glory by the spirit with which he acted his part in    sing sing what shall i sing   the cats run away with the puddingbag string  first he was led across the stage on his hind legs looking very fierce and indignant with a long tape trailing behind him and being set free at the proper moment he gave one bound over the fourandtwenty blackbirds who happened to be in the way and dashed off as if an enraged cook had actually been after him straight downstairs to the coalbin where he sat glaring in the dark till the fun was over  when all the characters had filed in and stood in two long rows music struck up and they danced all the way to boston a simple but lively affair which gave each a chance to show his or her costume as they pranced down the middle and up outside  such a funny medley as it was for there went fat king cole with the most ragged of the beggarmaids mistress mary in her pretty blue dress tripped along with simple simon staring about him like a blockhead the fine lady left her horse to dance with bobby shafto till every bell on her slippers tinkled its tongue out bopeep and a jolly fiddler skipped gayly up and down miss muffet took the big spider for her partner and made his many legs fly about in the wildest way the little wife got out of the wheelbarrow to help boy blue along and molly with the fryingpan over her shoulder led off splendidly when it was grand right and left  but the old lady and her goose were the best of all for the dames shoebuckles cut the most astonishing pigeonwings and to see that mammoth bird waddle down the middle with its wings half open its long neck bridling and its yellow legs in the first position as it curtsied to its partner was a sight to remember it was so intensely funny  the merry old gentleman laughed till he cried mr burton split his gloves he applauded so enthusiastically while the children beat the dust out of the carpet hopping up and down as they cried do it again we want it all over when the curtain went down at last on the flushed and panting party mother g bowing with her hat all awry and the goose doing a double shuffle as if it did not know how to leave off  but they could not do it all over again for it was growing late and the people felt that they certainly had received their moneys worth that evening  so it all ended merrily and when the guests departed the boys cleared the room like magic and the promised supper to the actors was served in handsome style jack and jill were at one end mrs goose and her bird at the other and all between was a comical collection of military heroes fairy characters and nursery celebrities all felt the need of refreshment after their labors and swept over the table like a flight of locusts leaving devastation behind but they had earned their fun and much innocent jollity prevailed while a few lingering papas and mammas watched the revel from afar and had not the heart to order these noble beings home till even the father of his country declared that hed had a perfectly splendid time but couldnt keep his eyes open another minute and very wisely retired to replace the immortal cocked hat with a nightcap     chapter xiii jack has a mystery   what is the matter does your head ache asked jill one evening in march observing that jack sat with his head in his hands an attitude which with him meant either pain or perplexity  no but im bothered i want some money and i dont see how i can earn it he answered tumbling his hair about and frowning darkly at the fire  how much and jills ready hand went to the pocket where her little purse lay for she felt rich with several presents lately made her  two seventyfive no thank you i wont borrow  what is it for  cant tell  why i thought you told me everything  sorry but i cant this time dont you worry i shall think of something  couldnt your mother help  dont wish to ask her  why cant she know  nobody can  how queer is it a scrape jack asked jill looking as curious as a magpie  it is likely to be if i cant get out of it this week somehow  well i dont see how i can help if im not to know anything and jill seemed rather hurt  you can just stop asking questions and tell me how a fellow can earn some money that would help ive got one dollar but i must have some more and jack looked worried as he fingered the little gold dollar on his watchguard  oh do you mean to use that  yes i do a man must pay his debts if he sells all he has to do it said jack sternly  dear me it must be something very serious and jill lay quite still for five minutes thinking over all the ways in which jack ever did earn money for mrs minot liked to have her boys work and paid them in some way for all they did  is there any wood to saw she asked presently being very anxious to help  all done  paths to shovel  no snow  lawn to rake then  not time for that yet  catalogue of books  frank got that job  copy those letters for your mother  take me too long must have my money friday if possible  i dont see what we can do then it is too early or too late for everything and you wont borrow  not of you no nor of any one else if i can possibly help it ive promised to do this myself and i will and jack wagged his head resolutely  couldnt you do something with the printingpress do me some cards and then perhaps the other girls will want some said jill as a forlorn hope  just the thing what a goose i was not to think of it ill rig the old machine up at once and starting from his seat jack dived into the big closet dragged out the little press and fell to oiling dusting and putting it in order like one relieved of a great anxiety  give me the types ill sort them and set up my name so you can begin as soon as you are ready you know what a help i was when we did the programmes im almost sure the girls will want cards and i know your mother would like some more tags said jill briskly rattling the letters into the different compartments while jack inked the rollers and hunted up his big apron whistling the while with recovered spirits  a dozen neat cards were soon printed and jill insisted on paying six cents for them as earning was not borrowing a few odd tags were found and done for mamma who immediately ordered four dozen at six cents a dozen though she was not told why there was such a pressing call for money  jacks monthly halfdollar had been spent the first weektwentyfive cents for a concert ten paid a fine for keeping a book too long from the library ten more to have his knife ground and five in candy for he dearly loved sweeties and was under bonds to mamma not to spend more than five cents a month on these unwholesome temptations she never asked the boys what they did with their money but expected them to keep account in the little books she gave them and now and then they showed the neat pages with pardonable pride though she often laughed at the queer items  all that evening jack  co worked busily for when frank came in he goodnaturedly ordered some palepink cards for annette and ran to the store to choose the right shade and buy some packages for the young printer also  what do you suppose he is in such a pucker for whispered jill as she set up the new name to frank who sat close by with one eye on his book and one on her  oh some notion hes a queer chap but i guess it isnt much of a scrape or i should know it hes so goodnatured hes always promising to do things for people and has too much pluck to give up when he finds he cant let him alone and it will all come out soon enough answered frank who laughed at his brother but loved him none the less for the tender heart that often got the better of his young head  but for once frank was mistaken the mystery did not come out and jack worked like a beaver all that week as orders poured in when jill and annette showed their elegant cards for as everybody knows if one girl has a new thing all the rest must whether it is a bow on the top of her head a peculiar sort of pencil or the latest kind of chewinggum little play did the poor fellow get for every spare minute was spent at the press and no invitation could tempt him away so much in earnest was our honest little franklin about paying his debt jill helped all she could and cheered his labors with her encouragement remembering how he stayed at home for her  it is real good of you to lend a hand and im ever so much obliged said jack as the last order was struck off and the drawer of the typebox held a pile of shining five and ten cent pieces with two or three quarters  i love to only it would be nicer if i knew what we were working for she said demurely as she scattered type for the last time and seeing that jack was both tired and grateful hoped to get a hint of the secret  i want to tell you dreadfully but i cant because ive promised  what never  never and jack looked as firm as a rock  then i shall find out for i havent promised  you cant  see if i dont  you are sharp but you wont guess this its a tremendous secret and nobody will tell it  youll tell it yourself you always do  i wont tell this it would be mean  wait and see i can get anything out of you if i try and jill laughed knowing her power well for jack found it very hard to keep a secret from her  dont try please dont it wouldnt be right and you dont want to make me do a dishonorable thing for your sake i know  jack looked so distressed that jill promised not to make him tell though she held herself free to find out in other ways if she could  thus relieved jack trudged off to school on friday with the two dollars and seventyfive cents jingling in his pocket though the dear gold coin had to be sacrificed to make up the sum he did his lessons badly that day was late at recess in the afternoon and as soon as school was over departed in his rubber boots to take a walk he said though the roads were in a bad state with a spring thaw nothing was seen of him till after teatime when he came limping in very dirty and tired but with a reposeful expression which betrayed that a load was off his mind frank was busy about his own affairs and paid little attention to him but jill was on tenterhooks to know where he had been yet dared not ask the question  merrys brother wants some cards he liked hers so much he wishes to make his ladylove a present heres the name and jill held up the order from harry grant who was to be married in the autumn  must wait till next week im too tired to do a thing tonight and i hate the sight of that old press answered jack laying himself down upon the rug as if every joint ached  what made you take such a long walk you look as tired as if youd been ten miles said jill hoping to discover the length of the trip  had to four or five miles isnt much only my leg bothered me and jack gave the ailing member a slap as if he had found it much in his way that day for though he had given up the crutches long ago he rather missed their support sometimes then with a great yawn he stretched himself out to bask in the blaze pillowing his head on his arms  dear old thing he looks all used up i wont plague him with talking and jill began to sing as she often did in the twilight  by the time the first song ended a gentle snore was heard and jack lay fast asleep worn out with the busy week and the walk which had been longer and harder than any one guessed jill took up her knitting and worked quietly by firelight still wondering and guessing what the secret could be for she had not much to amuse her and little things were very interesting if connected with her friends presently jack rolled over and began to mutter in his sleep as he often did when too weary for sound slumber jill paid no attention till he uttered a name which made her prick up her ears and listen to the broken sentences which followed only a few words but she dropped her work saying to herself  i do believe he is talking about the secret now i shall find out and he will tell me himself as i said he would  much pleased she leaned and listened but could make no sense of the confused babble about heavy boots all right old fellow jerrys off and the ink is too thick  the slam of the front door woke jack and he pulled himself up declaring that he believed he had been having a nap  i wish youd have another said jill greatly disappointed at the loss of the intelligence she seemed to be so near getting  floor is too hard for tired bones guess ill go to bed and get rested up for monday ive worked like fury this week so next im going in for fun and little dreaming what hard times were in store for him jack went off to enjoy his warm bath and welcome bed where he was soon sleeping with the serene look of one whose dreams were happy whose conscience was at rest                                       i have a few words to say to you before you go said mr acton pausing with his hand on the bell monday afternoon when the hour came for dismissing school  the bustle of putting away books and preparing for as rapid a departure as propriety allowed subsided suddenly and the boys and girls sat as still as mice while the hearts of such as had been guilty of any small sins began to beat fast  you remember that we had some trouble last winter about keeping the boys away from the saloon and that a rule was made forbidding any pupil to go to town during recess began mr acton who being a conscientious man as well as an excellent teacher felt that he was responsible for the children in school hours and did his best to aid parents in guarding them from the few temptations which beset them in a country town a certain attractive little shop where confectionery baseballs stationery and picture papers were sold was a favorite loafing place for some of the boys till the rule forbidding it was made because in the rear of the shop was a beer and billiard saloon a wise rule for the picture papers were not always of the best sort cigars were to be had idle fellows hung about there and some of the lads who wanted to be thought manly ventured to pass the green baize door just to look on  a murmur answered the teachers question and he continued you all know that the rule was broken several times and i told you the next offender would be publicly reprimanded as private punishments had no effect i am sorry to say that the time has come and the offender is a boy whom i trusted entirely it grieves me to do this but i must keep my promise and hope the example will have a good effect  mr acton paused as if he found it hard to go on and the boys looked at one another with inquiring eyes for their teacher seldom punished and when he did it was a very solemn thing several of these anxious glances fell upon joe who was very red and sat whittling a pencil as if he dared not lift his eyes  hes the chap wont he catch it whispered gus to frank for both owed him a grudge  the boy who broke the rule last friday at afternoon recess will come to the desk said mr acton in his most impressive manner  if a thunderbolt had fallen through the roof it would hardly have caused a greater surprise than the sight of jack minot walking slowly down the aisle with a wrathful flash in the eyes he turned on joe as he passed him  now minot let us have this over as soon as possible for i do not like it any better than you do and i am sure there is some mistake im told you went to the shop on friday is it true asked mr acton very gently for he liked jack and seldom had to correct him in any way  yes sir and jack looked up as if proud to show that he was not afraid to tell the truth as far as he could  to buy something  no sir  to meet someone  yes sir  was it jerry shannon  no answer but jacks fists doubled up of themselves as he shot another fiery glance at joe whose face burned as if it scorched him  i am told it was also that you were seen to go into the saloon with him did you and mr acton looked so sure that it was a mistake that it cost jack a great effort to say slowly  yes sir  quite a thrill pervaded the school at this confession for jerry was one of the wild fellows the boys all shunned and to have any dealings with him was considered a very disgraceful thing  did you play  no sir i cant  drink beer  i belong to the lodge and jack stood as erect as any little soldier who ever marched under a temperance banner and fought for the cause none are too young nor too old to help along  i was sure of that then what took you there my boy  the question was so kindly put that jack forgot himself an instant and blurted out  i only went to pay him some money sir  ah how much  two seventyfive muttered jack as red as a cherry at not being able to keep a secret better  too much for a lad like you to owe such a fellow as jerry how came it and mr acton looked disturbed  jack opened his lips to speak but shut them again and stood looking down with a little quiver about the mouth that showed how much it cost him to be silent  does any one beside jerry know of this  one other fellow after a pause  yes i understand and mr actons eye glanced at joe with a look that seemed to say i wish hed held his tongue  a queer smile flitted over jacks face for joe was not the other fellow and knew very little about it excepting what he had seen when he was sent on an errand by mr acton on friday  i wish you would explain the matter john for i am sure it is better than it seems and it would be very hard to punish you when you dont deserve it  but i do deserve it ive broken the rule and i ought to be punished said jack as if a good whipping would be easier to bear than this public crossexamination  and you cant explain or even say you are sorry or ashamed asked mr acton hoping to surprise another fact out of the boy  no sir i cant im not ashamed im not sorry and id do it again tomorrow if i had to cried jack losing patience and looking as if he would not bear much more  a groan from the boys greeted this barefaced declaration and susy quite shivered at the idea of having taken two bites out of the apple of such a hardened desperado  think it over till tomorrow and perhaps you will change your mind remember that this is the last week of the month and reports are given out next friday said mr acton knowing how much the boy prided himself on always having good ones to show his mother  poor jack turned scarlet and bit his lips to keep them still for he had forgotten this when he plunged into the affair which was likely to cost him dear then the color faded away the boyish face grew steady and the honest eyes looked up at his teacher as he said very low but all heard him the room was so still  it isnt as bad as it looks sir but i cant say any more no one is to blame but me and i couldnt help breaking the rule for jerry was going away i had only that time and id promised to pay up so i did  mr acton believed every word he said and regretted that they had not been able to have it out privately but he too must keep his promise and punish the offender whoever he was  very well you will lose your recess for a week and this months report will be the first one in which behavior does not get the highest mark you may go and i wish it understood that master minot is not to be troubled with questions till he chooses to set this matter right  then the bell rang the children trooped out mr acton went off without another word and jack was left alone to put up his books and hide a few tears that would come because frank turned his eyes away from the imploring look cast upon him as the culprit came down from the platform a disgraced boy  elder brothers are apt to be a little hard on younger ones so it is not surprising that frank who was an eminently proper boy was much cut up when jack publicly confessed to dealings with jerry leaving it to be supposed that the worst half of the story remained untold he felt it his duty therefore to collar poor jack when he came out and talk to him all the way home like a judge bent on getting at the truth by main force a kind word would have been very comforting but the scolding was too much for jacks temper so he turned dogged and would not say a word though frank threatened not to speak to him for a week  at teatime both boys were very silent one looking grim the other excited frank stared sternly at his brother across the table and no amount of marmalade sweetened or softened that reproachful look jack defiantly crunched his toast with occasional slashes at the butter as if he must vent the pentup emotions which half distracted him of course their mother saw that something was amiss but did not allude to it hoping that the cloud would blow over as so many did if left alone but this one did not and when both refused cake this sure sign of unusual perturbation made her anxious to know the cause as soon as tea was over jack retired with gloomy dignity to his own room and frank casting away the paper he had been pretending to read burst out with the whole story mrs minot was as much surprised as he but not angry because like most mothers she was sure that her sons could not do anything very bad  i will speak to him my boy wont refuse to give me some explanation she said when frank had freed his mind with as much warmth as if jack had broken all the ten commandments  he will you often call me obstinate but he is as pigheaded as a mule joe only knows what he saw old telltale and jerry has left town or id have it out of him make jack own up whether he can or not little donkey stormed frank who hated rowdies and could not forgive his brother for being seen with one  my dear all boys do foolish things sometimes even the wisest and best behaved so dont be hard on the poor child he has got into trouble ive no doubt but it cannot be very bad and he earned the money to pay for his prank whatever it was  mrs minot left the room as she spoke and frank cooled down as if her words had been a showerbath for he remembered his own costly escapade and how kindly both his mother and jack had stood by him on that trying occasion so feeling rather remorseful he went off to talk it over with gus leaving jill in a fever of curiosity for merry and molly had dropped in on their way home to break the blow to her and frank declined to discuss it with her after mildly stating that jack was a ninny in his opinion  well i know one thing said jill confidentially to snowball when they were left alone together if every one else is scolding him i wont say a word its so mean to crow over people when they are down and im sure he hasnt done anything to be ashamed of though he wont tell  snowball seemed to agree to this for he went and sat down by jacks slippers waiting for him on the hearth and jill thought that a very touching proof of affectionate fidelity to the little master who ruled them both  when he came it was evident that he had found it harder to refuse his mother than all the rest but she trusted him in spite of appearances and that was such a comfort for poor jacks heart was very full and he longed to tell the whole story but he would not break his promise and so kept silence bravely jill asked no questions affecting to be anxious for the games they always played together in the evening but while they played though the lips were sealed the bright eyes said as plainly as words i trust you and jack was very grateful  it was well he had something to cheer him up at home for he got little peace at school he bore the grave looks of mr acton meekly took the boys jokes goodnaturedly and withstood the artful teasing of the girls with patient silence but it was very hard for the social affectionate fellow to bear the general distrust for he had been such a favorite he felt the change keenly  but the thing that tried him most was the knowledge that his report would not be what it usually was it was always a happy moment when he showed it to his mother and saw her eye brighten as it fell on the 99 or 100 for she cared more for good behavior than for perfect lessons mr acton once said that frank minots moral influence in the school was unusual and jack never forgot her pride and delight as she told them what frank himself had not known till then it was jacks ambition to have the same said of him for he was not much of a scholar and he had tried hard since he went back to school to get good records in that respect at least now here was a dreadful downfall tardy marks bad company broken rules and something too wrong to tell apparently  well i deserve a good report and thats a comfort though nobody believes it he said to himself trying to keep up his spirits as the slow week went by and no word from him had cleared up the mystery     chapter xiv and jill finds it out   jill worried about it more than he did for she was a faithful little friend and it was a great trial to have jack even suspected of doing anything wrong school is a childs world while he is there and its small affairs are very important to him so jill felt that the one thing to be done was to clear away the cloud about her dear boy and restore him to public favor  ed will be here saturday night and may be he will find out for jack tells him everything i do hate to have him hectored so for i know he is though hes too proud to complain she said on thursday evening when frank told her some joke played upon his brother that day  i let him alone but i see that he isnt badgered too much thats all i can do if ed had only come home last saturday it might have done some good but now it will be too late for the reports are given out tomorrow you know answered frank feeling a little jealous of eds influence over jack though his own would have been as great if he had been as gentle  has jerry come back asked jill who kept all her questions for frank because she seldom alluded to the tender subject when with jack  no hes off for the summer got a place somewhere hope hell stay there and let bob alone  where is bob now i dont hear much about him lately said jill who was constantly on the lookout for the other fellow since it was not joe  oh he went to captain skinners the first of march chores round and goes to school up there captain is strict and wont let bob come to town except sundays but he dont mind it much for he likes horses has nice grub and the hill fellows are good chaps for him to be with so hes all right if he only behaves  how far is it to captain skinners asked jill suddenly having listened with her sharp eyes on frank as he tinkered away at his model since he was forbidden all other indulgence in his beloved pastime  its four miles to hill district but the captain lives this side of the schoolhouse about three from here i should say  how long would it take a boy to walk up there went on the questioner with a new idea in her head  depends on how much of a walkist he is  suppose he was lame and it was sloshy and he made a call and came back how long would that take asked jill impatiently  well in that case i should say two or three hours but its impossible to tell exactly unless you know how lame the fellow was and how long a call he made said frank who liked to be accurate  jack couldnt do it in less could he  he used to run up that hilly road for a breather and think nothing of it it would be a long job for him now poor little chap for his leg often troubles him though he hates to own it  jill lay back and laughed a happy little laugh as if she was pleased about something and frank looked over his shoulder to ask questions in his turn  what are you laughing at  cant tell  why do you want to know about hill district are you going there  wish i could id soon have it out of him  who  never mind please push up my table i must write a letter and i want you to post it for me tonight and never say a word till i give you leave  oh now you are going to have secrets and be mysterious and get into a mess are you and frank looked down at her with a suspicious air though he was intensely curious to know what she was about  go away till im done you will have to see the outside but you cant know the inside till the answer comes and propping herself up jill wrote the following note with some hesitation at the beginning and end for she did not know the gentleman she was addressing except by sight and it was rather awkward  robert walker  dear sir i want to ask if jack minot came to see you last friday afternoon he got into trouble being seen with jerry shannon he paid him some money jack wont tell and mr acton talked to him about it before all the school we feel bad because we think jack did not do wrong i dont know as you have anything to do with it but i thought id ask please answer quick respectfully yours  jane pecq  to make sure that her despatch was not tampered with jill put a great splash of red sealingwax on it which gave it a very official look and much impressed bob when he received it  there go and post it and dont let any one see or know about it she said handing it over to frank who left his work with unusual alacrity to do her errand when his eye fell on the address he laughed and said in a teasing way  are you and bob such good friends that you correspond what will jack say  dont know and dont care be good now and lets have a little secret as well as other folks ill tell you all about it when he answers said jill in her most coaxing tone  suppose he doesnt  then i shall send you up to see him i must know something and i want to do it myself if i can  look here what are you after i do believe you think frank got no farther for jill gave a little scream and stopped him by crying eagerly dont say it out loud i really do believe it may be and im going to find out  what made you think of him and frank looked thoughtfully at the letter as if turning carefully over in his mind the idea that jills quick wits had jumped at  come here and ill tell you  holding him by one button she whispered something in his ear that made him exclaim with a look at the rug  no did he i declare i shouldnt wonder it would be just like the dear old blunderhead  i never thought of it till you told me where bob was and then it all sort of burst upon me in one minute cried jill waving her arms about to express the intellectual explosion which had thrown light upon the mystery like skyrockets in a dark night  you are as bright as a button no time to lose im off and off he was splashing through the mud to post the letter on the back of which he added to make the thing sure hurry up fm  both felt rather guilty next day but enjoyed themselves very much nevertheless and kept chuckling over the mine they were making under jacks unconscious feet they hardly expected an answer at noon as the hill people were not very eager for their mail but at night jill was sure of a letter and to her great delight it came jack brought it himself which added to the fun and while she eagerly read it he sat calmly poring over the latest number of his own private and particular youths companion  bob was not a complete letterwriter by any means and with great labor and much ink had produced the following brief but highly satisfactory epistle not knowing how to address his fair correspondent he let it alone and went at once to the point in the frankest possible way  jack did come up friday sorry he got into a mess it was real kind of him and i shall pay him back soon jack paid jerry for me and i made him promise not to tell jerry said hed come here and make a row if i didnt cash up i was afraid id lose the place if he did for the capt is awful strict if jack dont tell now i will i aint mean glad you wrote  row  hurrah cried jill waving the letter over her head in great triumph call everybody and read it out she added as frank snatched it and ran for his mother seeing at a glance that the news was good jill was so afraid she should tell before the others came that she burst out singing pretty bobby shafto at the top of her voice to jacks great disgust for he considered the song very personal as he was rather fond of combing down his yellow hair and jill often plagued him by singing it when he came in with the golden quirls very smooth and nice to hide the scar on his forehead  in about five minutes the door flew open and in came mamma making straight for bewildered jack who thought the family had gone crazy when his parent caught him in her arms saying tenderly  my good generous boy i knew he was right all the time while frank worked his hand up and down like a pumphandle exclaiming heartily  youre a trump sir and im proud of you jill meantime calling out in wild delight  i told you so i told you so i did find out ha ha i did  come i say whats the matter im all right dont squeeze the breath out of me please expostulated jack looking so startled and innocent as he struggled feebly that they all laughed and this plaintive protest caused him to be released but the next proceeding did not enlighten him much for frank kept waving a very inky paper before him and ordering him to read it while mamma made a charge at jill as if it was absolutely necessary to hug somebody  hullo said jack when he got the letter into his own hand and read it now who put bob up to this nobody had any business to interferebut its mighty good of him anyway he added as the anxious lines in his round face smoothed themselves away while a smile of relief told how hard it had been for him to keep his word  i did cried jill clapping her hands and looking so happy that he could not have scolded her if he had wanted to  who told you he was in the scrape demanded jack in a hurry to know all about it now the seal was taken off his own lips  you did and jills face twinkled with naughty satisfaction for this was the best fun of all  i didnt when where its a joke  you did cried jill pointing to the rug you went to sleep there after the long walk and talked in your sleep about bob and all right old boy and ever so much gibberish i didnt think about it then but when i heard that bob was up there i thought may be he knew something about it and last night i wrote and asked him and thats the answer and now it is all right and you are the best boy that ever was and im so glad  here jill paused all out of breath and frank said with an approving pat on the head  it wont do to have such a sharp young person round if we are going to have secrets youd make a good detective miss  catch me taking naps before people again and jack looked rather crestfallen that his own words had set fine ear on the track never mind i didnt mean to tell though i just ached to do it all the time so i havent broken my word im glad you all know but you neednt let it get out for bob is a good fellow and it might make trouble for him added jack anxious lest his gain should be the others loss  i shall tell mr acton myself and the captain also for im not going to have my son suspected of wrongdoing when he has only tried to help a friend and borne enough for his sake said mamma much excited by this discovery of generous fidelity in her boy though when one came to look at it calmly one saw that it might have been done in a wiser way  now please dont make a fuss about it that would be most as bad as having every one down on me i can stand your praising me but i wont be patted on the head by anybody else and jack assumed a manly air though his face was full of genuine boyish pleasure at being set right in the eyes of those he loved  ill be discreet dear but you owe it to yourself as well as bob to have the truth known both have behaved well and no harm will come to him i am sure ill see to that myself said mrs minot in a tone that set jacks mind at rest on that point  now do tell all about it cried jill who was pining to know the whole story and felt as if she had earned the right to hear it  oh it wasnt much we promised ed to stand by bob so i did as well as i knew how and jack seemed to think that was about all there was to say  i never saw such a fellow for keeping a promise you stick to it through thick and thin no matter how silly or hard it is you remember mother last summer how you told him not to go in a boat and he promised the day we went on the picnic we rode up but the horse ran off home so we had to come back by way of the river all but jack and he walked every step of five miles because he wouldnt go near a boat though mr burton was there to take care of him i call that rather overdoing the matter and frank looked as if he thought moderation even in virtue a good thing  and i call it a fine sample of entire obedience he obeyed orders and that is what we all must do without always seeing why or daring to use our own judgment it is a great safeguard to jack and a very great comfort to me for i know that if he promises he will keep his word no matter what it costs him said mamma warmly as she tumbled up the quirls with an irrepressible caress remembering how the boy came wearily in after all the others without seeming for a moment to think that he could have done anything else  like casabianca cried jill much impressed for obedience was her hardest trial  i think he was a fool to burn up said frank bound not to give in  i dont its a splendid piece and every one likes to speak it and it was true and it wouldnt be in all the books if he was a fool grown people know what is good declared jill who liked heroic actions and was always hoping for a chance to distinguish herself in that way  you admire the charge of the light brigade and glow all over as you thunder it out yet they went gallantly to their death rather than disobey orders a mistake perhaps but it makes us thrill to hear of it and the same spirit keeps my jack true as steel when once his word is passed or he thinks it is his duty dont be laughed out of it my son for faithfulness in little things fits one for heroism when the great trials come ones conscience can hardly be too tender when honor and honesty are concerned  you are right mother and i am wrong i beg your pardon jack and you shant get ahead of me next time  frank made his mother a little bow gave his brother a shake of the hand and nodded to jill as if anxious to show that he was not too proud to own up when he made a mistake  please tell on jack this is very nice but i do want to know all about the other said jill after a short pause  let me see oh i saw bob at church and he looked rather blue so after sunday school i asked what the matter was he said jerry bothered him for some money he lent him at different times when they were loafing round together before we took him up he wouldnt get any wages for some time the captain keeps him short on purpose i guess and wont let him come down town except on sundays he didnt want any one to know about it for fear hed lose his place so i promised i wouldnt tell then i was afraid jerry would go and make a fuss and bob would run off or do something desperate being worried and i said id pay it for him if i could so he went home pretty jolly and i scratched round for the money got it too and wasnt i glad  jack paused to rub his hands and frank said with more than usual respect  couldnt you get hold of jerry in any other place and out of school time that did the mischief thanks to joe i thrashed him jilldid i mention it  i couldnt get all my money till friday morning and i knew jerry was off at night i looked for him before school and at noon but couldnt find him so afternoon recess was my last chance i was bound to do it and i didnt mean to break the rule but jerry was just going into the shop so i pelted after him and as it was private business we went to the billiardroom i declare i never was so relieved as when i handed over that money and made him say it was all right and he wouldnt go near bob hes off so my mind is easy and bob will be so grateful i can keep him steady perhaps that will be worth two seventyfive i think said jack heartily  you should have come to me began frank  and got laughed atno thank you interrupted jack recollecting several philanthropic little enterprises which were nipped in the bud for want of cooperation  to me then said his mother it would have saved so much trouble  i thought of it but bob didnt want the big fellows to know for fear theyd be down on him so i thought he might not like me to tell grown people i dont mind the fuss now and bob is as kind as he can be wanted to give me his big knife but i wouldnt take it id rather have this and jack put the letter in his pocket with a slap outside as if it warmed the cockles of his heart to have it there  well it seems rather like a tempest in a teapot now it is all over but i do admire your pluck little boy in holding out so well when every one was scolding at you and you in the right all the time said frank glad to praise now that he honestly could after his wholesale condemnation  that is what pulled me through i suppose i used to think if i had done anything wrong that i couldnt stand the snubbing a day i should have told right off and had it over now i guess ill have a good report if you do tell mr acton said jack looking at his mother so wistfully that she resolved to slip away that very evening and make sure that the thing was done  that will make you happier than anything else wont it asked jill eager to have him rewarded after his trials  theres one thing i like better though id be very sorry to lose my report its the fun of telling ed i tried to do as he wanted us to and seeing how pleased hell be added jack rather bashfully for the boys laughed at him sometimes for his love of this friend  i know he wont be any happier about it than someone else who stood by you all through and set her bright wits to work till the trouble was all cleared away said mrs minot looking at jills contented face as she lay smiling on them all  jack understood and hopping across the room gave both the thin hands a hearty shake then not finding any words quite cordial enough in which to thank this faithful little sister he stooped down and kissed her gratefully     chapter xv saint lucy   saturday was a busy and a happy time to jack for in the morning mr acton came to see him having heard the story overnight and promised to keep bobs secret while giving jack an acquittal as public as the reprimand had been then he asked for the report which jack had bravely received the day before and put away without showing to anybody  there is one mistake here which we must rectify said mr acton as he crossed out the low figures under the word behavior and put the muchdesired 100 there  but i did break the rule sir said jack though his face glowed with pleasure for mamma was looking on  i overlook that as i should your breaking into my house if you saw it was on fire you ran to save a friend and i wish i could tell those fellows why you were there it would do them good i am not going to praise you john but i did believe you in spite of appearances and i am glad to have for a pupil a boy who loves his neighbor better than himself  then having shaken hands heartily mr acton went away and jack flew off to have rejoicings with jill who sat up on her sofa without knowing it so eager was she to hear all about the call  in the afternoon jack drove his mother to the captains confiding to her on the way what a hard time he had when he went before and how nothing but the thought of cheering bob kept him up when he slipped and hurt his knee and his boot sprung a leak and the wind came up very cold and the hill seemed an endless mountain of mud and snow  mrs minot had such a gentle way of putting things that she would have won over a much harder man than the strict old captain who heard the story with interest and was much pleased with the boys efforts to keep bob straight that young person dodged away into the barn with jack and only appeared at the last minute to shove a bag of chestnuts into the chaise but he got a few kind words that did him good from mrs minot and the captain and from that day felt himself under bonds to behave well if he would keep their confidence  i shall give jill the nuts and i wish i had something she wanted very very much for i do think she ought to be rewarded for getting me out of the mess said jack as they drove happily home again  i hope to have something in a day or two that will delight her very much i will say no more now but keep my little secret and let it be a surprise to all by and by answered his mother looking as if she had not much doubt about the matter  that will be jolly you are welcome to your secret mamma ive had enough of them for one while and jack shrugged his broad shoulders as if a burden had been taken off  in the evening ed came and jack was quite satisfied when he saw how pleased his friend was at what he had done  i never meant you should take so much trouble only be kind to bob said ed who did not know how strong his influence was nor what a sweet example of quiet welldoing his own life was to all his mates  i wished to be really useful not just to talk about it and do nothing that isnt your way and i want to be like you answered jack with such affectionate sincerity that ed could not help believing him though he modestly declined the compliment by saying as he began to play softly better than i am i hope i dont amount to much  yes you do and if any one says you dont ill shake him i cant tell what it is only you always look so happy and contentedsort of sweet and shiny said jack as he stroked the smooth brown head rather at a loss to describe the unusually fresh and sunny expression of eds face which was always cheerful yet had a certain thoughtfulness that made it very attractive to both young and old  soap makes him shiny i never saw such a fellow to wash and brush put in frank as he came up with one of the pieces of music he and ed were fond of practising together  i dont mean that said jack indignantly i wash and brush till you call me a dandy but i dont have the same lookit seems to come from the inside somehow as if he was always jolly and clean and good in his mind you know  born so said frank rumbling away in the bass with a pair of hands that would have been the better for some of the abovementioned soap for he did not love to do much in the washing and brushing line  i suppose thats it well i like it and i shall keep on trying for being loved by every one is about the nicest thing in the world isnt it ed asked jack with a gentle tweak of the ear as he put a question which he knew would get no answer for ed was so modest he could not see wherein he differed from other boys nor believe that the sunshine he saw in other faces was only the reflection from his own  sunday evening mrs minot sat by the fire planning how she should tell some good news she had been saving up all day mrs pecq knew it and seemed so delighted that she went about smiling as if she did not know what trouble meant and could not do enough for the family she was downstairs now seeing that the clothes were properly prepared for the wash so there was no one in the bird room but mamma and the children frank was reading up all he could find about some biblical hero mentioned in the days sermon jill lay where she had lain for nearly four long months and though her face was pale and thin with the confinement there was an expression on it now sweeter even than health jack sat on the rug beside her looking at a white carnation through the magnifying glass while she was enjoying the perfume of a red one as she talked to him  if you look at the white petals youll see that they sparkle like marble and go winding a long way down to the middle of the flower where it grows sort of rosy and in among the small curly leaves like fringed curtains you can see the little green fairy sitting all alone your mother showed me that and i think it is very pretty i call it a fairy but it is really where the seeds are hidden and the sweet smell comes from  jill spoke softly lest she should disturb the others and as she turned to push up her pillow she saw mrs minot looking at her with a smile she did not understand  did you speak m she asked smiling back again without in the least knowing why  no dear i was listening and thinking what a pretty little story one could make out of your fairy living alone down there and only known by her perfume  tell it mamma it is time for our story and that would be a nice one i guess said jack who was as fond of stories as when he sat in his mothers lap and chuckled over the hero of the beanstalk  we dont have fairy tales on sunday you know began jill regretfully  call it a parable and have a moral to it then it will be all right put in frank as he shut his big book having found what he wanted  i like stories about saints and the good and wonderful things they did said jill who enjoyed the wise and interesting bits mrs minot often found for her in grownup books for jill had thoughtful times and asked questions which showed that she was growing fast in mind if not in body  this is a true story but i will disguise it a little and call it the miracle of saint lucy began mrs minot seeing a way to tell her good news and amuse the children likewise  frank retired to the easychair that he might sleep if the tale should prove too childish for him jill settled herself among her cushions and jack lay flat upon the rug with his feet up so that he could admire his red slippers and rest his knee which ached  once upon a time there was a queen who had two princes  wasnt there a princess asked jack interested at once  no and it was a great sorrow to the queen that she had no little daughter for the sons were growing up and she was often very lonely  like snowdrops mother whispered jill  now dont keep interrupting children or we never shall get on said frank more anxious to hear about the boys that were than the girl that was not  one day when the princes were outahem well say huntingthey found a little damsel lying on the snow half dead with cold they thought she was the child of a poor woman who lived in the foresta wild little thing always dancing and singing about as hard to catch as a squirrel and so fearless she would climb the highest trees leap broad brooks or jump off the steep rocks to show her courage the boys carried her home to the palace and the queen was glad to have her she had fallen and hurt herself so she lay in bed week after week with her mother to take care of her  thats you whispered jack throwing the white carnation at jill and she threw back the red one with her finger on her lips for the tale was very interesting now  she did not suffer much after a time but she scolded and cried and could not be resigned because she was a prisoner the queen tried to help her but she could not do much the princes were kind but they had their books and plays and were away a good deal some friends she had came often to see her but still she beat her wings against the bars like a wild bird in a cage and soon her spirits were all gone and it was sad to see her  where was your saint lucy i thought it was about her asked jack who did not like to have jills past troubles dwelt upon since his were not  she is coming saints are not bornthey are made after many trials and tribulations answered his mother looking at the fire as if it helped her to spin her little story well the poor child used to sing sometimes to while away the long hourssad songs mostly and one among them which the queen taught her was sweet patience come  this she used to sing a great deal after a while never dreaming that patience was an angel who could hear and obey but it was so and one night when the girl had lulled herself to sleep with that song the angel came nobody saw the lovely spirit with tender eyes and a voice that was like balm no one heard the rustle of wings as she hovered over the little bed and touched the lips the eyes the hands of the sleeper and then flew away leaving three gifts behind the girl did not know why but after that night the songs grew gayer there seemed to be more sunshine everywhere her eyes looked and her hands were never tired of helping others in various pretty useful or pleasant ways slowly the wild bird ceased to beat against the bars but sat in its cage and made music for all in the palace till the queen could not do without it the poor mother cheered up and the princes called the girl their nightingale  was that the miracle asked jack forgetting all about his slippers as he watched jills eyes brighten and the color come up in her white cheeks  that was the miracle and patience can work far greater ones if you will let her  and the girls name was lucy  yes they did not call her a saint then but she was trying to be as cheerful as a certain good woman she had heard of and so the queen had that name for her though she did not let her know it for a long time  thats not bad for a sunday story but there might have been more about the princes seems to me was franks criticism as jill lay very still trying to hide her face behind the carnation for she had no words to tell how touched and pleased she was to find that her little efforts to be good had been seen remembered and now rewarded in this way  there is more  then the story isnt done cried jack  oh dear no the most interesting things are to come if you can wait for them  yes i see this is the moral part now keep still and let us have the rest commanded frank while the others composed themselves for the sequel suspecting that it was rather nice because mammas sober face changed and her eyes laughed as they looked at the fire  the elder prince was very fond of driving dragons for the people of that country used these fiery monsters as horses  and got run away with didnt he laughed jack adding with great interest what did the other fellow do  he went about fighting other peoples battles helping the poor and trying to do good but he lacked judgment so he often got into trouble and was in such a hurry that he did not always stop to find out the wisest way as when he gave away his best coat to a beggar boy instead of the old one which he intended to give  i say that isnt fair mother neither of them was new and the boy needed the best more than i did and i wore the old one all winter didnt i asked jack who had rather exulted over frank and was now taken down himself  yes you did my dear and it was not an easy thing for my dandiprat to do now listen and ill tell you how they both learned to be wiser the elder prince soon found that the big dragons were too much for him and set about training his own little one who now and then ran away with him its name was will a good servant but a bad master so he learned to control it and in time this gave him great power over himself and fitted him to be a king over others  thank you mother ill remember my part of the moral now give jack his said frank who liked the dragon episode as he had been wrestling with his own of late and found it hard to manage  he had a fine example before him in a friend and he followed it more reasonably till he grew able to use wisely one of the best and noblest gifts of godbenevolence  now tell about the girl was there more to that part of the story asked jack well pleased with his moral as it took ed in likewise  that is the best of all but it seems as if i never should get to it after patience made lucy sweet and cheerful she began to have a curious power over those about her and to work little miracles herself though she did not know it the queen learned to love her so dearly she could not let her go she cheered up all her friends when they came with their small troubles the princes found bright eyes willing hands and a kind heart always at their service and felt without quite knowing why that it was good for them to have a gentle little creature to care for so they softened their rough manners loud voices and careless ways for her sake and when it was proposed to take her away to her own home they could not give her up but said she must stay longer didnt they  id like to see them saying anything else said frank while jack sat up to demand fiercely  who talks about taking jill away  lucys mother thought she ought to go and said so but the queen told her how much good it did them all to have her there and begged the dear woman to let her little cottage and come and be housekeeper in the palace for the queen was getting lazy and liked to sit and read and talk and sew with lucy better than to look after things  and she said she would cried jill clasping her hands in her anxiety for she had learned to love her cage now  yes mrs minot had no time to say more for one of the red slippers flew up in the air and jack had to clap both hands over his mouth to suppress the hurrah that nearly escaped frank said thats good and nodded with his most cordial smile at jill who pulled herself up with cheeks now as rosy as the red carnation and a little catch in her breath as she said to herself  its too lovely to be true  thats a firstrate end to a very good story began jack with grave decision as he put on his slipper and sat up to pat jills hand wishing it was not quite so like a little claw  thats not the end and mammas eyes laughed more than ever as three astonished faces turned to her and three voices cried out  still more  the very best of all you must know that while lucy was busy for others she was not forgotten and when she was expecting to lie on her bed through the summer plans were being made for all sorts of pleasant changes first of all she was to have a nice little brace to support the back which was growing better every day then as the warm weather came on she was to go out or lie on the piazza and by and by when school was done she was to go with the queen and the princes for a month or two down to the seaside where fresh air and salt water were to build her up in the most delightful way there now isnt that the best ending of all and mamma paused to read her answer in the bright faces of two of the listeners for jill hid hers in the pillow and lay quite still as if it was too much for her  that will be regularly splendid ill row you all aboutboating is so much easier than riding and i like it on salt water said frank going to sit on the arm of the sofa quite excited by the charms of the new plan  and ill teach you to swim and roll you over the beach and get seaweed and shells and no end of nice things and well all come home as strong as lions added jack scrambling up as if about to set off at once  the doctor says you have been doing finely of late and the brace will come tomorrow and the first really mild day you are to have a breath of fresh air wont that be good asked mrs minot hoping her story had not been too interesting  is she crying said jack much concerned as he patted the pillow in his most soothing way while frank lifted one curl after another to see what was hidden underneath  not tears for two eyes sparkled behind the fingers then the hands came down like clouds from before the sun and jills face shone out so bright and happy it did ones heart good to see it  im not crying she said with a laugh which was fuller of blithe music than any song she sung but it was so splendid it sort of took my breath away for a minute i thought i wasnt any better and never should be and i made up my mind i wouldnt ask it would be so hard for any one to tell me so now i see why the doctor made me stand up and told me to get my baskets ready to go amaying i thought he was in fun did he really mean i could go asked jill expecting too much for a word of encouragement made her as hopeful as she had been despondent before  no dear not so soon as that it will be months probably before you can walk and run as you used to but they will soon pass you neednt mind about mayday it is always too cold for flowers and you will find more here among your own plants than on the hills to fill your baskets answered mrs minot hastening to suggest something pleasant to beguile the time of probation  i can wait months are not years and if im truly getting well everything will seem beautiful and easy to me said jill laying herself down again with the patient look she had learned to wear and gathering up the scattered carnations to enjoy their spicy breath as if the fairies hidden there had taught her some of their sweet secrets  dear little girl it has been a long hard trial for you but it is coming to an end and i think you will find that it has not been time wasted i dont want you to be a saint quite yet but i am sure a gentler jill will rise up from that sofa than the one who lay down there in december  how could i help growing better when you were so good to me cried jill putting up both arms as mrs minot went to take franks place and he retired to the fire there to stand surveying the scene with calm approval  you have done quite as much for us so we are even i proved that to your mother and she is going to let the little house and take care of the big one for me while i borrow you to keep me happy and make the boys gentle and kind that is the bargain and we get the best of it said mrs minot looking well pleased while jack added thats so and frank observed with an air of conviction we couldnt get on without jill possibly  can i do all that i didnt know i was of any use i only tried to be good and grateful for there didnt seem to be anything else i could do said jill wondering why they were all so fond of her  no real trying is ever in vain it is like the spring rain and flowers are sure to follow in good time the three gifts patience gave saint lucy were courage cheerfulness and love and with these one can work the sweetest miracles in the world as you see and mrs minot pointed to the pretty room and its happy inmates  am i really the least bit like that good lucinda i tried to be but i didnt think i was asked jill softly  you are very like her in all ways but one she did not get well and you will  a short answer but it satisfied jill to her hearts core and that night when she lay in bed she thought to herself how curious it is that ive been a sort of missionary without knowing it they all love and thank me and wont let me go so i suppose i must have done something but i dont know what except trying to be good and pleasant  that was the secret and jill found it out just when it was most grateful as a reward for past efforts most helpful as an encouragement toward the constant welldoing which can make even a little girl a joy and comfort to all who know and love her     chapter xvi up at merrys   now fly round child and get your sweeping done up smart and early  yes mother  i shall want you to help me about the baking by and by  yes mother  roxy is cleaning the cellarclosets so youll have to get the vegetables ready for dinner father wants a boiled dish and i shall be so busy i cant see to it  yes mother  a cheerful voice gave the three answers but it cost merry an effort to keep it so for she had certain little plans of her own which made the work before her unusually distasteful saturday always was a trying day for though she liked to see rooms in order she hated to sweep as no speck escaped mrs grants eye and only the good oldfashioned broom wielded by a pair of strong arms was allowed baking was another trial she loved good bread and delicate pastry but did not enjoy burning her face over a hot stove daubing her hands with dough or spending hours rolling out cookies for the boys while a boiled dinner was her especial horror as it was not elegant and the washing of vegetables was a job she always shirked when she could  however having made up her mind to do her work without complaint she ran upstairs to put on her dustcap trying to look as if sweeping was the joy of her life  it is such a lovely day i did want to rake my garden and have a walk with molly and finish my book so i can get another she said with a sigh as she leaned out of the open window for a breath of the unusually mild air  down in the tenacre lot the boys were carting and spreading loam out in the barn her father was getting his plows ready over the hill rose the smoke of the distant factory and the river that turned the wheels was gliding through the meadows where soon the blackbirds would be singing old bess pawed the ground eager to be off the gray hens were scratching busily all about the yard even the green things in the garden were pushing through the brown earth softened by april rains and there was a shimmer of sunshine over the wide landscape that made every familiar object beautiful with hints of spring and the activity it brings  something made the old nursery hymn come into merrys head and humming to herself    in works of labor or of skill   i would be busy too  she tied on her cap shouldered her broom and fell to work so energetically that she soon swept her way through the chambers down the front stairs to the parlor door leaving freshness and order behind her as she went  she always groaned when she entered that apartment and got out of it again as soon as possible for it was like most country parlors a prim and chilly place with little beauty and no comfort black horsehair furniture very slippery and hard stood against the wall the table had its gift books albums worsted mat and ugly lamp the mantelpiece its china vases pink shells and clock that never went the gay carpet was kept distressingly bright by closed shutters six days out of the seven and a general air of gotomeeting solemnity pervaded the room merry longed to make it pretty and pleasant but her mother would allow of no change there so the girl gave up her dreams of rugs and hangings fine pictures and tasteful ornaments and dutifully aired dusted and shut up this awful apartment once a week privately resolving that if she ever had a parlor of her own it should not be as dismal as a tomb  the diningroom was a very different place for here merry had been allowed to do as she liked yet so gradual had been the change that she would have found it difficult to tell how it came about it seemed to begin with the flowers for her father kept his word about the posy pots and got enough to make quite a little conservatory in the baywindow which was sufficiently large for three rows all round and hangingbaskets overhead being discouraged by her first failure merry gave up trying to have things nice everywhere and contented herself with making that one nook so pretty that the boys called it her bower even busy mrs grant owned that plants were not so messy as she expected and the farmer was never tired of watching little daughter as she sat at work there with her low chair and table full of books  the lamp helped also for merry set up her own and kept it so well trimmed that it burned clear and bright shining on the green arch of ivy overhead and on the nasturtium vines framing the old glass and peeping at their gay little faces and at the pretty young girl so pleasantly that first her father came to read his paper by it then her mother slipped in to rest on the lounge in the corner and finally the boys hovered about the door as if the settinroom had grown more attractive than the kitchen  but the open fire did more than anything else to win and hold them all as it seldom fails to do when the black demon of an airtight stove is banished from the hearth after the room was cleaned till it shone merry begged to have the brass andirons put in and offered to keep them as bright as gold if her mother would consent so the great logs were kindled and the flames went dancing up the chimney as if glad to be set free from their prison it changed the whole room like magic and no one could resist the desire to enjoy its cheery comfort the farmers threecornered leathern chair soon stood on one side and mothers rocker on the other as they toasted their feet and dozed or chatted in the pleasant warmth  the boys slippers were always ready on the hearth and when the big boots were once off they naturally settled down about the table where the tall lamp with its pretty shade of pressed autumn leaves burned brightly and the books and papers lay ready to their hands instead of being tucked out of sight in the closet they were beginning to see that merrys notions had some sense in them since they were made comfortable and goodnaturedly took some pains to please her in various ways tom brushed his hair and washed his hands nicely before he came to table dick tried to lower his boisterous laughter and harry never smoked in the sittingroom even roxy expressed her pleasure in seeing things kind of spruced up and merrys gentle treatment of the hardworking drudge won her heart entirely  the girl was thinking of these changes as she watered her flowers dusted the furniture and laid the fire ready for kindling and when all was done she stood a minute to enjoy the pleasant room full of spring sunshine fresh air and exquisite order it seemed to give her heart for more distasteful labors and she fell to work at the pies as cheerfully as if she liked it  mrs grant was flying about the kitchen getting the loaves of brown and white bread ready for the big oven roxys voice came up from the cellar singing bounding billows with a swashing and scrubbing accompaniment which suggested that she was actually enjoying a life on the ocean wave merry in her neat cap and apron stood smiling over her work as she deftly rolled and clipped filled and covered finding a certain sort of pleasure in doing it well and adding interest to it by crimping the crust making pretty devices with strips of paste and starshaped prickings of the fork  goodwill giveth skill says the proverb and even particular mrs grant was satisfied when she paused to examine the pastry with her experienced eye  you are a handy child and a credit to your bringing up though i do say it those are as pretty pies as id wish to eat if they bake well and theres no reason why they shouldnt  may i make some tarts or rabbits of these bits the boys like them and i enjoy modelling this sort of thing said merry who was trying to mould a bird as she had seen ralph do with clay to amuse jill while the bust was going on  no dear theres no time for knickknacks today the beets ought to be on this minute run and get em and be sure you scrape the carrots well  poor merry put away the delicate task she was just beginning to like and taking a pan went down cellar wishing vegetables could be grown without earth for she hated to put her hands in dirty water a word of praise to roxy made that grateful scrubber leave her work to poke about in the rootcellar choosing sech as was pretty much of a muchness else they wouldnt bile even so merry was spared that part of the job and went up to scrape and wash without complaint since it was for father she was repaid at noon by the relish with which he enjoyed his dinner for merry tried to make even a boiled dish pretty by arranging the beets carrots turnips and potatoes in contrasting colors with the beef hidden under the cabbage leaves  now ill rest and read for an hour then ill rake my garden or run down town to see molly and get some seeds she thought to herself as she put away the spoons and glasses which she liked to wash that they might always be clear and bright  if youve done all your own mending theres a heap of socks to be looked over then ill show you about darning the tablecloths i do hate to have a stitch of work left over till monday said mrs grant who never took naps and prided herself on sitting down to her needle at 3 pm every day  yes mother and merry went slowly upstairs feeling that a part of saturday ought to be a holiday after books and work all the week as she braided up her hair her eye fell upon the reflection of her own face in the glass not a happy nor a pretty one just then and merry was so unaccustomed to seeing any other that involuntarily the frown smoothed itself out the eyes lost their weary look the drooping lips curved into a smile and leaning her elbows on the bureau she shook her head at herself saying half aloud as she glanced at ivanhoe lying near  you neednt look so cross and ugly just because you cant have what you want sweeping baking and darning are not so bad as being plagued with lovers and carried off and burnt at the stake so i wont envy poor rebecca her jewels and curls and romantic times but make the best of my own  then she laughed and the bright face came back into the mirror looking like an old friend and merry went on dressing with care for she took pleasure in her own little charms and felt a sense of comfort in knowing that she could always have one pretty thing to look at if she kept her own face serene and sweet it certainly looked so as it bent over the pile of big socks half an hour later and brightened with each that was laid aside her mother saw it and guessing why such wistful glances went from clock to window kindly shortened the task of tablecloth darning by doing a good bit herself before putting it into merrys hands  she was a good and loving mother in spite of her strict ways and knew that it was better for her romantic daughter to be learning all the housewifery lessons she could teach her than to be reading novels writing verses or philandering about with her head full of girlish fancies quite innocent in themselves but not the stuff to live on so she wisely taught the hands that preferred to pick flowers trim up rooms and mould birds to work well with needle broom and rollingpin put a receiptbook before the eyes that loved to laugh and weep over tender tales and kept the young head and heart safe and happy with wholesome duties useful studies and such harmless pleasures as girls should love instead of letting them waste their freshness in vague longings idle dreams and frivolous pastimes  but it was often hard to thwart the docile child and lately she had seemed to be growing up so fast that her mother began to feel a new sort of tenderness for this sweet daughter who was almost ready to take upon herself the cares as well as triumphs and delights of maidenhood something in the droop of the brown head and the quick motion of the busy hand with a little burn on it made it difficult for mrs grant to keep merry at work that day and her eye watched the clock almost as impatiently as the girls for she liked to see the young face brighten when the hour of release came  what next asked merry as the last stitch was set and she stifled a sigh on hearing the clock strike four for the sun was getting low and the lovely afternoon going fast  one more job if you are not too tired for it i want the receipt for diet drink miss dawes promised me would you like to run down and get it for me dear  yes mother and that answer was as blithe as a robins chirp for that was just where merry wanted to go  away went thimble and scissors and in five minutes away went merry skipping down the hill without a care in the world for a happy heart sat singing within and everything seemed full of beauty  she had a capital time with molly called on jill did her shopping in the village and had just turned to walk up the hill when ralph evans came tramping along behind her looking so pleased and proud about something that she could not help asking what it was for they were great friends and merry thought that to be an artist was the most glorious career a man could choose  i know youve got some good news she said looking up at him as he touched his hat and fell into step with her seeming more contented than before  i have and was just coming up to tell you for i was sure you would be glad it is only a hope a chance but it is so splendid i feel as if i must shout and dance or fly over a fence or two to let off steam  do tell me quick have you got an order asked merry full of interest at once for artistic vicissitudes were very romantic and she liked to hear about them  i may go abroad in the autumn  oh how lovely  isnt it david german is going to spend a year in rome to finish a statue and wants me to go along grandma is willing as cousin maria wants her for a long visit so everything looks promising and i really think i may go  wont it cost a great deal asked merry who in spite of her little elegancies had a good deal of her thrifty mothers common sense  yes and ive got to earn it but i cani know i can for ive saved some and i shall work like ten beavers all summer i wont borrow if i can help it but i know someone who would lend me five hundred if i wanted it and ralph looked as eager and secure as if the earning of twice that sum was a mere trifle when all the longing of his life was put into his daily tasks  i wish i had it to give you it must be so splendid to feel that you can do great things if you only have the chance and to travel and see all the lovely pictures and statues and people and places in italy how happy you must be and merrys eyes had the wistful look they always wore when she dreamed dreams of the world she loved to live in  i amso happy that im afraid it never will happen if i do go ill write and tell you all about the fine sights and how i get on would you like me to asked ralph beginning enthusiastically and ending rather bashfully for he admired merry very much and was not quite sure how this proposal would be received  indeed i should id feel so grand to have letters from paris and rome and youd have so much to tell it would be almost as good as going myself she said looking off into the daffodil sky as they paused a minute on the hilltop to get breath for both had walked as fast as they talked  and will you answer the letters asked ralph watching the innocent face which looked unusually kind and beautiful to him in that soft light  why yes id love to only i shall not have anything interesting to say what can i write about and merry smiled as she thought how dull her letters would sound after the exciting details his would doubtless give  write about yourself and all the rest of the people i know grandma will be gone and i shall want to hear how you get on ralph looked very anxious indeed to hear and merry promised she would tell all about the other people adding as she turned from the evening peace and loveliness to the house whence came the clatter of milkpans and the smell of cooking  i never should have anything very nice to tell about myself for i dont do interesting things as you do and you wouldnt care to hear about school and sewing and messing round at home  merry gave a disdainful little sniff at the savory perfume of ham which saluted them and paused with her hand on the gate as if she found it pleasanter out there than in the house ralph seemed to agree with her for leaning on the gate he lingered to say with real sympathy in his tone and something else in his face yes i should so you write and tell me all about it i didnt know you had any worries for you always seemed like one of the happiest people in the world with so many to pet and care for you and plenty of money and nothing very hard or hateful to do youd think you were well off if you knew as much about poverty and work and never getting what you want as i do  you bear your worries so well that nobody knows you have them i ought not to complain and i wont for i do have all i need im so glad you are going to get what you want at last and merry held out her hand to say goodnight with so much pleasure in her face that ralph could not make up his mind to go just yet  i shall have to scratch round in a lively way before i do get it for david says a fellow cant live on less than four or five hundred a year even living as poor artists have to in garrets and on crusts i dont mind as long as grandma is all right she is away tonight or i should not be here he added as if some excuse was necessary merry needed no hint for her tender heart was touched by the vision of her friend in a garret and she suddenly rejoiced that there was ham and eggs for supper so that he might be well fed once at least before he went away to feed on artistic crusts  being here come in and spend the evening the boys will like to hear the news and so will father do now  it was impossible to refuse the invitation he had been longing for and in they went to the great delight of roxy who instantly retired to the pantry smiling significantly and brought out the most elaborate pie in honor of the occasion merry touched up the table and put a little vase of flowers in the middle to redeem the vulgarity of doughnuts of course the boys upset it but as there was company nothing was said and ralph devoured his supper with the appetite of a hungry boy while watching merry eat bread and cream out of an oldfashioned silver porringer and thinking it the sweetest sight he ever beheld  then the young people gathered about the table full of the new plans and the elders listened as they rested after the weeks work a pleasant evening for they all liked ralph but as the parents watched merry sitting among the great lads like a little queen among her subjects half unconscious as yet of the power in her hands they nodded to one another and then shook their heads as if they said  im afraid the time is coming mother  no danger as long as she dont know it father  at nine the boys went off to the barn the farmer to wind up the eightday clock and the housewife to see how the baked beans and indian pudding for tomorrow were getting on in the oven ralph took up his hat to go saying as he looked at the shade on the tall student lamp  what a good light that gives i can see it as i go home every night and it burns up here like a beacon i always look for it and it hardly ever fails to be burning sort of cheers up the way you know when im tired or low in my mind  then im very glad i got it i liked the shape but the boys laughed at it as they did at my bulrushes in a gingerjar over there id been reading about household art and i thought id try a little answered merry laughing at her own whims  youve got a better sort of household art i think for you make people happy and places pretty without fussing over it this room is ever so much improved every time i come though i hardly see what it is except the flowers said ralph looking from the girl to the tall calla that bent its white cup above her as if to pour its dew upon her head  isnt that lovely i tried to draw itthe shape was so graceful i wanted to keep it but i couldnt isnt it a pity such beautiful things wont last forever and merry looked regretfully at the halffaded one that grew beside the fresh blossom  i can keep it for you it would look well in plaster may i asked ralph  thank you i should like that very much take the real one as a modelplease do there are more coming and this will brighten up your room for a day or two  as she spoke merry cut the stem and adding two or three of the great green leaves put the handsome flower in his hand with so much goodwill that he felt as if he had received a very precious gift then he said goodnight so gratefully that merrys hand quite tingled with the grasp of his and went away often looking backward through the darkness to where the light burned brightly on the hilltopthe beacon kindled by an unconscious hero for a young leander swimming gallantly against wind and tide toward the goal of his ambition     chapter xvii down at mollys   now my dears ive something very curious to tell you so listen quietly and then ill give you your dinners said molly addressing the nine cats who came trooping after her as she went into the shedchamber with a bowl of milk and a plate of scraps in her hands she had taught them to behave well at meals so though their eyes glared and their tails quivered with impatience they obeyed and when she put the food on a high shelf and retired to the big basket the four old cats sat demurely down before her while the five kits scrambled after her and tumbled into her lap as if hoping to hasten the desired feast by their innocent gambols  granny tobias mortification and molasses were the elders granny a gray old puss was the mother and grandmother of all the rest tobias was her eldest son and mortification his brother so named because he had lost his tail which affliction depressed his spirits and cast a blight over his young life molasses was a yellow cat the mamma of four of the kits the fifth being grannys latest darling toddlekins the little aunt was the image of her mother and very sedate even at that early age miss muffet so called from her dread of spiders was a timid black and white kit beauty a pretty maltese with a serene little face and pink nose ragbag a funny thing every color that a cat could be and scamp who well deserved his name for he was the plague of miss bats life and mollys especial pet  he was now perched on her shoulder and as she talked kept peeping into her face or biting her ear in the most impertinent way while the others sprawled in her lap or promenaded round the basket rim  my friends something very remarkable has happened miss bat is cleaning house and having made this announcement molly leaned back to see how the cats received it for she insisted that they understood all she said to them  tobias stared mortification lay down as if it was too much for him molasses beat her tail on the floor as if whipping a dusty carpet and granny began to purr approvingly the giddy kits paid no attention as they did not know what housecleaning meant happy little dears  i thought youd like it granny for you are a decent cat and know what is proper continued molly leaning down to stroke the old puss who blinked affectionately at her i cant imagine what put it into miss bats head i never said a word and gave up groaning over the clutter as i couldnt mend it i just took care of boo and myself and left her to be as untidy as she pleased and she is a regular old  here scamp put his paw on her lips because he saw them moving but it seemed as if it was to check the disrespectful word just coming out  well i wont call names but what shall i do when i see everything in confusion and she wont let me clear up asked molly looking round at scamp who promptly put the little paw on her eyelid as if the roll of the blue ball underneath amused him  shut my eyes to it you mean i do all i can but it is hard when i wish to be nice and do try dont i asked molly but scamp was ready for her and began to comb her hair with both paws as he stood on his hind legs to work so busily that molly laughed and pulled him down saying as she cuddled the sly kit  you sharp little thing i know my hair is not neat now for ive been chasing boo round the garden to wash him for school then miss bat threw the parlor carpet out of the window and i was so surprised i had to run and tell you now what had we better do about it  the cats all winked at her but no one had any advice to offer except tobias who walked to the shelf and looking up uttered a deep suggestive yowl which said as plainly as words dinner first and discussion afterward  very well dont scramble said molly getting up to feed her pets first the kits who rushed at the bowl and thrust their heads in lapping as if for a wager then the cats who each went to one of the four piles of scraps laid round at intervals and placidly ate their meat while molly retired to the basket to ponder over the phenomena taking place in the house  she could not imagine what had started the old lady it was not the example of her neighbors who had beaten carpets and scrubbed paint every spring for years without exciting her to any greater exertion than cleaning a few windows and having a man to clear away the rubbish displayed when the snow melted molly never guessed that her own efforts were at the bottom of the change or knew that a few words not meant for her ear had shamed miss bat into action coming home from prayermeeting one dark night she trotted along behind two old ladies who were gossiping in loud voices as one was rather deaf and miss bat was both pleased and troubled to hear herself unduly praised  i always said sister dawes meant well but shes getting into years and the care of two children is a good deal for her with her cooking and her rheumatiz i dont deny she did neglect em for a spell but she does well by em now and i wouldnt wish to see betterappearing children  youve no idee how improved molly is she came in to see my girls and brought her sewingwork shirts for the boy and done it as neat and capable as youd wish to see she always was a smart child but dreadful careless said the other old lady evidently much impressed by the change in harumscarum molly loo  being over to mis minots so much has been good for her and up to mis grants girls catch neat ways as quick as they do untidy ones and them wild little tykes often turn out smart women  sister dawes has done well by them children and i hope mr bemis sees it he ought to give her something comfortable to live on when she cant do for him any longer he can well afford it  i havent a doubt he will hes a lavish man when he starts to do a thing but dreadful unobserving else hed have seen to matters long ago them children was towntalk last fall and i used to feel as if it was my bounden duty to speak to miss dawes but i never did fearing i might speak too plain and hurt her feelings  youve spoken plain enough now and im beholden to you though youll never know it said miss bat to herself as she slipped into her own gate while the gossips trudged on quite unconscious of the listener behind them  miss bat was a worthy old soul in the main only like so many of us she needed rousing up to her duty she had got the rousing now and it did her good for she could not bear to be praised when she had not deserved it she had watched mollys efforts with lazy interest and when the girl gave up meddling with her affairs as she called the housekeeping miss bat ceased to oppose her and let her scrub boo mend clothes and brush her hair as much as she liked so molly had worked along without any help from her running in to mrs pecq for advice to merry for comfort or mrs minot for the higher kind of help one often needs so much now miss bat found that she was getting the credit and the praise belonging to other people and it stirred her up to try and deserve a part at least  molly dont want any help about her work or the boy its too late for that but if this house dont get a spring cleaning that will make it shine my name aint bathsheba dawes said the old lady as she put away her bonnet that night and laid energetic plans for a grand revolution inspired thereto not only by shame but by the hint that mr bemis was a lavish man as no one knew better than she  mollys amazement next day at seeing carpets fly out of window ancient cobwebs come down and longundisturbed closets routed out to the great dismay of moths and mice has been already confided to the cats and as she sat there watching them lap and gnaw she said to herself  i dont understand it but as she never says much to me about my affairs i wont take any notice till she gets through then ill admire everything all i can it is so pleasant to be praised after youve been trying hard  she might well say that for she got very little herself and her trials had been many her efforts not always successful and her reward seemed a long way off poor boo could have sympathized with her for he had suffered much persecution from his small schoolmates when he appeared with large gray patches on the little brown trousers where he had worn them out coasting down those too fascinating steps as he could not see the patches himself he fancied them invisible and came home much afflicted by the jeers of his friends then molly tried to make him a new pair out of a sack of her own but she cut both sides for the same leg so one was wrong side out fondly hoping no one would observe it she sewed bright buttons wherever they could be put and sent confiding boo away in a pair of blue trousers which were absurdly hunchy behind and buttony before he came home heartbroken and muddy having been accidentally tipped into a mudpuddle by two bad boys who felt that such tailoring was an insult to mankind that roused mollys spirit and she begged her father to take the boy and have him properly fitted out as he was old enough now to be welldressed and she wouldnt have him tormented his attention being called to the trousers mr bemis had a good laugh over them and then got boo a suit which caused him to be the admired of all observers and to feel as proud as a little peacock  cheered by this success molly undertook a set of small shirts and stitched away bravely though her own summer clothes were in a sad state and for the first time in her life she cared about what she should wear  i must ask merry and may be father will let me go with her and her mother when they do their shopping instead of leaving it to miss bat who dresses me like an old woman merry knows what is pretty and becoming i dont thought molly meditating in the bushel basket with her eyes on her snuffcolored gown and the dark purple bow at the end of the long braid muffet had been playing with  molly was beginning to see that even so small a matter as the choice of colors made a difference in ones appearance and to wonder why merry always took such pains to have a blue tie for the gray dress a rosy one for the brown and gloves that matched her bonnet ribbons merry never wore a locket outside her sack a gay bow in her hair and soiled cuffs a smart hat and the braid worn off her skirts she was exquisitely neat and simple yet always looked welldressed and pretty for her love of beauty taught her what all girls should learn as soon as they begin to care for appearancesthat neatness and simplicity are their best ornaments that good habits are better than fine clothes and the most elegant manners are the kindest  all these thoughts were dancing through mollys head and when she left her cats after a general romp in which even decorous granny allowed her family to play leapfrog over her respectable back she had made up her mind not to have yellow ribbons on her summer hat if she got a pink muslin as she had planned but to finish off boos last shirt before she went shopping with merry  it rained that evening and mr bemis had a headache so he threw himself down upon the lounge after tea for a nap with his silk handkerchief spread over his face he did get a nap and when he waked he lay for a time drowsily listening to the patter of the rain and another sound which was even more soothing putting back a corner of the handkerchief to learn what it was he saw molly sitting by the fire with boo in her lap rocking and humming as she warmed his little bare feet having learned to guard against croup by attending to the damp shoes and socks before going to bed boo lay with his round face turned up to hers stroking her cheek while the sleepy blue eyes blinked lovingly at her as she sang her lullaby with a motherly patience sweet to see they made a pretty little picture and mr bemis looked at it with pleasure having a leisure moment in which to discover as all parents do sooner or later that his children were growing up  molly is getting to be quite a woman and very like her mother thought papa wiping the eye that peeped for he had been fond of the pretty wife who died when boo was born sad loss to them poor things but miss bat seems to have done well by them molly is much improved and the boy looks finely shes a good soul after all and mr bemis began to think he had been hasty when he half made up his mind to get a new housekeeper feeling that burnt steak weak coffee and ragged wristbands were sure signs that miss bats days of usefulness were over  molly was singing the lullaby her mother used to sing to her and her father listened to it silently till boo was carried away too sleepy for anything but bed when she came back she sat down to her work fancying her father still asleep she had a crimson bow at her throat and one on the newly braided hair her cuffs were clean and a white apron hid the shabbiness of the old dress she looked like a thrifty little housewife as she sat with her basket beside her full of neat white rolls her spools set forth and a new pair of scissors shining on the table there was a sort of charm in watching the busy needle flash to and fro the anxious pucker of the forehead as she looked to see if the stitches were even and the expression of intense relief upon her face as she surveyed the finished buttonhole with girlish satisfaction her father was wide awake and looking at her thinking as he did so  really the old lady has worked well to change my tomboy into that nice little girl i wonder how she did it then he gave a yawn pulled off the handkerchief and said aloud what are you making molly for it struck him that sewing was a new amusement  shirts for boo sir four and this is the last she answered with pardonable pride as she held it up and nodded toward the pile in her basket  isnt that a new notion i thought miss bat did the sewing said mr bemis as he smiled at the funny little garment it looked so like boo himself  no sir only yours i do mine and boos at least im learning how and mrs pecq says i get on nicely answered molly threading her needle and making a knot in her most capable way  i suppose it is time you did learn for you are getting to be a great girl and all women should know how to make and mend you must take a stitch for me now and then miss bats eyes are not what they were i find and mr bemis looked at his frayed wristband as if he particularly felt the need of a stitch just then  id love to and i guess i could i can mend gloves merry taught me so id better begin on them if you have any said molly much pleased at being able to do anything for her father and still more so at being asked  theres something to start with and he threw her a pair with nearly every finger ripped  molly shook her head over them but got out her gray silk and fell to work glad to show how well she could sew  what are you smiling about asked her father after a little pause for his head felt better and it amused him to question molly  i was thinking about my summer clothes i must get them before long and id like to go with mrs grant and learn how to shop if you are willing  i thought miss bat did that for you  she always has but she gets ugly cheap things that i dont like i think i am old enough to choose myself if there is someone to tell me about prices and the goodness of the stuff merry does and she is only a few months older than i am  how old are you child asked her father feeling as if he had lost his reckoning  fifteen in august and molly looked very proud of the fact  so you are bless my heart how the time goes well get what you please if im to have a young lady here id like to have her prettily dressed it wont offend miss bat will it  mollys eyes sparkled but she gave a little shrug as she answered she wont care she never troubles herself about me if i let her alone  hey what not trouble herself if she doesnt who does and mr bemis sat up as if this discovery was more surprising than the other  i take care of myself and boo and she looks after you the house goes any way  i should think so i nearly broke my neck over the parlor sofa in the hall tonight what is it there for  molly laughed thats the joke sir miss bat is cleaning house and im sure it needs cleaning for it is years since it was properly done i thought you might have told her to  ive said nothing dont like housecleaning well enough to suggest it i did think the hall was rather dirty when i dropped my coat and took it up covered with lint is she going to upset the whole place asked mr bemis looking alarmed at the prospect  i hope so for i really am ashamed when people come to have them see the dust and cobwebs and old carpets and dirty windows said molly with a sigh though she never had cared a bit till lately  why dont you dust round a little then no time to spare from the books and play  i tried father but miss bat didnt like it and it was too hard for me alone if things were once in nice order i think i could keep them so for i do want to be neat and im learning as fast as i can  it is high time someone took hold if matters are left as you say ive just been thinking what a clever woman miss bat was to make such a tidy little girl out of what i used to hear called the greatest tomboy in town and wondering what i could give the old lady now i find you are the one to be thanked and it is a very pleasant surprise to me  give her the present please im satisfied if you like what ive done it isnt much and i didnt know as you would ever observe any difference but i did try and now i guess im really getting on said molly sewing away with a bright color in her cheeks for she too found it a pleasant surprise to be praised after many failures and few successes  you certainly are my dear ill wait till the housecleaning is over and then if we are all alive ill see about miss bats reward meantime you go with mrs grant and get whatever you and the boy need and send the bills to me and mr bemis lighted a cigar as if that matter was settled  oh thank you sir that will be splendid merry always has pretty things and i know you will like me when i get fixed said molly smoothing down her apron with a little air  seems to me you look very well as you are isnt that a pretty enough frock asked mr bemis quite unconscious that his own unusual interest in his daughters affairs made her look so bright and winsome  this why father ive worn it all winter and its frightfully ugly and almost in rags i asked you for a new one a month ago and you said youd see about it but you didnt so i patched this up as well as i could and molly showed her elbows feeling that such masculine blindness as this deserved a mild reproof  too bad well go and get half a dozen pretty muslin and gingham things and be as gay as a butterfly to make up for it laughed her father really touched by the patches and mollys resignation to the unreliable ill see about it which he recognized as a household word  molly clapped her hands old gloves and all exclaiming with girlish delight how nice it will seem to have a plenty of new neat dresses all at once and be like other girls miss bat always talks about economy and has no more taste than acaterpillar molly meant to say cat but remembering her pets spared them the insult  i think i can afford to dress my girl as well as grant does his get a new hat and coat child and any little notions you fancy miss bats economy isnt the sort i like and mr bemis looked at his wristbands again as if he could sympathize with mollys elbows  at this rate i shall have more clothes than i know what to do with after being a ragbag thought the girl in great glee as she bravely stitched away at the worst glove while her father smoked silently for a while feeling that several little matters had escaped his eye which he really ought to see about  presently he went to his desk but not to bury himself in business papers as usual for after rummaging in several drawers he took out a small bunch of keys and sat looking at them with an expression only seen on his face when he looked up at the portrait of a darkeyed woman hanging in his room he was a very busy man but he had a tender place in his heart for his children and when a look a few words a moments reflection called his attention to the fact that his little girl was growing up he found both pride and pleasure in the thought that this young daughter was trying to fill her mothers place and be a comfort to him if he would let her  molly my dear here is something for you he said and when she stood beside him added as he put the keys into her hand keeping both in his own for a minute  those are the keys to your mothers things i always meant you to have them when you were old enough to use or care for them i think youll fancy this better than any other present for you are a good child and very like her  something seemed to get into his throat there and molly put her arm round his neck saying with a little choke in her own voice thank you father id rather have this than anything else in the world and ill try to be more like her every day for your sake  he kissed her then said as he began to stir his papers about i must write some letters run off to bed child goodnight my dear goodnight  seeing that he wanted to be alone molly slipped away feeling that she had received a very precious gift for she remembered the dear dead mother and had often longed to possess the relics laid away in the one room where order reigned and miss bat had no power to meddle as she slowly undressed she was not thinking of the pretty new gowns in which she was to be as gay as a butterfly but of the halfworn garments waiting for her hands to unfold with a tender touch and when she fell asleep with the keys under her pillow and her arms round boo a few happy tears on her cheeks seemed to show that in trying to do the duty which lay nearest her she had earned a very sweet reward  so the little missionaries succeeded better in their second attempt than in their first for though still very far from being perfect girls each was slowly learning in her own way one of the three lessons all are the better for knowingthat cheerfulness can change misfortune into love and friends that in ordering ones self aright one helps others to do the same and that the power of finding beauty in the humblest things makes home happy and life lovely     chapter xviii may baskets   spring was late that year but to jill it seemed the loveliest she had ever known for hope was growing green and strong in her own little heart and all the world looked beautiful with the help of the brace she could sit up for a short time every day and when the air was mild enough she was warmly wrapped and allowed to look out at the open window into the garden where the gold and purple crocuses were coming bravely up and the snowdrops nodded their delicate heads as if calling to her  good day little sister come out and play with us for winter is over and spring is here  i wish i could thought jill as the soft wind kissed a tinge of color into her pale cheeks never mind they have been shut up in a darker place than i for months and had no fun at all i wont fret but think about july and the seashore while i work  the job now in hand was may baskets for it was the custom of the children to hang them on the doors of their friends the night before mayday and the girls had agreed to supply baskets if the boys would hunt for flowers much the harder task of the two jill had more leisure as well as taste and skill than the other girls so she amused herself with making a goodly store of pretty baskets of all shapes sizes and colors quite confident that they would be filled though not a flower had shown its head except a few hardy dandelions and here and there a small cluster of saxifrage  the violets would not open their blue eyes till the sunshine was warmer the columbines refused to dance with the boisterous east wind the ferns kept themselves rolled up in their brown flannel jackets and little hepatica with many another spring beauty hid away in the woods afraid to venture out in spite of the eager welcome awaiting them but the birds had come punctual as ever and the bluejays were screaming in the orchard robins were perking up their heads and tails as they went househunting purple finches in their little red hoods were feasting on the spruce buds and the faithful chip birds chirped gayly on the grapevine trellis where they had lived all winter warming their little gray breasts against the southern side of the house when the sun shone and hiding under the evergreen boughs when the snow fell  that tree is a sort of birds hotel said jill looking out at the tall spruce before her window every spray now tipped with a soft green they all go there to sleep and eat and it has room for every one it is green when other trees die the wind cant break it and the snow only makes it look prettier it sings to me and nods as if it knew i loved it  we might call it the holly tree inn as some of the cheap eatinghouses for poor people are called in the city as my holly bush grows at its foot for a sign you can be the landlady and feed your feathery customers every day till the hard times are over said mrs minot glad to see the childs enjoyment of the outer world from which she had been shut so long  jill liked the fancy and gladly strewed crumbs on the window ledge for the chippies who came confidingly to eat almost from her hand she threw out grain for the handsome jays the jaunty robins and the neighbors doves who came with soft flight to trip about on their pink feet arching their shining necks as they cooed and pecked carrots and cabbageleaves also flew out of the window for the marauding gray rabbit last of all jacks halfdozen who led him a weary life of it because they would not stay in the bunnyhouse but undermined the garden with their burrows ate the neighbors plants and refused to be caught till all but one ran away to jacks great relief this old fellow camped out for the winter and seemed to get on very well among the cats and the hens who shared their stores with him and he might be seen at all hours of the day and night scampering about the place or kicking up his heels by moonlight for he was a desperate poacher  jill took great delight in her pretty pensioners who soon learned to love the holly tree inn and to feel that the bird room held a caged comrade for when it was too cold or wet to open the windows the doves came and tapped at the pane the chippies sat on the ledge in plump little bunches as if she were their sunshine the jays called her in their shrill voices to ring the dinnerbell and the robins tilted on the spruce boughs where lunch was always to be had  the first of may came on sunday so all the celebrating must be done on saturday which happily proved fair though too chilly for muslin gowns paper garlands and picnics on damp grass being a holiday the boys decided to devote the morning to ball and the afternoon to the flower hunt while the girls finished the baskets and in the evening our particular seven were to meet at the minots to fill them ready for the closing frolic of hanging on doorhandles ringing bells and running away  now i must do my maying for there will be no more sunshine and i want to pick my flowers before it is dark come mammy you go too said jill as the last sunbeams shone in at the western window where her hyacinths stood that no fostering ray might be lost  it was rather pathetic to see the once merry girl who used to be the life of the woodparties now carefully lifting herself from the couch and leaning on her mothers strong arm slowly take the halfdozen steps that made up her little expedition but she was happy and stood smiling out at old bun skipping down the walk the goldedged clouds that drew apart so that a sunbeam might give her a goodnight kiss as she gathered her longcherished daisies primroses and hyacinths to fill the pretty basket in her hand  who is it for my dearie asked her mother standing behind her as a prop while the thin fingers did their work so willingly that not a flower was left  for my lady of course who else would i give my posies to when i love them so well answered jill who thought no name too fine for their best friend  i fancied it would be for master jack said her mother wishing the excursion to be a cheerful one  ive another for him but she must have the prettiest he is going to hang it for me and ring and run away and she wont know who its from till she sees this she will remember it for ive been turning and tending it ever so long to make it bloom today isnt it a beauty and jill held up her finest hyacinth which seemed to ring its pale pink bells as if glad to carry its sweet message from a grateful little heart  indeed it is and you are right to give your best to her come away now you must not stand any longer come and rest while i fetch a dish to put the flowers in till you want them and mrs pecq turned her round with her small maying safely done  i didnt think id ever be able to do even so much and here i am walking and sitting up and going to drive some day isnt it nice that im not to be a poor lucinda after all and jill drew a long sigh of relief that six months instead of twenty years would probably be the end of her captivity  yes thank heaven i dont think i could have borne that and the mother took jill in her arms as if she were a baby holding her close for a minute and laying her down with a tender kiss that made the arms cling about her neck as her little girl returned it heartily for all sorts of new sweet feelings seemed to be budding in both born of great joy and thankfulness  then mrs pecq hurried away to see about tea for the hungry boys and jill watched the pleasant twilight deepen as she lay singing to herself one of the songs her friend taught her because it fitted her so well    a little bird i am   shut from the fields of air   and in my cage i sit and sing   to him who placed me there   well pleased a prisoner to be   because my god it pleases thee    naught have i else to do   i sing the whole day long   and he whom most i love to please   doth listen to my song   he caught and bound my wandering wing   but still he bends to hear me sing  now we are ready for you so bring on your flowers said molly to the boys as she and merry added their store of baskets to the gay show jill had set forth on the long table ready for the evenings work  they wouldnt let me see one but i guess they have had good luck they look so jolly answered jill looking at gus frank and jack who stood laughing each with a large basket in his hands  fair to middling just look in and see with which cheerful remark gus tipped up his basket and displayed a few bits of green at the bottom  i did better now dont all scream at once over these beauties and frank shook out some evergreen sprigs half a dozen saxifrages and two or three forlorn violets with hardly any stems  i dont brag but heres the best of all the three chuckled jack producing a bunch of feathery carrottops with a few halfshut dandelions trying to look brave and gay  oh boys is that all  what shall we do  weve only a few houseflowers and all those baskets to fill cried the girls in despair for merrys contribution had been small and molly had only a handful of artificial flowers to fill up she said  it isnt our fault it is the late spring we cant make flowers can we asked frank in a tone of calm resignation  couldnt you buy some then said molly smoothing her crumpled morningglories with a sigh  who ever heard of a fellow having any money left the last day of the month demanded gus severely  or girls either i spent all mine in ribbon and paper for my baskets and now they are of no use its a shame lamented jill while merry began to thin out her full baskets to fill the empty ones  hold on cried frank relenting now jack make their minds easy before they begin to weep and wail  left the box outside you tell while i go for it and jack bolted as if afraid the young ladies might be too demonstrative when the tale was told  tell away said frank modestly passing the story along to gus who made short work of it  we rampaged all over the country and got only that small mess of greens knew youd be disgusted and sat down to see what we could do then jack piped up and said hed show us a place where we could get a plenty come on said we and after leading us a nice tramp he brought us out at morses greenhouse so we got a few on tick as we had but four cents among us and there you are pretty clever of the little chap wasnt it  a chorus of delight greeted jack as he popped his head in was promptly seized by his elders and walked up to the table where the box was opened displaying gay posies enough to fill most of the baskets if distributed with great economy and much green  you are the dearest boy that ever was began jill with her nose luxuriously buried in the box though the flowers were more remarkable for color than perfume  no im not theres a much dearer one coming upstairs now and hes got something that will make you howl for joy said jack ignoring his own prowess as ed came in with a bigger box looking as if he had done nothing but go a maying all his days  dont believe it cried jill hugging her own treasure jealously its only another joke i wont look said molly still struggling to make her cambric roses bloom again  i know what it is oh how sweet added merry sniffing as ed set the box before her saying pleasantly  you shall see first because you had faith  up went the cover and a whiff of the freshest fragrance regaled the seven eager noses bent to inhale it as a general murmur of pleasure greeted the nest of great rosy mayflowers that lay before them  the dear things how lovely they are and merry looked as if greeting her cousins so blooming and sweet was her own face  molly pushed her dingy garlands away ashamed of such poor attempts beside these perfect works of nature and jill stretched out her hand involuntarily as she said forgetting her exotics give me just one to smell of it is so woodsy and delicious  here you are plenty for all real pilgrim fathers right from plymouth one of our fellows lives there and i told him to bring me a good lot so he did and you can do what you like with them explained ed passing round bunches and shaking the rest in a mossy pile upon the table  ed always gets ahead of us in doing the right thing at the right time hope youve got some firstclass baskets ready for him said gus refreshing the washingtonian nose with a pink blossom or two  not much danger of his being forgotten answered molly and every one laughed for ed was much beloved by all the girls and his doorsteps always bloomed like a flowerbed on may eve  now we must fly round and fill up come boys sort out the green and hand us the flowers as we want them then we must direct them and by the time that is done you can go and leave them said jill setting all to work  ed must choose his baskets first these are ours but any of those you can have and molly pointed to a detachment of gay baskets set apart from those already partly filled  ed chose a blue one and merry filled it with the rosiest mayflowers knowing that it was to hang on mabels doorhandle  the others did the same and the pretty work went on with much fun till all were filled and ready for the names or notes  let us have poetry as we cant get wild flowers that will be rather fine proposed jill who liked jingles  all had had some practice at the game parties and pencils went briskly for a few minutes while silence reigned as the poets racked their brains for rhymes and stared at the blooming array before them for inspiration  oh dear i cant find a word to rhyme to geranium sighed molly pulling her braid as if to pump the well of her fancy dry  cranium said frank who was getting on bravely with annette and violet  that is elegant and molly scribbled away in great glee for her poems were always funny ones  how do you spell anemolythe wild flower i mean asked jill who was trying to compose a very appropriate piece for her best basket and found it easier to feel love and gratitude than to put them into verse  anemone do spell it properly or youll get laughed at answered gus wildly struggling to make his lines express great ardor without being too spoony as he expressed it  no i shouldnt this person never laughs at other persons mistakes as some persons do replied jill with dignity  jack was desperately chewing his pencil for he could not get on at all but ed had evidently prepared his poem for his paper was half full already and merry was smiling as she wrote a friendly line or two for ralphs basket as she feared he would be forgotten and knew he loved kindness even more than he did beauty  now lets read them proposed molly who loved to laugh even at herself  the boys politely declined and scrambled their notes into the chosen baskets in great haste but the girls were less bashful jill was invited to begin and gave her little piece with the pink hyacinth basket before her to illustrate her poem    to my lady    there are no flowers in the fields   no green leaves on the tree   no columbines no violets   no sweet anemone   so i have gathered from my pots   all that i have to fill   the basket that i hang tonight   with heaps of love from jill  thats perfectly sweet mine isnt but i meant it to be funny said molly as if there could be any doubt about the following ditty    dear grif   here is a whiff   of beautiful spring flowers   the big red rose   is for your nose   as toward the sky it towers    oh do not frown   upon this crown   of green pinks and blue geranium   but think of me   when this you see   and put it on your cranium  o molly you will never hear the last of that if grif gets it said jill as the applause subsided for the boys pronounced it tiptop  dont care he gets the worst of it any way for there is a pin in that rose and if he goes to smell the mayflowers underneath he will find a thorn to pay for the tack he put in my rubber boot i know he will play me some joke tonight and i mean to be first if i can answered molly settling the artificial wreath round the orangecolored canoe which held her effusion  now merry read yours you always have sweet poems and jill folded her hands to listen with pleasure to something sentimental  i cant read the poems in some of mine because they are for you but this little verse you can hear if you like im going to give that basket to ralph he said he should hang one for his grandmother and i thought that was so nice of him id love to surprise him with one all to himself hes always so good to us and merry looked so innocently earnest that no one smiled at her kind thought or the unconscious paraphrase she had made of a famous stanza in her own little verse    to one who teaches me   the sweetness and the beauty   of doing faithfully   and cheerfully my duty  he will like that and know who sent it for none of us have pretty pink paper but you or write such an elegant hand said molly admiring the delicate white basket shaped like a lily with the flowers inside and the note hidden among them all daintily tied up with the palest blushcolored ribbon  well thats no harm he likes pretty things as much as i do and i made my basket like a flower because i gave him one of my callas he admired the shape so much and merry smiled as she remembered how pleased ralph looked as he went away carrying the lovely thing  i think it would be a good plan to hang some baskets on the doors of other people who dont expect or often have any ill do it if you can spare some of these we have so many give me only one and let the others go to old mrs tucker and the little irish girl who has been sick so long and lame neddy and daddy munson it would please and surprise them so will we asked ed in that persuasive voice of his  all agreed at once and several people were made very happy by a bit of spring left at their doors by the may elves who haunted the town that night playing all sorts of pranks such a twanging of bells and rapping of knockers such a scampering of feet in the dark such droll collisions as boys came racing round corners or girls ran into one anothers arms as they crept up and down steps on the sly such laughing whistling flying about of flowers and friendly feelingit was almost a pity that mayday did not come oftener  molly got home late and found that grif had been before her after all for she stumbled over a marketbasket at her door and on taking it in found a mammoth nosegay of purple and white cabbages her favorite vegetable even miss bat laughed at the funny sight and molly resolved to get ralph to carve her a bouquet out of carrots beets and turnips for next time as grif would never think of that  merry ran up the gardenwalk alone for frank left her at the gate and was fumbling for the latch when she felt something hanging there opening the door carefully she found it gay with offerings from her mates and among them was one long quivershaped basket of birch bark with something heavy under the green leaves that lay at the top lifting these a slender basrelief of a calla lily in plaster appeared with this couplet slipped into the blue cord by which it was to hang    that mercy you to others show   that mercy grant to me  how lovely and this one will never fade but always be a pleasure hanging there now i really have something beautiful all my own said merry to herself as she ran up to hang the pretty thing on the dark wainscot of her room where the graceful curve of its pointed leaves and the depth of its white cup would be a joy to her eyes as long as they lasted  i wonder what that means and merry read over the lines again while a soft color came into her cheeks and a little smile of girlish pleasure began to dimple round her lips for she was so romantic this touch of sentiment showed her that her friendship was more valued than she dreamed but she only said how glad i am i remembered him and how surprised he will be to see mayflowers in return for the lily  he was and worked away more happily and bravely for the thought of the little friend whose eyes would daily fall on the white flower which always reminded him of her     chapter xix good templars   hi there bells rung get up lazybones called frank from his room as the clock struck six one bright morning and a great creaking and stamping proclaimed that he was astir  all right im coming responded a drowsy voice and jack turned over as if to obey but there the effort ended and he was off again for growing lads are hard to rouse as many a mother knows to her sorrow  frank made a beginning on his own toilet and then took a look at his brother for the stillness was suspicious  i thought so he told me to wake him and i guess this will do it and filling his great sponge with water frank stalked into the next room and stood over the unconscious victim like a stern executioner glad to unite business with pleasure in this agreeable manner  a woman would have relented and tried some milder means for when his broad shoulders and stout limbs were hidden jack looked very young and innocent in his sleep even frank paused a moment to look at the round rosy face the curly eyelashes halfopen mouth and the peaceful expression of a dreaming baby i must do it or he wont be ready for breakfast said the spartan brother and down came the sponge cold wet and choky as it was briskly rubbed to and fro regardless of every obstacle  come i say thats not fair leave me alone sputtered jack hitting out so vigorously that the sponge flew across the room and frank fell back to laugh at the indignant sufferer  i promised to wake you and you believe in keeping promises so im doing my best to get you up  well you neednt pour a quart of water down a fellows neck and rub his nose off need you im awake so take your old sponge and go along growled jack with one eye open and a mighty gape  see that you keep so then or ill come and give you another sort of a rouser said frank retiring wellpleased with his success  i shall have one good stretch if i like it is strengthening to the muscles and im as stiff as a board with all that football yesterday murmured jack lying down for one delicious moment he shut the open eye to enjoy it thoroughly and forgot the stretch altogether for the bed was warm the pillow soft and a halffinished dream still hung about his drowsy brain who does not know the fatal charm of that stolen momentfor once yield to it and one is lost  jack was miles away in the twinkling of a bedpost and the pleasing dream seemed about to return when a ruthless hand tore off the clothes swept him out of bed and he really did awake to find himself standing in the middle of his bathpan with both windows open and frank about to pour a pail of water over him  hold on yah how cold the water is why i thought i was up and hopping out jack rubbed his eyes and looked about with such a genuine surprise that frank put down the pail feeling that the deluge would not be needed this time  you are now and ill see that you keep so he said as he stripped the bed and carried off the pillows  i dont care what a jolly day and jack took a little promenade to finish the rousing process  youd better hurry up or you wont get your chores done before breakfast no time for a go as you please now said frank and both boys laughed for it was an old joke of theirs and rather funny  going up to bed one night expecting to find jack asleep frank discovered him tramping round and round the room airily attired in a towel and so dizzy with his brisk revolutions that as his brother looked he tumbled over and lay panting like a fallen gladiator  what on earth are you about  playing rowell walking for the belt and ive got it too laughed jack pointing to an old gilt chandelier chain hanging on the bedpost  you little noodle youd better revolve into bed before you lose your head entirely i never saw such a fellow for taking himself off his legs  well if i didnt exercise do you suppose i should be able to do thator that cried jack turning a somersault and striking a fine attitude as he came up flattering himself that he was the model of a youthful athlete  you look more like a clothespin than a hercules was the crushing reply of this unsympathetic brother and jack meekly retired with a bad headache  i dont do such silly things now im as broad across the shoulders as you are and twice as strong on my pins thanks to my gymnastics bet you a cent ill be dressed first though you have got the start said jack knowing that frank always had a protracted wrestle with his collarbuttons which gave his adversary a great advantage over him  done answered frank and at it they went a wild scramble was heard in jacks room and a steady tramp in the other as frank worked away at the stiff collar and the unaccommodating button till every finger ached a clashing of boots followed while jack whistled polly hopkins and frank declaimed in his deepest voice  arma virumque cano trojae qui primus ab oris italiam fato profugus laviniaque venit litora  hairbrushes came next and here frank got ahead for jacks thick crop would stand straight up on the crown and only a good wetting and a steady brush would make it lie down  play away no 2 called out frank as he put on his vest while jack was still at it with a pair of the stiffest brushes procurable for money  hold hard no 11 and dont forget your teeth answered jack who had done his  frank took a hasty rub and whisked on his coat while jack was picking up the various treasures which had flown out of his pockets as he caught up his roundabout  ready ill trouble you for a cent sonny and frank held out his hand as he appeared equipped for the day  you havent hung up your nightgown nor aired the bed nor opened the windows thats part of the dressing mother said so ive got you there for you did all that for me except this and jack threw his gown over a chair with a triumphant flourish as frank turned back to leave his room in the order which they had been taught was one of the signs of a good bringingup in boys as well as girls  ready ill trouble you for a cent old man and jack held out his hand with a chuckle  he got the money and a good clap beside then they retired to the shed to black their boots after which frank filled the woodboxes and jack split kindlings till the daily allowance was ready both went at their lessons for half an hour jack scowling over his algebra in the sofa corner while frank with his elbows on and his legs round the little stand which held his books seemed to be having a wrestlingmatch with herodotus  when the bell rang they were glad to drop the lessons and fall upon their breakfast with the appetite of wolves especially jack who sequestered oatmeal and milk with such rapidity that one would have thought he had a leathern bag hidden somewhere to slip it into like his famous namesake when he breakfasted with the giant  i declare i dont see what he does with it he really ought not to gobble so mother said frank who was eating with great deliberation and propriety  never you mind old quiddle im so hungry i could tuck away a bushel answered jack emptying a glass of milk and holding out his plate for more mush regardless of his white moustache  temperance in all things is wise in speech as well as eating and drinkingremember that boys said mamma from behind the urn  that reminds me we promised to do the observer this week and here it is tuesday and i havent done a thing have you asked frank  never thought of it we must look up some bits at noon instead of playing dare say jill has got some she always saves all she finds for me  i have one or two good items and can do any copying there may be but i think if you undertake the paper you should give some time and labor to make it good said mamma who was used to this state of affairs and often edited the little sheet read every week at the lodge the boys seldom missed going but the busy lady was often unable to be there so helped with the paper as her share of the labor  yes we ought but somehow we dont seem to get up much steam about it lately if more people belonged and we could have a grand time now and then it would be jolly and jack sighed at the lack of interest felt by outsiders in the loyal little lodge which went on year after year kept up by the faithful few  i remember when in this very town we used to have a cold water army and in the summer turn out with processions banners and bands of music to march about and end with a picnic songs and speeches in some grove or hall nearly all the children belonged to it and the parents also and we had fine times here twentyfive or thirty years ago  it didnt do much good seems to me for people still drink and we havent a decent hotel in the place said frank as his mother sat looking out of the window as if she saw again the pleasant sight of old and young working together against the great enemy of home peace and safety  oh yes it did my dear for to this day many of those children are true to their pledge one little girl was i am sure and now has two big boys to fight for the reform she has upheld all her life the town is better than it was in those days and if we each do our part faithfully it will improve yet more every boy and girl who joins is one gained perhaps and your example is the best temperance lecture you can give hold fast and dont mind if it isnt jolly it is right and that should be enough for us  mamma spoke warmly for she heartily believed in young peoples guarding against this dangerous vice before it became a temptation and hoped her boys would never break the pledge they had taken for young as they were they were old enough to see its worth feel its wisdom and pride themselves on the promise which was fast growing into a principle jacks face brightened as he listened and frank said with the steady look which made his face manly  it shall be now ill tell you what i was going to keep as a surprise till tonight for i wanted to have my secret as well as other folks ed and i went up to see bob sunday and he said hed join the lodge if theyd have him im going to propose him tonight  good good cried jack joyfully and mrs minot clapped her hands for every new member was rejoiced over by the good people who were not discouraged by ridicule indifference or opposition  weve got him now for no one will object and it is just the thing for him he wants to belong somewhere he says and hell enjoy the fun and the good things will help him and we will look after him the captain was so pleased and you ought to have seen eds face when bob said im ready if youll have me  franks own face was beaming and jack forgot to gobble he was so interested in the new convert while mamma said as she threw down her napkin and took up the newspaper  we must not forget our observer but have a good one tonight in honor of the occasion there may be something here come home early at noon and ill help you get your paper ready  ill be here but if you want frank youd better tell him not to dawdle over annettes gate half an hour began jack who could not resist teasing his dignified brother about one of the few foolish things he was fond of doing  do you want your nose pulled demanded frank who never would stand joking on that tender point from his brother  no i dont and if i did you couldnt do it with which taunt he was off and frank after him having made a futile dive at the impertinent little nose which was turned up at him and his sweetheart  boys boys not through the parlor implored mamma resigned to skirmishes but trembling for her piano legs as the four stout boots pranced about the table and then went thundering down the hall through the kitchen where the fat cook cheered them on and mary the maid tried to head off frank as jack rushed out into the garden but the pursuer ducked under her arm and gave chase with all speed then there was a glorious race all over the place for both were good runners and being as full of spring vigor as frisky calves they did astonishing things in the way of leaping fences dodging round corners and making good time down the wide walks  but jacks leg was not quite strong yet and he felt that his round nose was in danger of a vengeful tweak as his breath began to give out and franks long arms drew nearer and nearer to the threatened feature just when he was about to give up and meet his fate like a man old bunny who had been much excited by the race came scampering across the path with such a droll skip into the air and shake of the hind legs that frank had to dodge to avoid stepping on him and to laugh in spite of himself this momentary check gave jack a chance to bolt up the back stairs and take refuge in the bird room from the window of which jill had been watching the race with great interest  no romping was allowed there so a truce was made by locking little fingers and both sat down to get their breath  i am to go on the piazza for an hour by and by doctor said would you mind carrying me down before you go to school you do it so nicely im not a bit afraid said jill as eager for the little change as if it had been a long and varied journey  yes indeed come on princess answered jack glad to see her so well and happy  the boys made an armchair and away she went for a pleasant day downstairs she thanked frank with a posy for his buttonhole well knowing that it would soon pass into other hands and he departed to join annette having told jill about bob and set her to work on the observer jack kissed his mother and went whistling down the street a gay little bachelor with a nod and smile for all he met and no turnedup hat or jaunty turban bobbing along beside him to delay his steps or trouble his peace of mind  at noon they worked on their paper which was a collection of items cut from other papers concerning temperance a few anecdotes a bit of poetry a story and if possible an original article by the editor many hands make light work and nothing remained but a little copying which jill promised to do before night so the boys had time for a game of football after school in the afternoon which they much enjoyed as they sat resting on the posts gus said  uncle fred says he will give us a haycart ride tonight as it is moony and after it you are all to come to our house and have games  cant do it answered frank sadly  lodge groaned jack for both considered a drive in the cart where they all sat in a merry bunch among the hay one of the joys of life and much regretted that a prior engagement would prevent their sharing in it  thats a pity i forgot it was tuesday and cant put it off as ive asked all the rest give up your old lodge and come along said gus who had not joined yet  we might for once perhaps but i dont like tobegan jack hesitating  i wont whos to propose bob if we dont i want to go awfully but i wouldnt disappoint bob for a good deal now he is willing to come and frank sprang off his post as if anxious to flee temptation for it was very pleasant to go singing up hill and down dale in the spring moonlight withwell the fellows of his set  nor ed i forgot that no we cant go we want to be good templars and we mustnt shirk added jack following his brother  better come cant put it off lots of fun called gus disappointed at losing two of his favorite mates  but the boys did not turn back and as they went steadily away they felt that they were doing their little part in the good work and making their small sacrifices like faithful members  they got their reward however for at home they found mr chauncey a good and great man from england who had known their grandfather and was an honored friend of the family the boys loved to hear him talk and all teatime listened with interest to the conversation for mr chauncey was a reformer as well as a famous clergyman and it was like inspiring music to hear him tell about the worlds work and the brave men and women who were carrying it on eager to show that they had at least begun the boys told him about their lodge and were immensely pleased when their guest took from his pocketbook a worn paper proving that he too was a good templar and belonged to the same army as they did nor was that all for when they reluctantly excused themselves mr chauncey gave each a hearty grip and said holding their hands in his as he smiled at the young faces looking up at him with so much love and honor in them  tell the brothers and sisters that if i can serve them in any way while here to command me i will give them a lecture at their lodge or in public whichever they like and i wish you godspeed dear boys  two prouder lads never walked the streets than frank and jack as they hurried away nearly forgetting the poor little paper in their haste to tell the good news for it was seldom that such an offer was made the lodge and they felt the honor done them as bearers of it  as the secrets of the association cannot be divulged to the uninitiated we can only say that there was great rejoicing over the new member for bob was unanimously welcomed and much gratitude both felt and expressed for mr chaunceys interest in this small division of the grand army for these good folk met with little sympathy from the great people of the town and it was very cheering to have a wellknown and muchbeloved man say a word for them all agreed that the lecture should be public that others might share the pleasure with them and perhaps be converted by a higher eloquence than any they possessed  so the services that night were unusually full of spirit and good cheer for all felt the influence of a friendly word the beauty of a fine example the paper was much applauded the songs were very hearty and when frank whose turn it was to be chaplain read the closing prayer every one felt that they had much to give thanks for since one more had joined them and the work was slowly getting on with unexpected helpers sent to lend a hand the lights shone out from the little hall across the street the music reached the ears of passersby and the busy hum of voices up there told how faithfully some at least of the villagers tried to make the town a safer place for their boys to grow up in though the tavern still had its private bar and the saloondoor stood open to invite them in  there are many such quiet lodges and in them many young people learning as these lads were learning something of the duty they owed their neighbors as well as themselves and being fitted to become good men and sober citizens by practising and preaching the law and gospel of temperance  the next night mr chauncey lectured and the town turned out to hear the distinguished man who not only told them of the crime and misery produced by this terrible vice which afflicted both england and america but of the great crusade against it going on everywhere and the need of courage patience hard work and much faith that in time it might be overcome strong and cheerful words that all liked to hear and many heartily believed especially the young templars whose boyish fancies were won by the idea of fighting as knights of old did in the famous crusades they read about in their splendid new young folks edition of froissart  we cant pitch into people as the red cross fellows did but we can smash rumjugs when we get the chance and stand by our flag as our men did in the war said frank with sparkling eyes as they went home in the moonlight arm in arm keeping step behind mr chauncey who led the way with their mother on his arm a martial figure though a minister and a good captain to follow as the boys felt after hearing his stirring words  lets try and get up a company of boys like those mother told us about and show people that we mean what we say ill be colorbearer and you may drill us as much as you like a real cold water army with flags flying and drums and all sorts of larks said jack much excited and taking a dramatic view of the matter  well see about it something ought to be done and perhaps we shall be the men to do it when the time comes answered frank feeling ready to shoulder a musket or be a minuteman in good earnest  boyish talk and enthusiasm but it was of the right sort and when time and training had fitted them to bear arms these young knights would be worthy to put on the red cross and ride away to help right the wrongs and slay the dragons that afflict the world     chapter xx a sweet memory   now the lovely june days had come everything began to look really summerlike school would soon be over and the young people were joyfully preparing for the long vacation  we are all going up to bethlehem we take the seashore one year and the mountains the next better come along said gus as the boys lay on the grass after beating the lincolns at one of the first matches of the season  cant we are off to pebbly beach the second week in july our invalids need sea air that one looks delicate doesnt he asked frank giving jack a slight rap with his bat as that young gentleman lay in his usual attitude admiring the blue hose and russet shoes which adorned his sturdy limbs  stop that captain you neednt talk about invalids when you know mother says you are not to look at a book for a month because you have studied yourself thin and headachy im all right and jack gave himself a sounding slap on the chest where shone the white star of the hbbc  hear the little cockerel crow you just wait till you get into the college class and see if you dont have to study like fun said gus with unruffled composure for he was going to harvard next year and felt himself already a senior  never shall i dont want any of your old colleges im going into business as soon as i can ed says i may be his bookkeeper if i am ready when he starts for himself that is much jollier than grinding away for four years and then having to grind ever so many more at a profession said jack examining with interest the various knocks and bruises with which much ballplaying had adorned his hands  much you know about it just as well you dont mean to try for it would take a mighty long pull and strong pull to get you in business would suit you better and you and ed would make a capital partnership devlin minot  co sounds well hey gus  very but they are such goodnatured chaps theyd never get rich by the way ed came home at noon today sick i met him and he looked regularly knocked up answered gus in a sober tone  i told him hed better not go down monday for he wasnt well saturday and couldnt come to sing sunday evening you remember i must go right round and see what the matter is and jack jumped up with an anxious face  let him alone till tomorrow he wont want any one fussing over him now we are going for a pull come along and steer said frank for the sunset promised to be fine and the boys liked a brisk row in their newly painted boat the rhodora  go ahead and get ready ill just cut round and ask at the door it will seem kind and i must know how ed is wont be long and jack was off at his best pace  the others were waiting impatiently when he came back with slower steps and a more anxious face  how is the old fellow called frank from the boat while gus stood leaning on an oar in a nautical attitude  pretty sick had the doctor may have a fever i didnt go in but ed sent his love and wanted to know who beat answered jack stepping to his place glad to rest and cool himself  guess hell be all right in a day or two and gus pushed off leaving all care behind  hope he wont have typhoidthats no joke i tell you said frank who knew all about it and did not care to repeat the experience  hes worked too hard hes so faithful he does more than his share and gets tired out mother asked him to come down and see us when he has his vacation we are going to have high old times fishing and boating up or down asked jack as they glided out into the river  gus looked both ways and seeing another boat with a glimpse of red in it just going round the bend answered with decision up of course dont we always pull to the bridge  not when the girls are going down laughed jack who had recognized juliets scarlet boatingsuit as he glanced over his shoulder  mind what you are about and dont gabble commanded captain frank as the crew bent to their oars and the slender boat cut through the water leaving a long furrow trembling behind  oh ah i see there is a blue jacket as well as a red one so its all right    lady queen anne she sits in the sun   as white as a lily as brown as a bun  sung jack recovering his spirits and wishing jill was there too  do you want a ducking sternly demanded gus anxious to preserve discipline  shouldnt mind its so warm  but jack said no more and soon the rhodora was alongside the water witch exchanging greetings in the most amiable manner  pity this boat wont hold four wed put jack in yours and take you girls a nice spin up to the hemlocks said frank whose idea of bliss was floating down the river with annette as coxswain  youd better come in here this will hold four and we are tired of rowing returned the water witch so invitingly that gus could not resist  i dont think it is safe to put four in there youd better change places with annette gus and then we shall be shipshape said frank answering a telegram from the eyes that matched the blue jacket  wouldnt it be more shipshape still if you put me ashore at grifs landing i can take his boat or wait till you come back dont care what i do said jack feeling himself sadly in the way  the goodnatured offer being accepted with thanks the changes were made and leaving him behind the two boats went gayly up the river he really did not care what he did so sat in grifs boat awhile watching the red sky the shining stream and the low green meadows where the blackbirds were singing as if they too had met their little sweethearts and were happy  jack remembered that quiet halfhour long afterward because what followed seemed to impress it on his memory as he sat enjoying the scene he very naturally thought about ed for the face of the sister whom he saw was very anxious and the word fever recalled the hard times when frank was ill particularly the night it was thought the boy would not live till dawn and jack cried himself to sleep wondering how he ever could get on without his brother ed was almost as dear to him and the thought that he was suffering destroyed jacks pleasure for a little while but fortunately young people do not know how to be anxious very long so our boy soon cheered up thinking about the late match between the stars and the lincolns and after a good rest went whistling home with a handful of mint for mrs pecq and played games with jill as merrily as if there was no such thing as care in the world  next day ed was worse and for a week the answer was the same when jack crept to the back door with his eager question  others came also for the dear boy lying upstairs had friends everywhere and older neighbors thought of him even more anxiously and tenderly than his mates it was not fever but some swifter trouble for when saturday night came ed had gone home to a longer and more peaceful sabbath than any he had ever known in this world  jack had been there in the afternoon and a kind message had come down to him that his friend was not suffering so much and he had gone away hoping in his boyish ignorance that all danger was over an hour later he was reading in the parlor having no heart for play when frank came in with a look upon his face which would have prepared jack for the news if he had seen it but he did not look up and frank found it so hard to speak that he lingered a moment at the piano as he often did when he came home it stood open and on the rack was the jolly brothers galop which he had been learning to play with ed big boy as he was the sudden thought that never again would they sit shoulder to shoulder thundering the marches or singing the songs both liked so well made his eyes fill as he laid away the music and shut the instrument feeling as if he never wanted to touch it again then he went and sat down beside jack with an arm round his neck trying to steady his voice by a natural question before he told the heavy news  what are you reading jacky  the unusual caress the very gentle tone made jack look up and the minute he saw franks face he knew the truth  is ed he could not say the hard word and frank could only answer by a nod as he winked fast for the tears would come jack said no more but as the book dropped from his knee he hid his face in the sofapillow and lay quite still not crying but trying to make it seem true that his dear ed had gone away for ever he could not do it and presently turned his head a little to say in a despairing tone  i dont see what i shall do without him  i know its hard for you it is for all of us  youve got gus but now i havent anybody ed was always so good to me and with the name so many tender recollections came that poor jack broke down in spite of his manful attempts to smother the sobs in the red pillow  there was an unconscious reproach in the words frank thought for he was not as gentle as ed and he did not wonder that jack loved and mourned for the lost friend like a brother  youve got me ill be good to you cry if you want to i dont mind  there was such a sympathetic choke in franks voice that jack felt comforted at once and when he had had his cry out which was very soon he let frank pull him up with a bearlike but affectionate hug and sat leaning on him as they talked about their loss both feeling that there might have been a greater one and resolving to love one another very much hereafter  mrs minot often called frank the fatherboy because he was now the head of the house and a sober reliable fellow for his years usually he did not show much affection except to her for as he once said i shall never be too old to kiss my mother and she often wished that he had a little sister to bring out the softer side of his character he domineered over jack and laughed at his affectionate little ways but now when trouble came he was as kind and patient as a girl and when mamma came in having heard the news she found her fatherboy comforting his brother so well that she slipped away without a word leaving them to learn one of the sweet lessons sorrow teachesto lean on one another and let each trial bring them closer together  it is often said that there should be no death or grief in childrens stories it is not wise to dwell on the dark and sad side of these things but they have also a bright and lovely side and since even the youngest dearest and most guarded child cannot escape some knowledge of the great mystery is it not well to teach them in simple cheerful ways that affection sweetens sorrow and a lovely life can make death beautiful i think so therefore try to tell the last scene in the history of a boy who really lived and really left behind him a memory so precious that it will not be soon forgotten by those who knew and loved him for the influence of this short life was felt by many and even this brief record of it may do for other children what the reality did for those who still lay flowers on his grave and try to be as good as eddy  few would have thought that the death of a quiet lad of seventeen would have been so widely felt so sincerely mourned but virtue like sunshine works its own sweet miracles and when it was known that never again would the bright face be seen in the village streets the cheery voice heard the loving heart felt in any of the little acts which so endeared ed devlin to those about him it seemed as if young and old grieved alike for so much promise cut off in its springtime this was proved at the funeral for though it took place at the busy hour of a busy day men left their affairs women their households young people their studies and their play and gave an hour to show their affection respect and sympathy for those who had lost so much  the girls had trimmed the church with all the sweetest flowers they could find and garlands of lilies of the valley robbed the casket of its mournful look the boys had brought fresh boughs to make the grave a green bed for their comrades last sleep now they were all gathered together and it was a touching sight to see the rows of young faces sobered and saddened by their first look at sorrow the girls sobbed and the boys set their lips tightly as their glances fell upon the lilies under which the familiar face lay full of solemn peace tears dimmed older eyes when the hymn the dead boy loved was sung and the pastor told with how much pride and pleasure he had watched the gracious growth of this young parishioner since he first met the lad of twelve and was attracted by the shining face the pleasant manners dutiful and loving ready to help patient to bear and forbear eager to excel faithful to the smallest task yet full of high ambitions and better still possessing the childlike piety that can trust and believe wait and hope good and happythe two things we all long for and so few of us truly are this he was and this single fact was the best eulogy his pastor could pronounce over the beloved youth gone to a nobler manhood whose promise left so sweet a memory behind  as the young people looked listened and took in the scene they felt as if some mysterious power had changed their playmate from a creature like themselves into a sort of saint or hero for them to look up to and imitate if they could what has he done to be so loved praised and mourned they thought with a tender sort of wonder and the answer seemed to come to them as never before for never had they been brought so near the solemn truth of life and death it was not what he did but what he was that made him so beloved all that was sweet and noble in him still lives for goodness is the only thing we can take with us when we die the only thing that can comfort those we leave behind and help us to meet again hereafter  this feeling was in many hearts when they went away to lay him with prayer and music under the budding oak that leaned over his grave a fit emblem of the young life just beginning its new spring as the children did their part the beauty of the summer day soothed their sorrow and something of the soft brightness of the june sunshine seemed to gild their thoughts as it gilded the flowerstrewn mound they left behind the true and touching words spoken cheered as well as impressed them and made them feel that their friend was not lost but gone on into a higher class of the great school whose master is eternal love and wisdom so the tears soon dried and the young faces looked up like flowers after rain but the heavensent shower sank into the earth and they were the stronger sweeter for it more eager to make life brave and beautiful because death had gently shown them what it should be  when the boys came home they found their mother already returned and jill upon the parlor sofa listening to her account of the funeral with the same quiet hopeful look which their own faces wore for somehow the sadness seemed to have gone and a sort of sunday peace remained  im glad it was all so sweet and pleasant come and rest you look so tired and jill held out her hands to greet thema crumpled handkerchief in one and a little bunch of fading lilies in the other  jack sat down in the low chair beside her and leaned his head against the arm of the sofa for he was tired but frank walked slowly up and down the long rooms with a serious yet serene look on his face for he felt as if he had learned something that day and would always be the better for it presently he said stopping before his mother who leaned in the easychair looking up at the picture of her boys father  i should like to have just such things said about me when i die  so should i if i deserved them as ed did cried jack earnestly  you may if you try i should be proud to hear them and if they were true they would comfort me more than anything else i am glad you see the lovely side of sorrow and are learning the lesson such losses teach us answered their mother who believed in teaching young people to face trouble bravely and find the silver lining in the clouds that come to all of us  i never thought much about it before but now dying doesnt seem dreadful at allonly solemn and beautiful somehow everybody seems to love everybody else more for it and try to be kind and good and pious i cant say what i mean but you know mother and frank went pacing on again with the bright look his eyes always wore when he listened to music or read of some noble action  thats what merry said when she and molly came in on their way home but molly felt dreadfully and so did mabel she brought me these flowers to press for we are all going to keep some to remember dear ed by said jill carefully smoothing out the little bells as she laid the lilies in her hymnbook for she too had had a thoughtful hour while she lay alone imagining all that went on in the church and shedding a few tender tears over the friend who was always so kind to her  i dont want anything to remember him by i was so fond of him i couldnt forget if i tried i know i ought not to say it but i dont see why god let him die said jack with a quiver in his voice for his loving heart could not help aching still  no dear we cannot see or know many things that grieve us very much but we can trust that it is right and try to believe that all is meant for our good that is what faith means and without it we are miserable when you were little you were afraid of the dark but if i spoke or touched you then you were sure all was well and fell asleep holding my hand god is wiser and stronger than any father or mother so hold fast to him and you will have no doubt or fear however dark it seems  as you do said jack going to sit on the arm of mammas chair with his cheek to hers willing to trust as she bade him but glad to hold fast the living hand that had led and comforted him all his life  ed used to say to me when i fretted about getting well and thought nobody cared for me which was very naughty dont be troubled god wont forget you and if you must be lame he will make you able to bear it said jill softly her quick little mind all alive with new thoughts and feelings  he believed it and thats why he liked that hymn so much im glad they sung it today said frank bringing his heavy dictionary to lay on the book where the flowers were pressing  oh thank you could you play that tune for me i didnt hear it and id love to if you are willing asked jill  i didnt think i ever should want to play again but i do will you sing it for her mother im afraid i shall break down if i try alone  we will all sing music is good for us now said mamma and in rather broken voices they did sing eds favorite words    not a sparrow falleth but its god doth know   just as when his mandate lays a monarch low   not a leaflet moveth but its god doth see   think not then o mortal god forgetteth thee   far more precious surely than the birds that fly   is a fathers image to a fathers eye   een thy hairs are numbered trust him full and free   cast thy cares before him he will comfort thee   for the god that planted in thy breast a soul   on his sacred tables doth thy name enroll   cheer thine heart then mortal never faithless be   he that marks the sparrows will remember thee     chapter xxi pebbly beach   now mr jack it is a moral impossibility to get all those things into one trunk and you mustnt ask it of me said mrs pecq in a tone of despair as she surveyed the heap of treasures she was expected to pack for the boys  never mind the clothes we only want a boatingsuit apiece mamma can put a few collars in her trunk for us but these necessary things must go answered jack adding his target and airpistol to the pile of bats fishingtackle games and a choice collection of shabby balls  those are the necessaries and clothes the luxuries are they why dont you add a velocipede wheelbarrow and printingpress my dear asked mrs pecq while jill turned up her nose at boys rubbish  wish i could dare say we shall want them women dont know what fellows need and always must put in a lot of stiff shirts and clean handkerchiefs and clothesbrushes and pots of cold cream we are going to rough it and dont want any fuss and feathers said jack beginning to pack the precious balls in his rubber boots and strap them up with the umbrellas rods and bats seeing that there was no hope of a place in the trunk  here frank came in with two big books saying calmly just slip these in somewhere we shall need them  but you are not to study at all so you wont want those great dictionaries cried jill busily packing her new travellingbasket with all sorts of little rolls bags and boxes  they are not dics but my encyclopedia we shall want to know heaps of things and this tells about everything with those books and a microscope and a telescope you could travel round the world and learn all you wanted to cant possibly get on without them said frank fondly patting his favorite work  my patience what queer cattle boys are exclaimed mrs pecq while they all laughed it cant be done mr frank all the boxes are brim full and youll have to leave those fat books behind for theres no place anywhere  then ill carry them myself and frank tucked one under each arm with a determined air which settled the matter  i suppose youll study cockleology instead of boating and read up on polywogs while we play tennis or go poking round with your old spyglass instead of having a jolly good time said jack hauling away on the strap till all was taut and shipshape with the bundle  tadpoles dont live in salt water my son and if you mean conchology youd better say so i shall play as much as i wish and when i want to know about any new or curious thing i shall consult my cyclo instead of bothering other people with questions or giving it up like a dunce with which crushing reply frank departed leaving jill to pack and unpack her treasures a dozen times and jack to dance jigs on the lids of the trunks till they would shut  a very happy party set off the next day leaving mrs pecq waving her apron on the steps mrs minot carried the lunch jack his precious bundle with trifles dropping out by the way and jill felt very elegant bearing her new basket with red worsted cherries bobbing on the outside frank actually did take the encyclopedia done up in the roll of shawls and whenever the others wondered about anythingtides lighthouses towns or natural productionshe brought forth one of the books and triumphantly read therefrom to the great merriment if not edification of his party  a very short trip by rail and the rest of the journey by boat to jills great contentment for she hated to be shut up and while the lads roved here and there she sat under the awning too happy to talk but mrs minot watched with real satisfaction how the fresh wind blew the color back into the pale cheeks how the eyes shone and the heart filled with delight at seeing the lovely world again and being able to take a share in its active pleasures  the willows was a long low house close to the beach and as full as a beehive of pleasant people all intent on having a good time a great many children were swarming about and jill found it impossible to sleep after her journey there was such a lively clatter of tongues on the piazzas and so many feet going to and fro in the halls she lay down obediently while mrs minot settled matters in the two airy rooms and gave her some dinner but she kept popping up her head to look out of the window to see what she could see just opposite stood an artists cottage and studio with all manner of charming galleries towers steps and even a sort of drawbridge to pull up when the painter wished to be left in peace he was absent now and the visitors took possession of this fine playplace children were racing up and down the galleries ladies sitting in the tower boys disporting themselves on the roof and young gentlemen preparing for theatricals in the large studio  what fun ill have over there thought jill watching the merry scene with intense interest and wondering if the little girls she saw were as nice as molly and merry  then there were glimpses of the sea beyond the green bank where a path wound along to the beach whence came the cool dash of waves and now and then the glimmer of a passing sail  oh when can i go out it looks so lovely i cant wait long she said looking as eager as a little gull shut up in a cage and pining for its home on the wide ocean  as soon as it is a little cooler dear im getting ready for our trip but we must be careful and not do too much at once slow and sure is our motto answered mrs minot busily collecting the campstools the shawls the aircushions and the big parasols  ill be good only do let me have my sailorhat to wear and my new suit im not a bit tired and i do want to be like other folks right off said jill who had been improving rapidly of late and felt much elated at being able to drive out nearly every day to walk a little and sit up some hours without any pain or fatigue  to gratify her the blue flannel suit with its white trimming was put on and mamma was just buttoning the stout boots when jack thundered at the door and burst in with all sorts of glorious news  do come out mother its perfectly splendid on the beach ive found a nice place for jill to sit and its only a step lots of capital fellows here one has a bicycle and is going to teach us to ride no end of fun up at the hotel and every one seems glad to see us two ladies asked about jill and one of the girls has got some shells all ready for her gerty somebody and her mother is so pretty and jolly i like her ever so much they sit at our table and wally is the boy younger than i am but very pleasant bacon is the fellow in knickerbockers just wish you could see what stout legs hes got cox is the chap for me though we are going fishing tomorrow hes got a sweetlooking mother and a sister for you jill now then do come on ill take the traps  off they went and jill thought that very short walk to the shore the most delightful she ever took for people smiled at the little invalid as she went slowly by leaning on mrs minots arm while jack pranced in front doing the honors as if he owned the whole atlantic a new world opened to her eyes as they came out upon the pebbly beach full of people enjoying their afternoon promenade jill save one rapturous oh and then sat on her stool forgetting everything but the beautiful blue ocean rolling away to meet the sky with nothing to break the wide expanse but a sail here and there a point of rocks on one hand the little pier on the other and white gulls skimming by on their wide wings  while she sat enjoying herself jack showed his mother the place he had found and a very nice one it was just under the green bank lay an old boat propped up with some big stones a willow drooped over it the tide rippled up within a few yards of it and a fine view of the waves could be seen as they dashed over the rocks at the point  isnt it a good cubbyhouse ben cox and i fixed it for jill and she can have it for hers put her cushions and things there on the sand the children have thrown inthat will make it soft then these seats will do for tables and up in the bow im going to have that old rusty tin boiler full of saltwater so she can put seaweed and crabs and all sorts of chaps in it for an aquarium you know explained jack greatly interested in establishing his family comfortably before he left them  there couldnt be a nicer place and it is very kind of you to get it ready spread the shawls and settle jill then you neednt think of us any more but go and scramble with frank i see him over there with his spyglass and some pleasantlooking boys said mamma bustling about in great spirits  so the red cushions were placed the plaids laid and the little workbasket set upon the seat all ready for jill who was charmed with her nest and cuddled down under the big parasol declaring she would keep house there every day  even the old boiler pleased her and jack raced over the beach to begin his search for inhabitants for the new aquarium leaving jill to make friends with some pretty babies digging in the sand while mamma sat on the campstool and talked with a friend from harmony village  it seemed as if there could not be anything more delightful than to lie there lulled by the sound of the sea watching the sunset and listening to the pleasant babble of little voices close by but when they went to tea in the great hall with six tables full of merry people and half a dozen maids flying about jill thought that was even better because it was so new to her gerty and wally nodded to her and their pretty mamma was so kind and so gay that jill could not feel bashful after the first few minutes and soon looked about her sure of seeing friendly faces everywhere frank and jack ate as if the salt air had already improved their appetites and talked about bacon and cox as if they had been bosom friends for years mamma was as happy as they for her friend mrs hammond sat close by and this rosy lady who had been a physician cheered her up by predicting that jill would soon be running about as well as ever  but the best of all was in the evening when the elder people gathered in the parlors and played twenty questions while the children looked on for an hour before going to bed much amused at the sight of grown people laughing squabbling dodging and joking as if they had all become young again for as every one knows it is impossible to help lively skirmishes when that game is played jill lay in the sofa corner enjoying it all immensely for she never saw anything so droll and found it capital fun to help guess the thing or try to puzzle the opposite side her quick wits and bright face attracted people and in the pauses of the sport she held quite a levee for everybody was interested in the little invalid the girls shyly made friends in their own way the mammas told thrilling tales of the accidents their darlings had survived several gentlemen kindly offered their boats and the boys with the best intentions in life suggested strolls of two or three miles to rafes chasm and normans woe or invited her to tennis and archery as if violent exercise was the cure for all human ills she was very grateful and reluctantly went away to bed declaring when she got upstairs that these new friends were the dearest people she ever met and the willows the most delightful place in the whole world  next day a new life began for the young folksa very healthy happy life and all threw themselves into it so heartily that it was impossible to help getting great good from it for these summer weeks if well spent work miracles in tired bodies and souls frank took a fancy to the bicycle boy and being able to hire one of the breakneck articles soon learned to ride it and the two might be seen wildly working their long legs on certain smooth stretches of road or getting up their muscle rowing about the bay till they were almost as brown and nautical in appearance and language as the fishermen who lived in nooks and corners along the shore  jack struck up a great friendship with the sturdy bacon and the agreeable cox the latter being about his own age was his especial favorite and they soon were called box and cox by the other fellows which did not annoy them a bit as both had played parts in that immortal farce they had capital times fishing scrambling over the rocks playing ball and tennis and rainy days they took possession of the studio opposite drew up the portcullis and gallantly defended the castle which some of the others besieged with old umbrellas for shields bats for batteringrams and bunches of burrs for cannonballs great larks went on over there while the girls applauded from the piazza or chamberwindows and made a gay flag for the victors to display from the tower when the fight was over  but jill had the best time of all for each day brought increasing strength and spirits and she improved so fast it was hard to believe that she was the same girl who lay so long almost helpless in the bird room at home such lively letters as she sent her mother all about her new friends her fine sails drives and little walks the good times she had in the evening the lovely things people gave her and she was learning to make with shells and seaweed and what splendid fun it was to keep house in a boat  this last amusement soon grew quite absorbing and her cubby as she called it rapidly became a pretty grotto where she lived like a little mermaid daily loving more and more the beauty of the wonderful sea finding the boat too sunny at times the boys cut long willow boughs and arched them over the seats laying hemlock branches across till a green roof made it cool and shady inside there jill sat or lay among her cushions reading trying to sketch sorting shells drying gay seaweeds or watching her crabs jellyfish and anemones in the old boiler now buried in sand and edged about with moss from the woods  nobody disturbed her treasures but kindly added to them and often when she went to her nest she found fruit or flowers books or bonbons laid ready for her every one pitied and liked the bright little girl who could not run and frisk with the rest who was so patient and cheerful after her long confinement ready to help others and so grateful for any small favor she found now that the weary months had not been wasted and was very happy to discover in herself a new sort of strength and sweetness that was not only a comfort to her but made those about her love and trust her the songs she had learned attracted the babies who would leave their play to peep at her and listen when she sung over her work passersby paused to hear the blithe voice of the bird in the green cage and other invalids strolling on the beach would take heart when they saw the child so happy in spite of her great trial  the boys kept all their marine curiosities for her and were always ready to take her a row or a sail as the bay was safe and that sort of travelling suited her better than driving but the girls had capital times together and it did jill good to see another sort from those she knew at home she had been so much petted of late that she was getting rather vain of her small accomplishments and being with strangers richer better bred and educated than herself made her more humble in some things while it showed her the worth of such virtues as she could honestly claim mamie cox took her to drive in the fine carriage of her mamma and jill was much impressed by the fact that mamie was not a bit proud about it and did not put on any airs though she had a maid to take care of her gerty wore pretty costumes and came down with pink and blue ribbons in her hair that jill envied very much yet gerty liked her curls and longed to have some while her mother the lady from philadelphia as they called her was so kind and gay that jill quite adored her and always felt as if sunshine had come into the room when she entered two little sisters were very interesting to her and made her long for one of her own when she saw them going about together and heard them talk of their pleasant home where the great silk factories were but they invited her to come and see the wonderful cocoons and taught her to knot pretty gray fringe on a cushion which delighted her being so new and easy there were several other nice little lasses and they all gathered about jill with the sweet sympathy children are so quick to show toward those in pain or misfortune she thought they would not care for a poor little girl like herself yet here she was the queen of the troupe and this discovery touched and pleased her very much  in the morning they camped round the boat on the stones with books gay work and merry chatter till bathingtime then the beach was full of life and fun for every one looked so droll in the flannel suits it was hard to believe that the neat ladies and respectable gentlemen who went into the little houses could be the same persons as the queer shortskirted women with old hats tied down and bareheaded barefooted men in old suits who came skipping over the sand to disport themselves in the sea in the most undignified ways the boys raced about looking like circustumblers and the babies were regular little cupids running away from the waves that tried to kiss their flying feet  some of the young ladies and girls were famous swimmers and looked very pretty in their bright red and blue costumes with loose hair and gay stockings as they danced into the water and floated away as fearlessly as real mermaidens jill had her quiet dip and good rubbing each fine day and then lay upon the warm sand watching the pranks of the others and longing to run and dive and shout and tumble with the rest now that she was among the well and active it seemed harder to be patient than when shut up and unable to stir she felt so much better and had so little pain to remind her of past troubles it was almost impossible to help forgetting the poor back and letting her recovered spirits run away with her if mrs minot had not kept good watch she would have been off more than once so eager was she to be like other girls again so difficult was it to keep the restless feet quietly folded among the red cushions  one day she did yield to temptation and took a little voyage which might have been her last owing to the carelessness of those whom she trusted it was a good lesson and made her as meek as a lamb during the rest of her stay mrs minot drove to gloucester one afternoon leaving jill safely established after her nap in the boat with gerty and mamie making lace beside her  dont try to walk or run about my dear sit on the piazza if you get tired of this and amuse yourself quietly till i come back ill not forget the worsted and the canvas said mamma peeping over the bank for a last word as she waited for the omnibus to come along  oh dont forget the gibraltars cried jill popping her head out of the green roof  nor the bananas please added gerty looking round one end  nor the pink and blue ribbon to tie our shellbaskets called mamie nearly tumbling into the aquarium at the other end  mrs minot laughed and promised and rumbled away leaving jill to an experience which she never forgot  for half an hour the little girls worked busily then the boys came for gerty and mamie to go to the chasm with a party of friends who were to leave next day off they went and jill felt very lonely as the gay voices died away every one had gone somewhere and only little harry hammond and his maid were on the beach two or three sandpipers ran about among the pebbles and jill envied them their nimble legs so much that she could not resist getting up to take a few steps she longed to run straight away over the firm smooth sand and feel again the delight of swift motion but she dared not try it and stood leaning on her tall parasol with her book in her hand when frank jack and the bicycle boy came rowing lazily along and hailed her  come for a sail jill take you anywhere you like called jack touched by the lonely figure on the beach  id love to go if you will row mamma made me promise not to go sailing without a man to take care of me would it spoil your fun to have me answered jill eagerly  not a bit come out on the big stones and well take you aboard said frank as they steered to the place where she could embark the easiest  all the rest are gone to the chasm i wanted to go because ive never seen it but of course i had to give it up as i do most of the fun and jill sat down with an impatient sigh  well row you round there cant land but you can see the place and shout to the others if that will be any comfort to you proposed frank as they pulled away round the pier  oh yes that would be lovely and jill smiled at jack who was steering for she found it impossible to be dismal now with the fresh wind blowing in her face the blue waves slapping against the boat and three goodnatured lads ready to gratify her wishes  away they went laughing and talking gayly till they came to goodwins rocks where an unusual number of people were to be seen though the tide was going out and no white spray was dashing high into the air to make a sight worth seeing  what do you suppose they are about never saw such a lot of folks at this time shouldnt wonder if something had happened i say put me ashore and ill cut up and see said the bicycle boy who was of an inquiring turn  ill go with you said frank it wont take but a minute and id like to discover what it is may be something we ought to know about  so the boys pulled round into a quiet nook and the two elder ones scrambled up the rocks to disappear in the crowd five ten fifteen minutes passed and they did not return jack grew impatient so did jill and bade him run up and bring them back glad to know what kept them jack departed to be swallowed up in his turn for not a sign of a boy did she see after that and having vainly strained her eyes to discover the attraction which held them she gave it up lay down on their jackets and began to read  then the treacherous tide as it ebbed lower and lower down the beach began to lure the boat away for it was not fastened and when lightened of its load was an easy prize to the hungry sea always ready to steal all it can jill knew nothing of this for her story was dull the gentle motion proved soothing and before she knew it she was asleep little by little the runaway boat slid farther from the shore and presently was floating out to sea with its drowsy freight while the careless boys unconscious of the time they were wasting lingered to see group after group photographed by the enterprising man who had trundled his camera to the rocks  in the midst of a dream about home jill was roused by a loud shout and starting up so suddenly that the sunumbrella went overboard she found herself sailing off alone while the distracted lads roared and beckoned vainly from the cove the oars lay at their feet where they left them and the poor child was quite helpless for she could not manage the sail and even the parasol with which she might have paddled a little had gone down with all sail set for a minute jill was so frightened that she could only look about her with a scared face and wonder if drowning was a very disagreeable thing then the sight of the bicycle boy struggling with jack who seemed inclined to swim after her and frank shouting wildly hold on come back made her laugh in spite of her fear it was so comical and their distress so much greater than hers since it was their own carelessness which caused the trouble  i cant come back theres nothing to hold on to you didnt fasten me and now i dont know where im going cried jill looking from the shore to the treacherous sea that was gently carrying her away  keep cool well get a boat and come after you roared frank before he followed jack who had collected his wits and was tearing up the rocks like a chamois hunter  the bicycle boy calmly sat down to keep his eye on the runaway calling out from time to time such cheering remarks as all aboard for liverpool give my love to victoria luff and bear away when you come to halifax if you are hard up for provisions youll find an apple and some bait in my coatpocket and other directions for a comfortable voyage till his voice was lost in the distance as a stronger current bore her swiftly away and the big waves began to tumble and splash  at first jill had laughed at his efforts to keep up her spirits but when the boat floated round a point of rock that shut in the cove she felt all alone and sat quite still wondering what would become of her she turned her back to the sea and looked at the dear safe land which never had seemed so green and beautiful before up on the hill rustled the wood through which the happy party were wandering to the chasm on the rocks she still saw the crowd all busy with their own affairs unconscious of her danger here and there artists were sketching in picturesque spots and in one place an old gentleman sat fishing peacefully jill called and waved her handkerchief but he never looked up and an ugly little dog barked at her in what seemed to her a most cruel way  nobody sees or hears or cares and those horrid boys will never catch up she cried in despair as the boat began to rock more and more and the loud swash of water dashing in and out of the chasm drew nearer and nearer holding on now with both hands she turned and looked straight before her pale and shivering while her eyes tried to see some sign of hope among the steep cliffs that rose up on the left no one was there though usually at this hour they were full of visitors and it was time for the walkers to have arrived  i wonder if gerty and mamie will be sorry if im drowned thought jill remembering the poor girl who had been lost in the chasm not long ago her lively fancy pictured the grief of her friends at her loss but that did not help or comfort her now and as her anxious gaze wandered along the shore she said aloud in a pensive tone  perhaps i shall be wrecked on normans woe and somebody will make poetry about me it would be pretty to read but i dont want to die that way oh why did i come why didnt i stay safe and comfortable in my own boat  at the thought a sob rose and poor jill laid her head down on her lap to cry with all her heart feeling very helpless small and forsaken alone there on the great sea in the midst of her tears came the thought when people are in danger they ask god to save them and slipping down upon her knees she said her prayer as she had never said it before for when human help seems gone we turn to him as naturally as lost children cry to their father and feel sure that he will hear and answer them  after that she felt better and wiped away the drops that blinded her to look out again like a shipwrecked mariner watching for a sail and there it was close by coming swiftly on with a man behind it a sturdy brown fisher busy with his lobsterpots and quite unconscious how like an angel he looked to the helpless little girl in the rudderless boat  hi hi oh please do stop and get me im lost no oars nobody to fix the sail oh oh please come screamed jill waving her hat frantically as the other boat skimmed by and the man stared at her as if she really was a mermaid with a fishy tail  keep still ill come about and fetch you he called out and jill obeyed sitting like a little image of faith till with a good deal of shifting and flapping of the sail the other boat came alongside and took her in tow  a few words told the story and in five minutes she was sitting snugly tucked up watching an unpleasant mass of lobsters flap about dangerously near her toes while the boat bounded over the waves with a delightful motion and every instant brought her nearer home she did not say much but felt a good deal and when they met two boats coming to meet her manned by very anxious crews of men and boys she was so pale and quiet that jack was quite bowed down with remorse and frank nearly pitched the bicycle boy overboard because he gayly asked jill how she left her friends in england there was great rejoicing over her for the people on the rocks had heard of her loss and ran about like ants when their hill is disturbed of course half a dozen amiable souls posted off to the willows to tell the family that the little girl was drowned so that when the rescuers appeared quite a crowd was assembled on the beach to welcome her but jill felt so used up with her own share of the excitement that she was glad to be carried to the house by frank and jack and laid upon her bed where mrs hammond soon restored her with sugarcoated pills and words even sweeter and more soothing  other people busied with their own pleasures forgot all about it by the next day but jill remembered that hour long afterward both awake and asleep for her dreams were troubled and she often started up imploring someone to save her then she would recall the moment when feeling most helpless she had asked for help and it had come as quickly as if that tearful little cry had been heard and answered though her voice had been drowned by the dash of the waves that seemed ready to devour her this made a deep impression on her and a sense of childlike faith in the father of all began to grow up within her for in that lonely voyage short as it was she had found a very precious treasure to keep for ever to lean on and to love during the longer voyage which all must take before we reach our home     chapter xxii a happy day   oh dear only a week more and then we must go back dont you hate the thoughts of it said jack as he was giving jill her early walk on the beach one august morning  yes it will be dreadful to leave gerty and mamie and all the nice people but im so much better i wont have to be shut up again even if i dont go to school how i long to see merry and molly dear things if it wasnt for them i should hate going home more than you do answered jill stepping along quite briskly and finding it very hard to resist breaking into a skip or a run she felt so well and gay  wish they could be here today to see the fun said jack for it was the anniversary of the founding of the place and the people celebrated it by all sorts of festivity  i did want to ask molly but your mother is so good to me i couldnt find courage to do it mammy told me not to ask for a thing and im sure i dont get a chance i feel just as if i was your truly born sister jack  thats all right im glad you do answered jack comfortably though his mind seemed a little absent and his eyes twinkled when she spoke of molly now you sit in the cubbyhouse and keep quiet till the boat comes in then the fun will begin and you must be fresh and ready to enjoy it dont run off now i shall want to know where to find you by and by  no more running off thank you ill stay here till you come and finish this box for molly she has a birthday this week and ive written to ask what day so i can send it right up and surprise her  jacks eyes twinkled more than ever as he helped jill settle herself in the boat and then with a whoop he tore over the beach as if practising for the race which was to come off in the afternoon  jill was so busy with her work that time went quickly and the early boat came in just as the last pink shell was stuck in its place putting the box in the sun to dry she leaned out of her nook to watch the gay parties land and go streaming up the pier along the road that went behind the bank that sheltered her flocks of children were running about on the sand and presently strangers appeared eager to see and enjoy all the delights of this galaday  theres a fat little boy who looks ever so much like boo said jill to herself watching the people and hoping they would not come and find her since she had promised to stay till jack returned  the fat little boy was staring about him in a blissful sort of maze holding a wooden shovel in one hand and the skirts of a young girl with the other her back was turned to jill but something in the long brown braid with a flyaway blue bow hanging down her back looked very familiar to jill so did the gray suit and the japanese umbrella but the hat was strange and while she was thinking how natural the boots looked the girl turned round  why how much she looks like molly it cant beyes it might i do believe it is cried jill starting up and hardly daring to trust her own eyes  as she came out of her nest and showed herself there could be no doubt about the other girl for she gave one shout and came racing over the beach with both arms out while her hat blew off unheeded and the gay umbrella flew away to the great delight of all the little people except boo who was upset by his sisters impetuous rush and lay upon his back howling molly did not do all the running though and jill got her wish for never stopping to think of herself she was off at once and met her friend halfway with an answering cry it was a pretty sight to see them run into one anothers arms and hug and kiss and talk and skip in such a state of girlish joy they never cared who saw or laughed at their innocent raptures  you darling dear where did you come from cried jill holding molly by both shoulders and shaking her a little to be sure she was real  mrs minot sent for us to spend a week you look so well i cant believe my eyes answered molly patting jills cheeks and kissing them over and over as if to make sure the bright color would not come off  a week how splendid oh ive such heaps to tell and show you come right over to my cubby and see how lovely it is said jill forgetting everybody else in her delight at getting molly  i must get poor boo and my hat and umbrella i left them all behind me when i saw you laughed molly looking back  but mrs minot and jack had consoled boo and collected the scattered property so the girls went on arm in arm and had a fine time before any one had the heart to disturb them molly was charmed with the boat and jill very glad the box was done in season both had so much to tell and hear and plan that they would have sat there for ever if bathingtime had not come and the beach suddenly looked like a bed of red and yellow tulips for every one took a dip and the strangers added much to the fun  molly could swim like a duck and quite covered herself with glory by diving off the pier jack undertook to teach boo who was a promising pupil being so plump that he could not sink if he tried jill was soon through and lay on the sand enjoying the antics of the bathers till she was so faint with laughter she was glad to hear the dinnerhorn and do the honors of the willows to molly whose room was next hers  boatraces came first in the afternoon and the girls watched them sitting luxuriously in the nest with the ladies and children close by the sailingmatches were very pretty to see but molly and jill were more interested in the rowing for frank and the bicycle boy pulled one boat and the friends felt that this one must win it did though the race was not very exciting nor the prize of great worth but the boys and girls were satisfied and jack was much exalted for he always told frank he could do great things if he would only drop books and go in on his muscle  footraces followed and burning to distinguish himself also jack insisted on trying though his mother warned him that the weak leg might be harmed and he had his own doubts about it as he was all out of practice however he took his place with a handkerchief tied round his head red shirt and stockings and his sleeves rolled up as if he meant business jill and molly could not sit still during this race and stood on the bank quite trembling with excitement as the halfdozen runners stood in a line at the startingpost waiting for the word go  off they went at last over the smooth beach to the pole with the flag at the further end and every one watched them with mingled interest and merriment for they were a droll set and the running not at all scientific with most of them one young fisherman with big boots over his trousers started off at a great pace pounding along in the most dogged way while a little chap in a tight bathingsuit with very thin legs skimmed by him looking so like a sandpiper it was impossible to help laughing at both jacks former training stood him in good stead now for he went to work in professional style and kept a steady trot till the flagpole had been passed then he put on his speed and shot ahead of all the rest several of whom broke down and gave up but cox and bacon held on gallantly and soon it was evident that the sturdy legs in the knickerbockers were gaining fast for jack gave his ankle an ugly wrench on a round pebble and the weak knee began to fail he did his best however and quite a breeze of enthusiasm stirred the spectators as the three boys came down the course like mettlesome horses panting pale or purple but each bound to win at any cost  now bacon go it minot hit him up cox jacks ahead no he isnt here they come bacons done it shouted the other boys and they were right bacon had won for the gray legs came in just half a yard ahead of the red ones and minot tumbled into his brothers arms with hardly breath enough left to gasp out goodhumoredly all right im glad he beat  then the victor was congratulated and borne off by his friends to refresh himself while the lookerson scattered to see a game of tennis and the shooting of the archery club up at the hotel jack was soon rested and making light of his defeat insisted on taking the girls to see the fun so they drove up in the old omnibus and enjoyed the pretty sight very much for the young ladies were in uniform and the broad green ribbons over the white dresses the gay quivers long bows and big targets made a lively scene the shooting was good a handsome damsel got the prize of a dozen arrows and every one clapped in the most enthusiastic manner  molly and jill did not care about tennis so they went home to rest and dress for the evening because to their minds the dancing the illumination and the fireworks were the best fun of all jills white bunting with cherry ribbons was very becoming and the lively feet in the new slippers patted the floor impatiently as the sound of dance music came down to the willows after tea and the other girls waltzed on the wide piazza because they could not keep still  no dancing for me but molly must have a good time youll see that she does wont you boys said jill who knew that her share of the fun would be lying on a settee and watching the rest enjoy her favorite pastime  frank and jack promised and kept their word handsomely for there was plenty of room in the great dancinghall at the hotel and the band in the pavilion played such inspiring music that as the bicycle boy said every one who had a leg couldnt help shaking it molly was twirled about to her hearts content and flew hither and thither like a blue butterfly for all the lads liked her and she kept running up to tell jill the funny things they said and did  as night darkened from all the houses in the valley on the cliffs and along the shore lights shone and sparkled for every one decorated with gay lanterns and several yachts in the bay strung colored lamps about the little vessels making a pretty picture on the quiet sea jill thought she had never seen anything so like fairyland and felt very like one in a dream as she drove slowly up and down with mamie gerty molly and mrs cox in the carriage so that she might see it all without too much fatigue it was very lovely and when rockets began to whizz filling the air with golden rain a shower of colored stars fiery dragons or glittering wheels the girls could only shriek with delight and beg to stay a little longer each time the prudent lady proposed going home  it had to be at last but molly and jill comforted themselves by a long talk in bed for it was impossible to sleep with glares of light coming every few minutes flocks of people talking and tramping by in the road and bursts of music floating down to them as the older but not wiser revellers kept up the merriment till a late hour they dropped off at last but jill had the nightmare and molly was waked up by a violent jerking of her braid as jill tried to tow her along dreaming she was a boat  they were too sleepy to laugh much then but next morning they made merry over it and went to breakfast with such happy faces that all the young folks pronounced jills friend a most delightful girl what a good time molly did have that week other people were going to leave also and therefore much picnicking boating and driving was crowded into the last days clambakes on the shore charades in the studio sewingparties at the boat evening frolics in the big diningroom farewell calls gifts and invitations all sorts of plans for next summer and vows of eternal friendship exchanged between people who would soon forget each other it was very pleasant till poor boo innocently added to the excitement by poisoning a few of his neighbors with a bad lobster  the ambitious little soul pined to catch one of these mysterious but lovely red creatures and spent days fishing on the beach investigating holes and corners and tagging after the old man who supplied the house one day after a high wind he found several lobs washed up on the beach and though disappointed at their color he picked out a big one and set off to show his prize to molly halfway home he met the old man on his way with a basket of fish and being tired of lugging his contribution laid it with the others meaning to explain later no one saw him do it as the old man was busy with his pipe and boo ran back to get more dear lobs leaving his treasure to go into the kettle and appear at supper by which time he had forgotten all about it  fortunately none of the children ate any but several older people were made ill and quite a panic prevailed that night as one after the other called up the doctor who was boarding close by and good mrs grey the hostess ran about with hot flannels bottles of medicine and distracted messages from room to room all were comfortable by morning but the friends of the sufferers lay in wait for the old fisherman and gave him a good scolding for his carelessness the poor man was protesting his innocence when boo who was passing by looked into the basket and asked what had become of his lob a few questions brought the truth to light and a general laugh put every one in good humor when poor boo mildly said by way of explanation  i fought i was helpin mrs dray and i did want to see the dreen lob come out all red when she boiled him but i fordot and i dont fink ill ever find such a nice big one any more  for our sakes i hope you wont my dear said mrs hammond who had been nursing one of the sufferers  its lucky we are going home tomorrow or that child would be the death of himself and everybody else he is perfectly crazy about fish and ive pulled him out of that old lobsterpot on the beach a dozen times groaned molly much afflicted by the mishaps of her young charge  there was a great breaking up next day and the old omnibus went off to the station with bacon hanging on behind the bicycle boy and his iron whirligig atop and heads popping out of all the windows for last goodbyes our party and the hammonds were going by boat and were all ready to start for the pier when boo and little harry were missing molly the maid and both boys ran different ways to find them and all sorts of dreadful suggestions were being made when shouts of laughter were heard from the beach and the truants appeared proudly dragging in harrys little wagon a dead devilfish as the natives call that ugly thing which looks like a magnified tadpoleall head and no body  weve dot him called the innocents tugging up their prize with such solemn satisfaction it was impossible to help laughing  i always wanted to tatch a whale and this is a baby one i fink a boy said when they wanted to die they comed on the sand and did it and we saw this one go dead just now aint he pretty asked boo displaying the immense mouth with fond pride while his friend flapped the tail  what are you going to do with him said mrs hammond regarding her infant as if she often asked herself the same question about her boy  wap him up in a paper and tate him home to pay wid answered harry with such confidence in his big blue eyes that it was very hard to disappoint his hopes and tell him the treasure must be left behind  wails of despair burst from both children as the hardhearted boys tipped out the little whale and hustled the indignant fishermen on board the boat which had been whistling for them impatiently boo recovered his spirits first and gulping down a sob that nearly shook his hat off consoled his companion in affliction and convulsed his friends by taking from his pocket several little crabs the remains of a jellyfish and such a collection of pebbles that frank understood why he found the fat boy such a burden when he shouldered him kicking and howling in the late run to the boat these delicate toys healed the wounds of boo and harry and they were soon happily walking the little trabs about inside a stone wall of their own building while the others rested after their exertions and laid plans for coming to the willows another year as people usually did who had once tasted the wholesome delights and cordial hospitality of this charming place     chapter xxiii cattle show   the children were not the only ones who had learned something at pebbly beach mrs minot had talked a good deal with some very superior persons and received light upon various subjects which had much interested or perplexed her while the ladies worked or walked together they naturally spoke oftenest and most earnestly about their children and each contributed her experience mrs hammond who had been a physician for many years was wise in the care of healthy little bodies and the cure of sick ones mrs channing who had read travelled and observed much in the cause of education had many useful hints about the training of young minds and hearts several teachers reported their trials and all the mothers were eager to know how to bring up their boys and girls to be healthy happy useful men and women  as young people do not care for such discussions we will not describe them but as the impression they made upon one of the mammas affected our hero and heroine we must mention the changes which took place in their life when they all got home again  school begins tomorrow oh dear sighed jack as he looked up his books in the bird room a day or two after their return  dont you want to go i long to but dont believe i shall i saw our mothers talking to the doctor last night but i havent dared to ask what they decided said jill affectionately eying the longunused books in her little library  ive had such a jolly good time that i hate to be shut up all day worse than ever dont you frank asked jack with a vengeful slap at the arithmetic which was the torment of his life  well i confess i dont hanker for school as much as i expected id rather take a spin on the old bicycle our roads are so good it is a great temptation to hire a machine and astonish the natives thats what comes of idleness so brace up my boy and go to work for vacation is over answered frank gravely regarding the tall pile of books before him as if trying to welcome his old friends or tyrants rather for they ruled him with a rod of iron when he once gave himself up to them  ah but vacation is not over my dears said mrs minot hearing the last words as she came in prepared to surprise her family  glad of it how much longer is it to be asked jack hoping for a week at least  two or three years for some of you  what cried all three in utter astonishment as they stared at mamma who could not help smiling though she was very much in earnest  for the next two or three years i intend to cultivate my boys bodies and let their minds rest a good deal from books at least there is plenty to learn outside of schoolhouses and i dont mean to shut you up just when you most need all the air and exercise you can get good health good principles and a good education are the three blessings i ask for you and i am going to make sure of the first as a firm foundation for the other two  but mother what becomes of college asked frank rather disturbed at this change of base  put it off for a year and see if you are not better fitted for it then than now  but i am already fitted ive worked like a tiger all this year and im sure i shall pass  ready in one way but not in another that hard work is no preparation for four years of still harder study it has cost you these round shoulders many a headache and consumed hours when you had far better have been on the river or in the fields i cannot have you break down as so many boys do or pull through at the cost of illhealth afterward eighteen is young enough to begin the steady grind if you have a strong constitution to keep pace with the eager mind sixteen is too young to send even my good boy out into the world just when he most needs his mothers care to help him be the man she hopes to see him  mrs minot laid her hand on his shoulder as she spoke looking so fond and proud that it was impossible to rebel though some of his most cherished plans were spoilt  other fellows go at my age and i was rather pleased to be ready at sixteen he began but she added quickly  they go but how do they come out many lose health of body and many what is more precious still moral strength because too young and ignorant to withstand temptations of all sorts the best part of education does not come from books and the good principles i value more than either of the other things are to be carefully watched over till firmly fixed then you may face the world and come to no real harm trust me dear i do it for your sake so bear the disappointment bravely and in the end i think you will say im right  ill do my best but i dont see what is to become of us if we dont go to school you will get tired of it first said frank trying to set a good example to the others who were looking much impressed and interested  no danger of that for i never sent my children to school to get rid of them and now that they are old enough to be companions i want them at home more than ever there are to be some lessons however for busy minds must be fed but not crammed so you boys will go and recite at certain hours such things as seem most important but there is to be no studying at night no shutting up all the best hours of the day no hurry and fret of getting on fast or skimming over the surface of many studies without learning any thoroughly  so i say cried jack pleased with the new idea for he never did love books i do hate to be driven so i dont half understand because there is no time to have things explained school is good fun as far as play goes but i dont see the sense of making a fellow learn eighty questions in geography one day and forget them the next  what is to become of me please asked jill meekly  you and molly are to have lessons here i was a teacher when i was young you know and liked it so i shall be schoolmaam and leave my housekeeping in better hands than mine i always thought that mothers should teach their girls during these years and vary their studies to suit the growing creatures as only mothers can  that will be splendid will mollys father let her come cried jill feeling quite reconciled to staying at home if her friend was to be with her  he likes the plan very much for molly is growing fast and needs a sort of care that miss dawes cannot give her i am not a hard mistress and i hope you will find my school a pleasant one  i know i shall and im not disappointed because i was pretty sure i couldnt go to the old school again when i heard the doctor say i must be very careful for a long time i thought he meant months but if it must be years i can bear it for ive been happy this last one though i was sick said jill glad to show that it had not been wasted time by being cheerful and patient now  thats my good girl and mrs minot stroked the curly black head as if it was her own little daughters you have done so well i want you to go on improving for care now will save you pain and disappointment by and by you all have got a capital start during these six weeks so it is a good time to begin my experiment if it does not work well we will go back to school and college next spring  hurrah for mamma and the long vacation cried jack catching up two big books and whirling them round like clubs as if to get his muscles in order at once  now i shall have time to go to the gymnasium and straighten out my back said frank who was growing so tall he needed more breadth to make his height symmetrical  and to ride horseback i am going to hire old jane and get out the little phaeton so we can all enjoy the fine weather while it lasts molly and i can drive jill and you can take turns in the saddle when you are tired of ball and boating exercise of all sorts is one of the lessons we are to learn said mrs minot suggesting all the pleasant things she could to sweeten the pill for her pupils two of whom did love their books not being old enough to know that even an excellent thing may be overdone  wont that be gay ill get down the saddle today so we can begin right off lem rides and we can go together hope old jane will like it as well as i shall said jack who had found a new friend in a pleasant lad lately come to town  you must see that she does for you boys are to take care of her we will put the barn in order and you can decide which shall be hostler and which gardener for i dont intend to hire labor on the place any more our estate is not a large one and it will be excellent work for you my men  all right ill see to jane i love horses said jack well pleased with the prospect  my horse wont need much care i prefer a bicycle to a beast so ill get in the squashes pick the apples and cover the strawberry bed when it is time added frank who had enjoyed the free life at pebbly beach so much that he was willing to prolong it  you may put me in a hencoop and keep me there a year if you like i wont fret for im sure you know what is best for me said jill gayly as she looked up at the good friend who had done so much for her  im not sure that i wont put you in a pretty cage and send you to cattle show as a sample of what we can do in the way of taming a wild bird till it is nearly as meek as a dove answered mrs minot much gratified at the amiability of her flock  i dont see why there should not be an exhibition of children and prizes for the good and pretty ones as well as for fat pigs fine horses or handsome fruit and flowersi dont mean a baby show but boys and girls so people can see what the prospect is of a good crop for the next generation said frank glancing toward the tower of the building where the yearly agricultural fair was soon to be held  years ago there was a pretty custom here of collecting all the schools together in the spring and having a festival at the town hall each school showed its best pupils and the parents looked on at the blooming flower show it was a pity it was ever given up for the schools have never been so good as then nor the interest in them so great and mrs minot wondered as many people do why farmers seem to care more for their cattle and crops than for their children willingly spending large sums on big barns and costly experiments while the schoolhouses are shabby and inconvenient and the cheapest teachers preferred  ralph is going to send my bust he asked if he might and mother said yes mr german thinks it very good and i hope other people will said jill nodding toward the little plaster head that smiled down from its bracket with her own merry look  i could send my model it is nearly done ralph told me it was a clever piece of work and he knows added frank quite taken with the idea of exhibiting his skill in mechanics  and i could send my star bedquilt they always have things of that kind at cattle show and jill began to rummage in the closet for the pride of her heart burning to display it to an admiring world  i havent got anything cant sew rags together or make baby engines and i have no livestockyes i have too theres old bun ill send him for the fun of it he really is a curiosity for he is the biggest one i ever saw and hopping into the lime has made his fur such a queer color he looks like a new sort of rabbit ill catch and shut him up before he gets wild again and off rushed jack to lure unsuspecting old bun who had grown tame during their absence into the cage which he detested  they all laughed at his ardor but the fancy pleased them and as mamma saw no reason why their little works of art should not be sent frank fell to work on his model and jill resolved to finish her quilt at once while mrs minot went off to see mr acton about the hours and studies for the boys  in a week or two the young people were almost resigned to the loss of school for they found themselves delightfully fresh for the few lessons they did have and not weary of play since it took many useful forms old jane not only carried them all to ride but gave jack plenty of work keeping her premises in nice order frank mourned privately over the delay of college but found a solace in his whirligig and the gymnasium where he set himself to developing a chest to match the big head above which head no longer ached with eight or ten hours of study harvesting beans and raking up leaves seemed to have a soothing effect upon his nerves for now he fell asleep at once instead of thumping his pillow with vexation because his brain would go on working at difficult problems and passages when he wanted it to stop  jill and molly drove away in the little phaeton every fair morning over the sunny hills and through the changing woods filling their hands with asters and goldenrod their lungs with the pure invigorating air and their heads with all manner of sweet and happy fancies and feelings born of the wholesome influences about them people shook their heads and said it was wasting time but the rosyfaced girls were content to trust those wiser than themselves and found their new school very pleasant they read aloud a good deal rapidly acquiring one of the rarest and most beautiful accomplishments for they could stop and ask questions as they went along so that they understood what they read which is half the secret a thousand things came up as they sewed together in the afternoon and the eager minds received much general information in an easy and wellordered way physiology was one of the favorite studies and mrs hammond often came in to give them a little lecture teaching them to understand the wonders of their own systems and how to keep them in ordera lesson of far more importance just then than greek or latin for girls are the future mothers nurses teachers of the race and should feel how much depends on them merry could not resist the attractions of the friendly circle and soon persuaded her mother to let her do as they did so she got more exercise and less study which was just what the delicate girl needed  the first of the new ideas seemed to prosper and the second though suggested in joke was carried out in earnest for the other young people were seized with a strong desire to send something to the fair in fact all sorts of queer articles were proposed and much fun prevailed especially among the boys who ransacked their gardens for mammoth vegetables sighed for fivelegged calves blue roses or any other natural curiosity by means of which they might distinguish themselves ralph was the only one who had anything really worth sending for though franks model seemed quite perfect it obstinately refused to go and at the last moment blew up with a report like a popgun so it was laid away for repairs and its disappointed maker devoted his energies to helping jack keep bun in order for that indomitable animal got out of every prison they put him in and led jack a dreadful life during that last week at all hours of the day and night that distracted boy would start up crying there he is again and dart out to give chase and capture the villain now grown too fat to run as he once did  the very night before the fair frank was wakened by a chilly draught and getting up to see where it came from found jacks door open and bed empty while the vision of a white ghost flitting about the garden suggested a midnight rush after old bun frank watched laughingly till poor jack came toward the house with the gentleman in gray kicking lustily in his arms and then whispered in a sepulchral tone  put him in the old refrigerator he cant get out of that  blessing him for the suggestion the exhausted hunter shut up his victim in the new cell and found it a safe one for bun could not burrow through a sheet of zinc or climb up the smooth walls  jills quilt was a very elaborate piece of work being bright blue with little white stars all over it this she finished nicely and felt sure no patient old lady could outdo it merry decided to send butter for she had been helping her mother in the dairy that summer and rather liked the light part of the labor she knew it would please her very much if she chose that instead of wild flowers so she practised moulding the yellow pats into pretty shapes that it might please both eye and taste  molly declared she would have a little pen and put boo in it as the prize fat boya threat which so alarmed the innocent that he ran away and was found two or three miles from home asleep under the wall with two seedcakes and a pair of socks done up in a bundle being with difficulty convinced that it was a joke he consented to return to his family but was evidently suspicious till molly decided to send her cats and set about preparing them for exhibition the minots deserted bunnyhouse was rather large but as cats cannot be packed as closely as muchenduring sheep molly borrowed this desirable family mansion and put her darlings into it where they soon settled down and appeared to enjoy their new residence it had been scrubbed up and painted red cushions and plates put in and two american flags adorned the roof being barred all round a fine view of the happy family could be had now twelve in number as molasses had lately added three white kits to the varied collection  the girls thought this would be the most interesting spectacle of all and grif proposed to give some of the cats extra tails to increase their charms especially poor mortification who would appreciate the honor of two after having none for so long but molly declined and grif looked about him for some attractive animal to exhibit so that he too might go in free and come to honor perhaps  a young lady in the town owned a donkey a small gray beast who insisted on tripping along the sidewalks and bumping her rider against the walls as she paused to browse at her own sweet will regardless of blows or cries till ready to move on expressing great admiration for this rare animal grif obtained leave to display the charms of graciosa at the fair little did she guess the dark designs entertained against her dignity and happily she was not as sensitive to ridicule as a less humbleminded animal so she went willingly with her new friend and enjoyed the combing and trimming up which she received at his hands while he prepared for the great occasion  when the morning of september 28th arrived the town was all astir and the fair ground a lively scene the air was full of the lowing of cattle the tramp of horses squealing of indignant pigs and clatter of tongues as people and animals streamed in at the great gate and found their proper places our young folks were in a high state of excitement as they rumbled away with their treasures in a haycart the bunnyhouse might have been a cage of tigers so rampant were the cats at this new move old bun in a small box brooded over the insult of the refrigerator and looked as fierce as a rabbit could gus had a coop of rare fowls who clucked wildly all the way while ralph with the bust in his arms stood up in front and jill and molly bore the precious bedquilt as they sat behind  these objects of interest were soon arranged and the girls went to admire merrys golden butter cups among the green leaves under which lay the ice that kept the pretty flowers fresh the boys were down below where the cackling was very loud but not loud enough to drown the sonorous bray which suddenly startled them as much as it did the horses outside a shout of laughter followed and away went the lads to see what the fun was while the girls ran out on the balcony as someone said its that rogue of a grif with some new joke  it certainly was and to judge from the peals of merriment the joke was a good one in at the gate came a twoheaded donkey ridden by grif in great spirits at his success for the gatekeeper laughed so he never thought to ask for toll a train of boys followed him across the ground lost in admiration of the animal and the cleverness of her rider among the stage properties of the dramatic club was the old asss head once used in some tableaux from midsummer nights dream this grif had mended up and fastened by means of straps and a collar to poor graciosas neck hiding his work with a red cloth over her back one eye was gone but the other still opened and shut and the long ears wagged by means of strings which he slyly managed with the bridle so the artificial head looked almost as natural as the real one the funniest thing of all was the innocent air of graciosa and the mildly inquiring expression with which she now and then turned to look at or to smell of the new ornament as if she recognized a friends face yet was perplexed by its want of animation she vented her feelings in a bray which grif imitated convulsing all hearers by the sound as well as by the wink the one eye gave and the droll waggle of one erect ear while the other pointed straight forward  the girls laughed so at the ridiculous sight that they nearly fell over the railing and the boys were in ecstasies especially when grif emboldened by his success trotted briskly round the racecourse followed by the cheers of the crowd excited by the noise graciosa did her best till the false head loosened by the rapid motion slipped round under her nose causing her to stop so suddenly that grif flew off alighting on his own head with a violence which would have killed any other boy sobered by his downfall he declined to mount again but led his steed to repose in a shed while he rejoined his friends who were waiting impatiently to congratulate him on his latest and best prank  the committee went their rounds soon after and when the doors were again opened every one hurried to see if their articles had received a premium a card lay on the butter cups and mrs grant was full of pride because her butter always took a prize and this proved that merry was walking in her mothers steps in this direction at least another card swung from the blue quilt for the kindly judges knew who made it and were glad to please the little girl though several others as curious but not so pretty hung near by the cats were admired but as they were not among the animals usually exhibited there was no prize awarded gus hoped his hens would get one but somebody else outdid him to the great indignation of laura and lotty who had fed the white biddies faithfully for months jack was sure his rabbit was the biggest there and went eagerly to look for his premium but neither card nor bun were to be seen for the old rascal had escaped for the last time and was never seen again which was a great comfort to jack who was heartily tired of him  ralphs bust was the best of all for not only did it get a prize and was much admired but a lady who found jill and merry rejoicing over it was so pleased with the truth and grace of the little head that she asked about the artist and whether he would do one of her own child who was so delicate she feared he might not live long  merry gladly told the story of her ambitious friend and went to find him that he might secure the order while she was gone jill took up the tale gratefully telling how kind he had been to her how patiently he worked and waited and how much he longed to go abroad fortunately the lady was rich and generous as well as fond of art and being pleased with the bust and interested in the young sculptor gave him the order when he came and filled his soul with joy by adding that if it suited her when done it should be put into marble she lived in the city and ralph soon arranged his work so that he could give up his noon hour and go to model the child for every penny he could earn or save now was very precious as he still hoped to go abroad  the girls were so delighted with this good fortune that they did not stay for the races but went home to tell the happy news leaving the boys to care for the cats and enjoy the various matches to come off that day  im so glad i tried to look pleasant when i was lying on the board while ralph did my head for the pleasantness got into the clay face and that made the lady like it said jill as she lay resting on the sofa  i always thought it was a dear bright little face but now i love and admire it more than ever cried merry kissing it gratefully as she remembered the help and pleasure it had given ralph     chapter xxiv down the river   a fortnight later the boys were picking apples one golden october afternoon and the girls were hurrying to finish their work that they might go and help the harvesters it was six weeks now since the new school began and they had learned to like it very much though they found that it was not all play by any means but lessons exercise and various sorts of housework made an agreeable change and they felt that they were learning things which would be useful to them all their lives they had been making underclothes for themselves and each had several neatly finished garments cut fitted and sewed by herself and trimmed with the pretty tatting jill made in such quantities while she lay on her sofa  now they were completing new dressing sacks and had enjoyed this job very much as each chose her own material and suited her own taste in the making jills was white with tiny scarlet leaves all over it trimmed with red braid and buttons so like checkerberries she was tempted to eat them mollys was gay with bouquets of every sort of flower scalloped all round and adorned with six buttons each of a different color which she thought the last touch of elegance merrys though the simplest was the daintiest of the three being pale blue trimmed with delicate edging and beautifully made  mrs minot had been reading from miss stricklands queens of england while the girls worked and an illustrated shakspeare lay open on the table as well as several fine photographs of historical places for them to look at as they went along the hour was over now the teacher gone and the pupils setting the last stitches as they talked over the lesson which had interested them exceedingly  i really believe i have got henrys six wives into my head right at last two annes three katherines and one jane now ive seen where they lived and heard their stories i quite feel as if i knew them said merry shaking the threads off her work before she folded it up to carry home    king henry the eighth to six spouses was wedded   one died one survived two divorced two beheaded  was all i knew about them before poor things what a bad time they did have added jill patting down the red braid which would pucker a bit at the corners  katherine parr had the best of it because she outlived the old tyrant and so kept her head on said molly winding the thread round her last button as if bound to fasten it on so firmly that nothing should decapitate that  i used to think id like to be a queen or a great lady and wear velvet and jewels and live in a palace but now i dont care much for that sort of splendor i like to make things pretty at home and know that they all depend on me and love me very much queens are not happy and i am said merry pausing to look at anne hathaways cottage as she put up the picture and to wonder if it was very pleasant to have a famous man for ones husband  i guess your missionarying has done you good mine has and im getting to have things my own way more and more every day miss bat is so amiable i hardly know her and father tells her to ask miss molly when she goes to him for orders isnt that fun laughed molly in high glee at the agreeable change i like it ever so much but i dont want to stay so all my days i mean to travel and just as soon as i can i shall take boo and go all round the world and see everything she added waving her gay sack as if it were the flag she was about to nail to the masthead of her ship  well i should like to be famous in some way and have people admire me very much id like to act or dance or sing or be what i heard the ladies at pebbly beach call a queen of society but i dont expect to be anything and im not going to worry i shall not be a lucinda so i ought to be contented and happy all my life said jill who was very ambitious in spite of the newly acquired meekness which was all the more becoming because her natural liveliness often broke out like sunshine through a veil of light clouds  if the three girls could have looked forward ten years they would have been surprised to see how different a fate was theirs from the one each had chosen and how happy each was in the place she was called to fill merry was not making the old farmhouse pretty but living in italy with a young sculptor for her husband and beauty such as she never dreamed of all about her molly was not travelling round the world but contentedly keeping house for her father and still watching over boo who was becoming her pride and joy as well as care neither was jill a famous woman but a very happy and useful one with the two mothers leaning on her as they grew old the young men better for her influence over them many friends to love and honor her and a charming home where she was queen by right of her cheery spirit grateful heart and unfailing devotion to those who had made her what she was  if any curious reader not content with this peep into futurity asks did molly and jill ever marry we must reply for the sake of peacemolly remained a merry spinster all her days one of the independent brave and busy creatures of whom there is such need in the world to help take care of other peoples wives and children and do the many useful jobs that the married folk have no time for jill certainly did wear a white veil on the day she was twentyfive and called her husband jack further than that we cannot go except to say that this leap did not end in a catastrophe like the first one they took together  that day however they never dreamed of what was in store for them but chattered away as they cleared up the room and then ran off ready for play feeling that they had earned it by work well done they found the lads just finishing with boo to help by picking up the windfalls for the ciderheap after he had amused himself by putting about a bushel down the various holes old bun had left behind him jack was risking his neck climbing in the most dangerous places while frank with a longhandled applepicker nipped off the finest fruit with care both enjoying the pleasant task and feeling proud of the handsome red and yellow piles all about the little orchard merry and molly caught up baskets and fell to work with all their might leaving jill to sit upon a stool and sort the early apples ready to use at once looking up now and then to nod and smile at her mother who watched her from the window rejoicing to see her lass so well and happy  it was such a lovely day they all felt its cheerful influence for the sun shone bright and warm the air was full of an invigorating freshness which soon made the girls faces look like rosy apples and their spirits as gay as if they had been stealing sips of new cider through a straw jack whistled like a blackbird as he swung and bumped about frank orated and joked merry and molly ran races to see who would fill and empty fastest and jill sung to boo who reposed in a barrel exhausted with his labors  these are the last of the pleasant days and we ought to make the most of them lets have one more picnic before the frost spoils the leaves said merry resting a minute at the gate to look down the street which was a glorified sort of avenue with brilliant maples lining the way and carpeting the ground with crimson and gold  oh yes go down the river once more and have supper on the island i couldnt go to some of your picnics and i do long for a last good time before winter shuts me up again cried jill eager to harvest all the sunshine she could for she was not yet quite her old self again  im your man if the other fellows agree we cant barrel these up for a while so tomorrow will be a holiday for us better make sure of the day while you can this weather cant last long and frank shook his head like one on intimate terms with old prob  dont worry about those high ones jack give a shake and come down and plan about the party called molly throwing up a big baldwin with what seemed a remarkably good aim for a shower of apples followed and a boy came tumbling earthward to catch on the lowest bough and swing down like a caterpillar exclaiming as he landed  im glad that job is done ive rasped every knuckle ive got and worn out the knees of my pants nice little crop though isnt it  it will be nicer if this young man does not bite every apple he touches hi there stop it boo commanded frank as he caught his young assistant putting his small teeth into the best ones to see if they were sweet or sour  molly set the barrel up on end and that took the boy out of the reach of mischief so he retired from view and peeped through a crack as he ate his fifth pearmain regardless of consequences  gus will be at home tomorrow he always comes up early on saturday you know we cant get on without him said frank who missed his mate very much for gus had entered college and so far did not like it as much as he had expected  or ralph he is very busy every spare minute on the little boys bust which is getting on nicely he says but he will be able to come home in time for supper i think added merry remembering the absent as usual  ill ask the girls on my way home and all meet at two oclock for a good row while its warm what shall i bring asked molly wondering if miss bats amiability would extend to making goodies in the midst of her usual saturdays baking  you bring coffee and the big pot and some buttered crackers ill see to the pie and cake and the other girls can have anything else they like answered merry glad and proud that she could provide the party with her own inviting handiwork  ill take my zither so we can have music as we sail and grif will bring his violin and ralph can imitate a banjo so that youd be sure he had one i do hope it will be fine it is so splendid to go round like other folks and enjoy myself cried jill with a little bounce of satisfaction at the prospect of a row and ramble  come along then and make sure of the girls said merry catching up her roll of work for the harvesting was done  molly put her sack on as the easiest way of carrying it and extricating boo they went off accompanied by the boys to make sure of the fellows also leaving jill to sit among the apples singing and sorting like a thrifty little housewife  next day eleven young people met at the appointed place basket in hand ralph could not come till later for he was working now as he never worked before they were a merry flock for the mellow autumn day was even brighter and clearer than yesterday and the river looked its loveliest winding away under the sombre hemlocks or through the fairyland the gay woods made on either side two large boats and two small ones held them all and away they went first up through the three bridges and round the bend then turning they floated down to the green island where a grove of oaks rustled their sere leaves and the squirrels were still gathering acorns here they often met to keep their summer revels and here they now spread their feast on the flat rock which needed no cloth beside its own gray lichens the girls trimmed each dish with bright leaves and made the supper look like a banquet for the elves while the boys built a fire in the nook where ashes and blackened stones told of many a rustic meal the big tin coffeepot was not so romantic but more successful than a kettle slung on three sticks gypsy fashion so they did not risk a downfall but set the water boiling and soon filled the air with the agreeable perfume associated in their minds with picnics as most of them never tasted the fascinating stuff at any other time being the worst children can drink  frank was cook gus helped cut bread and cake jack and grif brought wood while bob walker took joes place and made himself generally useful as the other gentleman never did and so was quite out of favor lately  all was ready at last and they were just deciding to sit down without ralph when a shout told them he was coming and down the river skimmed a wherry at such a rate the boys wondered whom he had been racing with  something has happened and he is coming to tell us said jill who sat where she could see his eager face  nothing bad or he wouldnt smile so he is glad of a good row and a little fun after working so hard all the week and merry shook a red napkin as a welcoming signal  something certainly had happened and a very happy something it must be they all thought as ralph came on with flashing oars and leaping out as the boat touched the shore ran up the slope waving his hat and calling in a glad voice sure of sympathy in his delight  good news good news hurrah for rome next month  the young folks forgot their supper for a moment to congratulate him on his happy prospect and hear all about it while the leaves rustled as if echoing the kind words and the squirrels sat up aloft wondering what all the pleasant clamor was about  yes im really going in november german asked me to go with him today and if there is any little hitch in my getting off hell lend a hand and iill black his boots wet his clay and run his errands the rest of my life to pay for this cried ralph in a burst of gratitude for independent as he was the kindness of this successful friend to a deserving comrade touched and won his heart  i call that a handsome thing to do said frank warmly for noble actions always pleased him i heard my mother say that making good or useful men was the best sort of sculpture so i think david german may be proud of this piece of work whether the big statue succeeds or not  im very glad old fellow when i run over for my trip four years from now ill look you up and see how you are getting on said gus with a hearty shake of the hand and the younger lads grinned cheerfully even while they wondered where the fun was in shaping clay and chipping marble  shall you stay four years asked merrys soft voice while a wistful look came into her happy eyes  ten if i can answered ralph decidedly feeling as if a long lifetime would be all too short for the immortal work he meant to do ive got so much to learn that i shall do whatever david thinks best for me at first and when i can go alone i shall just shut myself up and forget that there is any world outside my den  do write and tell us how you get on now and then i like to hear about other peoples good times while im waiting for my own said molly too much interested to observe that grif was sticking burrs up and down her braids  of course i shall write to some of you but you mustnt expect any great things for years yet people dont grow famous in a hurry and it takes a deal of hard work even to earn your bread and butter as youll find if you ever try it answered ralph sobering down a little as he remembered the long and steady effort it had taken to get even so far  speaking of bread and butter reminds me that wed better eat ours before the coffee gets quite cold said annette for merry seemed to have forgotten that she had been chosen to play matron as she was the oldest  the boys seconded the motion and for a few minutes supper was the allabsorbing topic as the cups went round and the goodies vanished rapidly accompanied by the usual mishaps which make picnic meals such fun ralphs health was drunk with all sorts of good wishes and such splendid prophecies were made that he would have far surpassed michael angelo if they could have come true grif gave him an order on the spot for a fulllength statue of himself and stood up to show the imposing attitude in which he wished to be taken but unfortunately slipped and fell forward with one hand in the custard pie the other clutching wildly at the coffeepot which inhospitably burnt his fingers  i think i grasp the idea and will be sure to remember not to make your hair blow one way and the tails of your coat another as a certain sculptor made those of a famous man laughed ralph as the fallen hero scrambled up amidst general merriment  will the little bust be done before you go asked jill anxiously feeling a personal interest in the success of that order  yes ive been hard at it every spare minute i could get and have a fortnight more it suits mrs lennox and she will pay well for it so i shall have something to start with though i havent been able to save much im to thank you for that and i shall send you the first pretty thing i get hold of answered ralph looking gratefully at the bright face which grew still brighter as jill exclaimed  i do feel so proud to know a real artist and have my bust done by him i only wish i could pay for it as mrs lennox does but i havent any money and you dont need the sort of things i can make she added shaking her head as she thought over knit slippers wallpockets and crochet in all its forms as offerings to her departing friend  you can write often and tell me all about everybody for i shall want to know and people will soon forget me when im gone said ralph looking at merry who was making a garland of yellow leaves for juliets black hair  jill promised and kept her word but the longest letters went from the farmhouse on the hill though no one knew the fact till long afterward merry said nothing now but she smiled with a pretty color in her cheeks and was very much absorbed in her work while the talk went on  i wish i was twenty and going to seek my fortune as you are said jack and the other boys agreed with him for something in ralphs new plans and purposes roused the manly spirit in all of them reminding them that playtime would soon be over and the great world before them where to choose  it is easy enough to say what youd like but the trouble is you have to take what you can get and make the best of it said gus whose own views were rather vague as yet  no you dont always you can make things go as you want them if you only try hard enough and walk right over whatever stands in the way i dont mean to give up my plans for any man but if i live ill carry them outyou see if i dont and frank gave the rock where he lay a blow with his fist that sent the acorns flying all about  one of them hit jack and he said sorrowfully as he held it in his hand so carefully it was evident he had some association with it  ed used to say that and he had some splendid plans but they didnt come to anything  perhaps they did who can tell do your best while you live and i dont believe anything good is lost whether we have it a long or a short time said ralph who knew what a help and comfort high hopes were and how they led to better things if worthily cherished  a great many acorns are wasted i suppose but some of them sprout and grow and make splendid trees added merry feeling more than she knew how to express as she looked up at the oaks overhead  only seven of the party were sitting on the knoll now for the rest had gone to wash the dishes and pack the baskets down by the boats jack and jill with the three elder boys were in a little group and as merry spoke gus said to frank  did you plant yours  yes on the lawn and i mean it shall come up if i can make it answered frank gravely  i put mine where i can see it from the window and not forget to water and take care of it added jack still turning the pretty brown acorn to and fro as if he loved it  what do they mean whispered merry to jill who was leaning against her knee to rest  the boys were walking in the cemetery last sunday as they often do and when they came to eds grave the place was all covered with little acorns from the tree that grows on the bank they each took up some as they stood talking and jack said he should plant his for he loved ed very much you know the others said they would too and i hope the trees will grow though we dont need anything to remember him by answered jill in a low tone thinking of the pressed flowers the girls kept for his sake  the boys heard her but no one spoke for a moment as they sat looking across the river toward the hill where the pines whispered their lullabies and pointed heavenward steadfast and green all the year round none of them could express the thought that was in their minds as jill told the little story but the act and the feeling that prompted it were perhaps as beautiful an assurance as could have been given that the dear dead boys example had not been wasted for the planting of the acorns was a symbol of the desire budding in those young hearts to be what he might have been and to make their lives nobler for the knowledge and the love of him  it seems as if a great deal had happened this year said merry in a pensive tone for this quiet talk just suited her mood  so i say for theres been a declaration of independence and a revolution in our house and im commanderinchief now and dont i like it cried molly complacently surveying the neat new uniform she wore of her own choosing  i feel as if i never learned so much in my life as i have since last december and yet i never did so little added jill wondering why the months of weariness and pain did not seem more dreadful to her  well pitching on my head seems to have given me a good shaking up somehow and i mean to do great things next year in better ways than breaking my bones coasting said jack with a manly air  i feel like a siamese twin without his mate now you are gone but im under orders for a while and mean to do my best guess it wont be lost time and frank nodded at gus who nodded back with the slightly superior expression all freshmen wear  hope you wont find it so my work is all cut out for me and i intend to go in and win though it is more of a grind than you fellows know  im sure i have everything to be grateful for it wont be plain sailingi dont expect it but if i live ill do something to be proud of said ralph squaring his shoulders as if to meet and conquer all obstacles as he looked into the glowing west which was not fairer than his ambitious dreams  here we will say goodby to these girls and boys of ours as they sit together in the sunshine talking over a year that was to be for ever memorable to them not because of any very remarkable events but because they were just beginning to look about them as they stepped out of childhood into youth and some of the experiences of the past months had set them to thinking taught them to see the use and beauty of the small duties joys and sorrows which make up our lives and inspired them to resolve that the coming year should be braver and brighter than the last  there are many such boys and girls full of high hopes lovely possibilities and earnest plans pausing a moment before they push their little boats from the safe shore let those who launch them see to it that they have good health to man the oars good education for ballast and good principles as pilots to guide them as they voyage down an everwidening river to the sea
