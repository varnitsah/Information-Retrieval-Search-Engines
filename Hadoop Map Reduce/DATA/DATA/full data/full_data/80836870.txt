with thirst and travel sore two of mcphersons flanking corps    across the desert were tramping they had wandered off from the beaten track and now were wearily harking back ever staring round for the signal jack    that marked their comrades camping  the one was corporal robert dick bearded and burly short and thick rough of speech and in temper quick    a hardfaced old rapscallion the other fresh from the barrack square was a raw recruit smoothcheeked and fair half grown half drilled with the weedy air    of a draft from the home battalion  weary and parched and hungertorn they had wandered on from early morn and the young boysoldier limped forlorn    now stumbling and now falling around the orange sandcurves lay flecked with boulders black or grey deathsilent save that far away    a kite was shrilly calling  a kite  was that a kite  the yell that shrilly rose and faintly fell no kites and yet the kite knows well    the longdrawn wild halloo and right athwart the evening sky the yellow sandspray spurtled high and shrill and shriller swelled the cry    of allah  allahu  the corporal peered at the crimson west hid his pipe in his khaki vest growled out an oath and onward pressed    still glancing over his shoulder bedouins mate he curtly said well find some work for steel and lead and maybe sleep in a sandy bed    before were one hour older  but just one flutter before were done stiffen your lip and stand my son well take this bloomin circus on    ballcartridge load  now steady with a curse and a prayer the two faced round dogged and grim they stood their ground and their breechblocks snapped with a crisp clean sound    as the rifles sprang to the ready  alas for the emir ali khan a hundred paces before his clan that ebony steed of the prophets breed    is the foal of death and of danger a spurt of fire a gasp of pain a blueish blurr on the yellow plain the chief was down and his bridle rein    was in the grip of the stranger  with the light of hope on his rugged face the corporal sprang to the dead mans place one prick with the steel one thrust with the heel    and where was the man to outride him a grip of his knees a toss of his rein he was settling her down to her gallop again when he stopped for he heard just one faltering word    from the young recruit beside him  one faltering word from pal to pal but it found the heart of the corporal he had sprung to the sand he had lent him a hand    up mate  theyll be ere in a minute off with you  no palaver  go ill bide beind and run this show promotion has been cursed slow    and this is my chance to win it  into the saddle he thrust him quick spurred the black mare with a bayonet prick watched her gallop with plunge and with kick    away oer the desert careering then he turned with a softened face and loosened the strap of his cartridgecase while his thoughts flew back to the dear old place    in the sunny hampshire clearing  the young boyprivate glancing back saw the bedouins wild attack and heard the sharp martini crack    but as he gazed already the fierce fanatic arab band was closing in on every hand until one tawny swirl of sand    concealed them in its eddy      a squadron of british horse that night galloping hard in the shadowy light came on the scene of that last stern fight    and found the corporal lying silent and grim on the trampled sand his rifle grasped in his stiffened hand with the warrior pride of one who died    mid a ring of the dead and the dying  and still when twilight shadows fall after the evening bugle call in bivouac or in barrackhall his comrades speak of the corporal    his death and his devotion and there are some who like to say that perhaps a hidden meaning lay in the words he spoke and that the day when his rough bold spirit passed away    was the day that he won promotion    a forgotten tale    the scene of this ancient fight recorded by froissart is still called altura de los inglesos  five hundred years later wellingtons soldiers were fighting on the same ground  say what saw you on the hill    campesino garcia i saw my brindled heifer there a trail of bowmen spent and bare and a little man on a sorrel

bide the end to view i had graver things to do tending on the lambing ewe    down among the clover  ah but tell me what you heard    campesino garcia shouting from the mountainside shouting until eventide but it dwindled and it died    ere milking time was over  nay but saw you nothing more    campesino garcia yes i saw them lying there the little man and sorrel mare and in their ranks the

wooden horse go there was robin and leah and boadicea    and chesterfields son of the sea and irish nuneaton who never was beaten    they backed her at seven to three  the course was the devil  a start on the level    and then a stiff breather uphill a bank at the top with a fourfoot drop    and a bullfinch down by the mill a stretch of straight from the whittlesea gate    then up and down and up and the mounts that stay through farnshire clay    may bid for the farnshire cup  the tipsters were touting the bookies were shouting    bar one bar one bar one with a glint and a glimmer of silken shimmer    the field shone bright in the sun when farmer brown came riding down    i haint much time to spare but ive entered her name so ill play out the game    on the back o my old gray mare  you never would think er a thoroughbred clinker    theres never a judge that would each leg beind as a splint youll find    and the fore are none too good she roars a bit and she dont look fit    shes moulted alf er air but  he smiled in a way that seemed to say    that he knew that old gray mare  and the bookies laughed and the bookies chaffed    who backs the mare cried they a hundred to one  its doneand done    well take that price all day what if the mare is shedding hair    what if her eye is wild we read her worth and her pedigree birth    in the smile that her owner smiled  and the whisper grew and the whisper flew    that she came of isonomy stock fifty to one  its doneand done    look at her haunch and hock illgroomed  why yes but one may guess    that that is her owners guile ah farmer brown the sharps from town    have read your simple smile  theyve weighed him in  now lose or win    ive money at stake this day geelong my sweet and if were beat    well both do all we may he joins the rest they line abreast    back leah  mavis up the flag is dipped and the field is slipped    full split for the farnshire cup  christopher davis is leading on mavis    spider is waiting on flo boadicea is gaining on leah    irish nuneaton lies low robin is tailing his wind has been failing    son of the seas going fast so crack on the pace for its anyones race    and the winners the horse that can last  chestnut and bay and sorrel and gray    see how they glimmer and gleam bending and straining and losing and gaining    silk jackets flutter and stream they are over the grass as the cloud shadows pass    they are up to the fence at the top its hey then and over and into the clover    there wasnt one slip at the drop  they are all going still they are round by the mill    they are down by the whittlesea gate leahs complaining and mavis is gaining    and flos catching up in the straight robins gone wrong but the spider runs strong    he sticks to the leader like wax an utter outsider but look at his rider     jo chauncy the pick of the cracks  robin was tailing and pecked at a paling    leahs gone weak in her feet boadicea came down at the railing    son of the sea is dead beat leather to leather theyre pounding together    three of them all in a row and irish nuneaton who never was beaten    is level with spider and flo  its into the straight from the whittlesea gate    clean galloping over the green but four foot high the hurdles lie    with a sunken ditch between tis a bit of a test for a beast at its best    and the devil and all at its worst but its clear run in with the cup to win    for the horse that is over it first  so try it my beauties and fly it my beauties    spider nuneaton and flo with a trip and a blunder theres one of them under    hark to it crashing below is it the brown or the sorrel thats down    the brown  it is flo who is in and spider with chauncy the pick of the fancy    is going full split for a win  spider is winning  jo chauncy is winning    hes winning  hes winning  bravo the bookies are raving the ladies are waving    the stand is all shouting for jo the horse is clean done but the race may be won    by the newmarket lad on his back for the fire of the rider may bring an outsider    ahead of a thoroughbred crack  spider is winning  jo chauncy is winning    it swells like the roar of the sea but jo hears the drumming of somebody coming    and sees a lean head by his knee nuneaton  nuneaton  the spider is beaten    it is but a spurt at the most for lose it or win it they have but a minute    before they are up with the post  nuneaton is straining nuneaton is gaining    neither will falter nor flinch whips they are plying and jackets are flying    theyre fairly abreast to an inch crack em up  let em go  well ridden  bravo    gamer ones never were bred jo chauncy has done it  hes spurted  hes won it    the favourites beat by a head  dont tell me of luck for its judgment and pluck    and a courage that never will shirk to give your mind to it and know how to do it    and put all your heart in your work so heres to the spider the winning outsider    with little jo chauncy up may they stay lifes course both jockey and horse    as they stayed in the farnshire cup  but its possible that you are wondering what    may have happened to farmer brown and the old gray crock of isonomy stock    who was backed by the sharps from town she blew and she sneezed she coughed and she wheezed    she ran till her knees gave way but never a grumble at trip or at stumble    was heard from her jock that day  for somebody laid against the gray    and somebody made a pile and brown says he can make farming pay    and he smiles a simple smile them sharps from town were riled says brown    but i cant see whycan you for i said quite fair as i knew that mare    and i proved my words was true    the grooms story    ten mile in twenty minutes  e done it sir  thats true the big bay orse in the further stallthe one wots next to you ive seen some better orses ive seldom seen a wuss but e olds the bloomin record an thats good enough for us  we knew as it was in im  es thoroughbred three part we bought im for to race im but we found e ad no eart for e was sad and thoughtful and amazin dignified it seemed a kind o liberty to drive im or to ride  for e never seemed athinkin of what e ad to do but is thoughts was set on igher things admirin of the view e looked a puffeck pictur and a pictur e would stay e wouldnt even switch is tail to drive the flies away  and yet we knew twas in im we knew as e could fly but what we couldnt git at was ow to make im try wed almost turned the job up until at last one day we got the last yard out of im in a most amazin way  it was all along o master which master as the name of a reglar true blue sportman an always acts the same but we all as weaker moments which master e ad one an e went and bought a motorcar when motorcars begun  i seed it in the stable yardit fairly turned me sick  a greasy wheezy engine as can neither buck nor kick youve a screw to drive it forrard and a screw to make it stop for it was foaled in a smithy stove an bred in a blacksmith shop  it didnt want no stable it didnt ask no groom it didnt need no nothin but a bit o standin room just fill it up with paraffin an it would go all day which the same should be agin the law if i could ave my way  well master took is motorcar an moted ere an there a frightenin the orses an a poisonin the air e wore a bloomin yachtin cap but lor wot did e know excep that if you turn a screw the thing would stop or go  an then one day it wouldnt go  e screwed and screwed again but somethin jammed an there e stuck in the mud of a country lane it urt is pride most cruel but what was e to do so at last e bade me fetch a orse to pull the motor through  this was the orse we fetched im an when we reached the car we braced im tight and proper to the middle of the bar and buckled up is traces and lashed them to each side while e eld is ead so aughtily an looked most dignified  not bad tempered mind you but kind of pained and vexed and e seemed to say well bli me wot will they ask me next ive put up with some liberties but this caps all by far to be assistant engine to a crocky motorcar  well master e was in the car afiddlin with the gear and the orse was meditatin an i was standin near when master e touched somethinwhat it was well never know  but it sort o spurred the boiler up and made the engine go  old ard old gal says master and gently then says i but an engine wont eed coaxin an it aint no use to try so first e pulled a lever an then e turned a screw but the thing kept crawlin forrard spite of all that e could do  and first it went quite slowly and the orse went also slow but e ad to buck up faster when the wheels began to go for the car kept crowdin on im and buttin im along and in less than alf a minute sir that orse was goin strong  at first e walked quite dignified an then e ad to trot and then e tried a canter when the pace became too ot e looked is very aughtiest as if e didnt e mind and all the time the motorcar was pushin im beind  now master lost is ead when e found e couldnt stop and e pulled a valve or somethin an somethin else went pop an somethin else went fizzywiz and in a flash or less that blessed car was goin like a limited express  master eld the steerin gear an kept the road all right and away they whizzed and clatteredmy aunt it was a sight e seemed the finest draught orse as ever lived by far for all the country juggins thought twas im wot pulled the car  e was stretchin like a greyound e was goin all e knew but it bumped an shoved beind im for all that e could do it butted im an boosted im an spanked im on aead till e broke the tenmile record same as i already said  ten mile in twenty minutes  e done it sir  thats true the only time we ever found what that ere orse could do some say it wasnt ardly fair and the papers made a fuss but e broke the tenmile record and thats good enough for us  you see that orses tail sir  you dont  no more do we which really aint surprisin for e as no tail to see that engine wore it off im before master made it stop and all the road was littered like a bloomin barbers shop  and master  well it cured im  e altered from that day and come back to is orses in the good oldfashioned way and if you wants to git the sack the quickest way by far is to int as ow you think e ought to keep a motorcar    with the chiddingfolds       the horse is bedded down       where the straw lies deep    the hound is in the kennel       let the poor hound sleep    and the fox is in the spinney       by the run which he is haunting    and ill lay an even guinea       that a goose or two is wanting when the farmer comes to count them in the morning     the horse is up and saddled       girth the old horse tight    the hounds are out and drawing       in the morning light    now its yoick among the heather       and its yoick across the clover    and its to him all together       hyke a bertha  hyke a rover and the woodlands smell so sweetly in the morning     theres termagant awhimpering       she whimpers so    theres a young hound yapping       let the young hound go    but the old hound is cunning       and its him we mean to follow    they are running  they are running       and its forrard to the hollo for the scent is lying strongly in the morning     whos the fool that heads him       hold hard and let him pass    hes out among the oziers       hes clear upon the grass    you grip his flanks and settle       for the horse is stretched and straining    heres a game to test your mettle       and a sport to try your training when the chiddingfolds are running in the morning     were up by the coppice       and were down by the mill    were out upon the common       and the hounds are running still    you must tighten on the leather       for we blunder through the bracken    though youre over hocks in heather       still the pace must never slacken as we race through thursley common in the morning     we are breaking from the tangle       we are out upon the green    theres a bank and a hurdle       with a quickset between    you must steady him and try it       you are over with a scramble    heres a wattle  you must fly it       and you land among the bramble for its roughish toughish going in the morning     ware the bog by the grove       as you pound through the slush    see the whip  see the huntsman       we are close upon his brush    ware the root that lies before you       it will trip you if you blunder    ware the branch thats drooping oer you       you must dip and swerve from under as you gallop through the woodland in the morning     there were fifty at the find       there were forty at the mill    there were twenty on the heath       and ten are going still    some are pounded some are shirking       and they dwindle and diminish    till a weary pair are working       spent and blowing to the finish and we hear the shrill whooooping in the morning     the horse is bedded down       where the straw lies deep    the hound is in the kennel       he is yapping in his sleep    but the fox is in the spinney       lying snug in earth and burrow    and ill lay an even guinea       we could find again tomorrow if we chose to go ahunting in the morning    a hunting morning    put the saddle on the mare    for the wet winds blow theres winter in the air    and autumn all below for the red leaves are flying and the red bracken dying and the red fox lying    where the oziers grow  put the bridle on the mare    for my blood runs chill and my heart it is there    on the heathertufted hill with the gray skies oer us and the longdrawn chorus of a running pack before us    from the find to the kill  then lead round the mare    for its time that we began and away with thought and care    save to live and be a man while the keen air is blowing and the huntsman holloing and the black mare going    as the black mare can    the old gray fox    we started from the valley pride    and farnham way we went we waited at the coverside    but never found a scent then we tried the withy beds    which grow by frensham town and there we found the old gray fox       the

from my forbears    years agone yet within its walls i see a most motley company and they one and all claim me    as their own  theres one who is a soldier    bluff and keen singleminded heavyfisted    rude of mien he would gain a purse or stake it he would win a heart or break it he would give a life or take it    conscienceclean  and near him is a priest    still schismwhole he loves the censerreek    and organroll he has leanings to the mystic sacramental eucharistic and dim yearnings altruistic    thrill his soul  theres another who with doubts    is overcast i think him younger brother    to the last walking wary stride by stride peering forwards anxiouseyed since he learned to doubt his guide    in the past  and mid them all alert    but somewhat cowed there sits a starkfaced fellow    beetlebrowed whose black soul shrinks away from a lawyerridden day and has thoughts he dare not say    half avowed  there are others who are sitting    grim as doom in the dim illboding shadow    of my room darkling figures stern or quaint now a savage now a saint  showing fitfully and faint    through the gloom  and those shadows are so dense    there may be manyvery manymore    than i see they are sitting day and night soldier rogue and anchorite and they wrangle and they fight    over me  if the starkfaced fellow win    all is oer if the priest should gain his will    i doubt no more but if each shall have his day i shall swing and i shall sway in the same old weary way    as before    the irish colonel    said the king to the colonel the complaints are eternal    that you irish give more trouble       than any other corps  said the colonel to the king this complaint is no new thing    for your foemen sire have made it       a hundred times before    the blind archer    little boy love drew his bow at a chance    shooting down at the ballroom floor he hit an old chaperone watching the dance    and oh but he wounded her sore       hey love you couldnt mean that       hi love what would you be at          no word would he say          but he flew on his way for the little boys busy and how could he stay  little boy love drew a shaft just for sport    at the soberest club in pall mall he winged an old veteran drinking his port    and down that old veteran fell       hey love you mustnt do that       hi love what would you be at          this cannot be right          its ludicrous quite but its no use to argue for loves out of sight  a sadfaced young clerk in a cell all apart    was planning a celibate vow but the boys random arrow has sunk in his heart    and the cell is an empty one now       hey love you mustnt do that       hi love what would you be at          he is not for you          he has duties to do but i am his duty quoth love as he flew  the king sought a bride and the nation had hoped    for a queen without rival or peer but the little boy shot and the king has eloped    with miss noone on nothing a year       hey love you couldnt mean that       hi love what would you be at          what an impudent thing          to make game of a king but im a king also cried love on the wing  little boy love grew pettish one day    if you keep on complaining he swore ill pack both my bow and my quiver away    and so i shall plague you no more       hey love you mustnt do that       hi love what would you be at          you may ruin our ease          you may do what you please but we cant do without you you dear little tease    a parable    the cheesemites asked how the cheese got there    and warmly debated the matter the orthodox said that it came from the air    and the heretics said from the platter they argued it long and they argued it strong    and i hear they are arguing now but of all the choice spirits who lived in the cheese    not one of them thought of a cow    a tragedy    whos that walking on the moorland    whos that moving on the hill they are passing mid the bracken but the shadows grow and blacken    and i cannot see them clearly on the hill  whos that calling on the moorland    whos that crying on the hill was it bird or was it human was it child or man or woman    who was calling so sadly on the hill  whos that running on the moorland    whos that flying on the hill he is thereand there again but you cannot see him plain    for the shadow lies so darkly on the hill  whats that lying in the heather    whats that lurking on the hill my horse will go no nearer and i cannot see it clearer    but theres something that is lying on the hill    the passing    it was the hour of dawn    when the heart beats thin and small the window glimmered grey    framed in a shadow wall  and in the cold sad light    of the early morningtide the dear dead girl came back    and stood by his bedside  the girl he lost came back    he saw her flowing hair it flickered and it waved    like a breath in frosty air  as in a steamy glass    her face was dim and blurred her voice was sweet and thin    like the calling of a bird  you said that you would come    you promised not to stay and i have waited here    to help you on the way  i have waited on    but still you bide below you said that you would come    and oh i want you so  for half my soul is here    and half my soul is there when you are on the earth    and i am in the air  but on your dressingstand    there lies a triple key unlock the little gate    which fences you from me  just one little pang    just one throb of pain and then your weary head    between my breasts again  in the dim unhomely light    of the early morningtide he took the triple key    and he laid it by his side  a pistol silver chased    an open hunting knife a phial of the drug    which cures the ill of life  he looked upon the three    and sharply drew his breath now help me oh my love    for i fear this cold grey death  she bent her face above    she kissed him and she smiled she soothed him as a mother    may sooth a frightened child  just that little pang love    just a throb of pain and then your weary head    between my breasts again  he snatched the pistol up    he pressed it to his ear but a sudden sound broke in    and his skin was raw with fear  he took the hunting knife    he tried to raise the blade it glimmered cold and white    and he was sore afraid  he poured the potion out    but it was thick and brown his throat was sealed against it    and he could not drain it down  he looked to her for help    and when he lookedbehold his love was there before him    as in the days of old  he saw the drooping head    he saw the gentle eyes he saw the same shy grace of hers    he had been wont to prize  she pointed and she smiled    and lo he was aware of a halflit bedroom chamber    and a silent figure there  a silent figure lying    asprawl upon a bed with a silvermounted pistol    still clotted to his head  and as he downward gazed    her voice came full and clear the homely tender voice    which he had loved to hear  the key is very certain    the door is sealed to none you did it oh my darling    and you never knew it done  when the net was broken    you thought you felt its mesh you carried to the spirit    the troubles of the flesh  and are you trembling still dear    then let me take your hand and i will lead you outward    to a sweet and restful land  you know how once in london    i put my griefs on you but i can carry yours now     most sweet it is to do  most sweet it is to do love    and very sweet to plan how i the helpless woman    can help the helpful man  but let me see you smiling    with the smile i know so well forget the world of shadows    and the empty broken shell  it is the wornout garment    in which you tore a rent you tossed it down and carelessly    upon your way you went  it is not you my sweetheart    for you are here with me that frame was but the promise of    the thing that was to be   a tuning of the choir    ere the harmonies begin and yet it is the image    of the subtle thing within  theres not a trick of body    theres not a trait of mind but you bring it over with you    ethereal refined  but still the same for surely    if we alter as we die you would be you no longer    and i would not be i  i might be an angel    but not the girl you knew you might be immaculate    but that would not be you  and now i see you smiling    so darling take my hand and i will lead you outward    to a sweet and pleasant land  where thought is clear and nimble    where life is pure and fresh where the soul comes back rejoicing    from the mudbath of the flesh  but still that soul is human    with human ways and so i love my love in spirit    as i loved him long ago  so with hands together    and fingers twining tight the two dead lovers drifted    in the golden morning light  but a greyhaired man was lying    beneath them on a bed with a silvermounted pistol    still clotted to his head    the franklins maid from the white company    the franklin he hath gone to roam the franklins maid she bides at home but she is cold and coy and staid and who may win the franklins maid  there came a knight of high renown in bassinet and ciclatoun on bended knee full long he prayed  he might not win the franklins maid  there came a squire so debonair his dress was rich his words were fair he sweetly sang he deftly played  he could not win the franklins maid  there came a mercer wonderfine with velvet cap and gaberdine for all his ships for all his trade he could not buy the franklins maid  there came an archer bold and true with bracer guard and stave of yew his purse was light his jerkin frayed  haro alas the franklins maid  oh some have laughed and some have cried and some have scoured the countryside but off they ride through wood and glade the bowman and the franklins maid    the old huntsman    theres a keen and grim old huntsman    on a horse as white as snow sometimes he is very swift    and sometimes he is slow but he never is at fault    for he always hunts at view and he rides without a halt       after you  the huntsmans name is death    his horses name is time he is coming he is coming    as i sit and write this rhyme he is coming he is coming    as you read the rhyme i write you can hear the hoofs low drumming       day and night  you can hear the distant drumming    as the clock goes tickatack and the chiming of the hours    is the music of his pack you may hardly note their growling    underneath the noonday sun but at night you hear them howling       as they run  and they never check or falter    for they never miss their kill seasons change and systems alter    but the hunt is running still hark the evening chime is playing    oer the long grey town it peals dont you hear the deathhound baying       at your heels  where is there an earth or burrow    where a cover left for you a year a week perhaps tomorrow    brings the huntsmans death halloo day by day he gains upon us    and the most that we can claim is that when the hounds are on us       we die game  and somewhere dwells the master    by whom it was decreed he sent the savage huntsman    he bred the snowwhite steed these hounds which run for ever    he set them on your track he hears you scream but never       calls them back  he does not heed our suing    we never see his face he hunts to our undoing    we thank him for the chase we thank him and we flatter    we hopebecause we must  but have we cause  no matter       let us trust
