brangwens had lived for generations on the marsh farm in the meadows where the erewash twisted sluggishly through alder trees separating derbyshire from nottinghamshire two miles away a churchtower stood on a hill the houses of the little country town climbing assiduously up to it whenever one of the brangwens in the fields lifted his head from his work he saw the churchtower at ilkeston in the empty sky so that as he turned again to the horizontal land he was aware of something standing above him and beyond him in the distance  there was a look in the eyes of the brangwens as if they were expecting something unknown about which they were eager they had that air of readiness for what would come to them a kind of surety an expectancy the look of an inheritor  they were fresh blond slowspeaking people revealing themselves plainly but slowly so that one could watch the change in their eyes from laughter to anger blue litup laughter to a hard bluestaring anger through all the irresolute stages of the sky when the weather is changing  living on rich land on their own land near to a growing town they had forgotten what it was to be in straitened circumstances they had never become rich because there were always children and the patrimony was divided every time but always at the marsh there was ample  so the brangwens came and went without fear of necessity working hard because of the life that was in them not for want of the money neither were they thriftless they were aware of the last halfpenny and instinct made them not waste the peeling of their apple for it would help to feed the cattle but heaven and earth was teeming around them and how should this cease they felt the rush of the sap in spring they knew the wave which cannot halt but every year throws forward the seed to begetting and falling back leaves the youngborn on the earth they knew the intercourse between heaven and earth sunshine drawn into the breast and bowels the rain sucked up in the daytime nakedness that comes under the wind in autumn showing the birds nests no longer worth hiding their life and interrelations were such feeling the pulse and body of the soil that opened to their furrow for the grain and became smooth and supple after their ploughing and clung to their feet with a weight that pulled like desire lying hard and unresponsive when the crops were to be shorn away the young corn waved and was silken and the lustre slid along the limbs of the men who saw it they took the udder of the cows the cows yielded milk and pulse against the hands of the men the pulse of the blood of the teats of the cows beat into the pulse of the hands of the men they mounted their horses and held life between the grip of their knees they harnessed their horses at the wagon and with hand on the bridlerings drew the heaving of the horses after their will  in autumn the partridges whirred up birds in flocks blew like spray across the fallow rooks appeared on the grey watery heavens and flew cawing into the winter then the men sat by the fire in the house where the women moved about with surety and the limbs and the body of the men were impregnated with the day cattle and earth and vegetation and the sky the men sat by the fire and their brains were inert as their blood flowed heavy with the accumulation from the living day  the women were different on them too was the drowse of bloodintimacy calves sucking and hens running together in droves and young geese palpitating in the hand while the food was pushed down their throttle but the women looked out from the heated blind intercourse of farmlife to the spoken world beyond they were aware of the lips and the mind of the world speaking and giving utterance they heard the sound in the distance and they strained to listen  it was enough for the men that the earth heaved and opened its furrow to them that the wind blew to dry the wet wheat and set the young ears of corn wheeling freshly round about it was enough that they helped the cow in labour or ferreted the rats from under the barn or broke the back of a rabbit with a sharp knock of the hand so much warmth and generating and pain and death did they know in their blood earth and sky and beast and green plants so much exchange and interchange they had with these that they lived full and surcharged their senses full fed their faces always turned to the heat of the blood staring into the sun dazed with looking towards the source of generation unable to turn round  but the woman wanted another form of life than this something that was not bloodintimacy her house faced out from the farmbuildings and fields looked out to the road and the village with church and hall and the world beyond she stood to see the faroff world of cities and governments and the active scope of man the magic land to her where secrets were made known and desires fulfilled she faced outwards to where men moved dominant and creative having turned their back on the pulsing heat of creation and with this behind them were set out to discover what was beyond to enlarge their own scope and range and freedom whereas the brangwen men faced inwards to the teeming life of creation which poured unresolved into their veins  looking out as she must from the front of her house towards the activity of man in the world at large whilst her husband looked out to the back at sky and harvest and beast and land she strained her eyes to see what man had done in fighting outwards to knowledge she strained to hear how he uttered himself in his conquest her deepest desire hung on the battle that she heard far off being waged on the edge of the unknown she also wanted to know and to be of the fighting host  at home even so near as cossethay was the vicar who spoke the other magic language and had the other finer bearing both of which she could perceive but could never attain to the vicar moved in worlds beyond where her own menfolk existed did she not know her own menfolk fresh slow fullbuilt men masterful enough but easy native to the earth lacking outwardness and range of motion whereas the vicar dark and dry and small beside her husband had yet a quickness and a range of being that made brangwen in his large geniality seem dull and local she knew her husband but in the vicars nature was that which passed beyond her knowledge as brangwen had power over the cattle so the vicar had power over her husband what was it in the vicar that raised him above the common men as man is raised above the beast she craved to know she craved to achieve this higher being if not in herself then in her children that which makes a man strong even if he be little and frail in body just as any man is little and frail beside a bull and yet stronger than the bull what was it it was not money nor power nor position what power had the vicar over tom brangwennone yet strip them and set them on a desert island and the vicar was the master his soul was master of the other mans and whywhy she decided it was a question of knowledge  the curate was poor enough and not very efficacious as a man either yet he took rank with those others the superior she watched his children being born she saw them running as tiny things beside their mother and already they were separate from her own children distinct why were her own children marked below the others why should the curates children inevitably take precedence over her children why should dominance be given them from the start it was not money nor even class it was education and experience she decided  it was this this education this higher form of being that the mother wished to give to her children so that they too could live the supreme life on earth for her children at least the children of her heart had the complete nature that should take place in equality with the living vital people in the land not be left behind obscure among the labourers why must they remain obscured and stifled all their lives why should they suffer from lack of freedom to move how should they learn the entry into the finer more vivid circle of life  her imagination was fired by the squires lady at shelly hall who came to church at cossethay with her little children girls in tidy capes of beaver fur and smart little hats herself like a winter rose so fair and delicate so fair so fine in mould so luminous what was it that mrs hardy felt which she mrs brangwen did not feel how was mrs hardys nature different from that of the common women of cossethay in what was it beyond them all the women of cossethay talked eagerly about mrs hardy of her husband her children her guests her dress of her servants and her housekeeping the lady of the hall was the living dream of their lives her life was the epic that inspired their lives in her they lived imaginatively and in gossiping of her husband who drank of her scandalous brother of lord william bentley her friend member of parliament for the division they had their own odyssey enacting itself penelope and ulysses before them and circe and the swine and the endless web  so the women of the village were fortunate they saw themselves in the lady of the manor each of them lived her own fulfilment of the life of mrs hardy and the brangwen wife of the marsh aspired beyond herself towards the further life of the finer woman towards the extended being she revealed as a traveller in his selfcontained manner reveals faroff countries present in himself but why should a knowledge of faroff countries make a mans life a different thing finer bigger and why is a man more than the beast and the cattle that serve him it is the same thing  the male part of the poem was filled in by such men as the vicar and lord william lean eager men with strange movements men who had command of the further fields whose lives ranged over a great extent ah it was something very desirable to know this touch of the wonderful men who had the power of thought and comprehension the women of the village might be much fonder of tom brangwen and more at their ease with him yet if their lives had been robbed of the vicar and of lord william the leading shoot would have been cut away from them they would have been heavy and uninspired and inclined to hate so long as the wonder of the beyond was before them they could get along whatever their lot and mrs hardy and the vicar and lord william these moved in the wonder of the beyond and were visible to the eyes of cossethay in their motion  ii  about 1840 a canal was constructed across the meadows of the marsh farm connecting the newlyopened collieries of the erewash valley a high embankment travelled along the fields to carry the canal which passed close to the homestead and reaching the road went over in a heavy bridge  so the marsh was shut off from ilkeston and enclosed in the small valley bed which ended in a bushy hill and the village spire of cossethay  the brangwens received a fair sum of money from this trespass across their land then a short time afterwards a colliery was sunk on the other side of the canal and in a while the midland railway came down the valley at the foot of the ilkeston hill and the invasion was complete the town grew rapidly the brangwens were kept busy producing supplies they became richer they were almost tradesmen  still the marsh remained remote and original on the old quiet side of the canal embankment in the sunny valley where slow water wound along in company of stiff alders and the road went under ashtrees past the brangwens garden gate  but looking from the garden gate down the road to the right there through the dark archway of the canals square aqueduct was a colliery spinning away in the near distance and further red crude houses plastered on the valley in masses and beyond all the dim smoking hill of the town  the homestead was just on the safe side of civilization outside the gate the house stood bare from the road approached by a straight garden path along which at spring the daffodils were thick in green and yellow at the sides of the house were bushes of lilac and guelderrose and privet entirely hiding the farm buildings behind  at the back a confusion of sheds spread into the homeclose from out of two or three indistinct yards the duckpond lay beyond the furthest wall littering its white feathers on the padded earthen banks blowing its stray soiled feathers into the grass and the gorse bushes below the canal embankment which rose like a high rampart near at hand so that occasionally a mans figure passed in silhouette or a man and a towing horse traversed the sky  at first the brangwens were astonished by all this commotion around them the building of a canal across their land made them strangers in their own place this raw bank of earth shutting them off disconcerted them as they worked in the fields from beyond the now familiar embankment came the rhythmic run of the winding engines startling at first but afterwards a narcotic to the brain then the shrill whistle of the trains reechoed through the heart with fearsome pleasure announcing the faroff come near and imminent  as they drove home from town the farmers of the land met the blackened colliers trooping from the pitmouth as they gathered the harvest the west wind brought a faint sulphurous smell of pitrefuse burning as they pulled the turnips in november the sharp clinkclinkclinkclinkclink of empty trucks shunting on the line vibrated in their hearts with the fact of other activity going on beyond them  the alfred brangwen of this period had married a woman from heanor a daughter of the black horse she was a slim pretty dark woman quaint in her speech whimsical so that the sharp things she said did not hurt she was oddly a thing to herself rather querulous in her manner but intrinsically separate and indifferent so that her long lamentable complaints when she raised her voice against her husband in particular and against everybody else after him only made those who heard her wonder and feel affectionately towards her even while they were irritated and impatient with her she railed long and loud about her husband but always with a balanced easyflying voice and a quaint manner of speech that warmed his belly with pride and male triumph while he scowled with mortification at the things she said  consequently brangwen himself had a humorous puckering at the eyes a sort of fat laugh very quiet and full and he was spoilt like a lord of creation he calmly did as he liked laughed at their railing excused himself in a teasing tone that she loved followed his natural inclinations and sometimes pricked too near the quick frightened and broke her by a deep tense fury which seemed to fix on him and hold him for days and which she would give anything to placate in him they were two very separate beings vitally connected knowing nothing of each other yet living in their separate ways from one root  there were four sons and two daughters the eldest boy ran away early to sea and did not come back after this the mother was more the node and centre of attraction in the home the second boy alfred whom the mother admired most was the most reserved he was sent to school in ilkeston and made some progress but in spite of his dogged yearning effort he could not get beyond the rudiments of anything save of drawing at this in which he had some power he worked as if it were his hope after much grumbling and savage rebellion against everything after much trying and shifting about when his father was incensed against him and his mother almost despairing he became a draughtsman in a lacefactory in nottingham  he remained heavy and somewhat uncouth speaking with broad derbyshire accent adhering with all his tenacity to his work and to his town position making good designs and becoming fairly welloff but at drawing his hand swung naturally in big bold lines rather lax so that it was cruel for him to pedgill away at the lace designing working from the tiny squares of his paper counting and plotting and niggling he did it stubbornly with anguish crushing the bowels within him adhering to his chosen lot whatever it should cost and he came back into life set and rigid a rarespoken almost surly man  he married the daughter of a chemist who affected some social superiority and he became something of a snob in his dogged fashion with a passion for outward refinement in the household mad when anything clumsy or gross occurred later when his three children were growing up and he seemed a staid almost middleaged man he turned after strange women and became a silent inscrutable follower of forbidden pleasure neglecting his indignant bourgeois wife without a qualm  frank the third son refused from the first to have anything to do with learning from the first he hung round the slaughterhouse which stood away in the third yard at the back of the farm the brangwens had always killed their own meat and supplied the neighbourhood out of this grew a regular butchers business in connection with the farm  as a child frank had been drawn by the trickle of dark blood that ran across the pavement from the slaughterhouse to the crewyard by the sight of the man carrying across to the meatshed a huge side of beef with the kidneys showing embedded in their heavy laps of fat  he was a handsome lad with soft brown hair and regular features something like a later roman youth he was more easily excitable more readily carried away than the rest weaker in character at eighteen he married a little factory girl a pale plump quiet thing with sly eyes and a wheedling voice who insinuated herself into him and bore him a child every year and made a fool of him when he had taken over the butchery business already a growing callousness to it and a sort of contempt made him neglectful of it he drank and was often to be found in his public house blathering away as if he knew everything when in reality he was a noisy fool  of the daughters alice the elder married a collier and lived for a time stormily in ilkeston before moving away to yorkshire with her numerous young family effie the younger remained at home  the last child tom was considerably younger than his brothers so had belonged rather to the company of his sisters he was his mothers favourite she roused herself to determination and sent him forcibly away to a grammarschool in derby when he was twelve years old he did not want to go and his father would have given way but mrs brangwen had set her heart on it her slender pretty tightlycovered body with full skirts was now the centre of resolution in the house and when she had once set upon anything which was not often the family failed before her  so tom went to school an unwilling failure from the first he believed his mother was right in decreeing school for him but he knew she was only right because she would not acknowledge his constitution he knew with a childs deep instinctive foreknowledge of what is going to happen to him that he would cut a sorry figure at school but he took the infliction as inevitable as if he were guilty of his own nature as if his being were wrong and his mothers conception right if he could have been what he liked he would have been that which his mother fondly but deludedly hoped he was he would have been clever and capable of becoming a gentleman it was her aspiration for him therefore he knew it as the true aspiration for any boy but you cant make a silk purse out of a sows ear as he told his mother very early with regard to himself much to her mortification and chagrin  when he got to school he made a violent struggle against his physical inability to study he sat gripped making himself pale and ghastly in his effort to concentrate on the book to take in what he had to learn but it was no good if he beat down his first repulsion and got like a suicide to the stuff he went very little further he could not learn deliberately his mind simply did not work  in feeling he was developed sensitive to the atmosphere around him brutal perhaps but at the same time delicate very delicate so he had a low opinion of himself he knew his own limitation he knew that his brain was a slow hopeless goodfornothing so he was humble  but at the same time his feelings were more discriminating than those of most of the boys and he was confused he was more sensuously developed more refined in instinct than they for their mechanical stupidity he hated them and suffered cruel contempt for them but when it came to mental things then he was at a disadvantage he was at their mercy he was a fool he had not the power to controvert even the most stupid argument so that he was forced to admit things he did not in the least believe and having admitted them he did not know whether he believed them or not he rather thought he did  but he loved anyone who could convey enlightenment to him through feeling he sat betrayed with emotion when the teacher of literature read in a moving fashion tennysons ulysses or shelleys ode to the west wind his lips parted his eyes filled with a strained almost suffering light and the teacher read on fired by his power over the boy tom brangwen was moved by this experience beyond all calculation he almost dreaded it it was so deep but when almost secretly and shamefully he came to take the book himself and began the words oh wild west wind thou breath of autumns being the very fact of the print caused a prickly sensation of repulsion to go over his skin the blood came to his face his heart filled with a bursting passion of rage and incompetence he threw the book down and walked over it and went out to the cricket field and he hated books as if they were his enemies he hated them worse than ever he hated any person  he could not voluntarily control his attention his mind had no fixed habits to go by he had nothing to get hold of nowhere to start from for him there was nothing palpable nothing known in himself that he could apply to learning he did not know how to begin therefore he was helpless when it came to deliberate understanding or deliberate learning  he had an instinct for mathematics but if this failed him he was helpless as an idiot so that he felt that the ground was never sure under his feet he was nowhere his final downfall was his complete inability to attend to a question put without suggestion if he had to write a formal composition on the army he did at last learn to repeat the few facts he knew you can join the army at eighteen you have to be over five foot eight but he had all the time a living conviction that this was a dodge and that his commonplaces were beneath contempt then he reddened furiously felt his bowels sink with shame scratched out what he had written made an agonized effort to think of something in the real composition style failed became sullen with rage and humiliation put the pen down and would have been torn to pieces rather than attempt to write another word  he soon got used to the grammar school and the grammar school got used to him setting him down as a hopeless duffer at learning but respecting him for a generous honest nature only one narrow domineering fellow the latin master bullied him and made the blue eyes mad with shame and rage there was a horrid scene when the boy laid open the masters head with a slate and then things went on as before the teacher got little sympathy but brangwen winced and could not bear to think of the deed not even long after when he was a grown man  he was glad to leave school it had not been unpleasant he had enjoyed the companionship of the other youths or had thought he enjoyed it the time had passed very quickly in endless activity but he knew all the time that he was in an ignominious position in this place of learning he was aware of failure all the while of incapacity but he was too healthy and sanguine to be wretched he was too much alive yet his soul was wretched almost to hopelessness  he had loved one warm clever boy who was frail in body a consumptive type the two had had an almost classic friendship david and jonathan wherein brangwen was the jonathan the server but he had never felt equal with his friend because the others mind outpaced his and left him ashamed far in the rear so the two boys went at once apart on leaving school but brangwen always remembered his friend that had been kept him as a sort of light a fine experience to remember  tom brangwen was glad to get back to the farm where he was in his own again i have got a turnip on my shoulders let me stick to th fallow he said to his exasperated mother he had too low an opinion of himself but he went about at his work on the farm gladly enough glad of the active labour and the smell of the land again having youth and vigour and humour and a comic wit having the will and the power to forget his own shortcomings finding himself violent with occasional rages but usually on good terms with everybody and everything  when he was seventeen his father fell from a stack and broke his neck then the mother and son and daughter lived on at the farm interrupted by occasional loudmouthed lamenting jealousspirited visitations from the butcher frank who had a grievance against the world which he felt was always giving him less than his dues frank was particularly against the young tom whom he called a mardy baby and tom returned the hatred violently his face growing red and his blue eyes staring effie sided with tom against frank but when alfred came from nottingham heavy jowled and lowering speaking very little but treating those at home with some contempt effie and the mother sided with him and put tom into the shade it irritated the youth that his elder brother should be made something of a hero by the women just because he didnt live at home and was a lacedesigner and almost a gentleman but alfred was something of a prometheus bound so the women loved him tom came later to understand his brother better  as youngest son tom felt some importance when the care of the farm devolved on to him he was only eighteen but he was quite capable of doing everything his father had done and of course his mother remained as centre to the house  the young man grew up very fresh and alert with zest for every moment of life he worked and rode and drove to market he went out with companions and got tipsy occasionally and played skittles and went to the little travelling theatres once when he was drunk at a public house he went upstairs with a prostitute who seduced him he was then nineteen  the thing was something of a shock to him in the close intimacy of the farm kitchen the woman occupied the supreme position the men deferred to her in the house on all household points on all points of morality and behaviour the woman was the symbol for that further life which comprised religion and love and morality the men placed in her hands their own conscience they said to her be my consciencekeeper be the angel at the doorway guarding my outgoing and my incoming and the woman fulfilled her trust the men rested implicitly in her receiving her praise or her blame with pleasure or with anger rebelling and storming but never for a moment really escaping in their own souls from her prerogative they depended on her for their stability without her they would have felt like straws in the wind to be blown hither and thither at random she was the anchor and the security she was the restraining hand of god at times highly to be execrated  now when tom brangwen at nineteen a youth fresh like a plant rooted in his mother and his sister found that he had lain with a prostitute woman in a common public house he was very much startled for him there was until that time only one kind of womanhis mother and sister  but now he did not know what to feel there was a slight wonder a pang of anger of disappointment a first taste of ash and of cold fear lest this was all that would happen lest his relations with woman were going to be no more than this nothingness there was a slight sense of shame before the prostitute fear that she would despise him for his inefficiency there was a cold distaste for her and a fear of her there was a moment of paralyzed horror when he felt he might have taken a disease from her and upon all this startled tumult of emotion was laid the steadying hand of common sense which said it did not matter very much so long as he had no disease he soon recovered balance and really it did not matter so very much  but it had shocked him and put a mistrust into his heart and emphasized his fear of what was within himself he was however in a few days going about again in his own careless happygolucky fashion his blue eyes just as clear and honest as ever his face just as fresh his appetite just as keen  or apparently so he had in fact lost some of his buoyant confidence and doubt hindered his outgoing  for some time after this he was quieter more conscious when he drank more backward from companionship the disillusion of his first carnal contact with woman strengthened by his innate desire to find in a woman the embodiment of all his inarticulate powerful religious impulses put a bit in his mouth he had something to lose which he was afraid of losing which he was not sure even of possessing this first affair did not matter much but the business of love was at the bottom of his soul the most serious and terrifying of all to him  he was tormented now with sex desire his imagination reverted always to lustful scenes but what really prevented his returning to a loose woman over and above the natural squeamishness was the recollection of the paucity of the last experience it had been so nothing so dribbling and functional that he was ashamed to expose himself to the risk of a repetition of it  he made a strong instinctive fight to retain his native cheerfulness unimpaired he had naturally a plentiful stream of life and humour a sense of sufficiency and exuberance giving ease but now it tended to cause tension a strained light came into his eyes he had a slight knitting of the brows his boisterous humour gave place to lowering silences and days passed by in a sort of suspense  he did not know there was any difference in him exactly for the most part he was filled with slow anger and resentment but he knew he was always thinking of women or a woman day in day out and that infuriated him he could not get free and he was ashamed he had one or two sweethearts starting with them in the hope of speedy development but when he had a nice girl he found that he was incapable of pushing the desired development the very presence of the girl beside him made it impossible he could not think of her like that he could not think of her actual nakedness she was a girl and he liked her and dreaded violently even the thought of uncovering her he knew that in these last issues of nakedness he did not exist to her nor she to him again if he had a loose girl and things began to develop she offended him so deeply all the time that he never knew whether he was going to get away from her as quickly as possible or whether he were going to take her out of inflamed necessity again he learnt his lesson if he took her it was a paucity which he was forced to despise he did not despise himself nor the girl but he despised the net result in him of the experiencehe despised it deeply and bitterly  then when he was twentythree his mother died and he was left at home with effie his mothers death was another blow out of the dark he could not understand it he knew it was no good his trying one had to submit to these unforeseen blows that come unawares and leave a bruise that remains and hurts whenever it is touched he began to be afraid of all that which was up against him he had loved his mother  after this effie and he quarrelled fiercely they meant a very great deal to each other but they were both under a strange unnatural tension he stayed out of the house as much as possible he got a special corner for himself at the red lion at cossethay and became a usual figure by the fire a fresh fair young fellow with heavy limbs and head held back mostly silent though alert and attentive very hearty in his greeting of everybody he knew shy of strangers he teased all the women who liked him extremely and he was very attentive to the talk of the men very respectful  to drink made him quickly flush very red in the face and brought out the look of selfconsciousness and unsureness almost bewilderment in his blue eyes when he came home in this state of tipsy confusion his sister hated him and abused him and he went off his head like a mad bull with rage  he had still another turn with a lightolove one whitsuntide he went a jaunt with two other young fellows on horseback to matlock and thence to bakewell matlock was at that time just becoming a famous beautyspot visited from manchester and from the staffordshire towns in the hotel where the young men took lunch were two girls and the parties struck up a friendship  the miss who made up to tom brangwen then twentyfour years old was a handsome reckless girl neglected for an afternoon by the man who had brought her out she saw brangwen and liked him as all women did for his warmth and his generous nature and for the innate delicacy in him but she saw he was one who would have to be brought to the scratch however she was roused and unsatisfied and made mischievous so she dared anything it would be an easy interlude restoring her pride  she was a handsome girl with a bosom and dark hair and blue eyes a girl full of easy laughter flushed from the sun inclined to wipe her laughing face in a very natural and taking manner  brangwen was in a state of wonder he treated her with his chaffing deference roused but very unsure of himself afraid to death of being too forward ashamed lest he might be thought backward mad with desire yet restrained by instinctive regard for women from making any definite approach feeling all the while that his attitude was ridiculous and flushing deep with confusion she however became hard and daring as he became confused it amused her to see him come on  when must you get back she asked  im not particular he said  there the conversation again broke down  brangwens companions were ready to go on  art commin tom they called or art for stoppin  ay im commin he replied rising reluctantly an angry sense of futility and disappointment spreading over him  he met the full almost taunting look of the girl and he trembled with unusedness  shall you come an have a look at my mare he said to her with his hearty kindliness that was now shaken with trepidation  oh i should like to she said rising  and she followed him his rather sloping shoulders and his cloth ridinggaiters out of the room the young men got their own horses out of the stable  can you ride brangwen asked her  i should like to if i couldi have never tried she said  come then an have a try he said  and he lifted her he blushing she laughing into the saddle  i sll slip offits not a ladys saddle she cried  hold yer tight he said and he led her out of the hotel gate  the girl sat very insecurely clinging fast he put a hand on her waist to support her and he held her closely he clasped her as in an embrace he was weak with desire as he strode beside her  the horse walked by the river  you want to sit straddleleg he said to her  i know i do she said  it was the time of very full skirts she managed to get astride the horse quite decently showing an intent concern for covering her pretty leg  its a lots better this road she said looking down at him  ay it is he said feeling the marrow melt in his bones from the look in her eyes i dunno why they have that sidesaddle business twistin a woman in two  should us leave you thenyou seem to be fixed up there called brangwens companions from the road  he went red with anger  aydont worry he called back  how long are yer stoppin they asked  not after christmas he said  and the girl gave a tinkling peal of laughter  all rightbybye called his friends  and they cantered off leaving him very flushed trying to be quite normal with the girl but presently he had gone back to the hotel and given his horse into the charge of an ostler and had gone off with the girl into the woods not quite knowing where he was or what he was doing his heart thumped and he thought it the most glorious adventure and was mad with desire for the girl  afterwards he glowed with pleasure by jove but that was something like he stayed the afternoon with the girl and wanted to stay the night she however told him this was impossible her own man would be back by dark and she must be with him he brangwen must not let on that there had been anything between them  she gave him an intimate smile which made him feel confused and gratified  he could not tear himself away though he had promised not to interfere with the girl he stayed on at the hotel over night he saw the other fellow at the evening meal a small middleaged man with irongrey hair and a curious face like a monkeys but interesting in its way almost beautiful brangwen guessed that he was a foreigner he was in company with another an englishman dry and hard the four sat at table two men and two women brangwen watched with all his eyes  he saw how the foreigner treated the women with courteous contempt as if they were pleasing animals brangwens girl had put on a ladylike manner but her voice betrayed her she wanted to win back her man when dessert came on however the little foreigner turned round from his table and calmly surveyed the room like one unoccupied brangwen marvelled over the cold animal intelligence of the face the brown eyes were round showing all the brown pupil like a monkeys and just calmly looking perceiving the other person without referring to him at all they rested on brangwen the latter marvelled at the old face turned round on him looking at him without considering it necessary to know him at all the eyebrows of the round perceiving but unconcerned eyes were rather high up with slight wrinkles above them just as a monkeys had it was an old ageless face  the man was most amazingly a gentleman all the time an aristocrat brangwen stared fascinated the girl was pushing her crumbs about on the cloth uneasily flushed and angry  as brangwen sat motionless in the hall afterwards too much moved and lost to know what to do the little stranger came up to him with a beautiful smile and manner offering a cigarette and saying  will you smoke  brangwen never smoked cigarettes yet he took the one offered fumbling painfully with thick fingers blushing to the roots of his hair then he looked with his warm blue eyes at the almost sardonic lidded eyes of the foreigner the latter sat down beside him and they began to talk chiefly of horses  brangwen loved the other man for his exquisite graciousness for his tact and reserve and for his ageless monkeylike selfsurety they talked of horses and of derbyshire and of farming the stranger warmed to the young fellow with real warmth and brangwen was excited he was transported at meeting this odd middleaged dryskinned man personally the talk was pleasant but that did not matter so much it was the gracious manner the fine contact that was all  they talked a long while together brangwen flushing like a girl when the other did not understand his idiom then they said good night and shook hands again the foreigner bowed and repeated his good night  good night and bon voyage  then he turned to the stairs  brangwen went up to his room and lay staring out at the stars of the summer night his whole being in a whirl what was it all there was a life so different from what he knew it what was there outside his knowledge how much what was this that he had touched what was he in this new influence what did everything mean where was life in that which he knew or all outside him  he fell asleep and in the morning had ridden away before any other visitors were awake he shrank from seeing any of them again in the morning  his mind was one big excitement the girl and the foreigner he knew neither of their names yet they had set fire to the homestead of his nature and he would be burned out of cover of the two experiences perhaps the meeting with the foreigner was the more significant but the girlhe had not settled about the girl  he did not know he had to leave it there as it was he could not sum up his experiences  the result of these encounters was that he dreamed day and night absorbedly of a voluptuous woman and of the meeting with a small withered foreigner of ancient breeding no sooner was his mind free no sooner had he left his own companions than he began to imagine an intimacy with finetextured subtlemannered people such as the foreigner at matlock and amidst this subtle intimacy was always the satisfaction of a voluptuous woman  he went about absorbed in the interest and the actuality of this dream his eyes glowed he walked with his head up full of the exquisite pleasure of aristocratic subtlety and grace tormented with the desire for the girl  then gradually the glow began to fade and the cold material of his customary life to show through he resented it was he cheated in his illusion he balked the mean enclosure of reality stood stubbornly like a bull at a gate refusing to reenter the wellknown round of his own life  he drank more than usual to keep up the glow but it faded more and more for all that he set his teeth at the commonplace to which he would not submit it resolved itself starkly before him for all that  he wanted to marry to get settled somehow to get out of the quandary he found himself in but how he felt unable to move his limbs he had seen a little creature caught in birdlime and the sight was a nightmare to him he began to feel mad with the rage of impotency  he wanted something to get hold of to pull himself out but there was nothing steadfastly he looked at the young women to find a one he could marry but not one of them did he want and he knew that the idea of a life among such people as the foreigner was ridiculous  yet he dreamed of it and stuck to his dreams and would not have the reality of cossethay and ilkeston there he sat stubbornly in his corner at the red lion smoking and musing and occasionally lifting his beerpot and saying nothing for all the world like a gorping farmlabourer as he said himself  then a fever of restless anger came upon him he wanted to go awayright away he dreamed of foreign parts but somehow he had no contact with them and it was a very strong root which held him to the marsh to his own house and land  then effie got married and he was left in the house with only tilly the crosseyed womanservant who had been with them for fifteen years he felt things coming to a close all the time he had held himself stubbornly resistant to the action of the commonplace unreality which wanted to absorb him but now he had to do something  he was by nature temperate being sensitive and emotional his nausea prevented him from drinking too much  but in futile anger with the greatest of determination and apparent good humour he began to drink in order to get drunk damn it he said to himself you must have it one road or anotheryou cant hitch your horse to the shadow of a gatepostif youve got legs youve got to rise off your backside some time or other  so he rose and went down to ilkeston rather awkwardly took his place among a gang of young bloods stood drinks to the company and discovered he could carry it off quite well he had an idea that everybody in the room was a man after his own heart that everything was glorious everything was perfect when somebody in alarm told him his coat pocket was on fire he could only beam from a red blissful face and say issallriightissalriightits a rightlet it be let it be and he laughed with pleasure and was rather indignant that the others should think it unnatural for his coat pocket to burnit was the happiest and most natural thing in the worldwhat  he went home talking to himself and to the moon that was very high and small stumbling at the flashes of moonlight from the puddles at his feet wondering what the hanover then laughing confidently to the moon assuring her this was first class this was  in the morning he woke up and thought about it and for the first time in his life knew what it was to feel really acutely irritable in a misery of real bad temper after bawling and snarling at tilly he took himself off for very shame to be alone and looking at the ashen fields and the putty roads he wondered what in the name of hell he could do to get out of this prickly sense of disgust and physical repulsion and he knew that this was the result of his glorious evening  and his stomach did not want any more brandy he went doggedly across the fields with his terrier and looked at everything with a jaundiced eye  the next evening found him back again in his place at the red lion moderate and decent there he sat and stubbornly waited for what would happen next  did he or did he not believe that he belonged to this world of cossethay and ilkeston there was nothing in it he wanted yet could he ever get out of it was there anything in himself that would carry him out of it or was he a dunderheaded baby not man enough to be like the other young fellows who drank a good deal and wenched a little without any question and were satisfied  he went on stubbornly for a time then the strain became too great for him a hot accumulated consciousness was always awake in his chest his wrists felt swelled and quivering his mind became full of lustful images his eyes seemed bloodflushed he fought with himself furiously to remain normal he did not seek any woman he just went on as if he were normal till he must either take some action or beat his head against the wall  then he went deliberately to ilkeston in silence intent and beaten he drank to get drunk he gulped down the brandy and more brandy till his face became pale his eyes burning and still he could not get free he went to sleep in drunken unconsciousness woke up at four oclock in the morning and continued drinking he would get free gradually the tension in him began to relax he began to feel happy his riveted silence was unfastened he began to talk and babble he was happy and at one with all the world he was united with all flesh in a hot bloodrelationship so after three days of incessant brandydrinking he had burned out the youth from his blood he had achieved this kindled state of oneness with all the world which is the end of youths most passionate desire but he had achieved his satisfaction by obliterating his own individuality that which it depended on his manhood to preserve and develop  so he became a boutdrinker having at intervals these bouts of three or four days of brandydrinking when he was drunk for the whole time he did not think about it a deep resentment burned in him he kept aloof from any women antagonistic  when he was twentyeight a thicklimbed stiff fair man with fresh complexion and blue eyes staring very straight ahead he was coming one day down from cossethay with a load of seed out of nottingham it was a time when he was getting ready for another bout of drinking so he stared fixedly before him watchful yet absorbed seeing everything and aware of nothing coiled in himself it was early in the year  he walked steadily beside the horse the load clanked behind as the hill descended steeper the road curved downhill before him under banks and hedges seen only for a few yards ahead  slowly turning the curve at the steepest part of the slope his horse britching between the shafts he saw a woman approaching but he was thinking for the moment of the horse  then he turned to look at her she was dressed in black was apparently rather small and slight beneath her long black cloak and she wore a black bonnet she walked hastily as if unseeing her head rather forward it was her curious absorbed flitting motion as if she were passing unseen by everybody that first arrested him  she had heard the cart and looked up her face was pale and clear she had thick dark eyebrows and a wide mouth curiously held he saw her face clearly as if by a light in the air he saw her face so distinctly that he ceased to coil on himself and was suspended  thats her he said involuntarily as the cart passed by splashing through the thin mud she stood back against the bank then as he walked still beside his britching horse his eyes met hers he looked quickly away pressing back his head a pain of joy running through him he could not bear to think of anything  he turned round at the last moment he saw her bonnet her shape in the black cloak the movement as she walked then she was gone round the bend  she had passed by he felt as if he were walking again in a far world not cossethay a far world the fragile reality he went on quiet suspended rarefied he could not bear to think or to speak nor make any sound or sign nor change his fixed motion he could scarcely bear to think of her face he moved within the knowledge of her in the world that was beyond reality  the feeling that they had exchanged recognition possessed him like a madness like a torment how could he be sure what confirmation had he the doubt was like a sense of infinite space a nothingness annihilating he kept within his breast the will to surety they had exchanged recognition  he walked about in this state for the next few days and then again like a mist it began to break to let through the common barren world he was very gentle with man and beast but he dreaded the starkness of disillusion cropping through again  as he was standing with his back to the fire after dinner a few days later he saw the woman passing he wanted to know that she knew him that she was aware he wanted it said that there was something between them so he stood anxiously watching looking at her as she went down the road he called to tilly  who might that be he asked  tilly the crosseyed woman of forty who adored him ran gladly to the window to look she was glad when he asked her for anything she craned her head over the short curtain the little tight knob of her black hair sticking out pathetically as she bobbed about  oh whyshe lifted her head and peered with her twisted keen brown eyeswhy you know who it isits her from th vicarageyou know  how do i know you henbird he shouted  tilly blushed and drew her neck in and looked at him with her squinting sharp almost reproachful look  why you doits the new housekeeper  ayan what by that  well an what by that rejoined the indignant tilly  shes a woman isnt she housekeeper or no housekeeper shes got more to her than that who is sheshes got a name  well if she has i dont know retorted tilly not to be

tilly who loved nothing more than these tilts when he would call her names  there was a lull  i dont believe as anybody could keep it in their head the womanservant continued tentatively  what he

past  youd have to be rattling your tongues if anything went past  brangwen stood musing that evening he went up to cossethay to the red lion half with the intention of hearing more  she was the widow of a polish doctor he gathered her husband had died a refugee in london she spoke a bit foreignlike but you could easily make out what she said she had one little girl named anna lensky was the womans name mrs lensky  brangwen felt that here was the unreality established at last he felt also a curious certainty about her as if she were destined to him it was to him a profound satisfaction that she was a foreigner  a swift change had taken place on the earth for him as if a new creation were fulfilled in which he had real existence things had all been stark unreal barren mere nullities before now they were actualities that he could handle  he dared scarcely think of the woman he was afraid only all the time he was aware of her presence not far off he lived in her but he dared not know her even acquaint himself with her by thinking of her  one day he met her walking along the road with her little girl it was a child with a face like a bud of appleblossom and glistening fair hair like thistledown sticking out in straight wild flamy pieces and very dark eyes the child clung jealously to her mothers side when he looked at her staring with resentful black eyes but the mother glanced at him again almost vacantly and the very vacancy of her look inflamed him she had wide greybrown eyes with very dark fathomless pupils he felt the fine flame running under his skin as if all his veins had caught fire on the surface and he went on walking without knowledge  it was coming he knew his fate the world was submitting to its transformation he made no move it would come what would come  when his sister effie came to the marsh for a week he went with her for once to church in the tiny place with its mere dozen pews he sat not far from the stranger there was a fineness about her a poignancy about the way she sat and held her head lifted she was strange from far off yet so intimate she was from far away a presence so close to his soul she was not really there sitting in cossethay church beside her little girl she was not living the apparent life of her days she belonged to somewhere else he felt it poignantly as something real and natural but a pang of fear for his own concrete life that was only cossethay hurt him and gave him misgiving  her thick dark brows almost met above her irregular nose she had a wide rather thick mouth but her face was lifted to another world of life not to heaven or death but to some place where she still lived in spite of her bodys absence  the child beside her watched everything with wide black eyes she had an odd little defiant look her little red mouth was pinched shut she seemed to be jealously guarding something to be always on the alert for defence she met brangwens near vacant intimate gaze and a palpitating hostility almost like a flame of pain came into the wide overconscious dark eyes  the old clergyman droned on cossethay sat unmoved as usual and there was the foreign woman with a foreign air about her inviolate and the strange child also foreign jealously guarding something  when the service was over he walked in the way of another existence out of the church as he went down the churchpath with his sister behind the woman and child the little girl suddenly broke from her mothers hand and slipped back with quick almost invisible movement and was picking at something almost under brangwens feet her tiny fingers were fine and quick but they missed the red button  have you found something said brangwen to her  and he also stooped for the button but she had got it and she stood back with it pressed against her little coat her black eyes flaring at him as if to forbid him to notice her then having silenced him she turned with a swift mother and was gone down the path  the mother had stood watching impassive looking not at the child but at brangwen he became aware of the woman looking at him standing there isolated yet for him dominant in her foreign existence  he did not know what to do and turned to his sister but the wide grey eyes almost vacant yet so moving held him beyond himself  mother i may have it maynt i came the childs proud silvery tones mothershe seemed always to be calling her mother to remember hermotherand she had nothing to continue now her mother had replied yes my child but with ready invention the child stumbled and ran on what are those peoples names  brangwen heard the abstract  i dont know dear  he went on down the road as if he were not living inside himself but somewhere outside  who was that person his sister effie asked  i couldnt tell you he answered unknowing  shes somebody very funny said effie almost in condemnation that childs like one bewitched  bewitchedhow bewitched he repeated  you can see for yourself the mothers plain i must saybut the child is like a changeling shed be about thirtyfive  but he took no notice his sister talked on  theres your woman for you she continued youd better marry her but still he took no notice things were as they were  another day at teatime as he sat alone at table there came a knock at the front door it startled him like a portent no one ever knocked at the front door he rose and began slotting back the bolts turning the big key when he had opened the door the strange woman stood on the threshold  can you give me a pound of butter she asked in a curious detached way of one speaking a foreign language  he tried to attend to her question she was looking at him questioningly but underneath the question what was there in her very standing motionless which affected him  he stepped aside and she at once entered the house as if the door had been opened to admit her that startled him it was the custom for everybody to wait on the doorstep till asked inside he went into the kitchen and she followed  his teathings were spread on the scrubbed deal table a big fire was burning a dog rose from the hearth and went to her she stood motionless just inside the kitchen  tilly he called loudly have we got any butter  the stranger stood there like a silence in her black cloak  eh came the shrill cry from the distance  he shouted his question again  weve got whats on t table answered tillys shrill voice out of the dairy  brangwen looked at the table there was a large pat of butter on a plate almost a pound it was round and stamped with acorns and oakleaves  cant you come when youre wanted he shouted  why what dyou want tilly protested as she came peeking inquisitively through the other door  she saw the strange woman stared at her with crosseyes but said nothing  havent we any butter asked brangwen again impatiently as if he could command some by his question  i tell you theres whats on t table said tilly impatient that she was unable to create any to his demand we havent a morsel besides  there was a moments silence  the stranger spoke in her curiously distinct detached manner of one who must think her speech first  oh then thank you very much i am sorry that i have come to trouble you  she could not understand the entire lack of manners was slightly puzzled any politeness would have made the situation quite impersonal but here it was a case of wills in confusion brangwen flushed at her polite speech still he did not let her go  get summat an wrap that up for her he said to tilly looking at the butter on the table  and taking a clean knife he cut off that side of the butter where it was touched  his speech the for her penetrated slowly into the foreign woman and angered tilly  vicar has his butter fra browns by rights said the insuppressible servantwoman we sll be churnin tomorrow mornin first thing  yesthe longdrawn foreign yesyes said the polish woman i went to mrs browns she hasnt any more  tilly bridled her head bursting to say that according to the etiquette of people who bought butter it was no sort of manners whatever coming to a place cool as you like and knocking at the front door asking for a pound as a stopgap while your other people were short if you go to browns you go to browns an my butter isnt just to make shift when browns has got none  brangwen understood perfectly this unspoken speech of tillys the polish lady did not and as she wanted butter for the vicar and as tilly was churning in the morning she waited  sluther up now said brangwen loudly after this silence had resolved itself out and tilly disappeared through the inner door  i am afraid that i should not come so said the stranger looking at him enquiringly as if referring to him for what it was usual to do  he felt confused  hows that he said trying to be genial and being only protective  do you she began deliberately but she was not sure of her ground and the conversation came to an end her eyes looked at him all the while because she could not speak the language  they stood facing each other the dog walked away from her to him he bent down to it  and hows your little girl he asked  yes thank you she is very well was the reply a phrase of polite speech in a foreign language merely  sit you down he said  and she sat in a chair her slim arms coming through the slits of her cloak resting on her lap  youre not used to these parts he said still standing on the hearthrug with his back to the fire coatless looking with curious directness at the woman her selfpossession pleased him and inspired him set him curiously free it seemed to him almost brutal to feel so master of himself and of the situation  her eyes rested on him for a moment questioning as she thought of the meaning of his speech  no she said understanding noit is strange  you find it middlin rough he said  her eyes waited on him so that he should say it again  our ways are rough to you he repeated  yesyes i understand yes it is different it is strange but i was in yorkshire  oh well then he said its no worse here than what they are up there  she did not quite understand his protective manner and his sureness and his intimacy puzzled her what did he mean if he was her equal why did he behave so without formality  no she said vaguely her eyes resting on him  she saw him fresh and naive uncouth almost entirely beyond relationship with her yet he was goodlooking with his fair hair and blue eyes full of energy and with his healthy body that seemed to take equality with her she watched him steadily he was difficult for her to understand warm uncouth and confident as he was sure on his feet as if he did not know what it was to be unsure what then was it that gave him this curious stability  she did not know she wondered she looked round the room he lived in it had a close intimacy that fascinated and almost frightened her the furniture was old and familiar as old people the whole place seemed so kin to him as if it partook of his being that she was uneasy  it is already a long time that you have lived in this houseyes she asked  ive always lived here he said  yesbut your peopleyour family  weve been here above two hundred years he said her eyes were on him all the time wideopen and trying to grasp him he felt that he was there for her  it is your own place the house the farm  yes he said he looked down at her and met her look it disturbed her she did not know him he was a foreigner they had nothing to do with each other yet his look disturbed her to knowledge of him he was so strangely confident and direct  you live quite alone  yesif you call it alone  she did not understand it seemed unusual to her what was the meaning of it  and whenever her eyes after watching him for some time inevitably met his she was aware of a heat beating up over her consciousness she sat motionless and in conflict who was this strange man who was at once so near to her what was happening to her something in his young warmtwinkling eyes seemed to assume a right to her to speak to her to extend her his protection but how why did he speak to her why were his eyes so certain so full of light and confident waiting for no permission nor signal  tilly returned with a large leaf and found the two silent at once he felt it incumbent on him to speak now the servingwoman had come back  how old is your little girl he asked  four years she replied  her father hasnt been dead long then he asked  she was one year when he died  three years  yes three years that he is deadyes  curiously quiet she was almost abstracted answering these questions she looked at him again with some maidenhood opening in her eyes he felt he could not move neither towards her nor away from her something about her presence hurt him till he was almost rigid before her he saw the girls wondering look rise in her eyes  tilly handed her the butter and she rose  thank you very much she said how much is it  well make th vicar a present of it he said itll do for me goin to church  it ud look better of you if you went to church and took th money for your butter said tilly persistent in her claim to him  youd have to put in shouldnt you he said  how much please said the polish woman to tilly brangwen stood by and let be  then thank you very much she said  bring your little girl down sometime to look at th fowls and horses he saidif shed like it  yes she would like it said the stranger  and she went brangwen stood dimmed by her departure he could not notice tilly who was looking at him uneasily wanting to be reassured he could not think of anything he felt that he had made some invisible connection with the strange woman  a daze had come over his mind he had another centre of consciousness in his breast or in his bowels somewhere in his body there had started another activity it was as if a strong light were burning there and he was blind within it unable to know anything except that this transfiguration burned between him and her connecting them like a secret power  since she had come to the house he went about in a daze scarcely seeing even the things he handled drifting quiescent in a state of metamorphosis he submitted to that which was happening to him letting go his will suffering the loss of himself dormant always on the brink of ecstasy like a creature evolving to a new birth  she came twice with her child to the farm but there was this lull between them an intense calm and passivity like a torpor upon them so that there was no active change took place he was almost unaware of the child yet by his native good humour he gained her confidence even her affection setting her on a horse to ride giving her corn for the fowls  once he drove the mother and child from ilkeston picking them up on the road the child huddled close to him as if for love the mother sat very still there was a vagueness like a soft mist over all of them and a silence as if their wills were suspended only he saw her hands ungloved folded in her lap and he noticed the weddingring on her finger it excluded him it was a closed circle it bound her life the weddingring it stood for her life in which he could have no part nevertheless beyond all this there was herself and himself which should meet  as he helped her down from the trap almost lifting her he felt he had some right to take her thus between his hands she belonged as yet to that other to that which was behind but he must care for her also she was too living to be neglected  sometimes her vagueness in which he was lost made him angry made him rage but he held himself still as yet she had no response no being towards him it puzzled and enraged him but he submitted for a long time then from the accumulated troubling of her ignoring him gradually a fury broke out destructive and he wanted to go away to escape her  it happened she came down to the marsh with the child whilst he was in this state then he stood over against her strong and heavy in his revolt and though he said nothing still she felt his anger and heavy impatience grip hold of her she was shaken again as out of a torpor again her heart stirred with a quick outrunning impulse she looked at him at the stranger who was not a gentleman yet who insisted on coming into her life and the pain of a new birth in herself strung all her veins to a new form she would have to begin again to find a new being a new form to respond to that blind insistent figure standing over against her  a shiver a sickness of new birth passed over her the flame leaped up him under his skin she wanted it this new life from him with him yet she must defend herself against it for it was a destruction  as he worked alone on the land or sat up with his ewes at lambing time the facts and material of his daily life fell away leaving the kernel of his purpose clean and then it came upon him that he would marry her and she would be his life  gradually even without seeing her he came to know her he would have liked to think of her as of something given into his protection like a child without parents but it was forbidden him he had to come down from this pleasant view of the case she might refuse him and besides he was afraid of her  but during the long february nights with the ewes in labour looking out from the shelter into the flashing stars he knew he did not belong to himself he must admit that he was only fragmentary something incomplete and subject there were the stars in the dark heaven travelling the whole host passing by on some eternal voyage so he sat small and submissive to the greater ordering  unless she would come to him he must remain as a nothingness it was a hard experience but after her repeated obliviousness to him after he had seen so often that he did not exist for her after he had raged and tried to escape and said he was good enough by himself he was a man and could stand alone he must in the starry multiplicity of the night humble himself and admit and know that without her he was nothing  he was nothing but with her he would be real if she were now walking across the frosty grass near the sheepshelter through the fretful bleating of the ewes and lambs she would bring him completeness and perfection and if it should be so that she should come to him it should be soit was ordained so  he was a long time resolving definitely to ask her to marry him and he knew if he asked her she must really acquiesce she must it could not be otherwise  he had learned a little of her she was poor quite alone and had had a hard time in london both before and after her husband died but in poland she was a lady well born a landowners daughter  all these things were only words to him the fact of her superior birth the fact that her husband had been a brilliant doctor the fact that he himself was her inferior in almost every way of distinction there was an inner reality a logic of the soul which connected her with him  one evening in march when the wind was roaring outside came the moment to ask her he had sat with his hands before him leaning to the fire and as he watched the fire he knew almost without thinking that he was going this evening  have you got a clean shirt he asked tilly  you know youve got clean shirts she said  aybring me a white one  tilly brought down one of the linen shirts he had inherited from his father putting it before him to air at the fire she loved him with a dumb aching love as he sat leaning with his arms on his knees still and absorbed unaware of her lately a quivering inclination to cry had come over her when she did anything for him in his presence now her hands trembled as she spread the shirt he was never shouting and teasing now the deep stillness there was in the house made her tremble  he went to wash himself queer little breaks of consciousness seemed to rise and burst like bubbles out of the depths of his stillness  its got to be done he said as he stooped to take the shirt out of the fender its got to be done so why balk it and as he combed his hair before the mirror on the wall he retorted to himself superficially the womans not speechless dumb shes not clutterin at the nipple shes got the right to please herself and displease whosoever she likes  this streak of common sense carried him a little further  did you want anythink asked tilly suddenly appearing having heard him speak she stood watching him comb his fair beard his eyes were calm and uninterrupted  ay he said where have you put the scissors  she brought them to him and stood watching as chin forward he trimmed his beard  dont go an crop yourself as if you was at a shearin contest she said anxiously he blew the finecurled hair quickly off his lips  he put on all clean clothes folded his stock carefully and donned his best coat then being ready as grey twilight was falling he went across to the orchard to gather the daffodils the wind was roaring in the apple trees the yellow flowers swayed violently up and down he heard even the fine whisper of their spears as he stooped to break the flattened brittle stems of the flowers  whats todo shouted a friend who met him as he left the garden gate  bit of courtin like said brangwen  and tilly in a great state of trepidation and excitement let the wind whisk her over the field to the big gate whence she could watch him go  he went up the hill and on towards the vicarage the wind roaring through the hedges whilst he tried to shelter his bunch of daffodils by his side he did not think of anything only knew that the wind was blowing  night was falling the bare trees drummed and whistled the vicar he knew would be in his study the polish woman in the kitchen a comfortable room with her child in the darkest of twilight he went through the gate and down the path where a few daffodils stooped in the wind and shattered crocuses made a pale colourless ravel  there was a light streaming on to the bushes at the back from the kitchen window he began to hesitate how could he do this looking through the window he saw her seated in the rockingchair with the child already in its nightdress sitting on her knee the fair head with its wild fierce hair was drooping towards the firewarmth which reflected on the bright cheeks and clear skin of the child who seemed to be musing almost like a grownup person the mothers face was dark and still and he saw with a pang that she was away back in the life that had been the childs hair gleamed like spun glass her face was illuminated till it seemed like wax lit up from the inside the wind boomed strongly mother and child sat motionless silent the child staring with vacant dark eyes into the fire the mother looking into space the little girl was almost asleep it was her will which kept her eyes so wide  suddenly she looked round troubled as the wind shook the house and brangwen saw the small lips move the mother began to rock he heard the slight crunch of the rockers of the chair then he heard the low monotonous murmur of a song in a foreign language then a great burst of wind the mother seemed to have drifted away the childs eyes were black and dilated brangwen looked up at the clouds which packed in great alarming haste across the dark sky  then there came the childs high complaining yet imperative voice  dont sing that stuff mother i dont want to hear it  the singing died away  you will go to bed said the mother  he saw the clinging protest of the child the unmoved farawayness of the mother the clinging grasping effort of the child then suddenly the clear childish challenge  i want you to tell me a story  the wind blew the story began the child nestled against the mother brangwen waited outside suspended looking at the wild waving of the trees in the wind and the gathering darkness he had his fate to follow he lingered there at the threshold  the child crouched distinct and motionless curled in against her mother the eyes dark and unblinking among the keen wisps of hair like a curledup animal asleep but for the eyes the mother sat as if in shadow the story went on as if by itself brangwen stood outside seeing the night fall he did not notice the passage of time the hand that held the daffodils was fixed and cold  the story came to an end the mother rose at last with the child clinging round her neck she must be strong to carry so large a child so easily the little anna clung round her mothers neck the fair strange face of the child looked over the shoulder of the mother all asleep but the eyes and these wide and dark kept up the resistance and the fight with something unseen  when they were gone brangwen stirred for the first time from the place where he stood and looked round at the night he wished it were really as beautiful and familiar as it seemed in these few moments of release along with the child he felt a curious strain on him a suffering like a fate  the mother came down again and began folding the childs clothes he knocked she opened wondering a little bit at bay like a foreigner uneasy  good evening he said ill just come in a minute  a change went quickly over her face she was unprepared she looked down at him as he stood in the light from the window holding the daffodils the darkness behind in his black clothes she again did not know him she was almost afraid  but he was already stepping on to the threshold and closing the door behind him she turned into the kitchen startled out of herself by this invasion from the night he took off his hat and came towards her then he stood in the light in his black clothes and his black stock hat in one hand and yellow flowers in the other she stood away at his mercy snatched out of herself she did not know him only she knew he was a man come for her she could only see the darkclad mans figure standing there upon her and the gripped fist of flowers she could not see the face and the living eyes  he was watching her without knowing her only aware underneath of her presence  i come to have a word with you he said striding forward to the table laying down his hat and the flowers which tumbled apart and lay in a loose heap she had flinched from his advance she had no will no being the wind boomed in the chimney and he waited he had disembarrassed his hands now he shut his fists  he was aware of her standing there unknown dread yet related to him  i came up he said speaking curiously matteroffact and level to ask if youd marry me you are free arent you  there was a long silence whilst his blue eyes strangely impersonal looked into her eyes to seek an answer to the truth he was looking for the truth out of her and she as if hypnotized must answer at length  yes i am free to marry  the expression of his eyes changed became less impersonal as if he were looking almost at her for the truth of her steady and intent and eternal they were as if they would never change they seemed to fix and to resolve her she quivered feeling herself created willless lapsing into him into a common will with him  you want me she said  a pallor came over his face  yes he said  still there was no response and silence  no she said not of herself no i dont know  he felt the tension breaking up in him his fists slackened he was unable to move he stood there looking at her helpless in his vague collapse for the moment she had become unreal to him then he saw her come to him curiously direct and as if without movement in a sudden flow she put her hand to his coat  yes i want to she said impersonally looking at him with wide candid newlyopened eyes opened now with supreme truth he went very white as he stood and did not move only his eyes were held by hers and he suffered she seemed to see him with her newlyopened wide eyes almost of a child and with a strange movement that was agony to him she reached slowly forward her dark face and her breast to him with a slow insinuation of a kiss that made something break in his brain and it was darkness over him for a few moments  he had her in his arms and obliterated was kissing her and it was sheer bleached agony to him to break away from himself she was there so small and light and accepting in his arms like a child and yet with such an insinuation of embrace of infinite embrace that he could not bear it he could not stand  he turned and looked for a chair and keeping her still in his arms sat down with her close to him to his breast then for a few seconds he went utterly to sleep asleep and sealed in the darkest sleep utter extreme oblivion  from which he came to gradually always holding her warm and close upon him and she as utterly silent as he involved in the same oblivion the fecund darkness  he returned gradually but newly created as after a gestation a new birth in the womb of darkness aerial and light everything was new as a morning fresh and newlybegun like a dawn the newness and the bliss filled in and she sat utterly still with him as if in the same  then she looked up at him the wide young eyes blazing with light and he bent down and kissed her on the lips and the dawn blazed in them their new life came to pass it was beyond all conceiving good it was so good that it was almost like a passingaway a trespass he drew her suddenly closer to him  for soon the light began to fade in her gradually and as she was in his arms her head sank she leaned it against him and lay still with sunk head a little tired effaced because she was tired and in her tiredness was a certain negation of him  there is the child she said out of the long silence  he did not understand it was a long time since he had heard a voice now also he heard the wind roaring as if it had just begun again  yes he said not understanding there was a slight contraction of pain at his heart a slight tension on his brows something he wanted to grasp and could not  you will love her she said  the quick contraction like pain went over him again  i love her now he said  she lay still against him taking his physical warmth without heed it was great confirmation for him to feel her there absorbing the warmth from him giving him back her weight and her strange confidence but where was she that she seemed so absent his mind was open with wonder he did not know her  but i am much older than you she said  how old he asked  i am thirtyfour she said  i am twentyeight he said  six years  she was oddly concerned even as if it pleased her a little he sat and listened and wondered it was rather splendid to be so ignored by her whilst she lay against him and he lifted her with his breathing and felt her weight upon his living so he had a completeness and an inviolable power he did not interfere with her he did not even know her it was so strange that she lay there with her weight abandoned upon him he was silent with delight he felt strong physically carrying her on his breathing the strange inviolable completeness of the two of them made him feel as sure and as stable as god amused he wondered what the vicar would say if he knew  you neednt stop here much longer housekeeping he said  i like it also here she said when one has been in many places it is very nice here  he was silent again at this so close on him she lay and yet she answered him from so far away but he did not mind  what was your own home like when you were little he asked  my father was a landowner she replied it was near a river  this did not convey much to him all was as vague as before but he did not care whilst she was so close  i am a landownera little one he said  yes she said  he had not dared to move he sat there with his arms round her her lying motionless on his breathing and for a long time he did not stir then softly timidly his hand settled on the roundness of her arm on the unknown she seemed to lie a little closer a hot flame licked up from his belly to his chest  but it was too soon she rose and went across the room to a drawer taking out a little traycloth there was something quiet and professional about her she had been a nurse beside her husband both in warsaw and in the rebellion afterwards she proceeded to set a tray it was as if she ignored brangwen he sat up unable to bear a contradiction in her she moved about inscrutably  then as he sat there all mused and wondering she came near to him looking at him with wide grey eyes that almost smiled with a low light but her uglybeautiful mouth was still unmoved and sad he was afraid  his eyes strained and roused with unusedness quailed a little before her he felt himself quailing and yet he rose as if obedient to her he bent and kissed her heavy sad wide mouth that was kissed and did not alter fear was too strong in him again he had not got her  she turned away the vicarage kitchen was untidy and yet to him beautiful with the untidiness of her and her child such a wonderful remoteness there was about her and then something in touch with him that made his heart knock in his chest he stood there and waited suspended  again she came to him as he stood in his black clothes with blue eyes very bright and puzzled for her his face tensely alive his hair dishevelled she came close up to him to his intent blackclothed body and laid her hand on his arm he remained unmoved her eyes with a blackness of memory struggling with passion primitive and electric away at the back of them rejected him and absorbed him at once but he remained himself he breathed with difficulty and sweat came out at the roots of his hair on his forehead  do you want to marry me she asked slowly always uncertain  he was afraid lest he could not speak he drew breath hard saying  i do  then again what was agony to him with one hand lightly resting on his arm she leaned forward a little and with a strange primeval suggestion of embrace held him her mouth it was uglybeautiful and he could not bear it he put his mouth on hers and slowly slowly the response came gathering force and passion till it seemed to him she was thundering at him till he could bear no more he drew away white unbreathing only in his blue eyes was something of himself concentrated and in her eyes was a little smile upon a black void  she was drifting away from him again and he wanted to go away it was intolerable he could bear no more he must go yet he was irresolute but she turned away from him  with a little pang of anguish of denial it was decided  ill come an speak to the vicar tomorrow he said taking his hat  she looked at him her eyes expressionless and full of darkness he could see no answer  thatll do wont it he said  yes she answered mere echo without body or meaning  good night he said  good night  he left her standing there expressionless and void as she was then she went on laying the tray for the vicar needing the table she put the daffodils aside on the dresser without noticing them only their coolness touching her hand remained echoing there a long while  they were such strangers they must for ever be such strangers that his passion was a clanging torment to him such intimacy of embrace and such utter foreignness of contact it was unbearable he could not bear to be near her and know the utter foreignness between them know how entirely they were strangers to each other he went out into the wind big holes were blown into the sky the moonlight blew about sometimes a high moon liquidbrilliant scudded across a hollow space and took cover under electric browniridescent cloudedges then there was a blot of cloud and shadow then somewhere in the night a radiance again like a vapour and all the sky was teeming and tearing along a vast disorder of flying shapes and darkness and ragged fumes of light and a great brown circling halo then the terror of a moon running liquidbrilliant into the open for a moment hurting the eyes before she plunged under cover of cloud again    chapter ii  they live at the marsh  she was the daughter of a polish landowner who deeply in debt to the jews had married a german wife with money and who had died just before the rebellion quite young she had married paul lensky an intellectual who had studied at berlin and had returned to warsaw a patriot her mother had married a german merchant and gone away  lydia lensky married to the young doctor became with him a patriot and an émancipée they were poor but they were very conceited she learned nursing as a mark of her emancipation they represented in poland the new movement just begun in russia but they were very patriotic and at the same time very european  they had two children then came the great rebellion lensky very ardent and full of words went about inciting his countrymen little poles flamed down the streets of warsaw on the way to shoot every muscovite so they crossed into the south of russia and it was common for six little insurgents to ride into a jewish village brandishing swords and words emphasizing the fact that they were going to shoot every living muscovite  lensky was something of a fireeater also lydia tempered by her german blood coming of a different family was obliterated carried along in her husbands emphasis of declaration and his whirl of patriotism he was indeed a brave man but no bravery could quite have equalled the vividness of his talk he worked very hard till nothing lived in him but his eyes and lydia as if drugged followed him like a shadow serving echoing sometimes she had her two children sometimes they were left behind  she returned once to find them both dead of diphtheria her husband wept aloud unaware of everybody but the war went on and soon he was back at his work a darkness had come over lydias mind she walked always in a shadow silenced with a strange deep terror having hold of her her desire was to seek satisfaction in dread to enter a nunnery to satisfy the instincts of dread in her through service of a dark religion but she could not  then came the flight to london lensky the little thin man had got all his life locked into a resistance and could not relax again he lived in a sort of insane irritability touchy haughty to the last degree fractious so that as assistant doctor in one of the hospitals he soon became impossible they were almost beggars but he kept still his great ideas of himself he seemed to live in a complete hallucination where he himself figured vivid and lordly he guarded his wife jealously against the ignominy of her position rushed round her like a brandished weapon an amazing sight to the english eye had her in his power as if he hypnotized her she was passive dark always in shadow  he was wasting away already when the child was born he seemed nothing but skin and bone and fixed idea she watched him dying nursed him nursed the baby but really took no notice of anything a darkness was on her like remorse or like a remembering of the dark savage mystic ride of dread of death of the shadow of revenge when her husband died she was relieved he would no longer dart about her  england fitted her mood its aloofness and foreignness she had known a little of the language before coming and a sort of parrotmind made her pick it up fairly easily but she knew nothing of the english nor of english life indeed these did not exist for her she was like one walking in the underworld where the shades throng intelligibly but have no connection with one she felt the english people as a potent cold slightly hostile host amongst whom she walked isolated  the english people themselves were almost deferential to her the church saw that she did not want she walked without passion like a shade tormented into moments of love by the child her dying husband with his tortured eyes and the skin drawn tight over his face he was as a vision to her not a reality in a vision he was buried and put away then the vision ceased she was untroubled time went on grey uncoloured like a long journey where she sat unconscious as the landscape unrolled beside her when she rocked her baby at evening maybe she fell into a polish slumber song or she talked sometimes to herself in polish otherwise she did not think of poland nor of that life to which she had belonged it was a great blot looming blank in its darkness in the superficial activity of her life she was all english she even thought in english but her long blanks and darknesses of abstraction were polish  so she lived for some time then with slight uneasiness she used half to awake to the streets of london she realized that there was something around her very foreign she realized she was in a strange place and then she was sent away into the country there came into her mind now the memory of her home where she had been a child the big house among the land the peasants of the village  she was sent to yorkshire to nurse an old rector in his rectory by the sea this was the first shake of the kaleidoscope that brought in front of her eyes something she must see it hurt her brain the open country and the moors it hurt her and hurt her yet it forced itself upon her as something living it roused some potency of her childhood in her it had some relation to her  there was green and silver and blue in the air about her now and there was a strange insistence of light from the sea to which she must attend primroses glimmered around many of them and she stooped to the disturbing influence near her feet she even picked one or two flowers faintly remembering in the new colour of life what had been all the day long as she sat at the upper window the light came off the sea constantly constantly without refusal till it seemed to bear her away and the noise of the sea created a drowsiness in her a relaxation like sleep her automatic consciousness gave way a little she stumbled sometimes she had a poignant momentary vision of her living child that hurt her unspeakably her soul roused to attention  very strange was the constant glitter of the sea unsheathed in heaven very warm and sweet the graveyard in a nook of the hill catching the sunshine and holding it as one holds a bee between the palms of the hands when it is benumbed grey grass and lichens and a little church and snowdrops among coarse grass and a cupful of incredibly warm sunshine  she was troubled in spirit hearing the rushing of the beck away down under the trees she was startled and wondered what it was walking down she found the bluebells around her glowing like a presence among the trees  summer came the moors were tangled with harebells like water in the ruts of the roads the heather came rosy under the skies setting the whole world awake and she was uneasy she went past the gorse bushes shrinking from their presence she stepped into the heather as into a quickening bath that almost hurt her fingers moved over the clasped fingers of the child she heard the anxious voice of the baby as it tried to make her talk distraught  and she shrank away again back into her darkness and for a long while remained blotted safely away from living but autumn came with the faint red glimmer of robins singing winter darkened the moors and almost savagely she turned again to life demanding her life back again demanding that it should be as it had been when she was a girl on the land at home under the sky snow lay in great expanses the telegraph posts strode over the white earth away under the gloom of the sky and savagely her desire rose in her again demanding that this was poland her youth that all was her own again  but there were no sledges nor bells she did not see the peasants coming out like new people in their sheepskins and their fresh ruddy bright faces that seemed to become new and vivid when the snow lit up the ground it did not come to her the life of her youth it did not come back there was a little agony of struggle then a relapse into the darkness of the convent where satan and the devils raged round the walls and christ was white on the cross of victory  she watched from the sickroom the snow whirl past like flocks of shadows in haste flying on some final mission out to a leaden inalterable sea beyond the final whiteness of the curving shore and the snowspeckled blackness of the rocks half submerged but near at hand on the trees the snow was soft in bloom only the voice of the dying vicar spoke grey and querulous from behind  by the time the snowdrops were out however he was dead he was dead but with curious equanimity the returning woman watched the snowdrops on the edge of the grass below blown white in the wind but not to be blown away she watched them fluttering and bobbing the white shut flowers anchored by a thread to the greygreen grass yet never blown away not drifting with the wind  as she rose in the morning the dawn was beating up white gusts of light blown like a thin snowstorm from the east blown stronger and fiercer till the rose appeared and the gold and the sea lit up below she was impassive and indifferent yet she was outside the enclosure of darkness  there passed a space of shadow again the familiarity of dreadworship during which she was moved oblivious to cossethay there at first there was nothingjust grey nothing but then one morning there was a light from the yellow jasmine caught her and after that morning and evening the persistent ringing of thrushes from the shrubbery till her heart beaten upon was forced to lift up its voice in rivalry and answer little tunes came into her mind she was full of trouble almost like anguish resistant she knew she was beaten and from fear of darkness turned to fear of light she would have hidden herself indoors if she could above all she craved for the peace and heavy oblivion of her old state she could not bear to come to to realize the first pangs of this new parturition were so acute she knew she could not bear it she would rather remain out of life than be torn mutilated into this birth which she could not survive she had not the strength to come to life now in england so foreign skies so hostile she knew she would die like an early colourless scentless flower that the end of the winter puts forth mercilessly and she wanted to harbour her modicum of twinkling life  but a sunshiny day came full of the scent of a mezereon tree when bees were tumbling into the yellow crocuses and she forgot she felt like somebody else not herself a new person quite glad but she knew it was fragile and she dreaded it the vicar put peaflower into the crocuses for his bees to roll in and she laughed then night came with brilliant stars that she knew of old from her girlhood and they flashed so bright she knew they were victors  she could neither wake nor sleep as if crushed between the past and the future like a flower that comes aboveground to find a great stone lying above it she was helpless  the bewilderment and helplessness continued she was surrounded by great moving masses that must crush her and there was no escape save in the old obliviousness the cold darkness she strove to retain but the vicar showed her eggs in the thrushs nest near the back door she saw herself the motherthrush upon the nest and the way her wings were spread so eager down upon her secret the tense eager nesting wings moved her beyond endurance she thought of them in the morning when she heard the thrush whistling as he got up and she thought why didnt i die out there why am i brought here  she was aware of people who passed around her not as persons but as looming presences it was very difficult for her to adjust herself in poland the peasantry the people had been cattle to her they had been her cattle that she owned and used what were these people now she was coming awake she was lost  but she had felt brangwen go by almost as if he had brushed her she had tingled in body as she had gone on up the road after she had been with him in the marsh kitchen the voice of her body had risen strong and insistent soon she wanted him he was the man who had come nearest to her for her awakening  always however betweenwhiles she lapsed into the old unconsciousness indifference and there was a will in her to save herself from living any more but she would wake in the morning one day and feel her blood running feel herself lying open like a flower unsheathed in the sun insistent and potent with demand  she got to know him better and her instinct fixed on himjust on him her impulse was strong against him because he was not of her own sort but one blind instinct led her to take him to leave him and then to relinquish herself to him it would be safety she felt the rooted safety of him and the life in him also he was young and very fresh the blue steady livingness of his eyes she enjoyed like morning he was very young  then she lapsed again to stupor and indifference this however was bound to pass the warmth flowed through her she felt herself opening unfolding asking as a flower opens in full request under the sun as the beaks of tiny birds open flat to receive to receive and unfolded she turned to him straight to him and he came slowly afraid held back by uncouth fear and driven by a desire bigger than himself  when she opened and turned to him then all that had been and all that was was gone from her she was as new as a flower that unsheathes itself and stands always ready waiting receptive he could not understand this he forced himself through lack of understanding to the adherence to the line of honourable courtship and sanctioned licensed marriage therefore after he had gone to the vicarage and asked for her she remained for some days held in this one spell open receptive to him before him he was roused to chaos he spoke to the vicar and gave in the banns then he stood to wait  she remained attentive and instinctively expectant before him unfolded ready to receive him he could not act because of selffear and because of his conception of honour towards her so he remained in a state of chaos  and after a few days gradually she closed again away from him was sheathed over impervious to him oblivious then a black bottomless despair became real to him he knew what he had lost he felt he had lost it for good he knew what it was to have been in communication with her and to be cast off again in misery his heart like a heavy stone he went about unliving  till gradually he became desperate lost his understanding was plunged in a revolt that knew no bounds inarticulate he moved with her at the marsh in violent gloomy wordless passion almost in hatred of her till gradually she became aware of him aware of herself with regard to him her blood stirred to life she began to open towards him to flow towards him again he waited till the spell was between them again till they were together within one rushing hastening flame and then again he was bewildered he was tied up as with cords and could not move to her so she came to him and unfastened the breast of his waistcoat and his shirt and put her hand on him needing to know him for it was cruel to her to be opened and offered to him yet not to know what he was not even that he was there she gave herself to the hour but he could not and he bungled in taking her  so that he lived in suspense as if only half his faculties worked until the wedding she did not understand but the vagueness came over her again and the days lapsed by he could not get definitely into touch with her for the time being she let him go again  he suffered very much from the thought of actual marriage the intimacy and nakedness of marriage he knew her so little they were so foreign to each other they were such strangers and they could not talk to each other when she talked of poland or of what had been it was all so foreign she scarcely communicated anything to him and when he looked at her an overmuch reverence and fear of the unknown changed the nature of his desire into a sort of worship holding her aloof from his physical desire selfthwarting  she did not know this she did not understand they had looked at each other and had accepted each other it was so then there was nothing to balk at it was complete between them  at the wedding his face was stiff and expressionless he wanted to drink to get rid of his forethought and afterthought to set the moment free but he could not the suspense only tightened at his heart the jesting and joviality and jolly broad insinuation of the guests only coiled him more he could not hear that which was impending obsessed him he could not get free  she sat quiet with a strange still smile she was not afraid having accepted him she wanted to take him she belonged altogether to the hour now no future no past only this her hour she did not even notice him as she sat beside him at the head of the table he was very near their coming together was close at hand what more  as the time came for all the guests to go her dark face was softly lighted the bend of her head was proud her grey eyes clear and dilated so that the men could not look at her and the women were elated by her they served her very wonderful she was as she bade farewell her ugly wide mouth smiling with pride and recognition her voice speaking softly and richly in the foreign accent her dilated eyes ignoring one and all the departing guests her manner was gracious and fascinating but she ignored the being of him or her to whom she gave her hand  and brangwen stood beside her giving his hearty handshake to his friends receiving their regard gratefully glad of their attention his heart was tormented within him he did not try to smile the time of his trial and his admittance his gethsemane and his triumphal entry in one had come now  behind her there was so much unknown to him when he approached her he came to such a terrible painful unknown how could he embrace it and fathom it how could he close his arms round all this darkness and hold it to his breast and give himself to it what might not happen to him if he stretched and strained for ever he would never be able to grasp it all and to yield himself naked out of his own hands into the unknown power how could a man be strong enough to take her put his arms round her and have her and be sure he could conquer this awful unknown next his heart what was it then that she was to which he must also deliver himself up and which at the same time he must embrace contain  he was to be her husband it was established so and he wanted it more than he wanted life or anything she stood beside him in her silk dress looking at him strangely so that a certain terror horror took possession of him because she was strange and impending and he had no choice he could not bear to meet her look from under her strange thick brows  is it late she said  he looked at his watch  nohalfpast eleven he said and he made an excuse to go into the kitchen leaving her standing in the room among the disorder and the drinkingglasses  tilly was seated beside the fire in the kitchen her head in her hands she started up when he entered  why havent you gone to bed he said  i thought id better stop an lock up an do she said her agitation quietened him he gave her some little order then returned steadied now almost ashamed to his wife she stood a moment watching him as he moved with averted face then she said  you will be good to me wont you  she was small and girlish and terrible with a queer wide look in her eyes his heart leaped in him in anguish of love and desire he went blindly to her and took her in his arms  i want to he said as he drew her closer and closer in she was soothed by the stress of his embrace and remained quite still relaxed against him mingling in to him and he let himself go from past and future was reduced to the moment with her in which he took her and was with her and there was nothing beyond they were together in an elemental embrace beyond their superficial foreignness but in the morning he was uneasy again she was still foreign and unknown to him only within the fear was pride belief in himself as mate for her and she everything forgotten in her new hour of coming to life radiated vigour and joy so that he quivered to touch her  it made a great difference to him marriage things became so remote and of so little significance as he knew the powerful source of his life his eyes opened on a new universe and he wondered in thinking of his triviality before a new calm relationship showed to him in the things he saw in the cattle he used the young wheat as it eddied in a wind  and each time he returned home he went steadily expectantly like a man who goes to a profound unknown satisfaction at dinnertime he appeared in the doorway hanging back a moment from entering to see if she was there he saw her setting the plates on the whitescrubbed table her arms were slim she had a slim body and full skirts she had a dark shapely head with closebanded hair somehow it was her head so shapely and poignant that revealed her his woman to him as she moved about clothed closely fullskirted and wearing her little silk apron her dark hair smoothly parted her head revealed itself to him in all its subtle intrinsic beauty and he knew she was his woman he knew her essence that it was his to possess and he seemed to live thus in contact with her in contact with the unknown the unaccountable and incalculable  they did not take much notice of each other consciously  im betimes he said  yes she answered  he turned to the dogs or to the child if she was there the little anna played about the farm flitting constantly in to call something to her mother to fling her arms round her mothers skirts to be noticed perhaps caressed then forgetting to slip out again  then brangwen talking to the child or to the dog between his knees would be aware of his wife as in her tight dark bodice and her lace fichu she was reaching up to the corner cupboard he realized with a sharp pang that she belonged to him and he to her he realized that he lived by her did he own her was she here for ever or might she go away she was not really his it was not a real marriage this marriage between them she might go away he did not feel like a master husband father of her children she belonged elsewhere any moment she might be gone and he was ever drawn to her drawn after her with everraging everunsatisfied desire he must always turn home wherever his steps were taking him always to her and he could never quite reach her he could never quite be satisfied never be at peace because she might go away  at evening he was glad then when he had finished in the yard and come in and washed himself when the child was put to bed he could sit on the other side of the fire with his beer on the hob and his long white pipe in his fingers conscious of her there opposite him as she worked at her embroidery or as she talked to him and he was safe with her now till morning she was curiously selfsufficient and did not say very much occasionally she lifted her head her grey eyes shining with a strange light that had nothing to do with him or with this place and would tell him about herself she seemed to be back again in the past chiefly in her childhood or her girlhood with her father she very rarely talked of her first husband but sometimes all shiningeyed she was back at her own home telling him about the riotous times the trip to paris with her father tales of the mad acts of the peasants when a burst of religious selfhurting fervour had passed over the country  she would lift her head and say  when they brought the railway across the country they made afterwards smaller railways of shorter width to come down to our towna hundred miles when i was a girl gisla my german gouvernante was very shocked and she would not tell me but i heard the servants talking i remember it was pierre the coachman and my father and some of his friends landowners they had taken a wagon a whole railway wagonthat you travel in  a railwaycarriage said brangwen  she laughed to herself  i know it was a great scandal yesa whole wagon and they had girls you know filles naked all the wagonfull and so they came down to our village they came through villages of the jews and it was a great scandal can you imagine all the countryside and my mother she did not like it gisla said to me madame she must not know that you have heard such things  my mother she used to cry and she wished to beat my father plainly beat him he would say when she cried because he sold the forest the wood to jingle money in his pocket and go to warsaw or paris or kiev when she said he must take back his word he must not sell the forest he would stand and say i know i know i have heard it all i have heard it all before tell me some new thing i know i know i know oh but can you understand i loved him when he stood there under the door saying only i know i know i know it all already she could not change him no not if she killed herself for it and she could change everybody else but him she could not change him  brangwen could not understand he had pictures of a cattletruck full of naked girls riding from nowhere to nowhere of lydia laughing because her father made great debts and said i know i know of jews running down the street shouting in yiddish dont do it dont do it and being cut down by demented peasantsshe called them cattlewhilst she looked on interested and even amused of tutors and governesses and paris and a convent it was too much for him and there she sat telling the tales to the open space not to him arrogating a curious superiority to him a distance between them something strange and foreign and outside his life talking rattling without rhyme or reason laughing when he was shocked or astounded condemning nothing confounding his mind and making the whole world a chaos without order or stability of any kind then when they went to bed he knew that he had nothing to do with her she was back in her childhood he was a peasant a serf a servant a lover a paramour a shadow a nothing he lay still in amazement staring at the room he knew so well and wondering whether it was really there the window the chest of drawers or whether it was merely a figment in the atmosphere and gradually he grew into a raging fury against her but because he was so much amazed and there was as yet such a distance between them and she was such an amazing thing to him with all wonder opening out behind her he made no retaliation on her only he lay still and wideeyed with rage inarticulate not understanding but solid with hostility  and he remained wrathful and distinct from her unchanged outwardly to her but underneath a solid power of antagonism to her of which she became gradually aware and it irritated her to be made aware of him as a separate power she lapsed into a sort of sombre exclusion a curious communion with mysterious powers a sort of mystic dark state which drove him and the child nearly mad he walked about for days stiffened with resistance to her stiff with a will to destroy her as she was then suddenly out of nowhere there was connection between them again it came on him as he was working in the fields the tension the bond burst and the passionate flood broke forward into a tremendous magnificent rush so that he felt he could snap off the trees as he passed and create the world afresh  and when he arrived home there was no sign between them he waited and waited till she came and as he waited his limbs seemed strong and splendid to him his hands seemed like passionate servants to him goodly he felt a stupendous power in himself of life and of urgent strong blood  she was sure to come at last and touch him then he burst into flame for her and lost himself they looked at each other a deep laugh at the bottom of their eyes and he went to take of her again wholesale mad to revel in the inexhaustible wealth of her to bury himself in the depths of her in an inexhaustible exploration she all the while revelling in that he revelled in her tossed all her secrets aside and plunged to that which was secret to her as well whilst she quivered with fear and the last anguish of delight  what did it matter who they were whether they knew each other or not  the hour passed away again there was severance between them and rage and misery and bereavement for her and deposition and toiling at the mill with slaves for him but no matter they had had their hour and should it chime again they were ready for it ready to renew the game at the point where it was left off on the edge of the outer darkness when the secrets within the woman are game for the man hunted doggedly when the secrets of the woman are the mans adventure and they both give themselves to the adventure  she was with child and there was again the silence and distance between them she did not want him nor his secrets nor his game he was deposed he was cast out he seethed with fury at the small uglymouthed woman who had nothing to do with him sometimes his anger broke on her but she did not cry she turned on him like a tiger and there was battle  he had to learn to contain himself again and he hated it he hated her that she was not there for him and he took himself off anywhere  but an instinct of gratitude and a knowledge that she would receive him back again that later on she would be there for him again prevented his straying very far he cautiously did not go too far he knew she might lapse into ignorance of him lapse away from him farther farther farther till she was lost to him he had sense enough premonition enough in himself to be aware of this and to measure himself accordingly for he did not want to lose her he did not want her to lapse away  cold he called her selfish only caring about herself a foreigner with a bad nature caring really about nothing having no proper feelings at the bottom of her and no proper niceness he raged and piled up accusations that had some measure of truth in them all but a certain grace in him forbade him from going too far he knew and he quivered with rage and hatred that she was all these vile things that she was everything vile and detestable but he had grace at the bottom of him which told him that above all things he did not want to lose her he was not going to lose her  so he kept some consideration for her he preserved some relationship he went out more often to the red lion again to escape the madness of sitting next to her when she did not belong to him when she was as absent as any woman in indifference could be he could not stay at home so he went to the red lion and sometimes he got drunk but he preserved his measure some things between them he never forfeited  a tormented look came into his eyes as if something were always dogging him he glanced sharp and quick he could not bear to sit still doing nothing he had to go out to find company to give himself away there for he had no other outlet he could not work to give himself out he had not the knowledge  as the months of her pregnancy went on she left him more and more alone she was more and more unaware of him his existence was annulled and he felt bound down bound unable to stir beginning to go mad ready to rave for she was quiet and polite as if he did not exist as one is quiet and polite to a servant  nevertheless she was great with his child it was his turn to submit she sat opposite him sewing her foreign face inscrutable and indifferent he felt he wanted to break her into acknowledgment of him into awareness of him it was insufferable that she had so obliterated him he would smash her into regarding him he had a raging agony of desire to do so  but something bigger in him withheld him kept him motionless so he went out of the house for relief or he turned to the little girl for her sympathy and her love he appealed with all his power to the small anna so soon they were like lovers father and child  for he was afraid of his wife as she sat there with bent head silent working or reading but so unutterably silent that his heart seemed under the millstone of it she became herself like the upper millstone lying on him crushing him as sometimes a heavy sky lies on the earth  yet he knew he could not tear her away from the heavy obscurity into which she was merged he must not try to tear her into recognition of himself and agreement with himself it were disastrous impious so let him rage as he might he must withhold himself but his wrists trembled and seemed mad seemed as if they would burst  when in november the leaves came beating against the window shutters with a lashing sound he started and his eyes flickered with flame the dog looked up at him he sunk his head to the fire but his wife was startled he was aware of her listening  they blow up with a rattle he said  what she asked  the leaves  she sank away again the strange leaves beating in the wind on the wood had come nearer than she the tension in the room was overpowering it was difficult for him to move his head he sat with every nerve every vein every fibre of muscle in his body stretched on a tension he felt like a broken arch thrust sickeningly out from support for her response was gone he thrust at nothing and he remained himself he saved himself from crashing down into nothingness from being squandered into fragments by sheer tension sheer backward resistance  during the last months of her pregnancy he went about in a surcharged imminent state that did not exhaust itself she was also depressed and sometimes she cried it needed so much life to begin afresh after she had lost so lavishly sometimes she cried then he stood stiff feeling his heart would burst for she did not want him she did not want even to be made aware of him by the very puckering of her face he knew that he must stand back leave her intact alone for it was the old grief come back in her the old loss the pain of the old life the dead husband the dead children this was sacred to her and he must not violate her with his comfort for what she wanted she would come to him he stood aloof with turgid heart  he had to see her tears come fall over her scarcely moving face that only puckered sometimes down on to her breast that was so still scarcely moving and there was no noise save now and again when with a strange somnambulant movement she took her handkerchief and wiped her face and blew her nose and went on with the noiseless weeping he knew that any offer of comfort from himself would be worse than useless hateful to her jangling her she must cry but it drove him insane his heart was scalded his brain hurt in his head he went away out of the house  his great and chiefest source of solace was the child she had been at first aloof from him reserved however friendly she might seem one day the next she would have lapsed to her original disregard of him cold detached at her distance  the first morning after his marriage he had discovered it would not be so easy with the child at the break of dawn he had started awake hearing a small voice outside the door saying plaintively  mother  he rose and opened the door she stood on the threshold in her nightdress as she had climbed out of bed black eyes staring round and hostile her fair hair sticking out in a wild fleece the man and child confronted each other  i want my mother she said jealously accenting the my  come on then he said gently  wheres my mother  shes herecome on  the childs eyes staring at the man with ruffled hair and beard did not change the mothers voice called softly the little bare feet entered the room with trepidation  mother  come my dear  the small bare feet approached swiftly  i wondered where you were came the plaintive voice the mother stretched out her arms the child stood beside the high bed brangwen lightly lifted the tiny girl with an upadaisy then took his own place in the bed again  mother cried the child as in anguish  what my pet  anna wriggled close into her mothers arms clinging tight hiding from the fact of the man brangwen lay still and waited there was a long silence  then suddenly anna looked round as if she thought he would be gone she saw the face of the man lying upturned to the ceiling her black eyes stared antagonistic from her exquisite face her arms clung tightly to her mother afraid he did not move for some time not knowing what to say his face was smooth and softskinned with love his eyes full of soft light he looked at her scarcely moving his head his eyes smiling  have you just wakened up he said  go away she retorted with a little darting forward of the head something like a viper  nay he answered im not going you can go  go away came the sharp little command  theres room for you he said  you cant send your father from his own bed my little bird said her mother pleasantly  the child glowered at him miserable in her impotence  theres room for you as well he said its a big bed enough  she glowered without answering then turned and clung to her mother she would not allow it  during the day she asked her mother several times  when are we going home mother  we are at home darling we live here now this is our house we live here with your father  the child was forced to accept it but she remained against the man as night came on she asked  where are you going to sleep mother  i sleep with the father now  and when brangwen came in the child asked fiercely  why do you sleep with my mother my mother sleeps with me her voice quivering  you come as well an sleep with both of us he coaxed  mother she cried turning appealing against him  but i must have a husband darling all women must have a husband  and you like to have a father with your mother dont you said brangwen  anna glowered at him she seemed to cogitate  no she cried fiercely at length no i dont want and slowly her face puckered she sobbed bitterly he stood and watched her sorry but there could be no altering it  which when she knew she became quiet he was easy with her talking to her taking her to see the live creatures bringing her the first chickens in his cap taking her to gather the eggs letting her throw crusts to the horse she would easily accompany him and take all he had to give but she remained neutral still  she was curiously incomprehensibly jealous of her mother always anxiously concerned about her if brangwen drove with his wife to nottingham anna ran about happily enough or unconcerned for a long time then as afternoon came on there was only one cryi want my mother i want my mother and a bitter pathetic sobbing that soon had the softhearted tilly sobbing too the childs anguish was that her mother was gone gone  yet as a rule anna seemed cold resenting her mother critical of her it was  i dont like you to do that mother or i dont like you to say that she was a sore problem to brangwen and to all the people at the marsh as a rule however she was active lightly flitting about the farmyard only appearing now and again to assure herself of her mother happy she never seemed but quick sharp absorbed full of imagination and changeability tilly said she was bewitched but it did not matter so long as she did not cry there was something heartrending about annas crying her childish anguish seemed so utter and so timeless as if it were a thing of all the ages  she made playmates of the creatures of the farmyard talking to them telling them the stories she had from her mother counselling them and correcting them brangwen found her at the gate leading to the paddock and to the duckpond she was peering through the bars and shouting to the stately white geese that stood in a curving line  youre not to call at people when they want to come you must not do it  the heavy balanced birds looked at the fierce little face and the fleece of keen hair thrust between the bars and they raised their heads and swayed off producing the long cancanking protesting noise of geese rocking their shiplike beautiful white bodies in a line beyond the gate  youre naughty youre naughty cried anna tears of dismay and vexation in her eyes and she stamped her slipper  why what are they doing said brangwen  they wont let me come in she said turning her flushed little face to him  yi they will you can go in if you want to and he pushed open the gate for her  she stood irresolute looking at the group of blueywhite geese standing monumental under the grey cold day  go on he said  she marched valiantly a few steps in her little body started convulsively at the sudden derisive cancankank of the geese a blankness spread over her the geese trailed away with uplifted heads under the low grey sky  they dont know you said brangwen you should tell em what your name is  theyre naughty to shout at me she flashed  they think you dont live here he said  later he found her at the gate calling shrilly and imperiously  my name is anna anna lensky and i live here because mr brangwens my father now he is yes he is and i live here  this pleased brangwen very much and gradually without knowing it herself she clung to him in her lost childish desolate moments when it was good to creep up to something big and warm and bury her little self in his big unlimited being instinctively he was careful of her careful to recognize her and to give himself to her disposal  she was difficult of her affections for tilly she had a childish essential contempt almost dislike because the poor woman was such a servant the child would not let the servingwoman attend to her do intimate things for her not for a long time she treated her as one of an inferior race brangwen did not like it  why arent you fond of tilly he asked  becausebecausebecause she looks at me with her eyes bent  then gradually she accepted tilly as belonging to the household never as a person  for the first weeks the black eyes of the child were for ever on the watch brangwen goodhumoured but impatient spoiled by tilly was an easy blusterer if for a few minutes he upset the household with his noisy impatience he found at the end the child glowering at him with intense black eyes and she was sure to dart forward her little head like a serpent with her biting  go away  im not going away he shouted irritated at last go yourselfhustlestir thysenhop and he pointed to the door the child backed away from him pale with fear then she gathered up courage seeing him become patient  we dont live with you she said thrusting forward her little head at him youyoureyoure a bomakle  a what he shouted  her voice waveredbut it came  a bomakle  ay an youre a comakle  she meditated then she hissed forwards her head  im not  not what  a comakle  no more am i a bomakle  he was really cross  other times she would say  my mother doesnt live here  oh ay  i want her to go away  then wants your portion he replied laconically  so they drew nearer together he would take her with him when he went out in the trap the horse ready at the gate he came noisily into the house which seemed quiet and peaceful till he appeared to set everything awake  now then topsy pop into thy bonnet  the child drew herself up resenting the indignity of the address  i cant fasten my bonnet myself she said haughtily  not man enough yet he said tying the ribbons under her chin with clumsy fingers  she held up her face to him her little brightred lips moved as he fumbled under her chin  you talknonsents she said reechoing one of his phrases  that face shouts for th pump he said and taking out a big red handkerchief that smelled of strong tobacco began wiping round her mouth  is kitty waiting for me she asked  ay he said lets finish wiping your faceitll pass wi a catlick  she submitted prettily then when he let her go she began to skip with a curious flicking up of one leg behind her  now my young buckrabbit he said slippy  she came and was shaken into her coat and the two set off she sat very close beside him in the gig tucked tightly feeling his big body sway against her very splendid she loved the rocking of the gig when his big live body swayed upon her against her she laughed a poignant little shrill laugh and her black eyes glowed  she was curiously hard and then passionately tenderhearted her mother was ill the child stole about on tiptoe in the bedroom for hours being nurse and doing the thing thoughtfully and diligently another day her mother was unhappy anna would stand with her legs apart glowering balancing on the sides of her slippers she laughed when the goslings wriggled in tillys hand as the pellets of food were rammed down their throats with a skewer she laughed nervously she was hard and imperious with the animals squandering no love running about amongst them like a cruel mistress  summer came and hayharvest anna was a brown elfish mite dancing about tilly always marvelled over her more than she loved her  but always in the child was some anxious connection with the mother so long as mrs brangwen was all right the little girl played about and took very little notice of her but cornharvest went by the autumn drew on and the mother the later months of her pregnancy beginning was strange and detached brangwen began to knit his brows the old unhealthy uneasiness the unskinned susceptibility came on the child again if she went to the fields with her father then instead of playing about carelessly it was  i want to go home  home why thas nobbut this minute come  i want to go home  what for what ails thee  i want my mother  thy mother thy mother none wants thee  i want to go home  there would be tears in a moment  can ter find troad then  and he watched her scudding silent and intent along the hedgebottom at a steady anxious pace till she turned and was gone through the gateway then he saw her two fields off still pressing forward small and urgent his face was clouded as he turned to plough up the stubble  the year drew on in the hedges the berries shone red and twinkling above bare twigs robins were seen great droves of birds dashed like spray from the fallow rooks appeared black and flapping down to earth the ground was cold as he pulled the turnips the roads were churned deep in mud then the turnips were pitted and work was slack  inside the house it was dark and quiet the child flitted uneasily round and now and again came her plaintive startled cry  mother  mrs brangwen was heavy and unresponsive tired lapsed back brangwen went on working out of doors  at evening when he came in to milk the child would run behind him then in the cosy cowsheds with the doors shut and the air looking warm by the light of the hanging lantern above the branching horns of the cows she would stand watching his hands squeezing rhythmically the teats of the placid beast watch the froth and the leaping squirt of milk watch his hand sometimes rubbing slowly understandingly upon a hanging udder so they kept each other company but at a distance rarely speaking  the darkest days of the year came on the child was fretful sighing as if some oppression were on her running hither and thither without relief and brangwen went about at his work heavy his heart heavy as the sodden earth  the winter nights fell early the lamp was lighted before teatime the shutters were closed they were all shut into the room with the tension and stress mrs brangwen went early to bed anna playing on the floor beside her brangwen sat in the emptiness of the downstairs room smoking scarcely conscious even of his own misery and very often he went out to escape it  christmas passed the wet drenched cold days of january recurred monotonously with now and then a brilliance of blue flashing in when brangwen went out into a morning like crystal when every sound rang again and the birds were many and sudden and brusque in the hedges then an elation came over him in spite of everything whether his wife were strange or sad or whether he craved for her to be with him it did not matter the air rang with clear noises the sky was like crystal like a bell and the earth was hard then he worked and was happy his eyes shining his cheeks flushed and the zest of life was strong in him  the birds pecked busily round him the horses were fresh and ready the bare branches of the trees flung themselves up like a man yawning taut with energy the twigs radiated off into the clear light he was alive and full of zest for it all and if his wife were heavy separated from him extinguished then let her be let him remain himself things would be as they would be meanwhile he heard the ringing crow of a cockerel in the distance he saw the pale shell of the moon effaced on a blue sky  so he shouted to the horses and was happy if driving into ilkeston a fresh young woman were going in to do her shopping he hailed her and reined in his horse and picked her up then he was glad to have her near him his eyes shone his voice laughing teasing in a warm fashion made the poise of her head more beautiful her blood ran quicker they were both stimulated the morning was fine  what did it matter that at the bottom of his heart was care and pain it was at the bottom let it stop at the bottom his wife her suffering her coming painwell it must be so she suffered but he was out of doors full in life and it would be ridiculous indecent to pull a long face and to insist on being miserable he was happy this morning driving to town with the hoofs of the horse spanking the hard earth well he was happy if half the world were weeping at the funeral of the other half and it was a jolly girl sitting beside him and woman was immortal whatever happened whoever turned towards death let the misery come when it could not be resisted  the evening arrived later very beautiful with a rosy flush hovering above the sunset and passing away into violet and lavender with turquoise green north and south in the sky and in the east a great yellow moon hanging heavy and radiant it was magnificent to walk between the sunset and the moon on a road where little holly trees thrust black into the rose and lavender and starlings flickered in droves across the light but what was the end of the journey the pain came right enough later on when his heart and his feet were heavy his brain dead his life stopped  one afternoon the pains began mrs brangwen was put to bed the midwife came night fell the shutters were closed brangwen came in to tea to the loaf and the pewter teapot the child silent and quivering playing with glass beads the house empty it seemed or exposed to the winter night as if it had no walls  sometimes there sounded long and remote in the house vibrating through everything the moaning cry of a woman in labour brangwen sitting downstairs was divided his lower deeper self was with her bound to her suffering but the big shell of his body remembered the sound of owls that used to fly round the farmstead when he was a boy he was back in his youth a boy haunted by the sound of the owls waking up his brother to speak to him and his mind drifted away to the birds their solemn dignified faces their flight so soft and broadwinged and then to the birds his brother had shot fluffy dustcoloured dead heaps of softness with faces absurdly asleep it was a queer thing a dead owl  he lifted his cup to his lips he watched the child with the beads but his mind was occupied with owls and the atmosphere of his boyhood with his brothers and sisters elsewhere fundamental he was with his wife in labour the child was being brought forth out of their one flesh he and she one flesh out of which life must be put forth the rent was not in his body but it was of his body on her the blows fell but the quiver ran through to him to his last fibre she must be torn asunder for life to come forth yet still they were one flesh and still from further back the life came out of him to her and still he was the unbroken that has the broken rock in its arms their flesh was one rock from which the life gushed out of her who was smitten and rent from him who quivered and yielded  he went upstairs to her as he came to the bedside she spoke to him in polish  is it very bad he asked  she looked at him and oh the weariness to her of the effort to understand another language the weariness of hearing him attending to him making out who he was as he stood there fairbearded and alien looking at her she knew something of him of his eyes but she could not grasp him she closed her eyes  he turned away white to the gills  its not so very bad said the midwife  he knew he was a strain on his wife he went downstairs  the child glanced up at him frightened  i want my mother she quavered  ay but shes badly he said mildly unheeding  she looked at him with lost frightened eyes  has she got a headache  noshes going to have a baby  the child looked round he was unaware of her she was alone again in terror  i want my mother came the cry of panic  let tilly undress you he said youre tired  there was another silence again came the cry of labour  i want my mother rang automatically from the wincing panicstricken child that felt cut off and lost in a horror of desolation  tilly came forward her heart wrung  come an let me undress her then petlamb she crooned you sll have your mother in th mornin dont you fret my duckie never mind angel  but anna stood upon the sofa her back to the wall  i want my mother she cried her little face quivering and the great tears of childish utter anguish falling  shes poorly my lamb shes poorly tonight but shell be better by mornin oh dont cry dont cry love she doesnt want you to cry precious little heart no she doesnt  tilly took gently hold of the childs skirts anna snatched back her dress and cried in a little hysteria  no youre not to undress mei want my motherand her childs face was running with grief and tears her body shaken  oh but let tilly undress you let tilly undress you who loves you dont be wilful tonight mothers poorly she doesnt want you to cry  the child sobbed distractedly she could not hear  i wantmymother she wept  when youre undressed you sll go up to see your motherwhen youre undressed pet when youve let tilly undress you when youre a little jewel in your nightie love oh dont you cry dont you  brangwen sat stiff in his chair he felt his brain going tighter he crossed over the room aware only of the maddening sobbing  dont make a noise he said  and a new fear shook the child from the sound of his voice she cried mechanically her eyes looking watchful through her tears in terror alert to what might happen  i wantmymother quavered the sobbing blind voice  a shiver of irritation went over the mans limbs it was the utter persistent unreason the maddening blindness of the voice and the crying  you must come and be undressed he said in a quiet voice that was thin with anger  and he reached his hand and grasped her he felt her body catch in a convulsive sob but he too was blind and intent irritated into mechanical action he began to unfasten her little apron she would have shrunk from him but could not so her small body remained in his grasp while he fumbled at the little buttons and tapes unthinking intent unaware of anything but the irritation of her her body was held taut and resistant he pushed off the little dress and the petticoats revealing the white arms she kept stiff overpowered violated he went on with his task and all the while she sobbed choking  i want my mother  he was unheedingly silent his face stiff the child was now incapable of understanding she had become a little mechanical thing of fixed will she wept her body convulsed her voice repeating the same cry  eh dear o me cried tilly becoming distracted herself brangwen slow clumsy blind intent got off all the little garments and stood the child naked in its shift upon the sofa  wheres her nightie he asked  tilly brought it and he put it on her anna did not move her limbs to his desire he had to push them into place she stood with fixed blind will resistant a small convulsed unchangeable thing weeping ever and repeating the same phrase he lifted one foot after the other pulled off slippers and socks she was ready  do you want a drink he asked  she did not change unheeding uncaring she stood on the sofa standing back alone her hands shut and half lifted her face all tears raised and blind and through the sobbing and choking came the broken  iwantmymother  do you want a drink he said again  there was no answer he lifted the stiff denying body between his hands its stiff blindness made a flash of rage go through him he would like to break it  he set the child on his knee and sat again in his chair beside the fire the wet sobbing inarticulate noise going on near his ear the child sitting stiff not yielding to him or anything not aware  a new degree of anger came over him what did it all matter what did it matter if the mother talked polish and cried in labour if this child were stiff with resistance and crying why take it to heart let the mother cry in labour let the child cry in resistance since they would do so why should he fight against it why resist let it be if it were so let them be as they were if they insisted  and in a daze he sat offering no fight the child cried on the minutes ticked away a sort of torpor was on him  it was some little time before he came to and turned to attend to the child he was shocked by her little wet blinded face a bit dazed he pushed back the wet hair like a living statue of grief her blind face cried on  nay he said not as bad as that its not as bad as that anna my child come what are you crying for so much come stop now itll make you sick i wipe you dry dont wet your face any more dont cry any more wet tears dont its better not to dont cryits not so bad as all that hush now hushlet it be enough  his voice was queer and distant and calm he looked at the child she was beside herself now he wanted her to stop he wanted it all to stop to become natural  come he said rising to turn away well go an supperup the beast  he took a big shawl folded her round and went out into the kitchen for a lantern  youre never taking the child out of a night like this said tilly  ay itll quieten her he answered  it was raining the child was suddenly still shocked finding the rain on its face the darkness  well just give the cows their somethingtoeat afore they go to bed brangwen was saying to her holding her close and sure  there was a trickling of water into the butt a burst of raindrops sputtering on to her shawl and the light of the lantern swinging flashing on a wet pavement and the base of a wet wall otherwise it was black darkness one breathed darkness  he opened the doors upper and lower and they entered into the high dry barn that smelled warm even if it were not warm he hung the lantern on the nail and shut the door they were in another world now the light shed softly on the timbered barn on the whitewashed walls and the great heap of hay instruments cast their shadows largely a ladder rose to the dark arch of a loft outside there was the driving rain inside the softlyilluminated stillness and calmness of the barn  holding the child on one arm he set about preparing the food for the cows filling a pan with chopped hay and brewers grains and a little meal the child all wonder watched what he did a new being was created in her for the new conditions sometimes a little spasm eddying from the bygone storm of sobbing shook her small body her eyes were wide and wondering pathetic she was silent quite still  in a sort of dream his heart sunk to the bottom leaving the surface of him still quite still he rose with the panful of food carefully balancing the child on one arm the pan in the other hand the silky fringe of the shawl swayed softly grains and hay trickled to the floor he went along a dimlylit passage behind the mangers where the horns of the cows pricked out of the obscurity the child shrank he balanced stiffly rested the pan on the manger wall and tipped out the food half to this cow half to the next there was a noise of chains running as the cows lifted or dropped their heads sharply then a contented soothing sound a long snuffing as the beasts ate in silence  the journey had to be performed several times there was the rhythmic sound of the shovel in the barn then the man returned walking stiffly between the two weights the face of the child peering out from the shawl then the next time as he stooped she freed her arm and put it round his neck clinging soft and warm making all easier  the beasts fed he dropped the pan and sat down on a box to arrange the child  will the cows go to sleep now she said catching her breath as she spoke  yes  will they eat all their stuff up first  yes hark at them  and the two sat still listening to the snuffing and breathing of cows feeding in the sheds communicating with this small barn the lantern shed a soft steady light from one wall all outside was still in the rain he looked down at the silky folds of the paisley shawl it reminded him of his mother she used to go to church in it he was back again in the old irresponsibility and security a boy at home  the two sat very quiet his mind in a sort of trance seemed to become more and more vague he held the child close to him a quivering little shudder reechoing from her sobbing went down her limbs he held her closer gradually she relaxed the eyelids began to sink over her dark watchful eyes as she sank to sleep his mind became blank  when he came to as if from sleep he seemed to be sitting in a timeless stillness what was he listening for he seemed to be listening for some sound a long way off from beyond life he remembered his wife he must go back to her the child was asleep the eyelids not quite shut showing a slight film of black pupil between why did she not shut her eyes her mouth was also a little open  he rose quickly and went back to the house  is she asleep whispered tilly  he nodded the servantwoman came to look at the child who slept in the shawl with cheeks flushed hot and red and a whiteness a wanness round the eyes  godamercy whispered tilly shaking her head  he pushed off his boots and went upstairs with the child he became aware of the anxiety grasped tight at his heart because of his wife but he remained still the house was silent save for the wind outside and the noisy trickling and splattering of water in the waterbutts there was a slit of light under his wifes door  he put the child into bed wrapped as she was in the shawl for the sheets would be cold then he was afraid that she might not be able to move her arms so he loosened her the black eyes opened rested on him vacantly sank shut again he covered her up the last little quiver from the sobbing shook her breathing  this was his room the room he had had before he married it was familiar he remembered what it was to be a young man untouched  he remained suspended the child slept pushing her small fists from the shawl he could tell the woman her child was asleep but he must go to the other landing he started there was the sound of the owlsthe moaning of the woman what an uncanny sound it was not humanat least to a man  he went down to her room entering softly she was lying still with eyes shut pale tired his heart leapt fearing she was dead yet he knew perfectly well she was not he saw the way her hair went loose over her temples her mouth was shut with suffering in a sort of grin she was beautiful to himbut it was not human he had a dread of her as she lay there what had she to do with him she was other than himself  something made him go and touch her fingers that were still grasped on the sheet her browngrey eyes opened and looked at him she did not know him as himself but she knew him as the man she looked at him as a woman in childbirth looks at the man who begot the child in her an impersonal look in the extreme hour female to male her eyes closed again a great scalding peace went over him burning his heart and his entrails passing off into the infinite  when her pains began afresh tearing her he turned aside and could not look but his heart in torture was at peace his bowels were glad he went downstairs and to the door outside lifted his face to the rain and felt the darkness striking unseen and steadily upon him  the swift unseen threshing of the night upon him silenced him and he was overcome he turned away indoors humbly there was the infinite world eternal unchanging as well as the world of life    chapter iii  childhood of anna lensky  tom brangwen never loved his own son as he loved his stepchild anna when they told him it was a boy he had a thrill of pleasure he liked the confirmation of fatherhood it gave him satisfaction to know he had a son but he felt not very much outgoing to the baby itself he was its father that was enough  he was glad that his wife was mother of his child she was serene a little bit shadowy as if she were transplanted in the birth of the child she seemed to lose connection with her former self she became now really english really mrs brangwen her vitality however seemed lowered  she was still to brangwen immeasurably beautiful she was still passionate with a flame of being but the flame was not robust and present her eyes shone her face glowed for him but like some flower opened in the shade that could not bear the full light she loved the baby but even this with a sort of dimness a faint absence about her a shadowiness even in her motherlove when brangwen saw her nursing his child happy absorbed in it a pain went over him like a thin flame for he perceived how he must subdue himself in his approach to her and he wanted again the robust moral exchange of love and passion such as he had had at first with her at one time and another when they were matched at their highest intensity this was the one experience for him now and he wanted it always with remorseless craving  she came to him again with the same lifting of her mouth as had driven him almost mad with trammelled passion at first she came to him again and his heart delirious in delight and readiness he took her and it was almost as before  perhaps it was quite as before at any rate it made him know perfection it established in him a constant eternal knowledge  but it died down before he wanted it to die down she was finished she could take no more and he was not exhausted he wanted to go on but it could not be  so he had to begin the bitter lesson to abate himself to take less than he wanted for she was woman to him all other women were her shadows for she had satisfied him and he wanted it to go on and it could not however he raged and filled with suppression that became hot and bitter hated her in his soul that she did not want him however he had mad outbursts and drank and made ugly scenes still he knew he was only kicking against the pricks it was not he had to learn that she would not want him enough as much as he demanded that she should want him it was that she could not she could only want him in her own way and to her own measure and she had spent much life before he found her as she was the woman who could take him and give him fulfilment she had taken him and given him fulfilment she still could do so in her own times and ways but he must control himself measure himself to her  he wanted to give her all his love all his passion all his essential energy but it could not be he must find other things than her other centres of living she sat close and impregnable with the child and he was jealous of the child  but he loved her and time came to give some sort of course to his troublesome current of life so that it did not foam and flood and make misery he formed another centre of love in her child anna gradually a part of his stream of life was diverted to the child relieving the main flood to his wife also he sought the company of men he drank heavily now and again  the child ceased to have so much anxiety for her mother after the baby came seeing the mother with the baby boy delighted and serene and secure anna was at first puzzled then gradually she became indignant and at last her little life settled on its own swivel she was no more strained and distorted to support her mother she became more childish not so abnormal not charged with cares she could not understand the charge of the mother the satisfying of the mother had devolved elsewhere than on her gradually the child was freed she became an independent forgetful little soul loving from her own centre  of her own choice she then loved brangwen most or most obviously for these two made a little life together they had a joint activity it amused him at evening to teach her to count or to say her letters he remembered for her all the little nursery rhymes and childish songs that lay forgotten at the bottom of his brain  at first she thought them rubbish but he laughed and she laughed they became to her a huge joke old king cole she thought was brangwen mother hubbard was tilly her mother was the old woman who lived in a shoe it was a huge it was a frantic delight to the child this nonsense after her years with her mother after the poignant folktales she had had from her mother which always troubled and mystified her soul  she shared a sort of recklessness with her father a complete chosen carelessness that had the laugh of ridicule in it he loved to make her voice go high and shouting and defiant with laughter the baby was darkskinned and darkhaired like the mother and had hazel eyes brangwen called him the blackbird  hallo brangwen would cry starting as he heard the wail of the child announcing it wanted to be taken out of the cradle theres the blackbird tuning up  the blackbirds singing anna would shout with delight the blackbirds singing  when the pie was opened brangwen shouted in his bawling bass voice going over to the cradle the bird began to sing  wasnt it a dainty dish to set before a king cried anna her eyes flashing with joy as she uttered the cryptic words looking at brangwen for confirmation he sat down with the baby saying loudly  sing up my lad sing up  and the baby cried loudly and anna shouted lustily dancing in wild bliss     sing a song of sixpence    pocketful of posies    ascha ascha  then she stopped suddenly in silence and looked at brangwen again her eyes flashing as she shouted loudly and delightedly  ive got it wrong ive got it wrong  oh my sirs said tilly entering what a racket  brangwen hushed the child and anna flipped and danced on she loved her wild bursts of rowdiness with her father tilly hated it mrs brangwen did not mind  anna did not care much for other children she domineered them she treated them as if they were extremely young and incapable to her they were little people they were not her equals so she was mostly alone flying round the farm entertaining the farmhands and tilly and the servantgirl whirring on and never ceasing  she loved driving with brangwen in the trap then sitting high up and bowling along her passion for eminence and dominance was satisfied she was like a little savage in her arrogance she thought her father important she was installed beside him on high and they spanked along beside the high flourishing hedgetops surveying the activity of the countryside when people shouted a greeting to him from the road below and brangwen shouted jovially back her little voice was soon heard shrilling along with his followed by her chuckling laugh when she looked up at her father with bright eyes and they laughed at each other and soon it was the custom for the passerby to sing out how are ter tom well my lady or else mornin tom mornin my lass or else youre off together then or else youre lookin rarely you two  anna would respond with her father how are you john good mornin william ay makin for derby shrilling as loudly as she could though often in response to youre off out a bit then she would reply yes we are to the great joy of all she did not like the people who saluted him and did not salute her  she went into the publichouse with him if he had to call and often sat beside him in the barparlour as he drank his beer or brandy the landladies paid court to her in the obsequious way landladies have  well little lady an whats your name  anna brangwen came the immediate haughty answer  indeed it is an do you like driving in a trap with your father  yes said anna shy but bored by these inanities she had a touchmenot way of blighting the inane inquiries of grownup people  my word shes a fawce little thing the landlady would say to brangwen  ay he answered not encouraging comments on the child then there followed the present of a biscuit or of cake which anna accepted as her dues  what does she say that im a fawce little thing the small girl asked afterwards  she means youre a sharpshins  anna hesitated she did not understand then she laughed at some absurdity she found  soon he took her every week to market with him i can come cant i she asked every saturday or thursday morning when he made himself look fine in his dress of a gentleman farmer and his face clouded at having to refuse her  so at last he overcame his own shyness and tucked her beside him they drove into nottingham and put up at the black swan so far all right then he wanted to leave her at the inn but he saw her face and knew it was impossible so he mustered his courage and set off with her holding her hand to the cattlemarket  she stared in bewilderment flitting silent at his side but in the cattlemarket she shrank from the press of men all men all in heavy filthy boots and leathern leggins and the road underfoot was all nasty with cowmuck and it frightened her to see the cattle in the square pens so many horns and so little enclosure and such a madness of men and a yelling of drovers also she felt her father was embarrassed by her and illatease  he brought her a cake at the refreshmentbooth and set her on a seat a man hailed him  good morning tom that thine thenand the bearded farmer jerked his head at anna  ay said brangwen deprecating  i didna know thad one that old  no its my mississ  oh thats it and the man looked at anna as if she were some odd little cattle she glowered with black eyes  brangwen left her there in charge of the barman whilst he went to see about the selling of some young stirks farmers butchers drovers dirty uncouth men from whom she shrank instinctively stared down at her as she sat on her seat then went to get their drink talking in unabated tones all was big and violent about her  whose child met that be they asked of the barman  it belongs to tom brangwen  the child sat on in neglect watching the door for her father he never came many many men came but not he and she sat like a shadow she knew one did not cry in such a place and every man looked at her inquisitively she shut herself away from them  a deep gathering coldness of isolation took hold on her he was never coming back she sat on frozen unmoving  when she had become blank and timeless he came and she slipped off her seat to him like one come back from the dead he had sold his beast as quickly as he could but all the business was not finished he took her again through the hurtling welter of the cattlemarket  then at last they turned and went out through the gate he was always hailing one man or another always stopping to gossip about land and cattle and horses and other things she did not understand standing in the filth and the smell among the legs and great boots of men and always she heard the questions  what lass is that then i didnt know thad one o that age  it belongs to my missis  anna was very conscious of her derivation from her mother in the end and of her alienation  but at last they were away and brangwen went with her into a little dark ancient eatinghouse in the bridlesmithgate they had cowstail soup and meat and cabbage and potatoes other men other people came into the dark vaulted place to eat anna was wideeyed and silent with wonder  then they went into the big market into the corn exchange then to shops he bought her a little book off a stall he loved buying things odd things that he thought would be useful then they went to the black swan and she drank milk and he brandy and they harnessed the horse and drove off up the derby road  she was tired out with wonder and marvelling but the next day when she thought of it she skipped flipping her leg in the odd dance she did and talked the whole time of what had happened to her of what she had seen it lasted her all the week and the next saturday she was eager to go again  she became a familiar figure in the cattlemarket sitting waiting in the little booth but she liked best to go to derby there her father had more friends and she liked the familiarity of the smaller town the nearness of the river the strangeness that did not frighten her it was so much smaller she liked the coveredin market and the old women she liked the george inn where her father put up the landlord was brangwens old friend and anna was made much of she sat many a day in the cosy parlour talking to mr wigginton a fat man with red hair the landlord and when the farmers all gathered at twelve oclock for dinner she was a little heroine  at first she would only glower or hiss at these strange men with their uncouth accent but they were goodhumoured she was a little oddity with her fierce fair hair like spun glass sticking out in a flamy halo round the appleblossom face and the black eyes and the men liked an oddity she kindled their attention  she was very angry because marriott a gentlemanfarmer from ambergate called her the little polecat  why youre a polecat he said to her  im not she flashed  you are thats just how a polecat goes  she thought about it  well youreyoure she began  im what  she looked him up and down  youre a bowleg man  which he was there was a roar of laughter they loved her that she was indomitable  ah said marriott only a polecat says that  well i am a polecat she flamed  there was another roar of laughter from the men  they loved to tease her  well me little maid braithwaite would say to her an hows th lambs wool  he gave a tug at a glistening pale piece of her hair  its not lambs wool said anna indignantly putting back her offended lock  why whatst ca it then  its hair  hair wheriver dun they rear that sort  wheriver dun they she asked in dialect her curiosity overcoming her  instead of answering he shouted with joy it was the triumph to make her speak dialect  she had one enemy the man they called nutnat or natnut a cretin with inturned feet who came flaplapping along shoulder jerking up at every step this poor creature sold nuts in the publichouses where he was known he had no roof to his mouth and the men used to mock his speech  the first time he came into the george when anna was there she asked after he had gone her eyes very round  why does he do that when he walks  e canna elp isself duckie its th make o th fellow  she thought about it then she laughed nervously and then she bethought herself her cheeks flushed and she cried  hes a horrid man  nay hes non horrid he canna help it if he wor struck that road  but when poor nat came wambling in again she slid away and she would not eat his nuts if the men bought them for her and when the farmers gambled at dominoes for them she was angry  they are dirtymans nuts she cried  so a revulsion started against nat who had not long after to go to the workhouse  there grew in brangwens heart now a secret desire to make her a lady his brother alfred in nottingham had caused a great scandal by becoming the lover of an educated woman a lady widow of a doctor very often alfred brangwen went down as a friend to her cottage which was in derbyshire leaving his wife and family for a day or two then returning to them and noone dared gainsay him for he was a strongwilled direct man and he said he was a friend of this widow  one day brangwen met his brother on the station  where are you going to then asked the younger brother  im going down to wirksworth  youve got friends down there im told  yes  i sll have to be lookin in when im down that road  you please yourself  tom brangwen was so curious about the woman that the next time he was in wirksworth he asked for her house  he found a beautiful cottage on the steep side of a hill looking clean over the town that lay in the bottom of the basin and away at the old quarries on the opposite side of the space mrs forbes was in the garden she was a tall woman with white hair she came up the path taking off her thick gloves laying down her shears it was autumn she wore a widebrimmed hat  brangwen blushed to the roots of his hair and did not know what to say  i thought i might look in he said knowing you were friends of my brothers i had to come to wirksworth  she saw at once that he was a brangwen  will you come in she said my father is lying down  she took him into a drawingroom full of books with a piano and a violinstand and they talked she simply and easily she was full of dignity the room was of a kind brangwen had never known the atmosphere seemed open and spacious like a mountaintop to him  does my brother like reading he asked  some things he has been reading herbert spencer and we read browning sometimes  brangwen was full of admiration deep thrilling almost reverential admiration he looked at her with litup eyes when she said we read at last he burst out looking round the room  i didnt know our alfred was this way inclined  he is quite an unusual man  he looked at her in amazement she evidently had a new idea of his brother she evidently appreciated him he looked again at the woman she was about forty straight rather hard a curious separate creature himself he was not in love with her there was something chilling about her but he was filled with boundless admiration  at teatime he was introduced to her father an invalid who had to be helped about but who was ruddy and wellfavoured with snowy hair and watery blue eyes and a courtly naive manner that again was new and strange to brangwen so suave so merry so innocent  his brother was this womans lover it was too amazing brangwen went home despising himself for his own poor way of life he was a clodhopper and a boor dull stuck in the mud more than ever he wanted to clamber out to this visionary polite world  he was well off he was as well off as alfred who could not have above six hundred a year all told he himself made about four hundred and could make more his investments got better every day why did he not do something his wife was a lady also  but when he got to the marsh he realized how fixed everything was how the other form of life was beyond him and he regretted for the first time that he had succeeded to the farm he felt a prisoner sitting safe and easy and unadventurous he might with risk have done more with himself he could neither read browning nor herbert spencer nor have access to such a room as mrs forbess all that form of life was outside him  but then he said he did not want it the excitement of the visit began to pass off the next day he was himself and if he thought of the other woman there was something about her and her place that he did not like something cold something alien as if she were not a woman but an inhuman being who used up human life for cold unliving purposes  the evening came on he played with anna and then sat alone with his own wife she was sewing he sat very still smoking perturbed he was aware of his wifes quiet figure and quiet dark head bent over her needle it was too quiet for him it was too peaceful he wanted to smash the walls down and let the night in so that his wife should not be so secure and quiet sitting there he wished the air were not so close and narrow his wife was obliterated from him she was in her own world quiet secure unnoticed unnoticing he was shut down by her  he rose to go out he could not sit still any longer he must get out of this oppressive shutdown womanhaunt  his wife lifted her head and looked at him  are you going out she asked  he looked down and met her eyes they were darker than darkness and gave deeper space he felt himself retreating before her defensive whilst her eyes followed and tracked him own  i was just going up to cossethay he said  she remained watching him  why do you go she said  his heart beat fast and he sat down slowly  no reason particular he said beginning to fill his pipe again mechanically  why do you go away so often she said  but you dont want me he replied  she was silent for a while  you do not want to be with me any more she said  it startled him how did she know this truth he thought it was his secret  yi he said  you want to find something else she said  he did not answer did he he asked himself  you should not want so much attention she said you are not a baby  im not grumbling he said yet he knew he was  you think you have not enough she said  how enough  you think you have not enough in me but how do you know me what do you do to make me love you  he was flabbergasted  i never said i hadnt enough in you he replied i didnt know you wanted making to love me what do you want  you dont make it good between us any more you are not interested you do not make me want you  and you dont make me want you do you now there was a silence they were such strangers  would you like to have another woman she asked  his eyes grew round he did not know where he was how could she his own wife say such a thing but she sat there small and foreign and separate it dawned upon him she did not consider herself his wife except in so far as they agreed she did not feel she had married him at any rate she was willing to allow he might want another woman a gap a space opened before him  no he said slowly what other woman should i want  like your brother she said  he was silent for some time ashamed also  what of her he said i didnt like the woman  yes you liked her she answered persistently  he stared in wonder at his own wife as she told him his own heart so callously and he was indignant what right had she to sit there telling him these things she was his wife what right had she to speak to him like this as if she were a stranger  i didnt he said i want no woman  yes you would like to be like alfred  his silence was one of angry frustration he was astonished he had told her of his visit to wirksworth but briefly without interest he thought  as she sat with her strange dark face turned towards him her eyes watched him inscrutable casting him up he began to oppose her she was again the active unknown facing him must he admit her he resisted involuntarily  why should you want to find a woman who is more to you than me she said  the turbulence raged in his breast  i dont he said  why do you she repeated why do you want to deny me  suddenly in a flash he saw she might be lonely isolated unsure she had seemed to him the utterly certain satisfied absolute excluding him could she need anything  why arent you satisfied with meim not satisfied with you paul used to come to me and take me like a man does you only leave me alone or take me like your cattle quickly to forget me againso that you can forget me again  what am i to remember about you said brangwen  i want you to know there is somebody there besides yourself  well dont i know it  you come to me as if it was for nothing as if i was nothing there when paul came to me i was something to hima woman i was to you i am nothingit is like cattleor nothing  you make me feel as if i was nothing he said  they were silent she sat watching him he could not move his soul was seething and chaotic she turned to her sewing again but the sight of her bent before him held him and would not let him be she was a strange hostile dominant thing yet not quite hostile as he sat he felt his limbs were strong and hard he sat in strength  she was silent for a long time stitching he was aware poignantly of the round shape of her head very intimate compelling she lifted her head and sighed the blood burned in him her voice ran to him like fire  come here she said unsure  for some moments he did not move then he rose slowly and went across the hearth it required an almost deathly effort of volition or of acquiescence he stood before her and looked down at her her face was shining again her eyes were shining again like terrible laughter it was to him terrible how she could be transfigured he could not look at her it burnt his heart  my love she said  and she put her arms round him as he stood before her round his thighs pressing him against her breast and her hands on him seemed to reveal to him the mould of his own nakedness he was passionately lovely to himself he could not bear to look at her  my dear she said he knew she spoke a foreign language the fear was like bliss in his heart he looked down her face was shining her eyes were full of light she was awful he suffered from the compulsion to her she was the awful unknown he bent down to her suffering unable to let go unable to let himself go yet drawn driven she was now the transfigured she was wonderful beyond him he wanted to go but he could not as yet kiss her he was himself apart easiest he could kiss her feet but he was too ashamed for the actual deed which were like an affront she waited for him to meet her not to bow before her and serve her she wanted his active participation not his submission she put her fingers on him and it was torture to him that he must give himself to her actively participate in her that he must meet and embrace and know her who was other than himself there was that in him which shrank from yielding to her resisted the relaxing towards her opposed the mingling with her even while he most desired it he was afraid he wanted to save himself  there were a few moments of stillness then gradually the tension the withholding relaxed in him and he began to flow towards her she was beyond him the unattainable but he let go his hold on himself he relinquished himself and knew the subterranean force of his desire to come to her to be with her to mingle with her losing himself to find her to find himself in her he began to approach her to draw near  his blood beat up in waves of desire he wanted to come to her to meet her she was there if he could reach her the reality of her who was just beyond him absorbed him blind and destroyed he pressed forward nearer nearer to receive the consummation of himself he received within the darkness which should swallow him and yield him up to himself if he could come really within the blazing kernel of darkness if really he could be destroyed burnt away till he lit with her in one consummation that were supreme supreme  their coming together now after two years of married life was much more wonderful to them than it had been before it was the entry into another circle of existence it was the baptism to another life it was the complete confirmation their feet trod strange ground of knowledge their footsteps were litup with discovery wherever they walked it was well the world reechoed round them in discovery they went gladly and forgetful everything was lost and everything was found the new world was discovered it remained only to be explored  they had passed through the doorway into the further space where movement was so big that it contained bonds and constraints and labours and still was complete liberty she was the doorway to him he to her at last they had thrown open the doors each to the other and had stood in the doorways facing each other whilst the light flooded out from behind on to each of their faces it was the transfiguration glorification the admission  and always the light of the transfiguration burned on in their hearts he went his way as before she went her way to the rest of the world there seemed no change but to the two of them there was the perpetual wonder of the transfiguration  he did not know her any better any more precisely now that he knew her altogether poland her husband the warhe understood no more of this in her he did not understand her foreign nature half german half polish nor her foreign speech but he knew her he knew her meaning without understanding what she said what she spoke this was a blind gesture on her part in herself she walked strong and clear he knew her he saluted her was with her what was memory after all but the recording of a number of possibilities which had never been fulfilled what was paul lensky to her but an unfulfilled possibility to which he brangwen was the reality and the fulfilment what did it matter that anna lensky was born of lydia and paul god was her father and her mother he had passed through the married pair without fully making himself known to them  now he was declared to brangwen and to lydia brangwen as they stood together when at last they had joined hands the house was finished and the lord took up his abode and they were glad  the days went on as before brangwen went out to his work his wife nursed her child and attended in some measure to the farm they did not think of each otherwhy should they only when she touched him he knew her instantly that she was with him near him that she was the gateway and the way out that she was beyond and that he was travelling in her through the beyond whitherwhat does it matter he responded always when she called he answered when he asked her response came at once or at length  annas soul was put at peace between them she looked from one to the other and she saw them established to her safety and she was free she played between the pillar of fire and the pillar of cloud in confidence having the assurance on her right hand and the assurance on her left she was no longer called upon to uphold with her childish might the broken end of the arch her father and her mother now met to the span of the heavens and she the child was free to play in the space beneath between    chapter iv  girlhood of anne brangwen  when anna was nine years old brangwen sent her to the dames school in cossethay there she went flipping and dancing in her inconsequential fashion doing very much as she liked disconcerting old miss coates by her indifference to respectability and by her lack of reverence anna only laughed at miss coates liked her and patronized her in superb childish fashion  the girl was at once shy and wild she had a curious contempt for ordinary people a benevolent superiority she was very shy and tortured with misery when people did not like her on the other hand she cared very little for anybody save her mother whom she still rather resentfully worshipped and her father whom she loved and patronized but upon whom she depended these two her mother and father held her still in fee but she was free of other people towards whom on the whole she took the benevolent attitude she deeply hated ugliness or intrusion or arrogance however as a child she was as proud and shadowy as a tiger and as aloof she could confer favours but save from her mother and father she could receive none she hated people who came too near to her like a wild thing she wanted her distance she mistrusted intimacy  in cossethay and ilkeston she was always an alien she had plenty of acquaintances but no friends very few people whom she met were significant to her they seemed part of a herd undistinguished she did not take people very seriously  she had two brothers tom darkhaired small volatile whom she was intimately related to but whom she never mingled with and fred fair and responsive whom she adored but did not consider as a real separate thing she was too much the centre of her own universe too little aware of anything outside  the first person she met who affected her as a real living person whom she regarded as having definite existence was baron skrebensky her mothers friend he also was a polish exile who had taken orders and had received from mr gladstone a small country living in yorkshire  when anna was about ten years old she went with her mother to spend a few days with the baron skrebensky he was very unhappy in his redbrick vicarage he was vicar of a country church a living worth a little over two hundred pounds a year but he had a large parish containing several collieries with a new raw heathen population he went to the north of england expecting homage from the common people for he was an aristocrat he was roughly even cruelly received but he never understood it he remained a fiery aristocrat only he had to learn to avoid his parishioners  anna was very much impressed by him he was a smallish man with a rugged rather crumpled face and blue eyes set very deep and glowing his wife was a tall thin woman of noble polish family mad with pride he still spoke broken english for he had kept very close to his wife both of them forlorn in this strange inhospitable country and they always spoke in polish together he was disappointed with mrs brangwens soft natural english very disappointed that her child spoke no polish  anna loved to watch him she liked the big new rambling vicarage desolate and stark on its hill it was so exposed so bleak and bold after the marsh the baron talked endlessly in polish to mrs brangwen he made furious gestures with his hands his blue eyes were full of fire and to anna there was a significance about his sharp flinging movements something in her responded to his extravagance and his exuberant manner she thought him a very wonderful person she was shy of him she liked him to talk to her she felt a sense of freedom near him  she never could tell how she knew it but she did know that he was a knight of malta she could never remember whether she had seen his star or cross of his order or not but it flashed in her mind like a symbol he at any rate represented to the child the real world where kings and lords and princes moved and fulfilled their shining lives whilst queens and ladies and princesses upheld the noble order  she had recognized the baron skrebensky as a real person he had had some regard for her but when she did not see him any more he faded and became a memory but as a memory he was always alive to her  anna became a tall awkward girl her eyes were still very dark and quick but they had grown careless they had lost their watchful hostile look her fierce spun hair turned brown it grew heavier and was tied back she was sent to a young ladies school in nottingham  and at this period she was absorbed in becoming a young lady she was intelligent enough but not interested in learning at first she thought all the girls at school very ladylike and wonderful and she wanted to be like them she came to a speedy disillusion they galled and maddened her they were petty and mean after the loose generous atmosphere of her home where little things did not count she was always uneasy in the world that would snap and bite at every trifle  a quick change came over her she mistrusted herself she mistrusted the outer world she did not want to go on she did not want to go out into it she wanted to go no further  what do i care about that lot of girls she would say to her father contemptuously they are nobody  the trouble was that the girls would not accept anna at her measure they would have her according to themselves or not at all so she was confused seduced she became as they were for a time and then in revulsion she hated them furiously  why dont you ask some of your girls here her father would say  theyre not coming here she cried  and why not  theyre bagatelle she said using one of her mothers rare phrases  bagatelles or billiards it makes no matter theyre nice young lasses enough  but anna was not to be won over she had a curious shrinking from commonplace people and particularly from the young lady of her day she would not go into company because of the illatease feeling other people brought upon her and she never could decide whether it were her fault or theirs she half respected these other people and continuous disillusion maddened her she wanted to respect them still she thought the people she did not know were wonderful those she knew seemed always to be limiting her tying her up in little falsities that irritated her beyond bearing she would rather stay at home and avoid the rest of the world leaving it illusory  for at the marsh life had indeed a certain freedom and largeness there was no fret about money no mean little precedence nor care for what other people thought because neither mrs brangwen nor brangwen could be sensible of any judgment passed on them from outside their lives were too separate  so anna was only easy at home where the common sense and the supreme relation between her parents produced a freer standard of being than she could find outside where outside the marsh could she find the tolerant dignity she had been brought up in her parents stood undiminished and unaware of criticism the people she met outside seemed to begrudge her her very existence they seemed to want to belittle her also she was exceedingly reluctant to go amongst them she depended upon her mother and her father and yet she wanted to go out  at school or in the world she was usually at fault she felt usually that she ought to be slinking in disgrace she never felt quite sure in herself whether she were wrong or whether the others were wrong she had not done her lessons well she did not see any reason why she should do her lessons if she did not want to was there some occult reason why she should were these people schoolmistresses representatives of some mystic right some higher good they seemed to think so themselves but she could not for her life see why a woman should bully and insult her because she did not know thirty lines of as you like it after all what did it matter if she knew them or not nothing could persuade her that it was of the slightest importance because she despised inwardly the coarsely working nature of the mistress therefore she was always at outs with authority from constant telling she came almost to believe in her own badness her own intrinsic inferiority she felt that she ought always to be in a state of slinking disgrace if she fulfilled what was expected of her but she rebelled she never really believed in her own badness at the bottom of her heart she despised the other people who carped and were loud over trifles she despised them and wanted revenge on them she hated them whilst they had power over her  still she kept an ideal a free proud lady absolved from the petty ties existing beyond petty considerations she would see such ladies in pictures alexandra princess of wales was one of her models this lady was proud and royal and stepped indifferently over all small mean desires so thought anna in her heart and the girl did up her hair high under a little slanting hat her skirts were fashionably bunched up she wore an elegant skinfitting coat  her father was delighted anna was very proud in her bearing too naturally indifferent to smaller bonds to satisfy ilkeston which would have liked to put her down but brangwen was having no such thing if she chose to be royal royal she should be he stood like a rock between her and the world  after the fashion of his family he grew stout and handsome his blue eyes were full of light twinkling and sensitive his manner was deliberate but hearty warm his capacity for living his own life without attention from his neighbours made them respect him they would run to do anything for him he did not consider them but was openhanded towards them so they made profit of their willingness he liked people so long as they remained in the background  mrs brangwen went on in her own way following her own devices she had her husband her two sons and anna these staked out and marked her horizon the other people were outsiders inside her own world her life passed along like a dream for her it lapsed and she lived within its lapse active and always pleased intent she scarcely noticed the outer things at all what was outside was outside nonexistent she did not mind if the boys fought so long as it was out of her presence but if they fought when she was by she was angry and they were afraid of her she did not care if they broke a window of a railway carriage or sold their watches to have a revel at the goose fair brangwen was perhaps angry over these things to the mother they were insignificant it was odd little things that offended her she was furious if the boys hung around the slaughterhouse she was displeased when the school reports were bad it did not matter how many sins her boys were accused of so long as they were not stupid or inferior if they seemed to brook insult she hated them and it was only a certain gaucherie a gawkiness on annas part that irritated her against the girl certain forms of clumsiness grossness made the mothers eyes glow with curious rage otherwise she was pleased indifferent  pursuing her splendidlady ideal anna became a lofty demoiselle of sixteen plagued by family shortcomings she was very sensitive to her father she knew if he had been drinking were he ever so little affected and she could not bear it he flushed when he drank the veins stood out on his temples there was a twinkling cavalier boisterousness in his eye his manner was jovially overbearing and mocking and it angered her when she heard his loud roaring boisterous mockery an anger of resentment filled her she was quick to forestall him the moment he came in  you look a sight you do red in the face she cried  i might look worse if i was green he answered  boozing in ilkeston  and whats wrong wi ilson  she flounced away he watched her with amused twinkling eyes yet in spite of himself said that she flouted him  they were a curious family a law to themselves separate from the world isolated a small republic set in invisible bounds the mother was quite indifferent to ilkeston and cossethay to any claims made on her from outside she was very shy of any outsider exceedingly courteous winning even but the moment the visitor had gone she laughed and dismissed him he did not exist it had been all a game to her she was still a foreigner unsure of her ground but alone with her own children and husband at the marsh she was mistress of a little native land that lacked nothing  she had some beliefs somewhere never defined she had been brought up a roman catholic she had gone to the church of england for protection the outward form was a matter of indifference to her yet she had some fundamental religion it was as if she worshipped god as a mystery never seeking in the least to define what he was  and inside her the subtle sense of the great absolute wherein she had her being was very strong the english dogma never reached her the language was too foreign through it all she felt the great separator who held life in his hands gleaming imminent terrible the great mystery immediate beyond all telling  she shone and gleamed to the mystery whom she knew through all her senses she glanced with strange mystic superstitions that never found expression in the english language never mounted to thought in english but so she lived within a potent sensuous belief that included her family and contained her destiny  to this she had reduced her husband he existed with her entirely indifferent to the general values of the world her very ways the very mark of her eyebrows were symbols and indication to him there on the farm with her he lived through a mystery of life and death and creation strange profound ecstasies and incommunicable satisfactions of which the rest of the world knew nothing which made the pair of them apart and respected in the english village for they were also welltodo  but anna was only half safe within her mothers unthinking knowledge she had a motherofpearl rosary that had been her own fathers what it meant to her she could never say but the string of moonlight and silver when she had it between her fingers filled her with strange passion she learned at school a little latin she learned an ave maria and a pater noster she learned how to say her rosary but that was no good ave maria gratia plena dominus tecum benedicta tu in mulieribus et benedictus fructus ventris tui jesus ave maria sancta maria ora pro nobis peccatoribus nunc et in hora mortis nostrae amen  it was not right somehow what these words meant when translated was not the same as the pale rosary meant there was a discrepancy a falsehood it irritated her to say dominus tecum or benedicta tu in mulieribus she loved the mystic words ave maria sancta maria she was moved by benedictus fructus ventris tui jesus and by nunc et in hora mortis nostrae but none of it was quite real it was not satisfactory somehow  she avoided her rosary because moving her with curious passion as it did it meant only these not very significant things she put it away it was her instinct to put all these things away it was her instinct to avoid thinking to avoid it to save herself  she was seventeen touchy full of spirits and very moody quick to flush and always uneasy uncertain for some reason or other she turned more to her father she felt almost flashes of hatred for her mother her mothers dark muzzle and curiously insidious ways her mothers utter surety and confidence her strange satisfaction even triumph her mothers way of laughing at things and her mothers silent overriding of vexatious propositions most of all her mothers triumphant power maddened the girl  she became sudden and incalculable often she stood at the window looking out as if she wanted to go sometimes she went she mixed with people but always she came home in anger as if she were diminished belittled almost degraded  there was over the house a kind of dark silence and intensity in which passion worked its inevitable conclusions there was in the house a sort of richness a deep inarticulate interchange which made other places seem thin and unsatisfying brangwen could sit silent smoking in his chair the mother could move about in her quiet insidious way and the sense of the two presences was powerful sustaining the whole intercourse was wordless intense and close  but anna was uneasy she wanted to get away yet wherever she went there came upon her that feeling of thinness as if she were made smaller belittled she hastened home  there she raged and interrupted the strong settled interchange sometimes her mother turned on her with a fierce destructive anger in which was no pity or consideration and anna shrank afraid she went to her father  he would still listen to the spoken word which fell sterile on the unheeding mother sometimes anna talked to her father she tried to discuss people she wanted to know what was meant but her father became uneasy he did not want to have things dragged into consciousness only out of consideration for her he listened and there was a kind of bristling rousedness in the room the cat got up and stretching itself went uneasily to the door mrs brangwen was silent she seemed ominous anna could not go on with her faultfinding her criticism her expression of dissatisfactions she felt even her father against her he had a strong dark bond with her mother a potent intimacy that existed inarticulate and wild following its own course and savage if interrupted uncovered  nevertheless brangwen was uneasy about the girl the whole house continued to be disturbed she had a pathetic baffled appeal she was hostile to her parents even whilst she lived entirely with them within their spell  many ways she tried of escape she became an assiduous churchgoer but the language meant nothing to her it seemed false she hated to hear things expressed put into words whilst the religious feelings were inside her they were passionately moving in the mouth of the clergyman they were false indecent she tried to read but again the tedium and the sense of the falsity of the spoken word put her off she went to stay with girl friends at first she thought it splendid but then the inner boredom came on it seemed to her all nothingness and she felt always belittled as if never never could she stretch her length and stride her stride  her mind reverted often to the torture cell of a certain bishop of france in which the victim could neither stand nor lie stretched out never not that she thought of herself in any connection with this but often there came into her mind the wonder how the cell was built and she could feel the horror of the crampedness as something very real  she was however only eighteen when a letter came from mrs alfred brangwen in nottingham saying that her son william was coming to ilkeston to take a place as junior draughtsman scarcely more than apprentice in a lace factory he was twenty years old and would the marsh brangwens be friendly with him  tom brangwen at once wrote offering the young man a home at the marsh this was not accepted but the nottingham brangwens expressed gratitude  there had never been much love lost between the nottingham brangwens and the marsh indeed mrs alfred having inherited three thousand pounds and having occasion to be dissatisfied with her husband held aloof from all the brangwens whatsoever she affected however some esteem of mrs tom as she called the polish woman saying that at any rate she was a lady  anna brangwen was faintly excited at the news of her cousin wills coming to ilkeston she knew plenty of young men but they had never become real to her she had seen in this young gallant a nose she liked in that a pleasant moustache in the other a nice way of wearing clothes in one a ridiculous fringe of hair in another a comical way of talking they were objects of amusement and faint wonder to her rather than real beings the young men  the only man she knew was her father and as he was something large looming a kind of godhead he embraced all manhood for her and other men were just incidental  she remembered her cousin will he had town clothes and was thin with a very curious head black as jet with hair like sleek thin fur it was a curious head it reminded her she knew not of what of some animal some mysterious animal that lived in the darkness under the leaves and never came out but which lived vividly swift and intense she always thought of him with that black keen blind head and she considered him odd  he appeared at the marsh one sunday morning a rather long thin youth with a bright face and a curious selfpossession among his shyness a native unawareness of what other people might be since he was himself  when anna came downstairs in her sunday clothes ready for church he rose and greeted her conventionally shaking hands his manners were better than hers she flushed she noticed that he now had a thick fledge on his upper lip a black finelyshapen line marking his wide mouth it rather repelled her it reminded her of the thin fine fur of his hair she was aware of something strange in him  his voice had rather high upper notes and very resonant middle notes it was queer she wondered why he did it but he sat very naturally in the marsh livingroom he had some uncouthness some natural selfpossession of the brangwens that made him at home there  anna was rather troubled by the strangely intimate affectionate way her father had towards this young man he seemed gentle towards him he put himself aside in order to fill out the young man this irritated anna  father she said abruptly give me some collection  what collection asked brangwen  dont be ridiculous she cried flushing  nay he said what collections this  you know its the first sunday of the month  anna stood confused why was he doing this why was he making her conspicuous before this stranger  i want some collection she reasserted  so tha says he replied indifferently looking at her then turning again to this nephew  she went forward and thrust her hand into his breeches pocket he smoked steadily making no resistance talking to his nephew her hand groped about in his pocket and then drew out his leathern purse her colour was bright in her clear cheeks her eyes shone brangwens eyes were twinkling the nephew sat sheepishly anna in her finery sat down and slid all the money into her lap there was silver and gold the youth could not help watching her she was bent over the heap of money fingering the different coins  ive a good mind to take half a sovereign she said and she looked up with glowing dark eyes she met the lightbrown eyes of her cousin close and intent upon her she was startled she laughed quickly and turned to her father  ive a good mind to take half a sovereign our dad she said  yes nimble fingers said her father you take whats your own  are you coming our anna asked her brother from the door  she suddenly chilled to normal forgetting both her father and her cousin  yes im ready she said taking sixpence from the heap of money and sliding the rest back into the purse which she laid on the table  give it here said her father  hastily she thrust the purse into his pocket and was going out  youd better go wi em lad hadnt you said the father to the nephew  will brangwen rose uncertainly he had goldenbrown quick steady eyes like a birds like a hawks which cannot look afraid  your cousin will ll come with you said the father  anna glanced at the strange youth again she felt him waiting there for her to notice him he was hovering on the edge of her consciousness ready to come in she did not want to look at him she was antagonistic to him  she waited without speaking her cousin took his hat and joined her it was summer outside her brother fred was plucking a sprig of flowery currant to put in his coat from the bush at the angle of the house she took no notice her cousin followed just behind her  they were on the high road she was aware of a strangeness in her being it made her uncertain she caught sight of the flowering currant in her brothers buttonhole  oh our fred she cried dont wear that stuff to go to church  fred looked down protectively at the pink adornment on his breast  why i like it he said  then youre the only one who does im sure she said  and she turned to her cousin  do you like the smell of it she asked  he was there beside her tall and uncouth and yet selfpossessed it excited her  i cant say whether i do or not he replied  give it here fred dont have it smelling in church she said to the little boy her page  her fair small brother handed her the flower dutifully she sniffed it and gave it without a word to her cousin for his judgment he smelled the dangling flower curiously  its a funny smell he said  and suddenly she laughed and a quick light came on all their faces there was a blithe trip in the small boys walk  the bells were ringing they were going up the summery hill in their sunday clothes anna was very fine in a silk frock of brown and white stripes tight along the arms and the body bunched up very elegantly behind the skirt there was something of the cavalier about will brangwen and he was well dressed  he walked along with the sprig of currantblossom dangling between his fingers and none of them spoke the sun shone brightly on little showers of buttercup down the bank in the fields the foolsparsley was foamy held very high and proud above a number of flowers that flitted in the greenish twilight of the mowinggrass below  they reached the church fred led the way to the pew followed by the cousin then anna she felt very conspicuous and important somehow this young man gave her away to other people he stood aside and let her pass to her place then sat next to her it was a curious sensation to sit next to him  the colour came streaming from the painted window above her it lit on the dark wood of the pew on the stone worn aisle on the pillar behind her cousin and on her cousins hands as they lay on his knees she sat amid illumination illumination and luminous shadow all around her her soul very bright she sat without knowing it conscious of the hands and motionless knees of her cousin something strange had entered into her world something entirely strange and unlike what she knew  she was curiously elated she sat in a glowing world of unreality very delightful a brooding light like laughter was in her eyes she was aware of a strange influence entering in to her which she enjoyed it was a dark enrichening influence she had not known before she did not think of her cousin but she was startled when his hands moved  she wished he would not say the responses so plainly it diverted her from her vague enjoyment why would he obtrude and draw notice to himself it was bad taste but she went on all right till the hymn came he stood up beside her to sing and that pleased her then suddenly at the very first word his voice came strong and overriding filling the church he was singing the tenor her soul opened in amazement his voice filled the church it rang out like a trumpet and rang out again she started to giggle over her hymnbook but he went on perfectly steady up and down rang his voice going its own way she was helplessly shocked into laughter between moments of dead silence in herself she shook with laughter on came the laughter seized her and shook her till the tears were in her eyes she was amazed and rather enjoyed it and still the hymn rolled on and still she laughed she bent over her hymnbook crimson with confusion but still her sides shook with laughter she pretended to cough she pretended to have a crumb in her throat fred was gazing up at her with clear blue eyes she was recovering herself and then a slur in the strong blind voice at her side brought it all on again in a gust of mad laughter  she bent down to prayer in cold reproof of herself and yet as she knelt little eddies of giggling went over her the very sight of his knees on the praying cushion sent the little shock of laughter over her  she gathered herself together and sat with prim pure face white and pink and cold as a christmas rose her hands in her silk gloves folded on her lap her dark eyes all vague abstracted in a sort of dream oblivious of everything  the sermon rolled on vaguely in a tide of pregnant peace  her cousin took out his pockethandkerchief he seemed to be drifted absorbed into the sermon he put his handkerchief to his face then something dropped on to his knee there lay the bit of flowering currant he was looking down at it in real astonishment a wild snort of laughter came from anna everybody heard it was torture he had shut the crumpled flower in his hand and was looking up again with the same absorbed attention to the sermon another snort of laughter from anna fred nudged her remindingly  her cousin sat motionless somehow he was aware that his face was red she could feel him his hand closed over the flower remained quite still pretending to be normal another wild struggle in annas breast and the snort of laughter she bent forward shaking with laughter it was now no joke fred was nudgenudging at her she nudged him back fiercely then another vicious spasm of laughter seized her she tried to ward it off in a little cough the cough ended in a suppressed whoop she wanted to die and the closed hand crept away to the pocket whilst she sat in taut suspense the laughter rushed back at her knowing he was fumbling in his pocket to shove the flower away  in the end she felt weak exhausted and thoroughly depressed a blankness of wincing depression came over her she hated the presence of the other people her face became quite haughty she was unaware of her cousin any more  when the collection arrived with the last hymn her cousin was again singing resoundingly and still it amused her in spite of the shameful exhibition she had made of herself it amused her still she listened to it in a spell of amusement and the bag was thrust in front of her and her sixpence was mingled in the folds of her glove in her haste to get it out it flipped away and went twinkling in the next pew she stood and giggled she could not help it she laughed outright a figure of shame  what were you laughing about our anna asked fred the moment they were out of the church  oh i couldnt help it she said in her careless halfmocking fashion i dont know why cousin wills singing set me off  what was there in my singing to make you laugh he asked  it was so loud she said  they did not look at each other but they both laughed again both reddening  what were you snorting and laughing for our anna asked tom the elder brother at the dinner table his hazel eyes bright with joy everybody stopped to look at you tom was in the choir  she was aware of wills eyes shining steadily upon her waiting for her to speak  it was cousin wills singing she said  at which her cousin burst into a suppressed chuckling laugh suddenly showing all his small regular rather sharp teeth and just as quickly closing his mouth again  has he got such a remarkable voice on him then asked brangwen  no its not that said anna only it tickled mei couldnt tell you why  and again a ripple of laughter went down the table  will brangwen thrust forward his dark face his eyes dancing and said  im in the choir of st nicholas  oh you go to church then said brangwen  mother doesfather doesnt replied the youth  it was the little things his movement the funny tones of his voice that showed up big to anna the matteroffact things he said were absurd in contrast the things her father said seemed meaningless and neutral  during the afternoon they sat in the parlour that smelled of geranium and they ate cherries and talked will brangwen was called on to give himself forth and soon he was drawn out  he was interested in churches in church architecture the influence of ruskin had stimulated him to a pleasure in the medieval forms his talk was fragmentary he was only half articulate but listening to him as he spoke of church after church of nave and chancel and transept of roodscreen and font of hatchetcarving and moulding and tracery speaking always with close passion of particular things particular places there gathered in her heart a pregnant hush of churches a mystery a ponderous significance of bowed stone a dimcoloured light through which something took place obscurely passing into darkness a high delighted framework of the mystic screen and beyond in the furthest beyond the altar it was a very real experience she was carried away and the land seemed to be covered with a vast mystic church reserved in gloom thrilled with an unknown presence  almost it hurt her to look out of the window and see the lilacs towering in the vivid sunshine or was this the jewelled glass  he talked of gothic and renaissance and perpendicular and early english and norman the words thrilled her  have you been to southwell he said i was there at twelve oclock at midday eating my lunch in the churchyard and the bells played a hymn  ay its a fine minster southwell heavy its got heavy round arches rather low on thick pillars its grand the way those arches travel forward  theres a sedilia as wellpretty but i like the main body of the churchand that north porch  he was very much excited and filled with himself that afternoon a flame kindled round him making his experience passionate and glowing burningly real  his uncle listened with twinkling eyes halfmoved his aunt bent forward her dark face halfmoved but held by other knowledge anna went with him  he returned to his lodging at night treading quick his eyes glittering and his face shining darkly as if he came from some passionate vital tryst  the glow remained in him the fire burned his heart was fierce like a sun he enjoyed his unknown life and his own self and he was ready to go back to the marsh  without knowing it anna was wanting him to come in him she had escaped in him the bounds of her experience were transgressed he was the hole in the wall beyond which the sunshine blazed on an outside world  he came sometimes not often but sometimes talking again there recurred the strange remote reality which carried everything before it sometimes he talked of his father whom he hated with a hatred that was burningly close to love of his mother whom he loved with a love that was keenly close to hatred or to revolt his sentences were clumsy he was only half articulate but he had the wonderful voice that could ring its vibration through the girls soul transport her into his feeling sometimes his voice was hot and declamatory sometimes it had a strange twanging almost catlike sound sometimes it hesitated puzzled sometimes there was the break of a little laugh anna was taken by him she loved the running flame that coursed through her as she listened to him and his mother and his father became to her two separate people in her life  for some weeks the youth came frequently and was received gladly by them all he sat amongst them his dark face glowing an eagerness and a touch of derisiveness on his wide mouth something grinning and twisted his eyes always shining like a birds utterly without depth there was no getting hold of the fellow brangwen irritably thought he was like a grinning young tomcat that came when he thought he would and without cognizance of the other person  at first the youth had looked towards tom brangwen when he talked and then he looked towards his aunt for her appreciation valuing it more than his uncles and then he turned to anna because from her he got what he wanted which was not in the elder people  so that the two young people from being always attendant on the elder began to draw apart and establish a separate kingdom sometimes tom brangwen was irritated his nephew irritated him the lad seemed to him too special selfcontained his nature was fierce enough but too much abstracted like a separate thing like a cats nature a cat could lie perfectly peacefully on the hearthrug whilst its master or mistress writhed in agony a yard away it had nothing to do with other peoples affairs what did the lad really care about anything save his own instinctive affairs  brangwen was irritated nevertheless he liked and respected his nephew mrs brangwen was irritated by anna who was suddenly changed under the influence of the youth the mother liked the boy he was not quite an outsider but she did not like her daughter to be so much under the spell  so that gradually the two young people drew apart escaped from the elders to create a new thing by themselves he worked in the garden to propitiate his uncle he talked churches to propitiate his aunt he followed anna like a shadow like a long persistent unswerving black shadow he went after the girl it irritated brangwen exceedingly it exasperated him beyond bearing to see the litup grin the catgrin as he called it on his nephews face  and anna had a new reserve a new independence suddenly she began to act independently of her parents to live beyond them her mother had flashes of anger  but the courtship went on anna would find occasion to go shopping in ilkeston at evening she always returned with her cousin he walking with his head over her shoulder a little bit behind her like the devil looking over lincoln as brangwen noted angrily and yet with satisfaction  to his own wonder will brangwen found himself in an electric state of passion to his wonder he had stopped her at the gate as they came home from ilkeston one night and had kissed her blocking her way and kissing her whilst he felt as if some blow were struck at him in the dark and when they went indoors he was acutely angry that her parents looked up scrutinizing at him and her what right had they there why should they look up let them remove themselves or look elsewhere  and the youth went home with the stars in heaven whirling fiercely about the blackness of his head and his heart fierce insistent but fierce as if he felt something baulking him he wanted to smash through something  a spell was cast over her and how uneasy her parents were as she went about the house unnoticing not noticing them moving in a spell as if she were invisible to them she was invisible to them it made them angry yet they had to submit she went about absorbed obscured for a while  over him too the darkness of obscurity settled he seemed to be hidden in a tense electric darkness in which his soul his life was intensely active but without his aid or attention his mind was obscured he worked swiftly and mechanically and he produced some beautiful things  his favourite work was woodcarving the first thing he made for her was a butterstamper in it he carved a mythological bird a phoenix something like an eagle rising on symmetrical wings from a circle of very beautiful flickering flames that rose upwards from the rim of the cup  anna thought nothing of the gift on the evening when he gave it to her in the morning however when the butter was made she fetched his seal in place of the old wooden stamper of oakleaves and acorns she was curiously excited to see how it would turn out strange the uncouth bird moulded there in the cuplike hollow with curious thick waverings running inwards from a smooth rim she pressed another mould strange to lift the stamp and see that eaglebeaked bird raising its breast to her she loved creating it over and over again and every time she looked it seemed a new thing come to life every piece of butter became this strange vital emblem  she showed it to her mother and father  that is beautiful said her mother a little light coming on to her face  beautiful exclaimed the father puzzled fretted why what sort of a bird does he call it  and this was the question put by the customers during the next weeks  what sort of a bird do you call that as youve got on th butter  when he came in the evening she took him into the dairy to show him  do you like it he asked in his loud vibrating voice that always sounded strange reechoing in the dark places of her being  they very rarely touched each other they liked to be alone together near to each other but there was still a distance between them  in the cool dairy the candlelight lit on the large white surfaces of the cream pans he turned his head sharply it was so cool and remote in there so remote his mouth was open in a little strained laugh she stood with her head bent turned aside he wanted to go near to her he had kissed her once again his eye rested on the round blocks of butter where the emblematic bird lifted its breast from the shadow cast by the candle flame what was restraining him her breast was near him his head lifted like an eagles she did not move suddenly with an incredibly quick delicate movement he put his arms round her and drew her to him it was quick cleanly done like a bird that swoops and sinks close closer  he was kissing her throat she turned and looked at him her eyes were dark and flowing with fire his eyes were hard and bright with a fierce purpose and gladness like a hawks she felt him flying into the dark space of her flames like a brand like a gleaming hawk  they had looked at each other and seen each other strange yet near very near like a hawk stooping swooping dropping into a flame of darkness so she took the candle and they went back to the kitchen  they went on in this way for some time always coming together but rarely touching very seldom did they kiss and then often it was merely a touch of the lips a sign but her eyes began to waken with a constant fire she paused often in the midst of her transit as if to recollect something or to discover something  and his face became sombre intent he did not really hear what was said to him  one evening in august he came when it was raining he came in with his jacket collar turned up his jacket buttoned close his face wet and he looked so slim and definite coming out of the chill rain she was suddenly blinded with love for him yet he sat and talked with her father and mother meaninglessly whilst her blood seethed to anguish in her she wanted to touch him now only to touch him  there was the queer abstract look on her silvery radiant face that maddened her father her dark eyes were hidden but she raised them to the youth and they were dark with a flare that made him quail for a moment  she went into the second kitchen and took a lantern her father watched her as she returned  come with me will she said to her cousin i want to see if i put the brick over where that rat comes in  youve no need to do that retorted her father she took no notice the youth was between the two wills the colour mounted into the fathers face his blue eyes stared the girl stood near the door her head held slightly back like an indication that the youth must come he rose in his silent intent way and was gone with her the blood swelled in brangwens forehead veins  it was raining the light of the lantern flashed on the cobbled path and the bottom of the wall she came to a small ladder and climbed up he reached her the lantern and followed up there in the fowlloft the birds sat in fat bunches on the perches the red combs shining like fire bright sharp eyes opened there was a sharp crawk of expostulation as one of the hens shifted over the cock sat watching his yellow neckfeathers bright as glass anna went across the dirty floor brangwen crouched in the loft watching the light was soft under the red naked tiles the girl crouched in a corner there was another explosive bustle of a hen springing from her perch  anna came back stooping under the perches he was waiting for her near the door suddenly she had her arms round him was clinging close to him cleaving her body against his and crying in a whispering whimpering sound  will i love you i love you will i love you it sounded as if it were tearing her  he was not even very much surprised he held her in his arms and his bones melted he leaned back against the wall the door of the loft was open outside the rain slanted by in fine steely mysterious haste emerging out of the gulf of darkness he held her in his arms and he and she together seemed to be swinging in big swooping oscillations the two of them clasped together up in the darkness outside the open door of the loft in which they stood beyond them and below them was darkness with a travelling veil of rain  i love you will i love you she moaned i love you will  he held her as thought they were one and was silent  in the house tom brangwen waited a while then he got up and went out he went down the yard he saw the curious misty shaft coming from the loft door he scarcely knew it was the light in the rain he went on till the illumination fell on him dimly then looking up through the blurr he saw the youth and the girl together the youth with his back against the wall his head sunk over the head of the girl the elder man saw them blurred through the rain but lit up they thought themselves so buried in the night he even saw the lighted dryness of the loft behind and shadows and bunches of roosting fowls up in the night strange shadows cast from the lantern on the floor  and a black gloom of anger and a tenderness of selfeffacement fought in his heart she did not understand what she was doing she betrayed herself she was a child a mere child she did not know how much of herself she was squandering and he was blackly and furiously miserable was he then an old man that he should be giving her away in marriage was he old he was not old he was younger than that young thoughtless fellow in whose arms she lay who knew herhe or that blindheaded youth to whom did she belong if not to himself  he thought again of the child he had carried out at night into the barn whilst his wife was in labour with the young tom he remembered the soft warm weight of the little girl on his arm round his neck now she would say he was finished she was going away to deny him to leave an unendurable emptiness in him a void that he could not bear almost he hated her how dared she say he was old he walked on in the rain sweating with pain with the horror of being old with the agony of having to relinquish what was life to him  will brangwen went home without having seen his uncle he held his hot face to the rain and walked on in a trance i love you will i love you the words repeated themselves endlessly the veils had ripped and issued him naked into the endless space and he shuddered the walls had thrust him out and given him a vast space to walk in whither through this darkness of infinite space was he walking blindly where at the end of all the darkness was god the almighty still darkly seated thrusting him on i love you will i love you he trembled with fear as the words beat in his heart again and he dared not think of her face of her eyes which shone and of her strange transfigured face the hand of the hidden almighty burning bright had thrust out of the darkness and gripped him he went on subject and in fear his heart gripped and burning from the touch  the days went by they ran on darkpadded feet in silence he went to see anna but again there had come a reserve between them tom brangwen was gloomy his blue eyes sombre anna was strange and delivered up her face in its delicate colouring was mute touched dumb and poignant the mother bowed her head and moved in her own dark world that was pregnant again with fulfilment  will brangwen worked at his woodcarving it was a passion a passion for him to have the chisel under his grip verily the passion of his heart lifted the fine bite of steel he was carving as he had always wanted the creation of eve it was a panel in low relief for a church adam lay asleep as if suffering and god a dim large figure stooped towards him stretching forward his unveiled hand and eve a small vivid naked female shape was issuing like a flame towards the hand of god from the torn side of adam  now will brangwen was working at the eve she was thin a keen unripe thing with trembling passion fine as a breath of air he sent the chisel over her belly her hard unripe small belly she was a stiff little figure with sharp lines in the throes and torture and ecstasy of her creation but he trembled as he touched her he had not finished any of his figures there was a bird on a bough overhead lifting its wings for flight and a serpent wreathing up to it it was not finished yet he trembled with passion at last able to create the new sharp body of his eve  at the sides at the far sides at either end were two angels covering their faces with their wings they were like trees as he went to the marsh in the twilight he felt that the angels with covered faces were standing back as he went by the darkness was of their shadows and the covering of their faces when he went through the canal bridge the evening glowed in its last deep colours the sky was dark blue the stars glittered from afar very remote and approaching above the darkening cluster of the farm above the paths of crystal along the edge of the heavens  she waited for him like the glow of light and as if his face were covered and he dared not lift his face to look at her  corn harvest came on one evening they walked out through the farm buildings at nightfall a large gold moon hung heavily to the grey horizon trees hovered tall standing back in the dusk waiting anna and the young man went on noiselessly by the hedge along where the farmcarts had made dark ruts in the grass they came through a gate into a wide open field where still much light seemed to spread against their faces in the undershadow the sheaves lay on the ground where the reapers had left them many sheaves like bodies prostrate in shadowy bulk others were riding hazily in shocks like ships in the haze of moonlight and of dusk farther off  they did not want to turn back yet whither were they to go towards the moon for they were separate single  we will put up some sheaves said anna so they could remain there in the broad open place  they went across the stubble to where the long rows of upreared shocks ended curiously populous that part of the field looked where the shocks rode erect the rest was open and prostrate  the air was all hoary silver she looked around her trees stood vaguely at their distance as if waiting like heralds for the signal to approach in this space of vague crystal her heart seemed like a bell ringing she was afraid lest the sound should be heard  you take this row she said to the youth and passing on she stooped in the next row of lying sheaves grasping her hands in the tresses of the oats lifting the heavy corn in either hand carrying it as it hung heavily against her to the cleared space where she set the two sheaves sharply down bringing them together with a faint keen clash her two bulks stood leaning together he was coming walking shadowily with the gossamer dusk carrying his two sheaves she waited nearby he set his sheaves with a keen faint clash next to her sheaves they rode unsteadily he tangled the tresses of corn it hissed like a fountain he looked up and laughed  then she turned away towards the moon which seemed glowingly to uncover her bosom every time she faced it he went to the vague emptiness of the field opposite dutifully  they stooped grasped the wet soft hair of the corn lifted the heavy bundles and returned she was always first she set down her sheaves making a penthouse with those others he was coming shadowy across the stubble carrying his bundles she turned away hearing only the sharp hiss of his mingling corn she walked between the moon and his shadowy figure  she took her two new sheaves and walked towards him as he rose from stooping over the earth he was coming out of the near distance she set down her sheaves to make a new stook they were unsure her hands fluttered yet she broke away and turned to the moon which laid bare her bosom so she felt as if her bosom were heaving and panting with moonlight and he had to put up her two sheaves which had fallen down he worked in silence the rhythm of the work carried him away again as she was coming near  they worked together coming and going in a rhythm which carried their feet and their bodies in tune she stooped she lifted the burden of sheaves she turned her face to the dimness where he was and went with her burden over the stubble she hesitated set down her sheaves there was a swish and hiss of mingling oats he was drawing near and she must turn again and there was the flaring moon laying bare her bosom again making her drift and ebb like a wave  he worked steadily engrossed threading backwards and forwards like a shuttle across the strip of cleared stubble weaving the long line of riding shocks nearer and nearer to the shadowy trees threading his sheaves with hers  and always she was gone before he came as he came she drew away as he drew away she came were they never to meet gradually a low deepsounding will in him vibrated to her tried to set her in accord tried to bring her gradually to him to a meeting till they should be together till they should meet as the sheaves that swished together  and the work went on the moon grew brighter clearer the corn glistened he bent over the prostrate bundles there was a hiss as the sheaves left the ground a trailing of heavy bodies against him a dazzle of moonlight on his eyes and then he was setting the corn together at the stook and she was coming near  he waited for her he fumbled at the stook she came but she stood back till he drew away he saw her in shadow a dark column and spoke to her and she answered she saw the moonlight flash question on his face but there was a space between them and he went away the work carried them rhythmic  why was there always a space between them why were they apart why as she came up from under the moon would she halt and stand off from him why was he held away from her his will drummed persistently darkly it drowned everything else  into the rhythm of his work there came a pulse and a steadied purpose he stooped he lifted the weight he heaved it towards her setting it as in her under the moonlit space and he went back for more ever with increasing closeness he lifted the sheaves and swung striding to the centre with them ever he drove her more nearly to the meeting ever he did his share and drew towards her overtaking her there was only the moving to and fro in the moonlight engrossed the swinging in the silence that was marked only by the splash of sheaves and silence and a splash of sheaves and ever the splash of his sheaves broke swifter beating up to hers and ever the splash of her sheaves recurred monotonously unchanging and ever the splash of his sheaves beat nearer  till at last they met at the shock facing each other sheaves in hand and he was silvery with moonlight with a moonlit shadowy face that frightened her she waited for him  put yours down she said  no its your turn his voice was twanging and insistent  she set her sheaves against the shock he saw her hands glisten among the spray of grain and he dropped his sheaves and he trembled as he took her in his arms he had overtaken her and it was his privilege to kiss her she was sweet and fresh with the night air and sweet with the scent of grain and the whole rhythm of him beat into his kisses and still he pursued her in his kisses and still she was not quite overcome he wondered over the moonlight on her nose all the moonlight upon her all the darkness within her all the night in his arms darkness and shine he possessed of it all all the night for him now to unfold to venture within all the mystery to be entered all the discovery to be made  trembling with keen triumph his heart was white as a star as he drove his kisses nearer  my love she called in a low voice from afar the low sound seemed to call to him from far off under the moon to him who was unaware he stopped quivered and listened  my love came again the low plaintive call like a bird unseen in the night  he was afraid his heart quivered and broke he was stopped  anna he said as if he answered her from a distance unsure  my love  and he drew near and she drew near  anna he said in wonder and the birthpain of love  my love she said her voice growing rapturous and they kissed on the mouth in rapture and surprise long real kisses the kiss lasted there among the moonlight he kissed her again and she kissed him and again they were kissing together till something happened in him he was strange he wanted her he wanted her exceedingly she was something new they stood there folded suspended in the night and his whole being quivered with surprise as from a blow he wanted her and he wanted to tell her so but the shock was too great to him he had never realized before he trembled with irritation and unusedness he did not know what to do he held her more gently gently much more gently the conflict was gone by and he was glad and breathless and almost in tears but he knew he wanted her something fixed in him for ever he was hers and he was very glad and afraid he did not know what to do as they stood there in the open moonlit field he looked through her hair at the moon which seemed to swim liquidbright  she sighed and seemed to wake up then she kissed him again then she loosened herself away from him and took his hand it hurt him when she drew away from his breast it hurt him with a chagrin why did she draw away from him but she held his hand  i want to go home she said looking at him in a way he could not understand  he held close to her hand he was dazed and he could not move he did not know how to move she drew him away  he walked helplessly beside her holding her hand she went with bent head suddenly he said as the simple solution stated itself to him  well get married anna  she was silent  well get married anna shall we  she stopped in the field again and kissed him clinging to him passionately in a way he could not understand he could not understand but he left it all now to marriage that was the solution now fixed ahead he wanted her he wanted to be married to her he wanted to have her altogether as his own for ever and he waited intent for the accomplishment but there was all the while a slight tension of irritation  he spoke to his uncle and aunt that night  uncle he said anna and me think of getting married  oh ay said brangwen  but how you have no money said the mother  the youth went pale he hated these words but he was like a gleaming bright pebble something bright and inalterable he did not think he sat there in his hard brightness and did not speak  have you mentioned it to your own mother asked brangwen  noill tell her on saturday  youll go and see her  yes  there was a long pause  and what are you going to marry onyour pound a week  again the youth went pale as if the spirit were being injured in him  i dont know he said looking at his uncle with his bright inhuman eyes like a hawks  brangwen stirred in hatred  it needs knowing he said  i shall have the money later on said the nephew i will raise some now and pay it back then  oh ayand why this desperate hurry shes a child of eighteen and youre a boy of twenty youre neither of you of age to do as you like yet  will brangwen ducked his head and looked at his uncle with swift mistrustful eyes like a caged hawk  what does it matter how old she is and how old i am he said whats the difference between me now and when im thirty  a big difference let us hope  but you have no experienceyou have no experience and no money why do you want to marry without experience or money asked the aunt  what experience do i want aunt asked the boy  and if brangwens heart had not been hard and intact with anger like a precious stone he would have agreed  will brangwen went home strange and untouched he felt he could not alter from what he was fixed upon his will was set to alter it he must be destroyed and he would not be destroyed he had no money but he would get some from somewhere it did not matter he lay awake for many hours hard and clear and unthinking his soul crystallizing more inalterably then he went fast asleep  it was as if his soul had turned into a hard crystal he might tremble and quiver and suffer it did not alter  the next morning tom brangwen inhuman with anger spoke to anna  whats this about wanting to get married he said  she stood paling a little her dark eyes springing to the hostile startled look of a savage thing that will defend itself but trembles with sensitiveness  i do she said out of her unconsciousness  his anger rose and he would have liked to break her  you doyou doand what for he sneered with contempt the old childish agony the blindness that could recognize nobody the palpitating antagonism as of a raw helpless undefended thing came back on her  i do because i do she cried in the shrill hysterical way of her childhood you are not my fathermy father is deadyou are not my father  she was still a stranger she did not recognize him the cold blade cut down deep into brangwens soul it cut him off from her  and what if im not he said  but he could not bear it it had been so passionately dear to him her fatherdaddie  he went about for some days as if stunned his wife was bemused she did not understand she only thought the marriage was impeded for want of money and position  there was a horrible silence in the house anna kept out of sight as much as possible she could be for hours alone  will brangwen came back after stupid scenes at nottingham he too was pale and blank but unchanging his uncle hated him he hated this youth who was so inhuman and obstinate nevertheless it was to will brangwen that the uncle one evening handed over the shares which he had transferred to anna lensky they were for two thousand five hundred pounds will brangwen looked at his uncle it was a great deal of the marsh capital here given away the youth however was only colder and more fixed he was abstract purely a fixed will he gave the shares to anna  after which she cried for a whole day sobbing her eyes out and at night when she had heard her mother go to bed she slipped down and hung in the doorway her father sat in his heavy silence like a monument he turned his head slowly  daddy she cried from the doorway and she ran to him sobbing as if her heart would break daddydaddydaddy  she crouched on the hearthrug with her arms round him and her face against him his body was so big and comfortable but something hurt her head intolerably she sobbed almost with hysteria  he was silent with his hand on her shoulder his heart was bleak he was not her father that beloved image she had broken who was he then a man put apart with those whose life has no more developments he was isolated from her there was a generation between them he was old he had died out from hot life a great deal of ash was in his fire cold ash he felt the inevitable coldness and in bitterness forgot the fire he sat in his coldness of age and isolation he had his own wife and he blamed himself he sneered at himself for this clinging to the young wanting the young to belong to him  the child who clung to him wanted her childhusband as was natural and from him brangwen she wanted help so that her life might be properly fitted out but love she did not want why should there be love between them between the stout middleaged man and this child how could there be anything between them but mere human willingness to help each other he was her guardian no more his heart was like ice his face cold and expressionless she could not move him any more than a statue  she crept to bed and cried but she was going to be married to will brangwen and then she need not bother any more brangwen went to bed with a hard cold heart and cursed himself he looked at his wife she was still his wife her dark hair was threaded with grey her face was beautiful in its gathering age she was just fifty how poignantly he saw her and he wanted to cut out some of his own heart which was incontinent and demanded still to share the rapid life of youth how he hated himself  his wife was so poignant and timely she was still young and naive with some girls freshness but she did not want any more the fight the battle the control as he in his incontinence still did she was so natural and he was ugly unnatural in his inability to yield place how hideous this greedy middleage which must stand in the way of life like a large demon  what was missing in his life that in his ravening soul he was not satisfied he had had that friend at school his mother his wife and anna what had he done he had failed with his friend he had been a poor son but he had known satisfaction with his wife let it be enough he loathed himself for the state he was in over anna yet he was not satisfied it was agony to know it  was his life nothing had he nothing to show no work he did not count his work anybody could have done it what had he known but the long marital embrace with his wife curious that this was what his life amounted to at any rate it was something it was eternal he would say so to anybody and be proud of it he lay with his wife in his arms and she was still his fulfilment just the same as ever and that was the beall and the endall yes and he was proud of it  but the bitterness underneath that there still remained an unsatisfied tom brangwen who suffered agony because a girl cared nothing for him he loved his sonshe had them also but it was the further the creative life with the girl he wanted as well oh and he was ashamed he trampled himself to extinguish himself  what weariness there was no peace however old one grew one was never right never decent never master of oneself it was as if his hope had been in the girl  anna quickly lapsed again into her love for the youth will brangwen had fixed his marriage for the saturday before christmas and he waited for her in his bright unquestioning fashion until then he wanted her she was his he suspended his being till the day should come the wedding day december the twentythird had come into being for him as an absolute thing he lived in it  he did not count the days but like a man who journeys in a ship he was suspended till the coming to port  he worked at his carving he worked in his office he came to see her all was but a form of waiting without thought or question  she was much more alive she wanted to enjoy courtship he seemed to come and go like the wind without asking why or whither but she wanted to enjoy his presence for her he was the kernel of life to touch him alone was bliss but for him she was the essence of life she existed as much when he was at his carving in his lodging in ilkeston as when she sat looking at him in the marsh kitchen in himself he knew her but his outward faculties seemed suspended he did not see her with his eyes nor hear her with his voice  and yet he trembled sometimes into a kind of swoon holding her in his arms they would stand sometimes folded together in the barn in silence then to her as she felt his young tense figure with her hands the bliss was intolerable intolerable the sense that she possessed him for his body was so keen and wonderful it was the only reality in her world in her world there was this one tense vivid body of a man and then many other shadowy men all unreal in him she touched the centre of reality and they were together he and she at the heart of the secret how she clutched him to her his body the central body of all life out of the rock of his form the very fountain of life flowed  but to him she was a flame that consumed him the flame flowed up his limbs flowed through him till he was consumed till he existed only as an unconscious dark transit of flame deriving from her  sometimes in the darkness a cow coughed there was in the darkness a slow sound of cud chewing and it all seemed to flow round them and upon them as the hot blood flows through the womb laving the unborn young  sometimes when it was cold they stood to be lovers in the stables where the air was warm and sharp with ammonia and during these dark vigils he learned to know her her body against his they drew nearer and nearer together the kisses came more subtly close and fitting so when in the thick darkness a horse suddenly scrambled to its feet with a dull thunderous sound they listened as one person listening they knew as one person they were conscious of the horse  tom brangwen had taken them a cottage at cossethay on a twentyone years lease will brangwens eyes lit up as he saw it it was the cottage next the church with dark yewtrees very black old trees along the side of the house and the grassy front garden a red squarish cottage with a low slate roof and low windows it had a long dairyscullery a big flagged kitchen and a low parlour that went up one step from the kitchen there were whitewashed beams across the ceilings and odd corners with cupboards looking out through the windows there was the grassy garden the procession of black yew trees down one side and along the other sides a red wall with ivy separating the place from the highroad and the churchyard the old little church with its small spire on a square tower seemed to be looking back at the cottage windows  therell be no need to have a clock said will brangwen peeping out at the white clockface on the tower his neighbour  at the back of the house was a garden adjoining the paddock a cowshed with standing for two cows pigcotes and fowlhouses will brangwen was very happy anna was glad to think of being mistress of her own place  tom brangwen was now the fairy godfather he was never happy unless he was buying something will brangwen with his interest in all woodwork was getting the furniture he was left to buy tables and roundstaved chairs and the dressers quite ordinary stuff but such as was identified with his cottage  tom brangwen with more particular thought spied out what he called handy little things for her he appeared with a set of newfangled cookingpans with a special sort of hanging lamp though the rooms were so low with canny little machines for grinding meat or mashing potatoes or whisking eggs  anna took a sharp interest in what he bought though she was not always pleased some of the little contrivances which he thought so canny left her doubtful nevertheless she was always expectant on market days there was always a long thrill of anticipation he arrived with the first darkness the copper lamps of his cart glowing and she ran to the gate as he a dark burly figure up in the cart was bending over his parcels  its cupboard love as brings you out so sharp he said his voice resounding in the cold darkness nevertheless he was excited and she taking one of the cart lamps poked and peered among the jumble of things he had brought pushing aside the oil or implements he had got for himself  she dragged out a pair of small strong bellows registered them in her mind and then pulled uncertainly at something else it had a long handle and a piece of brown paper round the middle of it like a waistcoat  whats this she said poking  he stopped to look at her she went to the lamplight by the horse and stood there bent over the new thing while her hair was like bronze her apron white and cheerful her fingers plucked busily at the paper she dragged forth a little wringer with clean indiarubber rollers she examined it critically not knowing quite how it worked  she looked up at him he stood a shadowy presence beyond the light  how does it go she asked  why its for pulpin turnips he replied  she looked at him his voice disturbed her  dont be silly its a little mangle she said how do you stand it though  you screw it on th side o your washtub he came and held it out to her  oh yes she cried with one of her little skipping movements which still came when she was suddenly glad  and without another thought she ran off into the house leaving him to untackle the horse and when he came into the scullery he found her there with the little wringer fixed on the dollytub turning blissfully at the handle and tilly beside her exclaiming  my word thats a natty little thing thatll save you luggin your inside out thats the latest contraption that is  and anna turned away at the handle with great gusto of possession then she let tilly have a turn  it fair runs by itself said tilly turning on and on your clothesll nip out on to th line    chapter v  wedding at the marsh  it was a beautiful sunny day for the wedding a muddy earth but a bright sky they had three cabs and two big closedin vehicles everybody crowded in the parlour in excitement anna was still upstairs her father kept taking a nip of brandy he was handsome in his black coat and grey trousers his voice was hearty but troubled his wife came down in dark grey silk with lace and a touch of peacockblue in her bonnet her little body was very sure and definite brangwen was thankful she was there to sustain him among all these people  the carriages the nottingham mrs brangwen in silk brocade stands in the doorway saying who must go with whom there is a great bustle the front door is opened and the wedding guests are walking down the garden path whilst those still waiting peer through the window and the little crowd at the gate gorps and stretches how funny such dressedup people look in the winter sunshine  they are goneanother lot there begins to be more room anna comes down blushing and very shy to be viewed in her white silk and her veil her motherinlaw surveys her objectively twitches the white train arranges the folds of the veil and asserts herself  loud exclamations from the window that the bridegrooms carriage has just passed  wheres your hat father and your gloves cries the bride stamping her white slipper her eyes flashing through her veil he hunts roundhis hair is ruffled everybody has gone but the bride and her father he is readyhis face very red and daunted tilly dithers in the little porch waiting to open the door a waiting woman walks round anna who asks  am i all right  she is ready she bridles herself and looks queenly she waves her hand sharply to her father  come here  he goes she puts her hand very lightly on his arm and holding her bouquet like a shower stepping oh very graciously just a little impatient with her father for being so red in the face she sweeps slowly past the fluttering tilly and down the path there are hoarse shouts at the gate and all her floating foamy whiteness passes slowly into the cab  her father notices her slim ankle and foot as she steps up a childs foot his heart is hard with tenderness but she is in ecstasies with herself for making such a lovely spectacle all the way she sat flamboyant with bliss because it was all so lovely she looked down solicitously at her bouquet white roses and liliesofthevalley and tuberoses and maidenhair fernvery rich and cascadelike  her father sat bewildered with all this strangeness his heart was so full it felt hard and he couldnt think of anything  the church was decorated for christmas dark with evergreens cold and snowy with white flowers he went vaguely down to the altar how long was it since he had gone to be married himself he was not sure whether he was going to be married now or what he had come for he had a troubled notion that he had to do something or other he saw his wifes bonnet and wondered why she wasnt there with him  they stood before the altar he was staring up at the east window that glowed intensely a sort of blue purple it was deep blue glowing and some crimson and little yellow flowers held fast in veins of shadow in a heavy web of darkness how it burned alive in radiance among its black web  who giveth this woman to be married to this man he felt somebody touch him he started the words still reechoed in his memory but were drawing off  me he said hastily  ann bent her head and smiled in her veil how absurd he was  brangwen was staring away at the burning blue window at the back of the altar and wondering vaguely with pain if he ever should get old if he ever should feel arrived and established he was here at annas wedding well what right had he to feel responsible like a father he was still as unsure and unfixed as when he had married himself his wife and he with a pang of anguish he realized what uncertainties they both were he was a man of fortyfive fortyfive in five more years fifty then sixtythen seventythen it was finished my godand one still was so unestablished  how did one grow oldhow could one become confident he wished he felt older why what difference was there as far as he felt matured or completed between him now and him at his own wedding he might be getting married over againhe and his wife he felt himself tiny a little upright figure on a plain circled round with the immense roaring sky he and his wife two little upright figures walking across this plain whilst the heavens shimmered and roared about them when did one come to an end in which direction was it finished there was no end no finish only this roaring vast space did one never get old never die that was the clue he exulted strangely with torture he would go on with his wife he and she like two children camping in the plains what was sure but the endless sky but that was so sure so boundless  still the royal blue colour burned and blazed and sported itself in the web of darkness before him unwearyingly rich and splendid how rich and splendid his own life was red and burning and blazing and sporting itself in the dark meshes of his body and his wife how she glowed and burned dark within her meshes always it was so unfinished and unformed  there was a loud noise of the organ the whole party was trooping to the vestry there was a blotted scrawled bookand that young girl putting back her veil in her vanity and laying her hand with the weddingring selfconsciously conspicuous and signing her name proudly because of the vain spectacle she made  anna theresa lensky  anna theresa lenskywhat a vain independent minx she was the bridegroom slender in his black swallowtail and grey trousers solemn as a young solemn cat was writing seriously  william brangwen  that looked more like it  come and sign father cried the imperious young hussy  thomas brangwenclumsyfist he said to himself as he signed  then his brother a big sallow fellow with black sidewhiskers wrote  alfred brangwen  how many more brangwens said tom brangwen ashamed of the toofrequent recurrence of his family name  when they were out again in the sunshine and he saw the frost hoary and blue among the long grass under the tombstones the hollyberries overhead twinkling scarlet as the bells rang the yew trees hanging their black motionless ragged boughs everything seemed like a vision  the marriage party went across the graveyard to the wall mounted it by the little steps and descended oh a vain white peacock of a bride perching herself on the top of the wall and giving her hand to the bridegroom on the other side to be helped down the vanity of her white slim daintilystepping feet and her arched neck and the regal impudence with which she seemed to dismiss them all the others parents and wedding guests as she went with her young husband  in the cottage big fires were burning there were dozens of glasses on the table and holly and mistletoe hanging up the wedding party crowded in and tom brangwen becoming roisterous poured out drinks everybody must drink the bells were ringing away against the windows  lift your glasses up shouted tom brangwen from the parlour lift your glasses up an drink to the hearth an homehearth an home an may they enjoy it  night an day an may they enjoy it shouted frank brangwen in addition  hammer an tongs and may they enjoy it shouted alfred brangwen the saturnine  fill your glasses up an lets have it all over again shouted tom brangwen  hearth an home an may ye enjoy it  there was a ragged shout of the company in response  bed an blessin an may ye enjoy it shouted frank brangwen  there was a swelling chorus in answer  comin and goin an may ye enjoy it shouted the saturnine alfred brangwen and the men roared by now boldly and the women said just hark now  there was a touch of scandal in the air  then the party rolled off in the carriages full speed back to the marsh to a large meal of the hightea order which lasted for an hour and a half the bride and bridegroom sat at the head of the table very prim and shining both of them wordless whilst the company raged down the table  the brangwen men had brandy in their tea and were becoming unmanageable the saturnine alfred had glittering unseeing eyes and a strange fierce way of laughing that showed his teeth his wife glowered at him and jerked her head at him like a snake he was oblivious frank brangwen the butcher flushed and florid and handsome roared echoes to his two brothers tom brangwen in his solid fashion was letting himself go at last  these three brothers dominated the whole company tom brangwen wanted to make a speech for the first time in his life he must spread himself wordily  marriage he began his eyes twinkling and yet quite profound for he was deeply serious and hugely amused at the same time marriage he said speaking in the slow fullmouthed way of the brangwens is what were made for  let him talk said alfred brangwen slowly and inscrutably let him talk mrs alfred darted indignant eyes at her husband  a man continued tom brangwen enjoys being a man for what purpose was he made a man if not to enjoy it  that a true word said frank floridly  and likewise continued tom brangwen a woman enjoys being a woman at least we surmise she does  oh dont you bother called a farmers wife  you may back your life theyd be summisin said franks wife  now continued tom brangwen for a man to be a man it takes a woman  it does that said a woman grimly  and for a woman to be a woman it takes a man continued tom brangwen  all speak up men chimed in a feminine voice  therefore we have marriage continued tom brangwen  hold hold said alfred brangwen dont run us off our legs  and in dead silence the glasses were filled the bride and bridegroom two children sat with intent shining faces at the head of the table abstracted  theres no marriage in heaven went on tom brangwen but on earth there is marriage  thats the difference between em said alfred brangwen mocking  alfred said tom brangwen keep your remarks till afterwards and then well thank you for themtheres very little else on earth but marriage you can talk about making money or saving souls you can save your own soul seven times over and you may have a mint of money but your soul goes gnawin gnawin gnawin and it says theres something it must have in heaven there is no marriage but on earth there is marriage else heaven drops out and theres no bottom to it  just hark you now said franks wife  go on thomas said alfred sardonically  if weve got to be angels went on tom brangwen haranguing the company at large and if there is no such thing as a man nor a woman amongst them then it seems to me as a married couple makes one angel  its the brandy said alfred brangwen wearily  for said tom brangwen and the company was listening to the conundrum an angel cant be less than a human being and if it was only the soul of a man minus the man then it would be less than a human being  decidedly said alfred  and a laugh went round the table but tom brangwen was inspired  an angels got to be more than a human being he continued so i say an angel is the soul of man and woman in one they rise united at the judgment day as one angel  praising the lord said frank  praising the lord repeated tom  and what about the women left over asked alfred jeering the company was getting uneasy  that i cant tell how do i know as there is anybody left over at the judgment day let that be what i say is that when a mans soul and a womans soul unites togetherthat makes an angel  i dunno about souls i know as one plus one makes three sometimes said frank but he had the laugh to himself  bodies and souls its the same said tom  and what about your missis who was married afore you knew her asked alfred set on edge by this discourse  that i cant tell you if i am to become an angel itll be my married soul and not my single soul itll not be the soul of me when i was a lad for i hadnt a soul as would make an angel then  i can always remember said franks wife when our harold was bad he did nothink but see an angel at th back o th lookinglass look mother e said at that angel theer isnt no angel my duck i said but he wouldnt have it i took th lookinglass offn th dressintable but it made no difference he kep on sayin it was there my word it did give me a turn i thought for sure as id lost him  i can remember said another man toms sisters husband my mother gave me a good hidin once for sayin id got an angel up my nose she seed me pokin an she said what are you pokin at your nose forgive over theres an angel up it i said an she fetched me such a wipe but there was we used to call them thistle things angels as wafts about an id pushed one o these up my nose for some reason or other  its wonderful what children will get up their noses said franks wife i cn remember our hemmie she shoved one o them bluebell things out o th middle of a bluebell what they call candles up her nose and oh we had some work id seen her stickin em on the end of her nose like but i never thought shed be so soft as to shove it right up she was a gel of eight or more oh my word we got a crochethook an i dont know what   tom brangwens mood of inspiration began to pass away he forgot all about it and was soon roaring and shouting with the rest outside the wake came singing the carols they were invited into the bursting house they had two fiddles and a piccolo there in the parlour they played carols and the whole company sang them at the top of its voice only the bride and bridegroom sat with shining eyes and strange bright faces and scarcely sang or only with just moving lips  the wake departed and the guysers came there was loud applause and shouting and excitement as the old mystery play of st george in which every man present had acted as a boy proceeded with banging and thumping of club and dripping pan  by jove i got a crack once when i was playin beelzebub said tom brangwen his eyes full of water with laughing it knocked all th sense out of me as youd crack an egg but i tell you when i come to i played old johnny roger with st george i did that  he was shaking with laughter another knock came at the door there was a hush  its th cab said somebody from the door  walk in shouted tom brangwen and a redfaced grinning man entered  now you two get yourselves ready an off to blanket fair shouted tom brangwen strike a daisy but if youre not off like a blink o lightnin you shanna go you sll sleep separate  anna rose silently and went to change her dress will brangwen would have gone out but tilly came with his hat and coat the youth was helped on  well heres luck my boy shouted his father  when th fats in th fire let it frizzle admonished his uncle frank  fair and softly does it fair an softly does it cried his aunt franks wife contrary  you dont want to fall over yourself said his uncle by marriage youre not a bull at a gate  let a man have his own road said tom brangwen testily dont be so free of your adviceits his wedding this time not yours  e dont

man nor a crippleand hes neither thank god  dont you be so sure o your walkin powers cried franks wife theres many a man gets no further than halfway nor cant to save his life let him live for ever  why how do you know said alfred  its plain enough in th looks o some retorted lizzie his sisterinlaw  the youth stood with a faint halfhearing smile on his face he was tense and abstracted these things or anything scarcely touched him  anna came down in her day dress very elusive she kissed everybody men and women will brangwen shook hands with everybody kissed his mother who began to cry and the whole party went surging out to the cab  the young couple were shut up last injunctions shouted at them  drive on shouted tom brangwen  the cab rolled off they saw the light diminish under the ash trees then the whole party quietened went indoors  theyll have three good fires burning said tom brangwen looking at his watch i told emma to make em up at nine an then leave the door on th latch its only halfpast theyll have three fires burning an lamps lighted an emma will ha warmed th bed wi th warmin pan so i sd think theyll be all right  the party was much quieter they talked of the young couple  she said she didnt want a servant in said tom brangwen the house isnt big enough shed always have the creature under her nose emmall do what is wanted of her an theyll be to themselves  its best said lizzie youre more free  the party talked on slowly brangwen looked at his watch  lets go an give em a carol he said we sll find th fiddles at the cock an robin  ay come on said frank  alfred rose in silence the brotherinlaw and one of wills brothers rose also  the five men went out the night was flashing with stars sirius blazed like a signal at the side of the hill orion stately and magnificent was sloping along  tom walked with his brother alfred the mens heels rang on the ground  its a fine night said tom  ay said alfred  nice to get out  ay  the brothers walked close together the bond of blood strong between them tom always felt very much the junior to alfred  its a long while since you left home he said  ay said alfred i thought i was getting a bit oldishbut im not its the things youve got as gets worn out its not you yourself  why whats worn out  most folks as ive anything to do withas has anything to do with me they all break down youve got to go on by yourself if its only to perdition theres nobody going alongside even there  tom brangwen meditated this  maybe you was never broken in he said  no i never was said alfred proudly  and tom felt his elder brother despised him a little he winced under it  everybodys got a way of their own he said stubbornly its only a dog as hasnt an them as cant take what they give an give what they take they must go by themselves or get a dog asll follow em  they can do without the dog said his brother and again tom brangwen was humble thinking his brother was bigger than himself but if he was he was and if it were finer to go alone it was he did not want to go for all that  they went over the field where a thin keen wind blew round the ball of the hill in the starlight they came to the stile and to the side of annas house the lights were out only on the blinds of the rooms downstairs and of a bedroom upstairs firelight flickered  wed better leave em alone said alfred brangwen  nay nay said tom well carol em for th last time  and in a quarter of an hours time eleven silent rather tipsy men scrambled over the wall and into the garden by the yew trees outside the windows where faint firelight glowered on the blinds there came a shrill sound two violins and a piccolo shrilling on the frosty air  in the fields with their flocks abiding a commotion of mens voices broke out singing in ragged unison  anna brangwen had started up listening when the music began she was afraid  its the wake he whispered  she remained tense her heart beating heavily possessed with strange strong fear then there came the burst of mens singing rather uneven she strained still listening  its dad she said in a low voice they were silent listening  and my father he said  she listened still but she was sure she sank down again into bed into his arms he held her very close kissing her the hymn rambled on outside all the men singing their best having forgotten everything else under the spell of the fiddles and the tune the firelight glowed against the darkness in the room anna could hear her father singing with gusto  arent they silly she whispered  and they crept closer closer together hearts beating to one another and even as the hymn rolled on they ceased to hear it    chapter vi  anna victrix  will brangwen had some weeks of holiday after his marriage so the two took their honeymoon in full hands alone in their cottage together  and to him as the days went by it was as if the heavens had fallen and he were sitting with her among the ruins in a new world everybody else buried themselves two blissful survivors with everything to squander as they would at first he could not get rid of a culpable sense of licence on his part wasnt there some duty outside calling him and he did not come  it was all very well at night when the doors were locked and the darkness drawn round the two of them then they were the only inhabitants of the visible earth the rest were under the flood and being alone in the world they were a law unto themselves they could enjoy and squander and waste like conscienceless gods  but in the morning as the carts clanked by and children shouted down the lane as the hucksters came calling their wares and the church clock struck eleven and he and she had not got up yet even to breakfast he could not help feeling guilty as if he were committing a breach of the lawashamed that he was not up and doing  doing what she asked what is there to do you will only lounge about  still even lounging about was respectable one was at least in connection with the world then whereas now lying so still and peacefully while the daylight came obscurely through the drawn blind one was severed from the world one shut oneself off in tacit denial of the world and he was troubled  but it was so sweet and satisfying lying there talking desultorily with her it was sweeter than sunshine and not so evanescent it was even irritating the way the churchclock kept on chiming there seemed no space between the hours just a moment golden and still whilst she traced his features with her fingertips utterly careless and happy and he loved her to do it  but he was strange and unused so suddenly everything that had been before was shed away and gone one day he was a bachelor living with the world the next day he was with her as remote from the world as if the two of them were buried like a seed in darkness suddenly like a chestnut falling out of a burr he was shed naked and glistening on to a soft fecund earth leaving behind him the hard rind of worldly knowledge and experience he heard it in the hucksters cries the noise of carts the calling of children and it was all like the hard shed rind discarded inside in the softness and stillness of the room was the naked kernel that palpitated in silent activity absorbed in reality  inside the room was a great steadiness a core of living eternity only far outside at the rim went on the noise and the destruction here at the centre the great wheel was motionless centred upon itself here was a poised unflawed stillness that was beyond time because it remained the same inexhaustible unchanging unexhausted  as they lay close together complete and beyond the touch of time or change it was as if they were at the very centre of all the slow wheeling of space and the rapid agitation of life deep deep inside them all at the centre where there is utter radiance and eternal being and the silence absorbed in praise the steady core of all movements the unawakened sleep of all wakefulness they found themselves there and they lay still in each others arms for their moment they were at the heart of eternity whilst time roared far off for ever far off towards the rim  then gradually they were passed away from the supreme centre down the circles of praise and joy and gladness further and further out towards the noise and the friction but their hearts had burned and were tempered by the inner reality they were unalterably glad  gradually they began to wake up the noises outside became more real they understood and answered the call outside they counted the strokes of the bell and when they counted midday they understood that it was midday in the world and for themselves also  it dawned upon her that she was hungry she had been getting hungrier for a lifetime but even yet it was not sufficiently real to rouse her a long way off she could hear the words i am dying of hunger yet she lay still separate at peace and the words were unuttered there was still another lapse  and then quite calmly even a little surprised she was in the present and was saying  i am dying with hunger  so am i he said calmly as if it were of not the slightest significance and they relapsed into the warm golden stillness and the minutes flowed unheeded past the window outside  then suddenly she stirred against him  my dear i am dying of hunger she said  it was a slight pain to him to be brought to  well get up he said unmoving  and she sank her head on to him again and they lay still lapsing half consciously he heard the clock chime the hour she did not hear  do get up she murmured at length and give me something to eat  yes he said and he put his arms round her and she lay with her face on him they were faintly astonished that they did not move the minutes rustled louder at the window  let me go then he said  she lifted her head from him relinquishingly with a little breaking away he moved out of bed and was taking his clothes she stretched out her hand to him  you are so nice she said and he went back for a moment or two  then actually he did slip into some clothes and looking round quickly at her was gone out of the room she lay translated again into a pale clearer peace as if she were a spirit she listened to the noise of him downstairs as if she were no longer of the material world  it was halfpast one he looked at the silent kitchen untouched from last night dim with the drawn blind and he hastened to draw up the blind so people should know they were not in bed any later well it was his own house it did not matter hastily he put wood in the grate and made a fire he exulted in himself like an adventurer on an undiscovered island the fire blazed up he put on the kettle how happy he felt how still and secluded the house was there were only he and she in the world  but when he unbolted the door and halfdressed looked out he felt furtive and guilty the world was there after all and he had felt so secure as though this house were the ark in the flood and all the rest was drowned the world was there and it was afternoon the morning had vanished and gone by the day was growing old where was the bright fresh morning he was accused was the morning gone and he had lain with blinds drawn let it pass by unnoticed  he looked again round the chill grey afternoon and he himself so soft and warm and glowing there were two sprigs of yellow jasmine in the saucer that covered the milkjug he wondered who had been and left the sign taking the jug he hastily shut the door let the day and the daylight drop out let it go by unseen he did not care what did one day more or less matter to him it could fall into oblivion unspent if it liked this one course of daylight  somebody has been and found the door locked he said when he went upstairs with the tray he gave her the two sprigs of jasmine she laughed as she sat up in bed childishly threading the flowers in the breast of her nightdress her brown hair stuck out like a nimbus all fierce round her softly glowing face her dark eyes watched the tray eagerly  how good she cried sniffing the cold air im glad you did a lot and she stretched out her hands eagerly for her platecome back to bed quickits cold she rubbed her hands together sharply  he put off what little clothing he had on and sat beside her in the bed  you look like a lion with your mane sticking out and your nose pushed over your food he said  she tinkled with laughter and gladly ate her breakfast  the morning was sunk away unseen the afternoon was steadily going too and he was letting it go one bright transit of daylight gone by unacknowledged there was something unmanly recusant in it he could not quite reconcile himself to the fact he felt he ought to get up go out quickly into the daylight and work or spend himself energetically in the open air of the afternoon retrieving what was left to him of the day  but he did not go well one might as well be hung for a sheep as for a lamb if he had lost this day of his life he had lost it he gave it up he was not going to count his losses she didnt care she didnt care in the least then why should he should he be behind her in recklessness and independence she was superb in her indifference he wanted to be like her  she took her responsibilities lightly when she spilled her tea on the pillow she rubbed it carelessly with a handkerchief and turned over the pillow he would have felt guilty she did not and it pleased him it pleased him very much to see how these things did not matter to her  when the meal was over she wiped her mouth on her handkerchief quickly satisfied and happy and settled down on the pillow again with her fingers in his close strange furlike hair  the evening began to fall the light was half alive livid he hid his face against her  i dont like the twilight he said  i love it she answered  he hid his face against her who was warm and like sunlight she seemed to have sunlight inside her her heart beating seemed like sunlight upon him in her was a more real day than the day could give so warm and steady and restoring he hid his face against her whilst the twilight fell whilst she lay staring out with her unseeing dark eyes as if she wandered forth untrammelled in the vagueness the vagueness gave her scope and set her free  to him turned towards her heartpulse all was very still and very warm and very close like noontide he was glad to know this warm full noon it ripened him and took away his responsibility some of his conscience  they got up when it was quite dark she hastily twisted her hair into a knot and was dressed in a twinkling then they went downstairs drew to the fire and sat in silence saying a few words now and then  her father was coming she bundled the dishes away flew round and tidied the room assumed another character and again seated herself he sat thinking of his carving of eve he loved to go over his carving in his mind dwelling on every stroke every line how he loved it now when he went back to his creationpanel again he would finish his eve tender and sparkling it did not satisfy him yet the lord should labour over her in a silent passion of creation and adam should be tense as if in a dream of immortality and eve should take form glimmeringly shadowily as if the lord must wrestle with his own soul for her yet she was a radiance  what are you thinking about she asked  he found it difficult to say his soul became shy when he tried to communicate it  i was thinking my eve was too hard and lively  why  i dont know she should be more he made a gesture of infinite tenderness  there was a stillness with a little joy he could not tell her any more why could he not tell her any more she felt a pang of disconsolate sadness but it was nothing she went to him  her father came and found them both very glowing like an open flower he loved to sit with them where there was a perfume of love anyone who came must breathe it they were both very quick and alive lit up from the otherworld so that it was quite an experience for them that anyone else could exist  but still it troubled will brangwen a little in his orderly conventional mind that the established rule of things had gone so utterly one ought to get up in the morning and wash oneself and be a decent social being instead the two of them stayed in bed till nightfall and then got up she never washed her face but sat there talking to her father as bright and shameless as a daisy opened out of the dew or she got up at ten oclock and quite blithely went to bed again at three or at halfpast four stripping him naked in the daylight and all so gladly and perfectly oblivious quite of his qualms he let her do as she liked with him and shone with strange pleasure she was to dispose of him as she would he was translated with gladness to be in her hands and down went his qualms his maxims his rules his smaller beliefs she scattered them like an expert skittleplayer he was very much astonished and delighted to see them scatter  he stood and gazed and grinned with wonder whilst his tablets of stone went bounding and bumping and splintering down the hill dislodged for ever indeed it was true as they said that a man wasnt born before he was married what a change indeed  he surveyed the rind of the world houses factories trams the discarded rind people scurrying about work going on all on the discarded surface an earthquake had burst it all from inside it was as if the surface of the world had been broken away entire ilkeston streets church people work ruleoftheday all intact and yet peeled away into unreality leaving here exposed the inside the reality ones own being strange feelings and passions and yearnings and beliefs and aspirations suddenly become present revealed the permanent bedrock knitted one rock with the woman one loved it was confounding things are not what they seem when he was a child he had thought a woman was a woman merely by virtue of her skirts and petticoats and now lo the whole world could be divested of its garment the garment could lie there shed away intact and one could stand in a new world a new earth naked in a new naked universe it was too astounding and miraculous  this then was marriage the old things didnt matter any more one got up at four oclock and had broth at teatime and made toffee in the middle of the night one didnt put on ones clothes or one did put on ones clothes he still was not quite sure it was not criminal but it was a discovery to find one might be so supremely absolved all that mattered was that he should love her and she should love him and they should live kindled to one another like the lord in two burning bushes that were not consumed and so they lived for the time  she was less hampered than he so she came more quickly to her fulness and was sooner ready to enjoy again a return to the outside world she was going to give a teaparty his heart sank he wanted to go on to go on as they were he wanted to have done with the outside world to declare it finished for ever he was anxious with a deep desire and anxiety that she should stay with him where they were in the timeless universe of free perfect limbs and immortal breast affirming that the old outward order was finished the new order was begun to last for ever the living life palpitating from the gleaming core to action without crust or cover or outward lie but no he could not keep her she wanted the dead world againshe wanted to walk on the outside once more she was going to give a teaparty it made him frightened and furious and miserable he was afraid all would be lost that he had so newly come into like the youth in the fairy tale who was king for one day in the year and for the rest a beaten herd like cinderella also at the feast he was sullen but she blithely began to make preparations for her teaparty his fear was too strong he was troubled he hated her shallow anticipation and joy was she not forfeiting the reality the one reality for all that was shallow and worthless wasnt she carelessly taking off her crown to be an artificial figure having other artificial women to tea when she might have been perfect with him and kept him perfect in the land of intimate connection now he must be deposed his joy must be destroyed he must put on the vulgar shallow death of an outward existence  he ground his soul in uneasiness and fear but she rose to a real outburst of housework turning him away as she shoved the furniture aside to her broom he stood hanging miserable near he wanted her back dread and desire for her to stay with him and shame at his own dependence on her drove him to anger he began to lose his head the wonder was going to pass away again all the love the magnificent new order was going to be lost she would forfeit it all for the outside things she would admit the outside world again she would throw away the living fruit for the ostensible rind he began to hate this in her driven by fear of her departure into a state of helplessness almost of imbecility he wandered about the house  and she with her skirts kilted up flew round at her work absorbed  shake the rug then if you must hang round she said  and fretting with resentment he went to shake the rug she was blithely unconscious of him he came back hanging near to her  cant you do anything she said as if to a child impatiently cant you do your woodwork  where shall i do it he asked harsh with pain  anywhere  how furious that made him  or go for a walk she continued go down to the marsh dont hang about as if you were only half there  he winced and hated it he went away to read never had his soul felt so flayed and uncreated  and soon he must come down again to her his hovering near her wanting her to be with him the futility of him the way his hands hung irritated her beyond bearing she turned on him blindly and destructively he became a mad creature black and electric with fury the dark storms rose in him his eyes glowed black and evil he was fiendish in his thwarted soul  there followed two black and ghastly days when she was set in anguish against him and he felt as if he were in a black violent underworld and his wrists quivered murderously and she resisted him he seemed a dark almost evil thing pursuing her hanging on to her burdening her she would give anything to have him removed  you need some work to do she said you ought to be at work cant you do something  his soul only grew the blacker his condition now became complete the darkness of his soul was thorough everything had gone he remained complete in his own tense black will he was now unaware of her she did not exist his dark passionate soul had recoiled upon itself and now clinched and coiled round a centre of hatred existed in its own power there was a curiously ugly pallor an expressionlessness in his face she shuddered from him she was afraid of him his will seemed grappled upon her  she retreated before him she went down to the marsh she entered again the immunity of her parents love for her he remained at yew cottage black and clinched his mind dead he was unable to work at his woodcarving he went on working monotonously at the garden blindly like a mole  as she came home up the hill looking away at the town dim and blue on the hill her heart relaxed and became yearning she did not want to fight him any more she wanted loveoh love her feet began to hurry she wanted to get back to him her heart became tight with yearning for him  he had been making the garden in order cutting the edges of the turf laying the path with stones he was a good capable workman  how nice youve made it she said approaching tentatively down the path  but he did not heed he did not hear his brain was solid and dead  havent you made it nice she repeated rather plaintively  he looked up at her with that fixed expressionless face and unseeing eyes which shocked her made her go dazed and blind then he turned away she saw his slender stooping figure groping a revulsion came over her she went indoors  as she took off her hat in the bedroom she found herself weeping bitterly with some of the old anguished childish desolation she sat still and cried on she did not want him to know she was afraid of his hard evil moments the head dropped a little rigidly in a crouching cruel way she was afraid of him he seemed to lacerate her sensitive femaleness he seemed to hurt her womb to take pleasure in torturing her  he came into the house the sound of his footsteps in his heavy boots filled her with horror a hard cruel malignant sound she was afraid he would come upstairs but he did not she waited apprehensively he went out  where she was most vulnerable he hurt her oh where she was delivered over to him in her very soft femaleness he seemed to lacerate her and desecrate her she pressed her hands over her womb in anguish whilst the tears ran down her face and why and why why was he like this  suddenly she dried her tears she must get the tea ready she went downstairs and set the table when the meal was ready she called to him  ive mashed the tea will are you coming  she herself could hear the sound of tears in her own voice and she began to cry again he did not answer but went on with his work she waited a few minutes in anguish fear came over her she was panicstricken with terror like a child and she could not go home again to her father she was held by the power in this man who had taken her  she turned indoors so that he should not see her tears she sat down to table presently he came into the scullery his movements jarred on her as she heard them how horrible was the way he pumped exacerbating so cruel how she hated to hear him how he hated her how his hatred was like blows upon her the tears were coming again  he came in his face wooden and lifeless fixed persistent he sat down to tea his head dropped over his cup uglily his hands were red from the cold water and there were rims of earth in his nails he went on with his tea  it was his negative insensitiveness to her that she could not bear something clayey and ugly his intelligence was selfabsorbed how unnatural it was to sit with a selfabsorbed creature like something negative ensconced opposite one nothing could touch himhe could only absorb things into his own self  the tears were running down her face something startled him and he was looking up at her with his hateful hard bright eyes hard and unchanging as a bird of prey  what are you crying for came the grating voice  she winced through her womb she could not stop crying  what are you crying for came the question again in just the same tone and still there was silence with only the sniff of her tears  his eyes glittered and as if with malignant desire she shrank and became blind she was like a bird being beaten down a sort of swoon of helplessness came over her she was of another order than he she had no defence against him against such an influence she was only vulnerable she was given up  he rose and went out of the house possessed by the evil spirit it tortured him and wracked him and fought in him and whilst he worked in the deepening twilight it left him suddenly he saw that she was hurt he had only seen her triumphant before suddenly his heart was torn with compassion for her he became alive again in an anguish of compassion he could not bear to think of her tearshe could not bear it he wanted to go to her and pour out his hearts blood to her he wanted to give everything to her all his blood his life to the last dregs pour everything away to her he yearned with passionate desire to offer himself to her utterly  the evening star came and the night she had not lighted the lamp his heart burned with pain and with grief he trembled to go to her  and at last he went hesitating burdened with a great offering the hardness had gone out of him his body was sensitive slightly trembling his hand was curiously sensitive shrinking as he shut the door he fixed the latch almost tenderly  in the kitchen was only the fireglow he could not see her he quivered with dread lest she had gonehe knew not where in shrinking dread he went through to the parlour to the foot of the stairs  anna he called  there was no answer he went up the stairs in dread of the empty housethe horrible emptiness that made his heart ring with insanity he opened the bedroom door and his heart flashed with certainty that she had gone that he was alone  but he saw her on the bed lying very still and scarcely noticeable with her back to him he went and put his hand on her shoulder very gently hesitating in a great fear and selfoffering she did not move  he waited the hand that touched her shoulder hurt him as if she were sending it away he stood dim with pain  anna he said  but still she was motionless like a curled up oblivious creature his heart beat with strange throes of pain then by a motion under his hand he knew she was crying holding herself hard so that her tears should not be known he waited the tension continuedperhaps she was not cryingthen suddenly relapsed with a sharp catch of a sob his heart flamed with love and suffering for her kneeling carefully on the bed so that his earthy boots should not touch it he took her in his arms to comfort her the sobs gathered in her she was sobbing bitterly but not to him she was still away from him  he held her against his breast whilst she sobbed withheld from him and all his body vibrated against her  dont crydont cry he said with an odd simplicity his heart was calm and numb with a sort of innocence of love now  she still sobbed ignoring him ignoring that he held her his lips were dry  dont cry my love he said in the same abstract way in his breast his heart burned like a torch with suffering he could not bear the desolateness of her crying he would have soothed her with his blood he heard the church clock chime as if it touched him and he waited in suspense for it to have gone by it was quiet again  my love he said to her bending to touch her wet face with his mouth he was afraid to touch her how wet her face was his body trembled as he held her he loved her till he felt his heart and all his veins would burst and flood her with his hot healing blood he knew his blood would heal and restore her  she was becoming quieter he thanked the god of mercy that at last she was becoming quieter his head felt so strange and blazed still he held her close with trembling arms his blood seemed very strong enveloping her  and at last she began to draw near to him she nestled to him his limbs his body took fire and beat up in flames she clung to him she cleaved to his body the flames swept him he held her in sinews of fire if she would kiss him he bent his mouth down and her mouth soft and moist received him he felt his veins would burst with anguish of thankfulness his heart was mad with gratefulness he could pour himself out upon her for ever  when they came to themselves the night was very dark two hours had gone by they lay still and warm and weak like the newborn together and there was a silence almost of the unborn only his heart was weeping happily after the pain he did not understand he had yielded given way there was no understanding there could be only acquiescence and submission and tremulous wonder of consummation  the next morning when they woke up it had snowed he wondered what was the strange pallor in the air and the unusual tang snow was on the grass and the windowsill it weighed down the black ragged branches of the yews and smoothed the graves in the churchyard  soon it began to snow again and they were shut in he was glad for then they were immune in a shadowy silence there was no world no time  the snow lasted for some days on the sunday they went to church they made a line of footprints across the garden he left a flat snowprint of his hand on the wall as he vaulted over they traced the snow across the churchyard for three days they had been immune in a perfect love  there were very few people in church and she was glad she did not care much for church she had never questioned any beliefs and she was from habit and custom a regular attendant at morning service but she had ceased to come with any anticipation today however in the strangeness of snow after such consummation of love she felt expectant again and delighted she was still in the eternal world  she used after she went to the high school and wanted to be a lady wanted to fulfil some mysterious ideal always to listen to the sermon and to try to gather suggestions that was all very well for a while the vicar told her to be good in this way and in that she went away feeling it was her highest aim to fulfil these injunctions  but quickly this palled after a short time she was not very much interested in being good her soul was in quest of something which was not just being good and doing ones best no she wanted something else something that was not her readymade duty everything seemed to be merely a matter of social duty and never of her self they talked about her soul but somehow never managed to rouse or to implicate her soul as yet her soul was not brought in at all  so that whilst she had an affection for mr loverseed the vicar and a protective sort of feeling for cossethay church wanting always to help it and defend it it counted very small in her life  not but that she was conscious of some unsatisfaction when her husband was roused by the thought of the churches then she became hostile to the ostensible church she hated it for not fulfilling anything in her the church told her to be good very well she had no idea of contradicting what it said the church talked about her soul about the welfare of mankind as if the saving of her soul lay in her performing certain acts conducive to the welfare of mankind well and goodit was so then  nevertheless as she sat in church her face had a pathos and poignancy was this what she had come to hear how by doing this thing and by not doing that she could save her soul she did not contradict it but the pathos of her face gave the lie there was something else she wanted to hear it was something else she asked for from the church  but who was she to affirm it and what was she doing with unsatisfied desires she was ashamed she ignored them and left them out of count as much as possible her underneath yearnings they angered her she wanted to be like other people decently satisfied  he angered her more than ever church had an irresistible attraction for him and he paid no more attention to that part of the service which was church to her than if he had been an angel or a fabulous beast sitting there he simply paid no heed to the sermon or to the meaning of the service there was something thick dark dense powerful about him that irritated her too deeply for her to speak of it the church teaching in itself meant nothing to him and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive them that trespass against usit simply did not touch him it might have been more sounds and it would have acted upon him in the same way he did not want things to be intelligible and he did not care about his trespasses neither about the trespasses of his neighbour when he was in church leave that care for weekdays when he was in church he took no more notice of his daily life it was weekday stuff as for the welfare of mankindhe merely did not realize that there was any such thing except on weekdays when he was goodnatured enough in church he wanted a dark nameless emotion the emotion of all the great mysteries of passion  he was not interested in the thought of himself or of her oh and how that irritated her he ignored the sermon he ignored the greatness of mankind he did not admit the immediate importance of mankind he did not care about himself as a human being he did not attach any vital importance to his life in the drafting office or his life among men that was just merely the margin to the text the verity was his connection with anna and his connection with the church his real being lay in his dark emotional experience of the infinite of the absolute and the great mysterious illuminated capitals to the text were his feelings with the church  it exasperated her beyond measure she could not get out of the church the satisfaction he got the thought of her soul was intimately mixed up with the thought of her own self indeed her soul and her own self were one and the same in her whereas he seemed simply to ignore the fact of his own self almost to refute it he had a soula dark inhuman thing caring nothing for humanity so she conceived it and in the gloom and the mystery of the church his soul lived and ran free like some strange underground thing abstract  he was very strange to her and in this church spirit in conceiving himself as a soul he seemed to escape and run free of her in a way she envied it him this dark freedom and jubilation of the soul some strange entity in him it fascinated her again she hated it and again she despised him wanted to destroy it in him  this snowy morning he sat with a darkbright face beside her not aware of her and somehow she felt he was conveying to strange secret places the love that sprang in him for her he sat with a darkrapt halfdelighted face looking at a little stained window she saw the rubycoloured glass with the shadow heaped along the bottom from the snow outside and the familiar yellow figure of the lamb holding the banner a little darkened now but in the murky interior strangely luminous pregnant  she had always liked the little red and yellow window the lamb looking very silly and selfconscious was holding up a forepaw in the cleft of which was dangerously perched a little flag with a red cross very pale yellow the lamb with greenish shadows since she was a child she had liked this creature with the same feeling she felt for the little woolly lambs on green legs that children carried home from the fair every year she had always liked these toys and she had the same amused childish liking for this church lamb yet she had always been uneasy about it she was never sure that this lamb with a flag did not want to be more than it appeared so she half mistrusted it there was a mixture of dislike in her attitude to it  now by a curious gathering knitting of his eyes the faintest tension of ecstasy on his face he gave her the uncomfortable feeling that he was in correspondence with the creature the lamb in the window a cold wonder came over herher soul was perplexed there he sat motionless timeless with the faint bright tension on his face what was he doing what connection was there between him and the lamb in the glass  suddenly it gleamed to her dominant this lamb with the flag suddenly she had a powerful mystic experience the power of the tradition seized on her she was transported to another world and she hated it resisted it  instantly it was only a silly lamb in the glass again and dark violent hatred of her husband swept up in her what was he doing sitting there gleaming carried away soulful  she shifted sharply she knocked him as she pretended to pick up her glove she groped among his feet  he came to rather bewildered exposed anybody but her would have pitied him she wanted to rend him he did not know what was amiss what he had been doing  as they sat at dinner in their cottage he was dazed by the chill of antagonism from her she did not know why she was so angry but she was incensed  why do you never listen to the sermon she asked seething with hostility and violation  i do he said  you dontyou dont hear a single word  he retired into himself to enjoy his own sensation there was something subterranean about him as if he had an underworld refuge the young girl hated to be in the house with him when he was like this  after dinner he retired into the parlour continuing in the same state of abstraction which was a burden intolerable to her then he went to the bookshelf and took down books to look at that she had scarcely glanced over  he sat absorbed over a book on the illuminations in old missals and then over a book on paintings in churches italian english french and german he had when he was sixteen discovered a roman catholic bookshop where he could find such things  he turned the leaves in absorption absorbed in looking not thinking he was like a man whose eyes were in his chest she said of him later  she came to look at the things with him half they fascinated her she was puzzled interested and antagonistic  it was when she came to pictures of the pieta that she burst out  i do think theyre loathsome she cried  what he said surprised abstracted  those bodies with slits in them posing to be worshipped  you see it means the sacraments the bread he said slowly  does it she cried then its worse i dont want to see your chest slit nor to eat your dead body even if you offer it to me cant you see its horrible  it isnt me its christ  what if it is its you and its horrible you wallowing in your own dead body and thinking of eating it in the sacrament  youve to take it for what it means  it means your human body put up to be slit and killed and then worshippedwhat else  they lapsed into silence his soul grew angry and aloof  and i think that lamb in church she said is the biggest joke in the parish  she burst into a pouf of ridiculing laughter  it might be to those that see nothing in it he said you know its the symbol of christ of his innocence and sacrifice  whatever it means its a lamb she said and i like lambs too much to treat them as if they had to mean something as for the christmastree flagno  and again she poufed with mockery  its because you dont know anything he said violently harshly laugh at what you know not at what you dont know  what dont i know  what things mean  and what does it mean  he was reluctant to answer her he found it difficult  what does it mean she insisted  it means the triumph of the resurrection  she hesitated baffled a fear came upon her what were these things something dark and powerful seemed to extend before her was it wonderful after all  but noshe refused it  whatever it may pretend to mean what it is is a silly absurd toylamb with a christmastree flag ledged on its pawand if it wants to mean anything else it must look different from that  he was in a state of violent irritation against her partly he was ashamed of his love for these things he hid his passion for them he was ashamed of the ecstasy into which he could throw himself with these symbols and for a few moments he hated the lamb and the mystic pictures of the eucharist with a violent ashy hatred his fire was put out she had thrown cold water on it the whole thing was distasteful to him his mouth was full of ashes he went out cold with corpselike anger leaving her alone he hated her he walked through the white snow under a sky of lead  and she wept again in bitter recurrence of the previous gloom but her heart was easyoh much more easy  she was quite willing to make it up with him when he came home again he was black and surly but abated she had broken a little of something in him and at length he was glad to forfeit from his soul all his symbols to have her making love to him he loved it when she put her head on his knee and he had not asked her to or wanted her to he loved her when she put her arms round him and made bold love to him and he did not make love to her he felt a strong blood in his limbs again  and she loved the intent far look of his eyes when they rested on her intent yet far not near not with her and she wanted to bring them near she wanted his eyes to come to hers to know her and they would not they remained intent and far and proud like a hawks naive and inhuman as a hawks so she loved him and caressed him and roused him like a hawk till he was keen and instant but without tenderness he came to her fierce and hard like a hawk striking and taking her he was no mystic any more she was his aim and object his prey and she was carried off and he was satisfied or satiated at last  then immediately she began to retaliate on him she too was a hawk if she imitated the pathetic plover running plaintive to him that was part of the game when he satisfied moved with a proud insolent slouch of the body and a halfcontemptuous drop of the head unaware of her ignoring her very existence after taking his fill of her and getting his satisfaction of her her soul roused its pinions became like steel and she struck at him when he sat on his perch glancing sharply round with solitary pride pride eminent and fierce she dashed at him and threw him from his station savagely she goaded him from his keen dignity of a male she harassed him from his unperturbed pride till he was mad with rage his light brown eyes burned with fury they saw her now like flames of anger they flared at her and recognized her as the enemy  very good she was the enemy very good as he prowled round her she watched him as he struck at her she struck back  he was angry because she had carelessly pushed away his tools so that they got rusty  dont leave them littering in my way then she said  i shall leave them where i like he cried  then i shall throw them where i like  they glowered at each other he with rage in his hands she with her soul fierce with victory they were very well matched they would fight it out  she turned to her sewing immediately the teathings were cleared away she fetched out the stuff and his soul rose in rage he hated beyond measure to hear the shriek of calico as she tore the web sharply as if with pleasure and the run of the sewingmachine gathered a frenzy in him at last  arent you going to stop that row he shouted cant you do it in the daytime  she looked up sharply hostile from her work  no i cant do it in the daytime i have other things to do besides i like sewing and youre not going to stop me doing it  whereupon she turned back to her arranging fixing stitching his nerves jumped with anger as the sewingmachine started and stuttered and buzzed  but she was enjoying herself she was triumphant and happy as the darting needle danced ecstatically down a hem drawing the stuff along under its vivid stabbing irresistibly she made the machine hum she stopped it imperiously her fingers were deft and swift and mistress  if he sat behind her stiff with impotent rage it only made a trembling vividness come into her energy on she worked at last he went to bed in a rage and lay stiff away from her and she turned her back on him and in the morning they did not speak except in mere cold civilities  and when he came home at night his heart relenting and growing hot for love of her when he was just ready to feel he had been wrong and when he was expecting her to feel the same there she sat at the sewingmachine the whole house was covered with clipped calico the kettle was not even on the fire  she started up affecting concern  is it so late she cried  but his face had gone stiff with rage he walked through to the parlour then he walked back and out of the house again her heart sank very swiftly she began to make his tea  he went blackhearted down the road to ilkeston when he was in this state he never thought a bolt shot across the doors of his mind and shut him in a prisoner he went back to ilkeston and drank a glass of beer what was he going to do he did not want to see anybody  he would go to nottingham to his own town he went to the station and took a train when he got to nottingham still he had nowhere to go however it was more agreeable to walk familiar streets he paced them with a mad restlessness as if he were running amok then he turned to a bookshop and found a book on bamberg cathedral here was a discovery here was something for him he went into a quiet restaurant to look at his treasure he lit up with thrills of bliss as he turned from picture to picture he had found something at last in these carvings his soul had great satisfaction had he not come out to seek and had he not found he was in a passion of fulfilment these were the finest carvings statues he had ever seen the book lay in his hands like a doorway the world around was only an enclosure a room but he was going away he lingered over the lovely statues of women a marvellous finelywrought universe crystallized out around him as he looked again at the crowns the twining hair the womanfaces he liked all the better the unintelligible text of the german he preferred things he could not understand with the mind he loved the undiscovered and the undiscoverable he pored over the pictures intensely and these were wooden statues holzhe believed that meant wood wooden statues so shapen to his soul he was a million times gladdened how undiscovered the world was how it revealed itself to his soul what a fine exciting thing his life was at his hand did not bamberg cathedral make the world his own he celebrated his triumphant strength and life and verity and embraced the vast riches he was inheriting  but it was about time to go home he had better catch a train all the time there was a steady bruise at the bottom of his soul but so steady as to be forgettable he caught a train for ilkeston  it was ten oclock as he was mounting the hill to cossethay carrying his limp book on bamberg cathedral he had not yet thought of anna not definitely the dark finger pressing a bruise controlled him thoughtlessly  anna had started guiltily when he left the house she had hastened preparing the tea hoping he would come back she had made some toast and got all ready then he didnt come she cried with vexation and disappointment why had he gone why couldnt he come back now why was it such a battle between them she loved himshe did love himwhy couldnt he be kinder to her nicer to her  she waited in distressthen her mood grew harder he passed out of her thoughts she had considered indignantly what right he had to interfere with her sewing she had indignantly refuted his right to interfere with her at all she was not to be interfered with was she not herself and he the outsider  yet a quiver of fear went through her if he should leave her she sat conjuring fears and sufferings till she wept with very selfpity she did not know what she would do if he left her or if he turned against her the thought of it chilled her made her desolate and hard and against him the stranger the outsider the being who wanted to arrogate authority she remained steadily fortified was she not herself how could one who was not of her own kind presume with authority she knew she was immutable unchangeable she was not afraid for her own being she was only afraid of all that was not herself it pressed round her it came to her and took part in her in form of her man this vast resounding alien world which was not herself and he had so many weapons he might strike from so many sides  when he came in at the door his heart was blazed with pity and tenderness she looked so lost and forlorn and young she glanced up afraid and she was surprised to see him shiningfaced clear and beautiful in his movements as if he were clarified and a startled pang of fear and shame of herself went through her  they waited for each other to speak  do you want to eat anything she said  ill get it myself he answered not wanting her to serve him but she brought out food and it pleased him she did it for him he was again a bright lord  i went to nottingham he said mildly  to your mother she asked in a flash of contempt  noi didnt go home  who did you go to see  i went to see nobody  then why did you go to nottingham  i went because i wanted to go  he was getting angry that she again rebuffed him when he was so clear and shining  and who did you see  i saw nobody  nobody  nowho should i see  you saw nobody you knew  no i didnt he replied irritably  she believed him and her mood became cold  i bought a book he said handing her the propitiatory volume  she idly looked at the pictures beautiful the pure women with their cleardropping gowns her heart became colder what did they mean to him  he sat and waited for her she bent over the book  arent they nice he said his voice roused and glad her blood flushed but she did not lift her head  yes she said in spite of herself she was compelled by him he was strange attractive exerting some power over her  he came over to her and touched her delicately her heart beat with wild passion wild raging passion but she resisted as yet it was always the unknown always the unknown and she clung fiercely to her known self but the rising flood carried her away  they loved each other to transport again passionately and fully  isnt it more wonderful than ever she asked him radiant like a newly opened flower with tears like dew  he held her closer he was strange and abstracted  it is always more wonderful she asseverated in a glad childs voice remembering her fear and not quite cleared of it yet  so it went on continually the recurrence of love and conflict between them one day it seemed as if everything was shattered all life spoiled ruined desolate and laid waste the next day it was all marvellous again just marvellous one day she thought she would go mad from his very presence the sound of his drinking was detestable to her the next day she loved and rejoiced in the way he crossed the floor he was sun moon and stars in one  she fretted however at last over the lack of stability when the perfect hours came back her heart did not forget that they would pass away again she was uneasy the surety the surety the inner surety the confidence in the abidingness of love that was what she wanted and that she did not get she knew also that he had not got it  nevertheless it was a marvellous world she was for the most part lost in the marvellousness of it even her great woes were marvellous to her  she could be very happy and she wanted to be happy she resented it when he made her unhappy then she could kill him cast him out many days she waited for the hour when he would be gone to work then the flow of her life which he seemed to damn up was let loose and she was free she was free she was full of delight everything delighted her she took up the rug and went to shake it in the garden patches of snow were on the fields the air was light she heard the ducks shouting on the pond she saw them charge and sail across the water as if they were setting off on an invasion of the world she watched the rough horses one of which was clipped smooth on the belly so that he wore a jacket and long stockings of brown fur stand kissing each other in the wintry morning by the churchyard wall everything delighted her now he was gone the insulator the obstruction removed the world was all hers in connection with her  she was joyfully active nothing pleased her more than to hang out the washing in a high wind that came fullbutt over the round of the hill tearing the wet garments out of her hands making flapflapflap of the waving stuff she laughed and struggled and grew angry but she loved her solitary days  then he came home at night and she knitted her brows because of some endless contest between them as he stood in the doorway her heart changed it steeled itself the laughter and zest of the day disappeared from her she was stiffened  they fought an unknown battle unconsciously still they were in love with each other the passion was there but the passion was consumed in a battle and the deep fierce unnamed battle went on everything glowed intensely about them the world had put off its clothes and was awful with new primal nakedness  sunday came when the strange spell was cast over her by him half she loved it she was becoming more like him all the weekdays there was a glint of sky and fields the little church seemed to babble away to the cottages the morning through but on sundays when he stayed at home a deeplycoloured intense gloom seemed to gather on the face of the earth the church seemed to fill itself with shadow to become big a universe to her there was a burning of blue and ruby a sound of worship about her and when the doors were opened and she came out into the world it was a world newcreated she stepped into the resurrection of the world her heart beating to the memory of the darkness and the passion  if as very often they went to the marsh for tea on sundays then she regained another lighter world that had never known the gloom and the stained glass and the ecstasy of chanting her husband was obliterated she was with her father again who was so fresh and free and all daylight her husband with his intensity and his darkness was obliterated she left him she forgot him she accepted her father  yet as she went home again with the young man she put her hand on his arm tentatively a little bit ashamed her hand pleaded that he would not hold it against her her recusancy but he was obscured he seemed to become blind as if he were not there with her  then she was afraid she wanted him when he was oblivious of her she almost went mad with fear for she had become so vulnerable so exposed she was in touch so intimately all things about her had become intimate she had known them near and lovely like presences hovering upon her what if they should all go hard and separate again standing back from her terrible and distinct and she having known them should be at their mercy  this frightened her always her husband was to her the unknown to which she was delivered up she was a flower that has been tempted forth into blossom and has no retreat he had her nakedness in his power and who was he what was he a blind thing a dark force without knowledge she wanted to preserve herself  then she gathered him to herself again and was satisfied for a moment but as time went on she began to realize more and more that he did not alter that he was something dark alien to herself she had thought him just the bright reflex of herself as the weeks and months went by she realized that he was a dark opposite to her that they were opposites not complements  he did not alter he remained separately himself and he seemed to expect her to be part of himself the extension of his will she felt him trying to gain power over her without knowing her what did he want was he going to bully her  what did she want herself she answered herself that she wanted to be happy to be natural like the sunlight and the busy daytime and at the bottom of her soul she felt he wanted her to be dark unnatural sometimes when he seemed like the darkness covering and smothering her she revolted almost in horror and struck at him she struck at him and made him bleed and he became wicked because she dreaded him and held him in horror he became wicked he wanted to destroy and then the fight between them was cruel  she began to tremble he wanted to impose himself on her and he began to shudder she wanted to desert him to leave him a prey to the open with the unclean dogs of the darkness setting on to devour him he must beat her and make her stay with him whereas she fought to keep herself free of him  they went their ways now shadowed and stained with blood feeling the world far off unable to give help till she began to get tired after a certain point she became impassive detached utterly from him he was always ready to burst out murderously against her her soul got up and left him she went her way nevertheless in her apparent blitheness that made his soul black with opposition she trembled as if she bled  and ever and again the pure love came in sunbeams between them when she was like a flower in the sun to him so beautiful so shining so intensely dear that he could scarcely bear it then as if his soul had six wings of bliss he stood absorbed in praise feeling the radiance from the almighty beat through him like a pulse as he stood in the upright flame of praise transmitting the pulse of creation  and ever and again he appeared to her as the dread flame of power sometimes when he stood in the doorway his face lit up he seemed like an annunciation to her her heart beat fast and she watched him suspended he had a dark burning being that she dreaded and resisted she was subject to him as to the angel of the presence she waited upon him and heard his will and she trembled in his service  then all this passed away then he loved her for her childishness and for her strangeness to him for the wonder of her soul which was different from his soul and which made him genuine when he would be false and she loved him for the way he sat loosely in a chair or for the way he came through a door with his face open and eager she loved his ringing eager voice and the touch of the unknown about him his absolute simplicity  yet neither of them was quite satisfied he felt somewhere that she did not respect him she only respected him as far as he was related to herself for what he was beyond her she had no care she did not care for what he represented in himself it is true he did not know himself what he represented but whatever it was she did not really honour it she did no service to his work as a lacedesigner nor to himself as breadwinner because he went down to the office and worked every daythat entitled him to no respect or regard from her he knew rather she despised him for it and he almost loved her for this though at first it maddened him like an insult  what was much deeper she soon came to combat his deepest feelings what he thought about life and about society and mankind did not matter very much to her he was right enough to be insignificant this was again galling to him she would judge beyond him on these things but at length he came to accept her judgments discovering them as if they were his own it was not here the deep trouble lay the deep root of his enmity lay in the fact that she jeered at his soul he was inarticulate and stupid in thought but to some things he clung passionately he loved the church if she tried to get out of him what he believed then they were both soon in a white rage  did he believe the water turned to wine at cana she would drive him to the thing as a historical fact so much rainwaterlook at itcan it become grapejuice wine for an instant he saw with the clear eyes of the mind and said no his clear mind answering her for a moment rejected the idea and immediately his whole soul was crying in a mad inchoate hatred against this violation of himself it was true for him his mind was extinguished again at once his blood was up in his blood and bones he wanted the scene the wedding the water brought forward from the firkins as red wine and christ saying to his mother woman what have i to do with theemine hour is not yet come  and then  his mother saith unto the servants whatsoever he saith unto you do it  brangwen loved it with his bones and blood he loved it he could not let it go yet she forced him to let it go she hated his blind attachments  water natural water could it suddenly and unnaturally turn into wine depart from its being and at haphazard take on another being ah no he knew it was wrong  she became again the palpitating hostile child hateful putting things to destruction he became mute and dead his own being gave him the lie he knew it was so wine was wine water was water for ever the water had not become wine the miracle was not a real fact she seemed to be destroying him he went out dark and destroyed his soul running its blood and he tasted of death because his life was formed in these unquestioned concepts  she desolate again as she had been when she was a child went away and sobbed she did not care she did not care whether the water had turned to wine or not let him believe it if he wanted to but she knew she had won and an ashy desolation came over her  they were ashenly miserable for some time then the life began to come back he was nothing if not dogged he thought again of the chapter of st john there was a great biting pang but thou hast kept the good wine until now the best wine the young mans heart responded in a craving in a triumph although the knowledge that it was not true in fact bit at him like a weasel in his heart which was stronger the pain of the denial or the desire for affirmation he was stubborn in spirit and abode by his desire but he would not any more affirm the miracles as true  very well it was not true the water had not turned into wine the water had not turned into wine but for all that he would live in his soul as if the water had turned into wine for truth of fact it had not but for his soul it had  whether it turned into wine or whether it didnt he said it doesnt bother me i take it for what it is  and what is it she asked quickly hopefully  its the bible he said  that answer enraged her and she despised him she did not actively question the bible herself but he drove her to contempt  and yet he did not care about the bible the written letter although he could not satisfy her yet she knew of herself that he had something real he was not a dogmatist he did not believe in fact that the water turned into wine he did not want to make a fact out of it indeed his attitude was without criticism it was purely individual he took that which was of value to him from the written word he added to his spirit his mind he let sleep  and she was bitter against him that he let his mind sleep that which was human belonged to mankind he would not exert he cared only for himself he was no christian above all christ had asserted the brotherhood of man  she almost against herself clung to the worship of the human knowledge man must die in the body but in his knowledge he was immortal such somewhere was her belief quite obscure and unformulated she believed in the omnipotence of the human mind  he on the other hand blind as a subterranean thing just ignored the human mind and ran after his own darksouled desires following his own tunnelling nose she felt often she must suffocate and she fought him off  then he knowing he was blind fought madly back again frantic in sensual fear he did foolish things he asserted himself on his rights he arrogated the old position of master of the house  youve a right to do as i want he cried  fool she answered fool  ill let you know whos master he cried  fool she answered fool ive known my own father who could put a dozen of you in his pipe and push them down with his fingerend dont i know what a fool you are  he knew himself what a fool he was and was flayed by the knowledge yet he went on trying to steer the ship of their dual life he asserted his position as the captain of the ship and captain and ship bored her he wanted to loom important as master of one of the innumerable domestic craft that make up the great fleet of society it seemed to her a ridiculous armada of tubs jostling in futility she felt no belief in it she jeered at him as master of the house master of their dual life and he was black with shame and rage he knew with shame how her father had been a man without arrogating any authority  he had gone on the wrong tack and he felt it hard to give up the expedition there was great surging and shame then he yielded he had given up the masterofthehouse idea  there was something he wanted nevertheless some form of mastery ever and anon after his collapses into the petty and the shameful he rose up again and stubborn in spirit strong in his power to start afresh set out once more in his male pride of being to fulfil the hidden passion of his spirit  it began well but it ended always in war between them till they were both driven almost to madness he said she did not respect him she laughed in hollow scorn of this for her it was enough that she loved him  respect what she asked  but he always answered the wrong thing and though she cudgelled her brains she could not come at it  why dont you go on with your woodcarving she said why dont you finish your adam and eve  but she did not care for the adam and eve and he never put another stroke to it she jeered at the eve saying she is like a little marionette why is she so small youve made adam as big as god and eve like a doll  it is impudence to say that woman was made out of mans body she continued when every man is born of woman what impudence men have what arrogance  in a rage one day after trying to work on the board and failing so that his belly was a flame of nausea he chopped up the whole panel and put it on the fire she did not know he went about for some days very quiet and subdued after it  where is the adam and eve board she asked him  burnt  she looked at him  but your carving  i burned it  when  she did not believe him  on friday night  when i was at the marsh  yes  she said no more  then when he had gone to work she wept for a whole day and was much chastened in spirit so that a new fragile flame of love came out of the ashes of this last pain  directly it occurred to her that she was with child there was a great trembling of wonder and anticipation through her soul she wanted a child not that she loved babies so much though she was touched by all young things but she wanted to bear children and a certain hunger in her heart wanted to unite her husband with herself in a child  she wanted a son she felt a son would be everything she wanted to tell her husband but it was such a trembling intimate thing to tell him and he was at this time hard and unresponsive so that she went away and wept it was such a waste of a beautiful opportunity such a frost that nipped in the bud one of the beautiful moments of her life she went about heavy and tremulous with her secret wanting to touch him oh most delicately and see his face dark and sensitive attend to her news she waited and waited for him to become gentle and still towards her but he was always harsh and he bullied her  so that the buds shrivelled from her confidence she was chilled she went down to the marsh  well said her father looking at her and seeing her at the first glance whats amiss wi you now  the tears came at the touch of his careful love  nothing she said  cant you hit it off you two he said  hes so obstinate she quivered but her soul was obdurate itself  ay an i know another whos all that said her father  she was silent  you dont want to make yourselves miserable said her father all about nowt  he isnt miserable she said  ill back my life if you can do nowt else you can make him as miserable as a dog youd be a dab hand at that my lass  i do nothing to make him miserable she retorted  oh nooh no a packet o butterscotch you are  she laughed a little  you mustnt think i want him to be miserable she cried i dont  we quite readily believe it retorted brangwen neither do you intend him to be hopping for joy like a fish in a pond  this made her think she was rather surprised to find that she did not intend her husband to be hopping for joy like a fish in a pond  her mother came and they all sat down to tea talking casually  remember child said her mother that everything is not waiting for your hand just to take or leave you mustnt expect it between two people the love itself is the important thing and that is neither you nor him it is a third thing you must create you mustnt expect it to be just your way  hanor do i if i did i should soon find my mistake out if i put my hand out to take anything my hand is very soon bitten i can tell you  then you must mind where you put your hand said her father  anna was rather indignant that they took the tragedy of her young married life with such equanimity  you love the man right enough said her father wrinkling his forehead in distress thats all as counts  i do love him more shame to him she cried i want to tell himive been waiting for four days now to tell him her face began to quiver the tears came her parents watched her in silence she did not go on  tell him what said her father  that were going to have an infant she sobbed and hes never never let me not once every time ive come to him hes been horrid to me and i wanted to tell him i did and he wont let mehes cruel to me  she sobbed as if her heart would break her mother went and comforted her put her arms round her and held her close her father sat with a queer wrinkled brow and was rather paler than usual his heart went tense with hatred of his soninlaw  so that when the tale was sobbed out and comfort administered and tea sipped and something like calm restored to the little circle the thought of will brangwens entry was not pleasantly entertained  tilly was set to watch out for him as he passed by on his way home the little party at table heard the womans servants shrill call  youve got to come in will annas here  after a few moments the youth entered  are you stopping he asked in his hard harsh voice  he seemed like a blade of destruction standing there she quivered to tears  sit you down said tom brangwen an take a bit off your length  will brangwen sat down he felt something strange in the atmosphere he was dark browed but his eyes had the keen intent sharp look as if he could only see in the distance which was a beauty in him and which made anna so angry  why does he always deny me she said to herself why is it nothing to him what i am  and tom brangwen blueeyed and warm sat in opposition to the youth  how long are you stopping the young husband asked his wife  not very long she said  get your tea lad said tom brangwen are you itchin to be off the moment you enter  they talked of trivial things through the open door the level rays of sunset poured in shining on the floor a grey hen appeared stepping swiftly in the doorway pecking and the light through her comb and her wattles made an oriflamme tossed here and there as she went her grey body was like a ghost  anna watching threw scraps of bread and she felt the child flame within her she seemed to remember again forgotten burning faroff things  where was i born mother she asked  in london  and was my fathershe spoke of him as if he were merely a strange name she could never connect herself with himwas he dark  he had darkbrown hair and dark eyes and a fresh colouring he went bald rather bald when he was quite young replied her mother also as if telling a tale which was just old imagination  was he goodlooking  yeshe was very goodlookingrather small i have never seen an englishman who looked like him  why  he wasthe mother made a quick running movement with her handshis figure was alive and changingit was never fixed he was not in the least steadylike a running stream  it flashed over the youthanna too was like a running stream instantly he was in love with her again  tom brangwen was frightened his heart always filled with fear fear of the unknown when he heard his women speak of their bygone men as of strangers they had known in passing and had taken leave of again  in the room there came a silence and a singleness over all their hearts they were separate people with separate destinies why should they seek each to lay violent hands of claim on the other  the young people went home as a sharp little moon was setting in the dusk of spring tufts of trees hovered in the upper air the little church pricked up shadowily at the top of the hill the earth was a dark blue shadow  she put her hand lightly on his arm out of her far distance and out of the distance he felt her touch him they walked on hand in hand along opposite horizons touching across the dusk there was a sound of thrushes calling in the dark blue twilight  i think we are going to have an infant bill she said from far off  he trembled and his fingers tightened on hers  why he asked his heart beating you dont know  i do she said  they continued without saying any more walking along opposite horizons hand in hand across the intervening space two separate people and he trembled as if a wind blew on to him in strong gusts out of the unseen he was afraid he was afraid to know he was alone for she seemed fulfilled and separate and sufficient in her half of the world he could not bear to know that he was cut off why could he not be always one with her it was he who had given her the child why could she not be with him one with him why must he be set in this separateness why could she not be with him close close as one with him she must be one with him  he held her fingers tightly in his own she did not know what he was thinking the blaze of light on her heart was too beautiful and dazzling from the conception in her womb she walked glorified and the sound of the thrushes of the trains in the valley of the faroff faint noises of the town were her magnificat  but he was struggling in silence it seemed as though there were before him a solid wall of darkness that impeded him and suffocated him and made him mad he wanted her to come to him to complete him to stand before him so that his eyes did not should not meet the naked darkness nothing mattered to him but that she should come and complete him for he was ridden by the awful sense of his own limitation it was as if he ended uncompleted as yet uncreated on the darkness and he wanted her to come and liberate him into the whole  but she was complete in herself and he was ashamed of his need his helpless need of her his need and his shame of need weighed on him like a madness yet still he was quiet and gentle in reverence of her conception and because she was with child by him  and she was happy in showers of sunshine she loved her husband as a presence as a grateful condition but for the moment her need was fulfilled and now she wanted only to hold her husband by the hand in sheer happiness without taking thought only being glad  he had various folios of reproductions and among them a cheap print from fra angelicos entry of the blessed into paradise this filled anna with bliss the beautiful innocent way in which the blessed held each other by the hand as they moved towards the radiance the real real angelic melody made her weep with happiness the floweriness the beams of light the linking of hands was almost too much for her too innocent  day after day came shining through the door of paradise day after day she entered into the brightness the child in her shone till she herself was a beam of sunshine and how lovely was the sunshine that loitered and wandered out of doors where the catkins on the big hazel bushes at the end of the garden hung in their shaken floating aureole where little fumes like fire burst out from the black yew trees as a bird settled clinging to the branches one day bluebells were along the hedgebottoms then cowslips twinkled like manna golden and evanescent on the meadows she was full of a rich drowsiness and loneliness how happy she was how gorgeous it was to live to have known herself her husband the passion of love and begetting and to know that all this lived and waited and burned on around her a terrible purifying fire through which she had passed for once to come to this peace of golden radiance when she was with child and innocent and in love with her husband and with all the many angels hand in hand she lifted her throat to the breeze that came across the fields and she felt it handling her like sisters fondling her she drank it in perfume of cowslips and of appleblossoms  and in all the happiness a black shadow shy wild a beast of prey roamed and vanished from sight and like strands of gossamer blown across her eyes there was a dread for her  she was afraid when he came home at night as yet her fear never spoke the shadow never rushed upon her he was gentle humble he kept himself withheld his hands were delicate upon her and she loved them but there ran through her the thrill crisp as pain for she felt the darkness and otherworld still in his soft sheathed hands  but the summer drifted in with the silence of a miracle she was almost always alone all the while went on the long lovely drowsiness the maidenblush roses in the garden were all shed washed away in a pouring rain summer drifted into autumn and the long vague golden days began to close crimson clouds fumed about the west and as night came on all the sky was fuming and steaming and the moon far above the swiftness of vapours was white bleared the night was uneasy suddenly the moon would appear at a clear window in the sky looking down from far above like a captive and anna did not sleep there was a strange dark tension about her husband  she became aware that he was trying to force his will upon her something there was something he wanted as he lay there dark and tense and her soul sighed in weariness  everything was so vague and lovely and he wanted to wake her up to the hard hostile reality she drew back in resistance still he said nothing but she felt his power persisting on her till she became aware of the strain she cried out against the exhaustion he was forcing her he was forcing her and she wanted so much the joy and the vagueness and the innocence of her pregnancy she did not want his bittercorrosive love she did not want it poured into her to burn her why must she have it why oh why was he not content contained  she sat many hours by the window in those days when he drove her most with the black constraint of his will and she watched the rain falling on the yew trees she was not sad only wistful blanched the child under her heart was a perpetual warmth and she was sure the pressure was only upon her from the outside her soul had no stripes  yet in her heart itself was always this same strain tense anxious she was not safe she was always exposed she was always attacked there was a yearning in her for a fulness of peace and blessedness what a heavy yearning it wasso heavy  she knew vaguely that all the time he was not satisfied all the time he was trying to force something from her ah how she wished she could succeed with him in her own way he was there so inevitable she lived in him also and how she wanted to be at peace with him at peace she loved him she would give him love pure love with a strange rapt look in her face she awaited his homecoming that night  then when he came she rose with her hands full of love as of flowers radiant innocent a dark spasm crossed his face as she watched her face shining and flowerlike with innocent love his face grew dark and tense the cruelty gathered in his brows his eyes turned aside she saw the whites of his eyes as he looked aside from her she waited touching him with her hands but from his body through her hands came the bittercorrosive shock of his passion upon her destroying her in blossom she shrank she rose from her knees and went away from him to preserve herself and it was great pain to her  to him also it was agony he saw the glistening flowerlike love in her face and his heart was black because he did not want it not thisnot this he did not want flowery innocence he was unsatisfied the rage and storm of unsatisfaction tormented him ceaselessly why had she not satisfied him he had satisfied her she was satisfied at peace innocent round the doors of her own paradise  and he was unsatisfied unfulfilled he raged in torment wanting wanting it was for her to satisfy him then let her do it let her not come with flowery handfuls of innocent love he would throw these aside and trample the flowers to nothing he would destroy her flowery innocent bliss was he not entitled to satisfaction from her and was not his heart all raging desire his soul a black torment of unfulfilment let it be fulfilled in him then as it was fulfilled in her he had given her her fulfilment let her rise up and do her part  he was cruel to her but all the time he was ashamed and being ashamed he was more cruel for he was ashamed that he could not come to fulfilment without her and he could not and she would not heed him he was shackled and in darkness of torment  she beseeched him to work again to do his woodcarving but his soul was too black he had destroyed his panel of adam and eve he could not begin again least of all now whilst he was in this condition  for her there was no final release since he could not be liberated from himself strange and amorphous she must go yearning on through the trouble like a warm glowing cloud blown in the middle of a storm she felt so rich in her warm vagueness that her soul cried out on him because he harried her and wanted to destroy her  she had her moments of exaltation still rebirths of old exaltations as she sat by her bedroom window watching the steady rain her spirit was somewhere far off  she sat in pride and curious pleasure when there was no one to exult with and the unsatisfied soul must dance and play then one danced before the unknown  suddenly she realized that this was what she wanted to do big with child as she was she danced there in the bedroom by herself lifting her hands and her body to the unseen to the unseen creator who had chosen her to whom she belonged  she would not have had anyone know she danced in secret and her soul rose in bliss she danced in secret before the creator she took off her clothes and danced in the pride of her bigness  it surprised her when it was over she was shrinking and afraid to what was she now exposed she half wanted to tell her husband yet she shrank from him  all the time she ran on by herself she liked the story of david who danced before the lord and uncovered himself exultingly why should he uncover himself to michal a common woman he uncovered himself to the lord  thou comest to me with a sword and a spear and a shield but i come to thee in the name of the lordfor the battle is the lords and he will give you into our hands  her heart rang to the words she walked in her pride and her battle was her own lords her husband was delivered over  in these days she was oblivious of him who was he to come against her no he was not even the philistine the giant he was like saul proclaiming his own kingship she laughed in her heart who was he proclaiming his kingship she laughed in her heart with pride  and she had to dance in exultation beyond him because he was in the house she had to dance before her creator in exemption from the man on a saturday afternoon when she had a fire in the bedroom again she took off her things and danced lifting her knees and her hands in a slow rhythmic exulting he was in the house so her pride was fiercer she would dance his nullification she would dance to her unseen lord she was exalted over him before the lord  she heard him coming up the stairs and she flinched she stood with the firelight on her ankles and feet naked in the shadowy late afternoon fastening up her hair he was startled he stood in the doorway his brows black and lowering  what are you doing he said gratingly youll catch a cold  and she lifted her hands and danced again to annul him the light glanced on her knees as she made her slow fine movements down the far side of the room across the firelight he stood away near the door in blackness of shadow watching transfixed and with slow heavy movements she swayed backwards and forwards like a full ear of corn pale in the dusky afternoon threading before the firelight dancing his nonexistence dancing herself to the lord to exultation  he watched and his soul burned in him he turned aside he could not look it hurt his eyes her fine limbs lifted and lifted her hair was sticking out all fierce and her belly big strange terrifying uplifted to the lord her face was rapt and beautiful she danced exulting before her lord and knew no man  it hurt him as he watched as if he were at the stake he felt he was being burned alive the strangeness the power of her in her dancing consumed him he was burned he could not grasp he could not understand he waited obliterated then his eyes became blind to her he saw her no more and through the unseeing veil between them he called to her in his jarring voice  what are you doing that for  go away she said let me dance by myself  that isnt dancing he said harshly what do you want to do that for  i dont do it for you she said you go away  her strange lifted belly big with his child had he no right to be there he felt his presence a violation yet he had his right to be there he went and sat on the bed  she stopped dancing and confronted him again lifting her slim arms and twisting at her hair her nakedness hurt her opposed to him  i can do as i like in my bedroom she cried why do you interfere with me  and she slipped on a dressinggown and crouched before the fire he was more at ease now she was covered up the vision of her tormented him all the days of his life as she had been then a strange exalted thing having no relation to himself  after this day the door seemed to shut on his mind his brow shut and became impervious his eyes ceased to see his hands were suspended within himself his will was coiled like a beast hidden under the darkness but always potent working  at first she went on blithely enough with him shut down beside her but then his spell began to take hold of her the dark seething potency of him the power of a creature that lies hidden and exerts its will to the destruction of the freerunning creature as the tiger lying in the darkness of the leaves steadily enforces the fall and death of the light creatures that drink by the waterside in the morning gradually began to take effect on her though he lay there in his darkness and did not move yet she knew he lay waiting for her she felt his will fastening on her and pulling her down even whilst he was silent and obscure  she found that in all her outgoings and her incomings he prevented her gradually she realized that she was being borne down by him borne down by the clinging heavy weight of him that he was pulling her down as a leopard clings to a wild cow and exhausts her and pulls her down  gradually she realized that her life her freedom was sinking under the silent grip of his physical will he wanted her in his power he wanted to devour her at leisure to have her at length she realized that her sleep was a long ache and a weariness and exhaustion because of his will fastened upon her as he lay there beside her during the night  she realized it all and there came a momentous pause a pause in her swift running a moments suspension in her life when she was lost  then she turned fiercely on him and fought him he was not to do this to her it was monstrous what horrible hold did he want to have over her body why did he want to drag her down and kill her spirit why did he want to deny her spirit why did he deny her spirituality hold her for a body only and was he to claim her carcase  some vast hideous darkness he seemed to represent to her  what do you do to me she cried what beastly thing do you do to me you put a horrible pressure on my head you dont let me sleep you dont let me live every moment of your life you are doing something to me something horrible that destroys me there is something horrible in you something dark and beastly in your will what do you want of me what do you want to do to me  all the blood in his body went black and powerful and corrosive as he heard her black and blind with hatred of her he was he was in a very black hell and could not escape  he hated her for what she said did he not give her everything was she not everything to him and the shame was a bitter fire in him that she was everything to him that he had nothing but her and then that she should taunt him with it that he could not escape the fire went black in his veins for try as he might he could not escape she was everything to him she was his life and his derivation he depended on her if she were taken away he would collapse as a house from which the central pillar is removed  and she hated him because he depended on her so utterly he was horrible to her she wanted to thrust him off to set him apart it was horrible that he should cleave to her so close so close like leopard that had leapt on her and fastened  he went on from day to day in a blackness of rage and shame and frustration how he tortured himself to be able to get away from her but he could not she was as the rock on which he stood with deep heaving water all round and he was unable to swim he must take his stand on her he must depend on her  what had he in life save her nothing the rest was a great heaving flood the terror of the night of heaving overwhelming flood which was his vision of life without her was too much for him he clung to her fiercely and abjectly  and she beat him off she beat him off where could he turn like a swimmer in a dark sea beaten off from his hold whither could he turn he wanted to leave her he wanted to be able to leave her for his souls sake for his manhoods sake he must be able to leave her  but for what she was the ark and the rest of the world was flood the only tangible secure thing was the woman he could leave her only for another woman and where was the other woman and who was the other woman besides he would be just in the same state another woman would be woman the case would be the same  why was she the all the everything why must he live only through her why must he sink if he were detached from her why must he cleave to her in a frenzy as for his very life  the only other way to leave her was to die the only straight way to leave her was to die his dark raging soul knew that but he had no desire for death  why could he not leave her why could he not throw himself into the hidden water to live or die as might be he could not he could not but supposing he went away right away and found work and had a lodging again he could be again as he had been before  but he knew he could not a woman he must have a woman and having a woman he must be free of her it would be the same position for he could not be free of her  for how can a man stand unless he have something sure under his feet can a man tread the unstable water all his life and call that standing better give in and drown at once  and upon what could he stand save upon a woman was he then like the old man of the seas impotent to move save upon the back of another life was he impotent or a cripple or a defective or a fragment  it was black mad shameful torture the frenzy of fear the frenzy of desire and the horrible grasping backwash of shame  what was he afraid of why did life without anna seem to him just a horrible welter everything jostling in a meaningless dark fathomless flood why if anna left him even for a week did he seem to be clinging like a madman to the edge of reality and slipping surely surely into the flood of unreality that would drown him this horrible slipping into unreality drove him mad his soul screamed with fear and agony  yet she was pushing him off from her pushing him away breaking his fingers from their hold on her persistently ruthlessly he wanted her to have pity and sometimes for a moment she had pity but she always began again thrusting him off into the deep water into the frenzy and agony of uncertainty  she became like a fury to him without any sense of him her eyes were bright with a cold unmoving hatred then his heart seemed to die in its last fear she might push him off into the deeps  she would not sleep with him any more she said he destroyed her sleep up started all his frenzy and madness of fear and suffering she drove him away like a cowed lurking devil he was driven off his mind working cunningly against her devising evil for her but she drove him off in his moments of intense suffering she seemed to him inconceivable a monster the principle of cruelty  however her pity might give way for moments she was hard and cold as a jewel he must be put off from her she must sleep alone she made him a bed in the small room  and he lay there whipped his soul whipped almost to death yet unchanged he lay in agony of suffering thrown back into unreality like a man thrown overboard into a sea to swim till he sinks because there is no hold only a wide weltering sea  he did not sleep save for the white sleep when a thin veil is drawn over the mind it was not sleep he was awake and he was not awake he could not be alone he needed to be able to put his arms round her he could not bear the empty space against his breast where she used to be he could not bear it he felt as if he were suspended in space held there by the grip of his will if he relaxed his will would fall fall through endless space into the bottomless pit always falling willless helpless nonexistent just dropping to extinction falling till the fire of friction had burned out like a falling star then nothing nothing complete nothing  he rose in the morning grey and unreal and she seemed fond of him again she seemed to make up to him a little  i slept well she said with her slightly false brightness did you  all right he answered  he would never tell her  for three or four nights he lay alone through the white sleep his will unchanged unchanged still tense fixed in its grip then as if she were revived and free to be fond of him again deluded by his silence and seeming acquiescence moved also by pity she took him back again  each night in spite of all the shame he had waited with agony for bedtime to see if she would shut him out and each night as in her false brightness she said good night he felt he must kill her or himself but she asked for her kiss so pathetically so prettily so he kissed her whilst his heart was ice  and sometimes he went out once he sat for a long time in the church porch before going in to bed it was dark with a wind blowing he sat in the church porch and felt some shelter some security but it grew cold and he must go in to bed  then came the night when she said putting her arms round him and kissing him fondly  stay with me tonight will you  and he had stayed without demur but his will had not altered he would have her fixed to him  so that soon she told him again she must be alone  i dont want to send you away i want to sleep with you but i cant sleep you dont let me sleep  his blood turned black in his veins  what do you mean by such a thing its an arrant lie i dont let you sleep  but you dont i sleep so well when im alone and i cant sleep when youre there you do something to me you put a pressure on my head and i must sleep now the child is coming  its something in yourself he replied something wrong in you  horrible in the extreme were these nocturnal combats when all the world was asleep and they two were alone alone in the world and repelling each other it was hardly to be borne  he went and lay down alone and at length after a grey and livid and ghastly period he relaxed something gave way in him he let go he did not care what became of him strange and dim he became to himself to her to everybody a vagueness had come over everything like a drowning and it was an infinite relief to drown a relief a great great relief  he would insist no more he would force her no more he would force himself upon her no more he would let go relax lapse and what would be should be  yet he wanted her still he always always wanted her in his soul he was desolate as a child he was so helpless like a child on its mother he depended on her for his living he knew it and he knew he could hardly help it  yet he must be able to be alone he must be able to lie down alongside the empty space and let be he must be able to leave himself to the flood to sink or live as might be for he recognized at length his own limitation and the limitation of his power he had to give in  there was a stillness a wanness between them half at least of the battle was over sometimes she wept as she went about her heart was very heavy but the child was always warm in her womb  they were friends again new subdued friends but there was a wanness between them they slept together once more very quietly and distinct not one together as before and she was intimate with him as at first but he was very quiet and not intimate he was glad in his soul but for the time being he was not alive  he could sleep with her and let her be he could be alone now he had just learned what it was to be able to be alone it was right and peaceful she had given him a new deeper freedom the world might be a welter of uncertainty but he was himself now he had come into his own existence he was born for a second time born at last unto himself out of the vast body of humanity now at last he had a separate identity he existed alone even if he were not quite alone before he had only existed in so far as he had relations with another being now he had an absolute selfas well as a relative self  but it was a very dumb weak helpless self a crawling nursling he went about very quiet and in a way submissive he had an unalterable self at last free separate independent  she was relieved she was free of him she had given him to himself she wept sometimes with tiredness and helplessness but he was a husband and she seemed in the child that was coming to forget it seemed to make her warm and drowsy she lapsed into a long muse indistinct warm vague unwilling to be taken out of her vagueness and she rested on him also  sometimes she came to him with a strange light in her eyes poignant pathetic as if she were asking for something he looked and he could not understand she was so beautiful so visionary the rays seemed to go out of his breast to her like a shining he was there for her all for her and she would hold his breast and kiss it and kiss it kneeling beside him she who was waiting for the hour of her delivery and he would lie looking down at his breast till it seemed that his breast was not himself that he had left it lying there yet it was himself also and beautiful and bright with her kisses he was glad with a strange radiant pain whilst she kneeled beside him and kissed his breast with a slow rapt halfdevotional movement  he knew she wanted something his heart yearned to give it her his heart yearned over her and as she lifted her face that was radiant and rosy as a little cloud his heart still yearned over her and now from the distance adored her she had a flowerlike presence which he adored as he stood far off a stranger  the weeks passed on the time drew near they were very gentle and delicately happy the insistent passionate dark soul the powerful unsatisfaction in him seemed stilled and tamed the lion lay down with the lamb in him  she loved him very much indeed and he waited near her she was a precious remote thing to him at this time as she waited for her child her soul was glad with an ecstasy because of the coming infant she wanted a boy oh very much she wanted a boy  but she seemed so young and so frail she was indeed only a girl as she stood by the fire washing herselfshe was proud to wash herself at this timeand he looked at her his heart was full of extreme tenderness for her such fine fine limbs her slim round arms like chasing lights and her legs so simple and childish yet so very proud oh she stood on proud legs with a lovely reckless balance of her full belly and the adorable little roundnesses and the breasts becoming important above it all her face was like a rosy cloud shining  how proud she was what a lovely proud thing her young body and she loved him to put his hand on her ripe fullness so that he should thrill also with the stir and the quickening there he was afraid and silent but she flung her arms round his neck with proud impudent joy  the pains came on and ohhow she cried she would have him stay with her and after her long cries she would look at him with tears in her eyes and a sobbing laugh on her face saying  i dont mind it really  it was bad enough but to her it was never deathly even the fierce tearing pain was exhilarating she screamed and suffered but was all the time curiously alive and vital she felt so powerfully alive and in the hands of such a masterly force of life that her bottommost feeling was one of exhilaration she knew she was winning winning she was always winning with each onset of pain she was nearer to victory  probably he suffered more than she did he was not shocked or horrified but he was screwed very tight in the vise of suffering  it was a girl the second of silence on her face when they said so showed him she was disappointed and a great blazing passion of resentment and protest sprang up in his heart in that moment he claimed the child  but when the milk came and the infant sucked her breast she seemed to be leaping with extravagant bliss  it sucks me it sucks me it likes meoh it loves it she cried holding the child to her breast with her two hands covering it passionately  and in a few moments as she became used to her bliss she looked at the youth with glowing unseeing eyes and said  anna victrix  he went away trembling and slept to her her pains were the woundsmart of a victor she was the prouder  when she was well again she was very happy she called the baby ursula both anna and her husband felt they must have a name that gave them private satisfaction the baby was tawny skinned it had a curious downy skin and wisps of bronze hair and the yellow grey eyes that wavered and then became goldenbrown like the fathers so they called her ursula because of the picture of the saint  it was a rather delicate baby at first but soon it became stronger and was restless as a young eel anna was worn out with the daylong wrestling with its young vigour  as a little animal she loved and adored it and was happy she loved her husband she kissed his eyes and nose and mouth and made much of him she said his limbs were beautiful she was fascinated by the physical form of him  and she was indeed anna victrix he could not combat her any more he was out in the wilderness alone with her having occasion to go to london he marvelled as he returned thinking of naked lurking savages on an island how these had built up and created the great mass of oxford street or piccadilly how had helpless savages running with their spears on the riverside after fish how had they come to rear up this great london the ponderous massive ugly superstructure of a world of man upon a world of nature it frightened and awed him man was terrible awful in his works the works of man were more terrible than man himself almost monstrous  and yet for his own part for his private being brangwen felt that the whole of the mans world was exterior and extraneous to his own real life with anna sweep away the whole monstrous superstructure of the world of today cities and industries and civilization leave only the bare earth with plants growing and waters running and he would not mind so long as he were whole had anna and the child and the new strange certainty in his soul then if he were naked he would find clothing somewhere he would make a shelter and bring food to his wife  and what more what more would be necessary the great mass of activity in which mankind was engaged meant nothing to him by nature he had no part in it what did he live for then for anna only and for the sake of living what did he want on this earth anna only and his children and his life with his children and her was there no more  he was attended by a sense of something more something further which gave him absolute being it was as if now he existed in eternity let time be what it might what was there outside the fabricated world that he did not believe in what should he bring to her from outside nothing was it enough as it was he was troubled in his acquiescence she was not with him yet he scarcely believed in himself apart from her though the whole infinite was with him let the whole world slide down and over the edge of oblivion he would stand alone but he was unsure of her and he existed also in her so he was unsure  he hovered near to her never quite able to forget the vague haunting uncertainty that seemed to challenge him and which he would not hear a pang of dread almost guilt as of insufficiency would go over him as he heard her talking to the baby she stood before the window with the monthold child in her arms talking in a musical young singsong that he had not heard before and which rang on his heart like a claim from the distance or the voice of another world sounding its claim on him he stood near listening and his heart surged surged to rise and submit then it shrank back and stayed aloof he could not move a denial was upon him as if he could not deny himself he must he must be himself  look at the silly bluecaps my beauty she crooned holding up the infant to the window where shone the white garden and the bluetits scuffling in the snow look at the silly bluecaps my darling having a fight in the snow look at them my birdbeating the snow about with their wings and shaking their heads oh arent they wicked things wicked things look at their yellow feathers on the snow there theyll miss them wont they when theyre cold later on  must we tell them to stop must we say stop it to them my bird but they are naughty naughty look at them suddenly her voice broke loud and fierce she rapped the pane sharply  stop it she cried stop it you little nuisances stop it she called louder and rapped the pane more sharply her voice was fierce and imperative  have more sense she cried  there now theyre gone where have they gone the silly things what will they say to each other what will they say my lambkin theyll forget wont they theyll forget all about it out of their silly little heads and their blue caps  after a moment she turned her bright face to her husband  they were really fighting they were really fierce with each other she said her voice keen with excitement and wonder as if she belonged to the birds world were identified with the race of birds  ay theyll fight will bluecaps he said glad when she turned to him with her glow from elsewhere he came and stood beside her and looked out at the marks on the snow where the birds had scuffled and at the yew trees burdened white and black branches what was the appeal it made to him what was the question of her bright face what was the challenge he was called to answer he did not know but as he stood there he felt some responsibility which made him glad but uneasy as if he must put out his own light and he could not move as yet  anna loved the child very much oh very much yet still she was not quite fulfilled she had a slight expectant feeling as of a door half opened here she was safe and still in cossethay but she felt as if she were not in cossethay at all she was straining her eyes to something beyond and from her pisgah mount which she had attained what could she see a faint gleaming horizon a long way off and a rainbow like an archway a shadowdoor with faintly coloured coping above it must she be moving thither  something she had not something she did not grasp could not arrive at there was something beyond her but why must she start on the journey she stood so safely on the pisgah mountain  in the winter when she rose with the sunrise and out of the back windows saw the east flaming yellow and orange above the green glowing grass while the great pear tree in between stood dark and magnificent as an idol and under the dark pear tree the little sheet of water spread smooth in burnished yellow light she said it is here and when at evening the sunset came in a red glare through the big opening in the clouds she said again it is beyond  dawn and sunset were the feet of the rainbow that spanned the day and she saw the hope the promise why should she travel any further  yet she always asked the question as the sun went down in his fiery winter haste she faced the blazing close of the affair in which she had not played her fullest part and she made her demand still what are you doing making this big shining commotion what is it that you keep so busy about that you will not let us alone  she did not turn to her husband for him to lead her he was apart from her with her according to her different conceptions of him the child she might hold up she might toss the child forward into the furnace the child might walk there amid the burning coals and the incandescent roar of heat as the three witnesses walked with the angel in the fire  soon she felt sure of her husband she knew his dark face and the extent of its passion she knew his slim vigorous body she said it was hers then there was no denying her she was a rich woman enjoying her riches  and soon again she was with child which made her satisfied and took away her discontent she forgot that she had watched the sun climb up and pass his way a magnificent traveller surging forward she forgot that the moon had looked through a window of the high dark night and nodded like a magic recognition signalled to her to follow sun and moon travelled on and left her passed her by a rich woman enjoying her riches she should go also but she could not go when they called because she must stay at home now with satisfaction she relinquished the adventure to the unknown she was bearing her children  there was another child coming and anna lapsed into vague content if she were not the wayfarer to the unknown if she were arrived now settled in her builded house a rich woman still her doors opened under the arch of the rainbow her threshold reflected the passing of the sun and moon the great travellers her house was full of the echo of journeying  she was a door and a threshold she herself through her another soul was coming to stand upon her as upon the threshold looking out shading its eyes for the direction to take    chapter vii  the cathedral  during the first year of her marriage before ursula was born anna brangwen and her husband went to visit her mothers friend the baron skrebensky the latter had kept a slight connection with annas mother and had always preserved some officious interest in the young girl because she was a pure pole  when baron skrebensky was about forty years old his wife died and left him raving disconsolate lydia had visited him then taking anna with her it was when the girl was fourteen years old since then she had not seen him she remembered him as a small sharp clergyman who cried and talked and terrified her whilst her mother was most strangely consoling in a foreign language  the little baron never quite approved of anna because she spoke no polish still he considered himself in some way her guardian on lenskys behalf and he presented her with some old heavy russian jewellery the least valuable of his wifes relics then he lapsed out of the brangwens life again though he lived only about thirty miles away  three years later came the startling news that he had married a young english girl of good family everybody marvelled then came a copy of the history of the parish of briswell by rudolph baron skrebensky vicar of briswell it was a curious book incoherent full of interesting exhumations it was dedicated to my wife millicent maud pearse in whom i embrace the generous spirit of england  if he embraces no more than the spirit of england said tom brangwen its a bad lookout for him  but paying a formal visit with his wife he found the new baroness a little creamyskinned insidious thing with redbrown hair and a mouth that one must always watch because it curved back continually in an incomprehensible strange laugh that exposed her rather prominent teeth she was not beautiful yet tom brangwen was immediately under her spell she seemed to snuggle like a kitten within his warmth whilst she was at the same time elusive and ironical suggesting the fine steel of her claws  the baron was almost dotingly courteous and attentive to her she almost mockingly yet quite happy let him dote curious little thing she was she had the soft creamy elusive beauty of a ferret tom brangwen was quite at a loss at her mercy and she laughed a little breathlessly as if tempted to cruelty she did put fine torments on the elderly baron  when some months later she bore a son the baron skrebensky was loud with delight  gradually she gathered a circle of acquaintances in the county for she was of good family half venetian educated in dresden the little foreign vicar attained to a social status which almost satisfied his maddened pride  therefore the brangwens were surprised when the invitation came for anna and her young husband to pay a visit to briswell vicarage for the skrebenskys were now moderately well off millicent skrebensky having some fortune of her own  anna took her best clothes recovered her best highschool manner and arrived with her husband will brangwen ruddy bright with long limbs and a small head like some uncouth bird was not changed in the least the little baroness was smiling showing her teeth she had a real charm a kind of joyous coldness laughing delighted like some weasel anna at once respected her and was on her guard before her instinctively attracted by the strange childlike surety of the baroness yet mistrusting it fascinated the little baron was now quite whitehaired very brittle he was wizened and wrinkled yet fiery unsubdued anna looked at his lean body at his small fine lean legs and lean hands as he sat talking and she flushed she recognized the quality of the male in him his lean concentrated age his informed fire his faculty for sharp deliberate response he was so detached so purely objective a woman was thoroughly outside him there was no confusion so he could give that fine deliberate response  he was something separate and interesting his hard intrinsic being whittled down by age to an essentiality and a directness almost deathlike cruel was yet so unswervingly sure in its action so distinct in its surety that she was attracted to him she watched his cool hard separate fire fascinated by it would she rather have it than her husbands diffuse heat than his blind hot youth  she seemed to be breathing high sharp air as if she had just come out of a hot room these strange skrebenskys made her aware of another freer element in which each person was detached and isolated was not this her natural element was not the close brangwen life stifling her  meanwhile the little baroness with always a subtle light stirring of her full lustrous hazel eyes was playing with will brangwen he was not quick enough to see all her movements yet he watched her steadily with unchanging litup eyes she was a strange creature to him but she had no power over him she flushed and was irritated yet she glanced again and again at his dark living face curiously as if she despised him she despised his uncritical unironical nature it had nothing for her yet it angered her as if she were jealous he watched her with deferential interest as he would watch a stoat playing but he himself was not implicated he was different in kind she was all lambent biting flames he was a red fire glowing steadily she could get nothing out of him so she made him flush darkly by assuming a biting subtle classsuperiority he flushed but still he did not object he was too different  her little boy came in with the nurse he was a quick slight child with fine perceptiveness and a cool transitoriness in his interest at once he treated will brangwen as an outsider he stayed by anna for a moment acknowledged her then was gone again quick observant restless with a glance of interest at everything  the father adored him and spoke to him in polish it was queer the stiff aristocratic manner of the father with the child the distance in the relationship the classic fatherhood on the one hand the filial subordination on the other they played together in their different degrees very separate two different beings differing as it were in rank rather than in relationship and the baroness smiled smiled smiled always smiled showing her rather protruding teeth having always a mysterious attraction and charm  anna realized how different her own life might have been how different her own living her soul stirred she became as another person her intimacy with her husband passed away the curious enveloping brangwen intimacy so warm so close so stifling when one seemed always to be in contact with the other person like a bloodrelation was annulled she denied it this close relationship with her young husband he and she were not one his heat was not always to suffuse her suffuse her through her mind and her individuality till she was of one heat with him till she had not her own self apart she wanted her own life he seemed to lap her and suffuse her with his being his hot life till she did not know whether she were herself or whether she were another creature united with him in a world of close bloodintimacy that closed over her and excluded her from all the cool outside  she wanted her own old sharp self detached detached active but not absorbed active for her own part taking and giving but never absorbed whereas he wanted this strange absorption with her which still she resisted but she was partly helpless against it she had lived so long in tom brangwens love beforehand  from the skrebenskys they went to will brangwens beloved lincoln cathedral because it was not far off he had promised her that one by one they should visit all the cathedrals of england they began with lincoln which he knew well  he began to get excited as the time drew near to set off what was it that changed him so much she was almost angry coming as she did from the skrebenskys but now he ran on alone his very breast seemed to open its doors to watch for the great church brooding over the town his soul ran ahead  when he saw the cathedral in the distance dark blue lifted watchful in the sky his heart leapt it was the sign in heaven it was the spirit hovering like a dove like an eagle over the earth he turned his glowing ecstatic face to her his mouth opened with a strange ecstatic grin  there she is he said  the she irritated her why she it was it what was the cathedral a big building a thing of the past obsolete to excite him to such a pitch she began to stir herself to readiness  they passed up the steep hill he eager as a pilgrim arriving at the shrine as they came near the precincts with castle on one side and cathedral on the other his veins seemed to break into fiery blossom he was transported  they had passed through the gate and the great west front was before them with all its breadth and ornament  it is a false front he said looking at the golden stone and the twin towers and loving them just the same in a little ecstasy he found himself in the porch on the brink of the unrevealed he looked up to the lovely unfolding of the stone he was to pass within to the perfect womb  then he pushed open the door and the great pillared gloom was before him in which his soul shuddered and rose from her nest his soul leapt soared up into the great church his body stood still absorbed by the height his soul leapt up into the gloom into possession it reeled it swooned with a great escape it quivered in the womb in the hush and the gloom of fecundity like seed of procreation in ecstasy  she too was overcome with wonder and awe she followed him in his progress here the twilight was the very essence of life the coloured darkness was the embryo of all light and the day here the very first dawn was breaking the very last sunset sinking and the immemorial darkness whereof lifes day would blossom and fall away again reechoed peace and profound immemorial silence  away from time always outside of time between east and west between dawn and sunset the church lay like a seed in silence dark before germination silenced after death containing birth and death potential with all the noise and transition of life the cathedral remained hushed a great involved seed whereof the flower would be radiant life inconceivable but whose beginning and whose end were the circle of silence spanned round with the rainbow the jewelled gloom folded music upon silence light upon darkness fecundity upon death as a seed folds leaf upon leaf and silence upon the root and the flower hushing up the secret of all between its parts the death out of which it fell the life into which it has dropped the immortality it involves and the death it will embrace again  here in the church before and after were folded together all was contained in oneness brangwen came to his consummation out of the doors of the womb he had come putting aside the wings of the womb and proceeding into the light through daylight and dayafterday he had come knowledge after knowledge and experience after experience remembering the darkness of the womb having prescience of the darkness after death then betweenwhile he had pushed open the doors of the cathedral and entered the twilight of both darkness the hush of the twofold silence where dawn was sunset and the beginning and the end were one  here the stone leapt up from the plain of earth leapt up in a manifold clustered desire each time up away from the horizontal earth through twilight and dusk and the whole range of desire through the swerving the declination ah to the ecstasy the touch to the meeting and the consummation the meeting the clasp the close embrace the neutrality the perfect swooning consummation the timeless ecstasy there his soul remained at the apex of the arch clinched in the timeless ecstasy consummated  and there was no time nor life nor death but only this this timeless consummation where the thrust from earth met the thrust from earth and the arch was locked on the keystone of ecstasy this was all this was everything till he came to himself in the world below then again he gathered himself together in transit every jet of him strained and leaped leaped clear into the darkness above to the fecundity and the unique mystery to the touch the clasp the consummation the climax of eternity the apex of the arch  she too was overcome but silenced rather than tuned to the place she loved it as a world not quite her own she resented his transports and ecstasies his passion in the cathedral at first awed her then made her angry after all there was the sky outside and in here in this mysterious halfnight when his soul leapt with the pillars upwards it was not to the stars and the crystalline dark space but to meet and clasp with the answering impulse of leaping stone there in the dusk and secrecy of the roof the faroff clinching and mating of the arches the leap and thrust of the stone carrying a great roof overhead awed and silenced her  but yetyet she remembered that the open sky was no blue vault no dark dome hung with many twinkling lamps but a space where stars were wheeling in freedom with freedom above them always higher  the cathedral roused her too but she would never consent to the knitting of all the leaping stone in a great roof that closed her in and beyond which was nothing nothing it was the ultimate confine his soul would have liked it to be so here here is all complete eternal motion meeting ecstasy and no illusion of time of night and day passing by but only perfectly proportioned space and movement clinching and renewing and passion surging its way into great waves to the altar recurrence of ecstasy  her soul too was carried forward to the altar to the threshold of eternity in reverence and fear and joy but ever she hung back in the transit mistrusting the culmination of the altar she was not to be flung forward on the lift and lift of passionate flights to be cast at last upon the altar steps as upon the shore of the unknown there was a great joy and a verity in it but even in the dazed swoon of the cathedral she claimed another right the altar was barren its lights gone out god burned no more in that bush it was dead matter lying there she claimed the right to freedom above her higher than the roof she had always a sense of being roofed in  so that she caught at little things which saved her from being swept forward headlong in the tide of passion that leaps on into the infinite in a great mass triumphant and flinging its own course she wanted to get out of this fixed leaping forwardtravelling movement to rise from it as a bird rises with wet limp feet from the sea to lift herself as a bird lifts its breast and thrusts its body from the pulse and heave of a sea that bears it forward to an unwilling conclusion tear herself away like a bird on wings and in open space where there is clarity rise up above the fixed surcharged motion a separate speck that hangs suspended moves this way and that seeing and answering before it sinks again having chosen or found the direction in which it shall be carried forward  and it was as if she must grasp at something as if her wings were too weak to lift her straight off the heaving motion so she caught sight of the wicked odd little faces carved in stone and she stood before them arrested  these sly little faces peeped out of the grand tide of the cathedral like something that knew better they knew quite well these little imps that retorted on mans own illusion that the cathedral was not absolute they winked and leered giving suggestion of the many things that had been left out of the great concept of the church however much there is inside here theres a good deal they havent got in the little faces mocked  apart from the lift and spring of the great impulse towards the altar these little faces had separate wills separate motions separate knowledge which rippled back in defiance of the tide and laughed in triumph of their own very littleness  oh look cried anna oh look how adorable the faces look at her  brangwen looked unwillingly this was the voice of the serpent in his eden she pointed him to a plump sly malicious little face carved in stone  he knew her the man who carved her said anna im sure she was his wife  it isnt a woman at all its a man said brangwen curtly  do you think sono that isnt a man that is no mans face  her voice sounded rather jeering he laughed shortly and went on but she would not go forward with him she loitered about the carvings and he could not go forward without her he waited impatient of this counteraction she was spoiling his passionate intercourse with the cathedral his brows began to gather  oh this is good she cried again here is the same womanlookonly hes made her cross isnt it lovely hasnt he made her hideous to a degree she laughed with pleasure didnt he hate her he must have been a nice man look at herisnt it awfully goodjust like a shrewish woman he must have enjoyed putting her in like that he got his own back on her didnt he  its a mans face no womans at alla monksclean shaven he said  she laughed with a pouf of laughter  you hate to think he put his wife in your cathedral dont you she mocked with a tinkle of profane laughter and she laughed with malicious triumph  she had got free from the cathedral she had even destroyed the passion he had she was glad he was bitterly angry strive as he would he could not keep the cathedral wonderful to him he was disillusioned that which had been his absolute containing all heaven and earth was become to him as to her a shapely heap of dead matterbut dead dead  his mouth was full of ash his soul was furious he hated her for having destroyed another of his vital illusions soon he would be stark stark without one place wherein to stand without one belief in which to rest  yet somewhere in him he responded more deeply to the sly little face that knew better than he had done before to the perfect surge of his cathedral  nevertheless for the time being his soul was wretched and homeless and he could not bear to think of annas ousting him from his beloved realities he wanted his cathedral he wanted to satisfy his blind passion and he could not any more something intervened  they went home again both of them altered she had some new reverence for that which he wanted he felt that his cathedrals would never again be to him as they had been before he had thought them absolute but now he saw them crouching under the sky with still the dark mysterious world of reality inside but as a world within a world a sort of side show whereas before they had been as a world to him within a chaos a reality an order an absolute within a meaningless confusion  he had felt before that could he but go through the great door and look down the gloom towards the faroff concluding wonder of the altar that then with the windows suspended around like tablets of jewels emanating their own glory then he had arrived here the satisfaction he had yearned after came near towards this the porch of the great unknown all reality gathered and there the altar was the mystic door through which all and everything must move on to eternity  but now somehow sadly and disillusioned he realized that the doorway was no doorway it was too narrow it was false outside the cathedral were many flying spirits that could never be sifted through the jewelled gloom he had lost his absolute  he listened to the thrushes in the gardens and heard a note which the cathedrals did not include something free and careless and joyous he crossed a field that was all yellow with dandelions on his way to work and the bath of yellow glowing was something at once so sumptuous and so fresh that he was glad he was away from his shadowy cathedral  there was life outside the church there was much that the church did not include he thought of god and of the whole blue rotunda of the day that was something great and free he thought of the ruins of the grecian worship and it seemed a temple was never perfectly a temple till it was ruined and mixed up with the winds and the sky and the herbs  still he loved the church as a symbol he loved it he tended it for what it tried to represent rather than for that which it did represent still he loved it the little church across his gardenwall drew him he gave it loving attention but he went to take charge of it to preserve it it was as an old sacred thing to him he looked after the stone and woodwork mending the organ and restoring a piece of broken carving repairing the church furniture later he became choirmaster also  his life was shifting its centre becoming more superficial he had failed to become really articulate failed to find real expression he had to continue in the old form but in spirit he was uncreated  anna was absorbed in the child now she left her husband to take his own way she was willing now to postpone all adventure into unknown realities she had the child her palpable and immediate future was the child if her soul had found no utterance her womb had  the church that neighboured with his house became very intimate and dear to him he cherished it he had it entirely in his charge if he could find no new activity he would be happy cherishing the old dear form of worship he knew this little whitewashed church in its shadowy atmosphere he sank back into being he liked to sink himself in its hush as a stone sinks into water  he went across his garden mounted the wall by the little steps and entered the hush and peace of the church as the heavy door clanged to behind him his feet reechoed in the aisle his heart reechoed with a little passion of tenderness and mystic peace he was also slightly ashamed like a man who has failed who lapses back for his fulfilment  he loved to light the candles at the organ and sitting there alone in the little glow practice the hymns and chants for the service the whitewashed arches retreated into darkness the sound of the organ and the organpedals died away upon the unalterable stillness of the church there were faint ghostly noises in the tower and then the music swelled out again loudly triumphantly  he ceased to fret about his life he relaxed his will and let everything go what was between him and his wife was a great thing if it was not everything she had conquered really let him wait and abide wait and abide she and the baby and himself they were one the organ rang out his protestation his soul lay in the darkness as he pressed the keys of the organ  to anna the baby was a complete bliss and fulfilment her desires sank into abeyance her soul was in bliss over the baby it was rather a delicate child she had trouble to rear it she never for a moment thought it would die it was a delicate infant therefore it behoved her to make it strong she threw herself into the labour the child was everything her imagination was all occupied here she was a mother it was enough to handle the new little limbs the new little body hear the new little voice crying in the stillness all the future rang to her out of the sound of the babys crying and cooing she balanced the coming years of life in her hands as she nursed the child the passionate sense of fulfilment of the future germinated in her made her vivid and powerful all the future was in her hands in the hands of the woman and before this baby was ten months old she was again with child she seemed to be in the fecund of storm life every moment was full and busy with productiveness to her she felt like the earth the mother of everything  brangwen occupied himself with the church he played the organ he trained the choirboys he taught a sundayschool class of youths he was happy enough there was an eager yearning kind of happiness in him as he taught the boys on sundays he was all the time exciting himself with the proximity of some secret that he had not yet fathomed  in the house he served his wife and the little matriarchy she loved him because he was the father of her children and she always had a physical passion for him so he gave up trying to have the spiritual superiority and control or even her respect for his conscious or public life he lived simply by her physical love for him and he served the little matriarchy nursing the child and helping with the housework indifferent any more of his own dignity and importance but his abandoning of claims his living isolated upon his own interest made him seem unreal unimportant  anna was not publicly proud of him but very soon she learned to be indifferent to public life he was not what is called a manly man he did not drink or smoke or arrogate importance but he was her man and his very indifference to all claims of manliness set her supreme in her own world with him physically she loved him and he satisfied her he went alone and subsidiary always at first it had irritated her the outer world existed so little to him looking at him with outside eyes she was inclined to sneer at him but her sneer changed to a sort of respect she respected him that he could serve her so simply and completely above all she loved to bear his children she loved to be the source of children  she could not understand him his strange dark rages and his devotion to the church it was the church building he cared for and yet his soul was passionate for something he laboured cleaning the stonework repairing the woodwork restoring the organ and making the singing as perfect as possible to keep the church fabric and the churchritual intact was his business to have the intimate sacred building utterly in his own hands and to make the form of service complete there was a little bright anguish and tension on his face and in his intent movements he was like a lover who knows he is betrayed but who still loves whose love is only the more intense the church was false but he served it the more attentively  during the day at his work in the office he kept himself suspended he did not exist he worked automatically till it was time to go home  he loved with a hot heart the darkhaired little ursula and he waited for the child to come to consciousness now the mother monopolized the baby but his heart waited in its darkness his hour would come  in the long run he learned to submit to anna she forced him to the spirit of her laws whilst leaving him the letter of his own she combated in him his devils she suffered very much from his inexplicable and incalculable dark rages when a blackness filled him and a black wind seemed to sweep out of existence everything that had to do with him she could feel herself everything being annihilated by him  at first she fought him at night in this state he would kneel down to say his prayers she looked at his crouching figure  why are you kneeling there pretending to pray she said harshly do you think anybody can pray when they are in the vile temper you are in  he remained crouching by the beside motionless  its horrible she continued and such a pretence what do you pretend you are saying who do you pretend you are praying to  he still remained motionless seething with inchoate rage when his whole nature seemed to disintegrate he seemed to live with a strain upon himself and occasionally came these dark chaotic rages the lust for destruction she then fought with him and their fights were horrible murderous and then the passion between them came just as black and awful  but little by little as she learned to love him better she would put herself aside and when she felt one of his fits upon him would ignore him successfully leave him in his world whilst she remained in her own he had a black struggle with himself to come back to her for at last he learned that he would be in hell until he came back to her so he struggled to submit to her and she was afraid of the ugly strain in his eyes she made love to him and took him then he was grateful to her love humble  he made himself a woodwork shed in which to restore things which were destroyed in the church so he had plenty to do his wife his child the church the woodwork and his wageearning all occupying him if only there were not some limit to him some darkness across his eyes he had to give in to it at last himself he must submit to his own inadequacy aware of some limit to himself of something unformed in his own black violent temper and to reckon with it but as she was more gentle with him it became quieter  as he sat sometimes very still with a bright vacant face anna could see the suffering among the brightness he was aware of some limit to himself of something unformed in his very being of some buds which were not ripe in him some folded centres of darkness which would never develop and unfold whilst he was alive in the body he was unready for fulfilment something undeveloped in him limited him there was a darkness in him which he could not unfold which would never unfold in him    chapter viii  the child  from the first the baby stirred in the young father a deep strong emotion he dared scarcely acknowledge it was so strong and came out of the dark of him when he heard the child cry a terror possessed him because of the answering echo from the unfathomed distances in himself must he know in himself such distances perilous and imminent  he had the infant in his arms he walked backwards and forwards troubled by the crying of his own flesh and blood this was his own flesh and blood crying his soul rose against the voice suddenly breaking out from him from the distances in him  sometimes in the night the child cried and cried when the night was heavy and sleep oppressed him and half asleep he stretched out his hand to put it over the babys face to stop the crying but something arrested his hand the very inhumanness of the intolerable continuous crying arrested him it was so impersonal without cause or object yet he echoed to it directly his soul answered its madness it filled him with terror almost with frenzy  he learned to acquiesce to this to submit to the awful obliterated sources which were the origin of his living tissue he was not what he conceived himself to be then he was what he was unknown potent dark  he became accustomed to the child he knew how to lift and balance the little body the baby had a beautiful rounded head that moved him passionately he would have fought to the last drop to defend that exquisite perfect round head  he learned to know the little hands and feet the strange unseeing goldenbrown eyes the mouth that opened only to cry or to suck or to show a queer toothless laugh he could almost understand even the dangling legs which at first had created in him a feeling of aversion they could kick in their queer little way they had their own softness  one evening suddenly he saw the tiny living thing rolling naked in the mothers lap and he was sick it was so utterly helpless and vulnerable and extraneous in a world of hard surfaces and varying altitudes it lay vulnerable and naked at every point yet it was quite blithe and yet in its blind awful crying was there not the blind faroff terror of its own vulnerable nakedness the terror of being so utterly delivered over helpless at every point he could not bear to hear it crying his heart strained and stood on guard against the whole universe  but he waited for the dread of these days to pass he saw the joy coming he saw the lovely creamy cool little ear of the baby a bit of dark hair rubbed to a bronze floss like bronzedust and he waited for the child to become his to look at him and answer him  it had a separate being but it was his own child his flesh and blood vibrated to it he caught the baby to his breast with his passionate clapping laugh and the infant knew him  as the newlyopened newlydawned eyes looked at him he wanted them to perceive him to recognize him then he was verified the child knew him a queer contortion of laughter came on its face for him he caught it to his breast clapping with a triumphant laugh  the goldenbrown eyes of the child gradually lit up and dilated at the sight of the darkglowing face of the youth it knew its mother better it wanted its mother more but the brightest sharpest little ecstasy was for the father  it began to be strong to move vigorously and freely to make sounds like words it was a baby girl now already it knew his strong hands it exulted in his strong clasp it laughed and crowed when he played with it  and his heart grew redhot with passionate feeling for the child she was not much more than a year old when the second baby was born then he took ursula for his own she his first little girl he had set his heart on her  the second had dark blue eyes and a fair skin it was more a brangwen people said the hair was fair but they forgot annas stiff blonde fleece of childhood they called the newcomer gudrun  this time anna was stronger and not so eager she did not mind that the baby was not a boy it was enough that she had milk and could suckle her child oh oh the bliss of the little life sucking the milk of her body oh oh oh the bliss as the infant grew stronger of the two tiny hands clutching catching blindly yet passionately at her breast of the tiny mouth seeking her in blind sure vital knowledge of the sudden consummate peace as the little body sank the mouth and throat sucking sucking sucking drinking life from her to make a new life almost sobbing with passionate joy of receiving its own existence the tiny hands clutching frantically as the nipple was drawn back not to be gainsaid this was enough for anna she seemed to pass off into a kind of rapture of motherhood her rapture of motherhood was everything  so that the father had the elder baby the weaned child the goldenbrown wondering vivid eyes of the little ursula were for him who had waited behind the mother till the need was for him the mother felt a sharp stab of jealousy but she was still more absorbed in the tiny baby it was entirely hers its need was direct upon her  so ursula became the child of her fathers heart she was the little blossom he was the sun he was patient energetic inventive for her he taught her all the funny little things he filled her and roused her to her fullest tiny measure she answered him with her extravagant infants laughter and her call of delight  now there were two babies a woman came in to do the housework anna was wholly nurse two babies were not too much for her but she hated any form of work now her children had come except the charge of them  when ursula toddled about she was an absorbed busy child always amusing herself needing not much attention from other people at evening towards six oclock anna very often went across the lane to the stile lifted ursula over into the field with a go and meet daddy then brangwen coming up the steep round of the hill would see before him on the brow of the path a tiny tottering windblown little mite with a dark head who as soon as she saw him would come running in tiny wild windmill fashion lifting her arms up and down to him down the steep hill his heart leapt up he ran his fastest to her to catch her because he knew she would fall she came fluttering on wildly with her little limbs flying and he was glad when he caught her up in his arms once she fell as she came flying to him he saw her pitch forward suddenly as she was running with her hands lifted to him and when he picked her up her mouth was bleeding he could never bear to think of it he always wanted to cry even when he was an old man and she had become a stranger to him how he loved that little ursulahis heart had been sharply seared for her when he was a youth first married  when she was a little older he would see her recklessly climbing over the bars of the stile in her red pinafore swinging in peril and tumbling over picking herself up and flitting towards him sometimes she liked to ride on his shoulder sometimes she preferred to walk with his hand sometimes she would fling her arms round his legs for a moment then race free again whilst he went shouting and calling to her a child along with her he was still only a tall thin unsettled lad of twentytwo  it was he who had made her her cradle her little chair her little stool her high chair it was he who would swing her up to table or who would make for her a doll out of an old tableleg whilst she watched him saying  make her eyes daddy make her eyes  and he made her eyes with his knife  she was very fond of adorning herself so he would tie a piece of cotton round her ear and hang a blue bead on it underneath for an earring the earrings varied with a red bead and a golden bead and a little pearl bead and as he came home at night seeing her bridling and looking very selfconscious he took notice and said  so youre wearing your best golden and pearl earrings today  yes  i suppose youve been to see the queen  yes i have  oh and what had she to say  she saidshe saidyou wont dirty your nice white frock  he gave her the nicest bits from his plate putting them into her red moist mouth and he would make on a piece of breadandbutter a bird out of jam which she ate with extraordinary relish  after the teathings were washed up the woman went away leaving the family free usually brangwen helped in the bathing of the children he held long discussions with his child as she sat on his knee and he unfastened her clothes and he seemed to be talking really of momentous things deep moralities then suddenly she ceased to hear having caught sight of a glassie rolled into a corner she slipped away and was in no hurry to return  come back here he said waiting she became absorbed taking no notice  come on he repeated with a touch of command  an excited little chuckle came from her but she pretended to be absorbed  do you hear milady  she turned with a fleeting exulting laugh he rushed on her and swept her up  who was it that didnt come he said rolling her between his strong hands tickling her and she laughed heartily heartily she loved him that he compelled her with his strength and decision he was allpowerful the tower of strength which rose out of her sight  when the children were in bed sometimes anna and he sat and talked desultorily both of them idle he read very little anything he was drawn to read became a burning reality to him another scene outside his window whereas anna skimmed through a book to see what happened then she had enough  therefore they would often sit together talking desultorily what was really between them they could not utter their words were only accidents in the mutual silence when they talked they gossiped she did not care for sewing  she had a beautiful way of sitting musing gratefully as if her heart were lit up sometimes she would turn to him laughing to tell him some little thing that had happened during the day then he would laugh they would talk awhile before the vital physical silence was between them again  she was thin but full of colour and life she was perfectly happy to do just nothing only to sit with a curious languid dignity so careless as to be almost regal so utterly indifferent so confident the bond between them was undefinable but very strong it kept everyone else at a distance  his face never changed whilst she knew him it only became more intense it was ruddy and dark in its abstraction not very human it had a strong intent brightness sometimes when his eyes met hers a yellow flash from them caused a darkness to swoon over her consciousness electric and a slight strange laugh came on his face her eyes would turn languidly then close as if hypnotized and they lapsed into the same potent darkness he had the quality of a young black cat intent unnoticeable and yet his presence gradually made itself felt stealthily and powerfully took hold of her he called not to her but to something in her which responded subtly out of her unconscious darkness  so they were together in a darkness passionate electric for ever haunting the back of the common day never in the light in the light he seemed to sleep unknowing only she knew him when the darkness set him free and he could see with his goldglowing eyes his intention and his desires in the dark then she was in a spell then she answered his harsh penetrating call with a soft leap of her soul the darkness woke up electric bristling with an unknown overwhelming insinuation  by now they knew each other she was the daytime the daylight he was the shadow put aside but in the darkness potent with an overwhelming voluptuousness  she learned not to dread and to hate him but to fill herself with him to give herself to his black sensual power that was hidden all the daytime and the curious rolling of the eyes as if she were lapsing in a trance away from her ordinary consciousness became habitual with her when something threatened and opposed her in life the conscious life  so they remained as separate in the light and in the thick darkness married he supported her daytime authority kept it inviolable at last and she in all the darkness belonged to him to his close insinuating hypnotic familiarity  all his daytime activity all his public life was a kind of sleep she wanted to be free to belong to the day and he ran avoiding the day in work after tea he went to the shed to his carpentry or his woodcarving he was restoring the patched degraded pulpit to its original form  but he loved to have the child near him playing by his feet she was a piece of light that really belonged to him that played within his darkness he left the shed door on the latch and when with his second sense of another presence he knew she was coming he was satisfied he was at rest when he was alone with her he did not want to take notice to talk he wanted to live unthinking with her presence flickering upon him  he always went in silence the child would push open the shed door and see him working by lamplight his sleeves rolled back his clothes hung about him carelessly like mere wrapping inside his body was concentrated with a flexible charged power all of its own isolated from when she was a tiny child ursula could remember his forearm with its fine black hairs and its electric flexibility working at the bench through swift unnoticeable movements always ambushed in a sort of silence  she hung a moment in the door of the shed waiting for him to notice her he turned his black curved eyebrows arching slightly  hullo twittermiss  and he closed the door behind her then the child was happy in the shed that smelled of sweet wood and resounded to the noise of the plane or the hammer or the saw yet was charged with the silence of the worker she played on intent and absorbed among the shavings and the little nogs of wood she never touched him his feet and legs were near she did not approach them  she liked to flit out after him when he was going to church at night if he were going to be alone he swung her over the wall and let her come  again she was transported when the door was shut behind them and they two inherited the big pale void place she would watch him as he lit the organ candles wait whilst he began his practicing his tunes then she ran foraging here and there like a kitten playing by herself in the darkness with eyes dilated the ropes hung vaguely twining on the floor from the bells in the tower and ursula always wanted the fluffy redandwhite or blueandwhite ropegrips but they were above her  sometimes her mother came to claim her then the child was seized with resentment she passionately resented her mothers superficial authority she wanted to assert her own detachment  he however also gave her occasional cruel shocks he let her play about in the church she rifled footstools and hymnbooks and cushions like a bee among flowers whilst the organ echoed away this continued for some weeks then the charwoman worked herself up into a frenzy of rage to dare to attack brangwen and one day descended on him like a harpy he wilted away and wanted to break the old beasts neck  instead he came glowering in fury to the house and turned on ursula  why you tiresome little monkey cant you even come to church without pulling the place to bits  his voice was harsh and catlike he was blind to the child she shrank away in childish anguish and dread what was it what awful thing was it  the mother turned with her calm almost superb manner  what has she done then  done she shall go in the church no more pulling and littering and destroying  the wife slowly rolled her eyes and lowered her eyelids  what has she destroyed then  he did not know  ive just had mrs wilkinson at me he cried with a list of things shes done  ursula withered under the contempt and anger of the she as he spoke of her  send mrs wilkinson here to me with a list of the things shes done said anna i am the one to hear that  its not the things the child has done continued the mother that have put you out so much its because you cant bear being spoken to by that old woman but you havent the courage to turn on her when she attacks you you bring your rage here  he relapsed into silence ursula knew that he was wrong in the outside upper world he was wrong already came over the child the cold sense of the impersonal world there she knew her mother was right but still her heart clamoured after her father for him to be right in his dark sensuous underworld but he was angry and went his way in blackness and brutal silence again  the child ran about absorbed in life quiet full of amusement she did not notice things nor changes nor alterations one day she would find daisies in the grass another day appleblossoms would be sprinkled white on the ground and she would run among it for pleasure because it was there yet again birds would be pecking at the cherries her father would throw cherries down from the tree all round her on the garden then the fields were full of hay  she did not remember what had been nor what would be the outside things were there each day she was always herself the world outside was accidental even her mother was accidental to her a condition that happened to endure  only her father occupied any permanent position in the childish consciousness when he came back she remembered vaguely how he had gone away when he went away she knew vaguely that she must wait for his coming back whereas her mother returning from an outing merely became present there was no reason for connecting her with some previous departure  the return or the departure of the father was the one event which the child remembered when he came something woke up in her some yearning she knew when he was out of joint or irritable or tired then she was uneasy she could not rest  when he was in the house the child felt full and warm rich like a creature in the sunshine when he was gone she was vague forgetful when he scolded her even she was often more aware of him than of herself he was her strength and her greater self  ursula was three years old when another baby girl was born then the two small sisters were much together gudrun and ursula gudrun was a quiet child who played for hours alone absorbed in her fancies she was brownhaired fairskinned strangely placid almost passive yet her will was indomitable once set from the first she followed ursulas lead yet she was a thing to herself so that to watch the two together was strange they were like two young animals playing together but not taking real notice of each other gudrun was the mothers favouriteexcept that anna always lived in her latest baby  the burden of so many lives depending on him wore the youth down he had his work in the office which was done purely by effort of will he had his barren passion for the church he had three young children also at this time his health was not good so he was haggard and irritable often a pest in the house then he was told to go to his woodwork or to the church  between him and the little ursula there came into being a strange alliance they were aware of each other he knew the child was always on his side but in his consciousness he counted it for nothing she was always for him he took it for granted yet his life was based on her even whilst she was a tiny child on her support and her accord  anna continued in her violent trance of motherhood always busy often harassed but always contained in her trance of motherhood she seemed to exist in her own violent fruitfulness and it was as if the sun shone tropically on her her colour was bright her eyes full of a fecund gloom her brown hair tumbled loosely over her ears she had a look of richness no responsibility no sense of duty troubled her the outside public life was less than nothing to her really  whereas when at twentysix he found himself father of four children with a wife who lived intrinsically like the ruddiest lilies of the field he let the weight of responsibility press on him and drag him it was then that his child ursula strove to be with him she was with him even as a baby of four when he was irritable and shouted and made the household unhappy she suffered from his shouting but somehow it was not really him she wanted it to be over she wanted to resume her normal connection with him when he was disagreeable the child echoed to the crying of some need in him and she responded blindly her heart followed him as if he had some tie with her and some love which he could not deliver her heart followed him persistently in its love  but there was the dim childish sense of her own smallness and inadequacy a fatal sense of worthlessness she could not do anything she was not enough she could not be important to him this knowledge deadened her from the first  still she set towards him like a quivering needle all her life was directed by her awareness of him her wakefulness to his being and she was against her mother  her father was the dawn wherein her consciousness woke up but for him she might have gone on like the other children gudrun and theresa and catherine one with the flowers and insects and playthings having no existence apart from the concrete object of her attention but her father came too near to her the clasp of his hands and the power of his breast woke her up almost in pain from the transient unconsciousness of childhood wideeyed unseeing she was awake before she knew how to see she was wakened too soon too soon the call had come to her when she was a small baby and her father held her close to his breast her sleepliving heart was beaten into wakefulness by the striving of his bigger heart by his clasping her to his body for love and for fulfilment asking as a magnet must always ask from her the response had struggled dimly vaguely into being  the children were dressed roughly for the country when she was little ursula pattered about in little wooden clogs a blue overall over her thick red dress a red shawl crossed on her breast and tied behind again so she ran with her father to the garden  the household rose early he was out digging by six oclock in the morning he went to his work at halfpast eight and ursula was usually in the garden with him though not near at hand  at eastertime one year she helped him to set potatoes it was the first time she had ever helped him the occasion remained as a picture one of her earliest memories they had gone out soon after dawn a cold wind was blowing he had his old trousers tucked into his boots he wore no coat nor waistcoat his shirtsleeves fluttered in the wind his face was ruddy and intent in a kind of sleep when he was at work he neither heard nor saw a long thin man looking still a youth with a line of black moustache above his thick mouth and his fine hair blown on his forehead he worked away at the earth in the grey first light alone his solitariness drew the child like a spell  the wind came chill over the darkgreen fields ursula ran up and watched him push the settingpeg in at one side of his ready earth stride across and push it in the other side pulling the line taut and clear upon the clods intervening then with a sharp cutting noise the bright spade came towards her cutting a grip into the new soft earth  he struck his spade upright and straightened himself  do you want to help me he said  she looked up at him from out of her little woollen bonnet  ay he said you can put some taters in for me looklike thatthese little sprits standing upso much apart you see  and stooping down he quickly surely placed the spritted potatoes in the soft grip where they rested separate and pathetic on the heavy cold earth  he gave her a little basket of potatoes and strode himself to the other end of the line she saw him stooping working towards her she was excited and unused she put in one potato then rearranged it to make it sit nicely some of the sprits were broken and she was afraid the responsibility excited her like a string tying her up she could not help looking with dread at the string buried under the heapedback soil her father was working nearer stooping working nearer she was overcome by her responsibility she put potatoes quickly into the cold earth  he came near  not so close he said stooping over her potatoes taking some out and rearranging the others she stood by with the painful terrified helplessness of childhood he was so unseeing and confident she wanted to do the thing and yet she could not she stood by looking on her little blue overall fluttering in the wind the red woollen ends of her shawl blowing gustily then he went down the row relentlessly turning the potatoes in with his sharp spadecuts he took no notice of her only worked on he had another world from hers  she stood helplessly stranded on his world he continued his work she knew she could not help him a little bit forlorn at last she turned away and ran down the garden away from him as fast as she could go away from him to forget him and his work  he missed her presence her face in her red woollen bonnet her blue overall fluttering she ran to where a little water ran trickling between grass and stones that she loved  when he came by he said to her  you didnt help me much  the child looked at him dumbly already her heart was heavy because of her own disappointment her mouth was dumb and pathetic but he did not notice he went his way  and she played on because of her disappointment persisting even the more in her play she dreaded work because she could not do it as he did it she was conscious of the great breach between them she knew she had no power the grownup power to work deliberately was a mystery to her  he would smash into her sensitive childs world destructively her mother was lenient careless the children played about as they would all day ursula was thoughtlesswhy should she remember things if across the garden she saw the hedge had budded and if she wanted these greenypink tiny buds for breadandcheese to play at teaparty with over she went for them  then suddenly perhaps the next day her soul would almost start out of her body as her father turned on her shouting  whos been tramplin an dancin across where ive just sowed seed i know its you nuisance can you find nowhere else to walk but just over my seed beds but its like you that isno heed but to follow your own greedy nose  it had shocked him in his intent world to see the zigzagging lines of deep little footprints across his work the child was infinitely more shocked her vulnerable little soul was flayed and trampled why were the footprints there she had not wanted to make them she stood dazzled with pain and shame and unreality  her soul her consciousness seemed to die away she became shut off and senseless a little fixed creature whose soul had gone hard and unresponsive the sense of her own unreality hardened her like a frost she cared no longer  and the sight of her face shut and superior with selfasserting indifference made a flame of rage go over him he wanted to break her  ill break your obstinate little face he said through shut teeth lifting his hand  the child did not alter in the least the look of indifference complete glancing indifference as if nothing but herself existed to her remained fixed  yet far away in her the sobs were tearing her soul and when he had gone she would go and creep under the parlour sofa and lie clinched in the silent hidden misery of childhood  when she crawled out after an hour or so she went rather stiffly to play she willed to forget she cut off her childish soul from memory so that the pain and the insult should not be real she asserted herself only there was not nothing in the world but her own self so very soon she came to believe in the outward malevolence that was against her and very early she learned that even her adored father was part of this malevolence and very early she learned to harden her soul in resistance and denial of all that was outside her harden herself upon her own being  she never felt sorry for what she had done she never forgave those who had made her guilty if he had said to her why ursula did you trample my carefullymade bed that would have hurt her to the quick and she would have done anything for him but she was always tormented by the unreality of outside things the earth was to walk on why must she avoid a certain patch just because it was called a seedbed it was the earth to walk on this was her instinctive assumption and when he bullied her she became hard cut herself off from all connection lived in the little separate world of her own violent will  as she grew older five six seven the connection between her and her father was even stronger yet it was always straining to break she was always relapsing on her own violent will into her own separate world of herself this made him grind his teeth with bitterness for he still wanted her but she could harden herself into her own selfs universe impregnable  he was very fond of swimming and in warm weather would take her down to the canal to a silent place or to a big pond or reservoir to bathe he would take her on his back as he went swimming and she clung close feeling his strong movement under her so strong as if it would uphold all the world then he taught her to swim  she was a fearless little thing when he dared her and he had a curious craving to frighten her to see what she would do with him he said would she ride on his back whilst he jumped off the canal bridge down into the water beneath  she would he loved to feel the naked child clinging on to his shoulders there was a curious fight between their two wills he mounted the parapet of the canal bridge the water was a long way down but the child had a deliberate will set upon his she held herself fixed to him  he leapt and down they went the crash of the water as they went under struck through the childs small body with a sort of unconsciousness but she remained fixed and when they came up again and when they went to the bank and when they sat on the grass side by side he laughed and said it was fine and the darkdilated eyes of the child looked at him wonderingly darkly wondering from the shock yet reserved and unfathomable so he laughed almost with a sob  in a moment she was clinging safely on his back again and he was swimming in deep water she was used to his nakedness and to her mothers nakedness ever since she was born they were clinging to each other and making up to each other for the strange blow that had been struck at them yet still on other days he would leap again with her from the bridge daringly almost wickedly till at length as he leapt once she dropped forward on to his head and nearly broke his neck so that they fell into the water in a heap and fought for a few moments with death he saved her and sat on the bank quivering but his eyes were full of the blackness of death it was as if death had cut between their two lives and separated them  still they were not separate there was this curious taunting intimacy between them when the fair came she wanted to go in the swingboats he took her and standing up in the boat holding on to the irons began to drive higher perilously higher the child clung fast on her seat  do you want to go any higher he said to her and she laughed with her mouth her eyes wide and dilated they were rushing through the air  yes she said feeling as if she would turn into vapour lose hold of everything and melt away the boat swung far up then down like a stone only to be caught sickeningly up again  any higher he called looking at her over his shoulder his face evil and beautiful to her  she laughed with white lips  he sent the swingboat sweeping through the air in a great semicircle till it jerked and swayed at the high horizontal the child clung on pale her eyes fixed on him people below were calling the jerk at the top had almost shaken them both out he had done what he couldand he was attracting censure he sat down and let the swingboat swing itself out  people in the crowd cried shame on him as he came out of the swingboat he laughed the child clung to his hand pale and mute in a while she was violently sick he gave her lemonade and she gulped a little  dont tell your mother youve been sick he said there was no need to ask that when she got home the child crept away under the parlour sofa like a sick little animal and was a long time before she crawled out  but anna got to know of this escapade and was passionately angry and contemptuous of him his goldenbrown eyes glittered he had a strange cruel little smile and as the child watched him for the first time in her life a disillusion came over her something cold and isolating she went over to her mother her soul was dead towards him it made her sick  still she forgot and continued to love him but ever more coldly he was at this time when he was about twentyeight years old strange and violent in his being sensual he acquired some power over anna over everybody he came into contact with  after a long bout of hostility anna at last closed with him she had now four children all girls for seven years she had been absorbed in wifehood and motherhood for years he had gone on beside her never really encroaching upon her then gradually another self seemed to assert its being within him he was still silent and separate but she could feel him all the while coming near upon her as if his breast and his body were threatening her and he was always coming closer gradually he became indifferent of responsibility he would do what pleased him and no more  he began to go away from home he went to nottingham on saturdays always alone to the football match and to the musichall and all the time he was watching in readiness he never cared to drink but with his hard goldenbrown eyes so keen seeing with their tiny black pupils he watched all the people everything that happened and he waited  in the empire one evening he sat next to two girls he was aware of the one beside him she was rather small common with a fresh complexion and an upper lip that lifted from her teeth so that when she was not conscious her mouth was slightly open and her lips pressed outwards in a kind of blind appeal she was strongly aware of the man next to her so that all her body was still very still her face watched the stage her arms went down into her lap very selfconscious and still  a gleam lit up in him should he begin with her should he begin with her to live the other the unadmitted life of his desire why not he had always been so good save for his wife he was a virgin and why when all women were different why when he would only live once he wanted the other life his own life was barren not enough he wanted the other  her open mouth showing the small irregular white teeth appealed to him it was open and ready it was so vulnerable why should he not go in and enjoy what was there the slim arm that went down so still and motionless to the lap it was pretty she would be small he would be able almost to hold her in his two hands she would be small almost like a child and pretty her childishness whetted him keenly she would he helpless between his hands  that was the best turn weve had he said to her leaning over as he clapped his hands he felt strong and unshakeable in himself set over against all the world his soul was keen and watchful glittering with a kind of amusement he was perfectly selfcontained he was himself the absolute the rest of the world was the object that should contribute to his being  the girl started turned round her eyes lit up with an almost painful flash of a smile the colour came deeply in her cheeks  yes it was she said quite meaninglessly and she covered her rather prominent teeth with her lips then she sat looking straight before her seeing nothing only conscious of the colour burning in her cheeks  it pricked him with a pleasant sensation his veins and his nerves attended to her she was so young and palpitating  its not such a good programme as last weeks he said  again she half turned her face to him and her clear bright eyes bright like shallow water filled with light frightened yet involuntarily lighting and shaking with response  oh isnt it i wasnt able to come last week  he noted the common accent it pleased him he knew what class she came of probably she was a warehouselass he was glad she was a common girl  he proceeded to tell her about the last weeks programme she answered at random very confusedly the colour burned in her cheek yet she always answered him the girl on the other side sat remotely obviously silent he ignored her all his address was for his own girl with her bright shallow eyes and her vulnerably opened mouth  the talk went on meaningless and random on her part quite deliberate and purposive on his it was a pleasure to him to make this conversation an activity pleasant as a fine game of chance and skill he was very quiet and pleasanthumoured but so full of strength she fluttered beside his steady pressure of warmth and his surety  he saw the performance drawing to a close his senses were alert and wilful he would press his advantages he followed her and her plain friend down the stairs to the street it was raining  its a nasty night he said shall you come and have a drink of somethinga cup of coffeeits early yet  oh i dont think so she said looking away into the night  i wish you would he said putting himself as it were at her mercy there was a moments pause  come to rollins he said  nonot there  to carsons then  there was a silence the other girl hung on the man was the centre of positive force  will your friend come as well  there was another moment of silence while the other girl felt her ground  no thanks she said ive promised to meet a friend  another time then he said  oh thanks she replied very awkward  good night he said  see you later said his girl to her friend  where said the friend  you know gertie replied his girl  all right jennie  the friend was gone into the darkness he turned with his girl to the teashop they talked all the time he made his sentences in sheer almost muscular pleasure of exercising himself with her he was looking at her all the time perceiving her appreciating her finding her out gratifying himself with her he could see distinct attractions in her her eyebrows with their particular curve gave him keen aesthetic pleasure later on he would see her bright pellucid eyes like shallow water and know those and there remained the open exposed mouth red and vulnerable that he reserved as yet and all the while his eyes were on the girl estimating and handling with pleasure her young softness about the girl herself who or what she was he cared nothing he was quite unaware that she was anybody she was just the sensual object of his attention  shall we go then he said  she rose in silence as if acting without a mind merely physically he seemed to hold her in his will outside it was still raining  lets have a walk he said i dont mind the rain do you  no i dont mind it she said  he was alert in every sense and fibre and yet quite sure and steady and lit up as if transfused he had a free sensation of walking in his own darkness not in anybody elses world at all he was purely a world to himself he had nothing to do with any general consciousness just his own senses were supreme all the rest was external insignificant leaving him alone with this girl whom he wanted to absorb whose properties he wanted to absorb into his own senses he did not care about her except that he wanted to overcome her resistance to have her in his power fully and exhaustively to enjoy her  they turned into the dark streets he held her umbrella over her and put his arm round her she walked as if she were unaware but gradually as he walked he drew her a little closer into the movement of his side and hip she fitted in there very well it was a real good fit to walk with her like this it made him exquisitely aware of his own muscular self and his hand that grasped her side felt one curve of her and it seemed like a new creation to him a reality an absolute an existing tangible beauty of the absolute it was like a star everything in him was absorbed in the sensual delight of this one small firm curve in her body that his hand and his whole being had lighted upon  he led her into the park where it was almost dark he noticed a corner between two walls under a great overhanging bush of ivy  let us stand here a minute he said  he put down the umbrella and followed her into the corner retreating out of the rain he needed no eyes to see all he wanted was to know through touch she was like a piece of palpable darkness he found her in the darkness put his arms round her and his hands upon her she was silent and inscrutable but he did not want to know anything about her he only wanted to discover her and through her clothing what absolute beauty he touched  take your hat off he said  silently obediently she shook off her hat and gave herself to his arms again he liked herhe liked the feel of herhe wanted to know her more closely he let his fingers subtly seek out her cheek and neck what amazing beauty and pleasure in the dark his fingers had often touched anna on the face and neck like that what matter it was one man who touched anna another who now touched this girl he liked best his new self he was given over altogether to the sensuous knowledge of this woman and every moment he seemed to be touching absolute beauty something beyond knowledge  very close marvelling and exceedingly joyful in their discoveries his hands pressed upon her so subtly so seekingly so finely and desirously searching her out that she too was almost swooning in the absolute of sensual knowledge in utter sensual delight she clenched her knees her thighs her loins together it was an added beauty to him  but he was patiently working for her relaxation patiently his whole being fixed in the smile of latent gratification his whole body electric with a subtle powerful reducing force upon her so he came at length to kiss her and she was almost betrayed by his insidious kiss her open mouth was too helpless and unguarded he knew this and his first kiss was very gentle and soft and assuring so assuring so that her soft defenseless mouth became assured even bold seeking upon his mouth and he answered her gradually gradually his soft kiss sinking in softly softly but ever more heavily more heavily yet till it was too heavy for her to meet and she began to sink under it she was sinking sinking his smile of latent gratification was becoming more tense he was sure of her he let the whole force of his will sink upon her to sweep her away but it was too great a shock for her with a sudden horrible movement she ruptured the state that contained them both  dontdont  it was a rather horrible cry that seemed to come out of her not to belong to her it was some strange agony of terror crying out the words there was something vibrating and beside herself in the noise his nerves ripped like silk  whats the matter he said as if calmly whats the matter  she came back to him but trembling reservedly this time  her cry had given him gratification but he knew he had been too sudden for her he was now careful for a while he merely sheltered her also there had broken a flaw into his perfect will he wanted to persist to begin again to lead up to the point where he had let himself go on her and then manage more carefully successfully so far she had won and the battle was not over yet but another voice woke in him and prompted him to let her golet her go in contempt  he sheltered her and soothed her and caressed her and kissed her and again began to come nearer nearer he gathered himself together even if he did not take her he would make her relax he would fuse away her resistance so softly softly with infinite caressiveness he kissed her and the whole of his being seemed to fondle her till at the verge swooning at the breaking point there came from her a beaten inarticulate moaning cry  dontoh dont  his veins fused with extreme voluptuousness for a moment he almost lost control of himself and continued automatically but there was a moment of inaction of cold suspension he was not going to take her he drew her to him and soothed her and caressed her but the pure zest had gone she struggled to herself and realized he was not going to take her and then at the very last moment when his fondling had come near again his hot living desire despising her against his cold sensual desire she broke violently away from him  dont she cried harsh now with hatred and she flung her hand across and hit him violently keep off of me  his blood stood still for a moment then the smile came again within him steady cruel  why whats the matter he said with suave irony nobodys going to hurt you  i know what you want she said  i know what i want he said whats the odds  well youre not going to have it off me  arent i well then im not its no use crying about it is it  no it isnt said the girl rather disconcerted by his irony  but theres no need to have a row about it we can kiss good night just the same cant we  she was silent in the darkness  or do you want your hat and umbrella to go home this minute  still she was silent he watched her dark figure as she stood there on the edge of the faint darkness and he waited  come and say good night nicely if were going to say it he said  still she did not stir he put his hand out and drew her into the darkness again  its warmer in here he said a lot cosier  his will had not yet relaxed from her the moment of hatred exhilarated him  im going now she muttered as he closed his hand over her  see how well you fit your place he said as he drew her to her previous position close upon him what do you want to leave it for  and gradually the intoxication invaded him again the zest came back after all why should he not take her  but she did not yield to him entirely  are you a married man she asked at length  what if i am he said  she did not answer  i dont ask you whether youre married or not he said  you know jolly well im not she answered hotly oh if she could only break away from him if only she need not yield to him  at length her will became cold against him she had escaped but she hated him for her escape more than for her danger did he despise her so coldly and she was in torture of adherence to him still  shall i see you next weeknext saturday he said as they returned to the town she did not answer  come to the empire with meyou and gertie he said  i should look well going with a married man she said  im no less of a man for being married am i he said  oh its a different matter altogether with a married man she said in a readymade speech that showed her chagrin  hows that he asked  but she would not enlighten him yet she promised without promising to be at the meetingplace next saturday evening  so he left her he did not know her name he caught a train and went home  it was the last train he was very late he was not home till midnight but he was quite indifferent he had no real relation with his home not this man which he now was anna was sitting up for him she saw the queer absolved look on his face a sort of latent almost sinister smile as if he were absolved from his good ties  where have you been she asked puzzled interested  to the empire  who with  by myself i came home with tom cooper  she looked at him and wondered what he had been doing she was indifferent as to whether he lied or not  you have come home very strange she said and there was an appreciative inflexion in the speech  he was not affected as for his humble good self he was absolved from it he sat down and ate heartily he was not tired he seemed to take no notice of her  for anna the moment was critical she kept herself aloof and watched him he talked to her but with a little indifference since he was scarcely aware of her so then she did not affect him here was a new turn of affairs he was rather attractive nevertheless she liked him better than the ordinary mute halfeffaced halfsubdued man she usually knew him to be so he was blossoming out into his real self it piqued her very good let him blossom she liked a new turn of affairs he was a strange man come home to her glancing at him she saw she could not reduce him to what he had been before in an instant she gave it up yet not without a pang of rage which would insist on their old beloved love their old accustomed intimacy and her old established supremacy she almost rose up to fight for them and looking at him and remembering his father she was wary this was the new turn of affairs  very good if she could not influence him in the old way she would be level with him in the new her old defiant hostility came up very good she too was out on her own adventure her voice her manner changed she was ready for the game something was liberated in her she liked him she liked this strange man come home to her he was very welcome indeed she was very glad to welcome a stranger she had been bored by the old husband to his latent cruel smile she replied with brilliant challenge he expected her to keep the moral fortress not she it was much too dull a part she challenged him back with a sort of radiance very bright and free opposite to him he looked at her and his eyes glinted she too was out in the field  his senses pricked up and keenly attended to her she laughed perfectly indifferent and loose as he was he came towards her she neither rejected him nor responded to him in a kind of radiance superb in her inscrutability she laughed before him she too could throw everything overboard love intimacy responsibility what were her four children to her now what did it matter that this man was the father of her four children  he was the sensual male seeking his pleasure she was the female ready to take hers but in her own way a man could turn into a free lance so then could a woman she adhered as little as he to the moral world all that had gone before was nothing to her she was another woman under the instance of a strange man he was a stranger to her seeking his own ends very good she wanted to see what this stranger would do now what he was  she laughed and kept him at arms length whilst apparently ignoring him she watched him undress as if he were a stranger indeed he was a stranger to her  and she roused him profoundly violently even before he touched her the little creature in nottingham had but been leading up to this they abandoned in one motion the moral position each was seeking gratification pure and simple  strange his wife was to him it was as if he were a perfect stranger as if she were infinitely and essentially strange to him the other half of the world the dark half of the moon she waited for his touch as if he were a marauder who had come in infinitely unknown and desirable to her and he began to discover her he had an inkling of the vastness of the unknown sensual store of delights she was with a passion of voluptuousness that made him dwell on each tiny beauty in a kind of frenzy of enjoyment he lit upon her her beauty the beauties the separate several beauties of her body  he was quite ousted from himself and sensually transported by that which he discovered in her he was another man revelling over her there was no tenderness no love between them any more only the maddening sensuous lust for discovery and the insatiable exorbitant gratification in the sensual beauties of her body and she was a store a store of absolute beauties that it drove him to contemplate there was such a feast to enjoy and he with only one mans capacity  he lived in a passion of sensual discovery with her for some timeit was a duel no love no words no kisses even only the maddening perception of beauty consummate absolute through touch he wanted to touch her to discover her maddeningly he wanted to know her yet he must not hurry or he missed everything he must enjoy one beauty at a time and the multitudinous beauties of her body the many little rapturous places sent him mad with delight and with desire to be able to know more to have strength to know more for all was there  he would say during the daytime  tonight i shall know the little hollow under her ankle where the blue vein crosses and the thought of it and the desire for it made a thick darkness of anticipation  he would go all the day waiting for the night to come when he could give himself to the enjoyment of some luxurious absolute of beauty in her the thought of the hidden resources of her the undiscovered beauties and ecstatic places of delight in her body waiting only waiting for him to discover them sent him slightly insane he was obsessed if he did not discover and make known to himself these delights they might be lost for ever he wished he had a hundred mens energies with which to enjoy her he wished he were a cat to lick her with a rough grating lascivious tongue he wanted to wallow in her bury himself in her flesh cover himself over with her flesh  and she separate with a strange dangerous glistening look in her eyes received all his activities upon her as if they were expected by her and provoked him when he was quiet to more till sometimes he was ready to perish for sheer inability to be satisfied of her inability to have had enough of her  their children became mere offspring to them they lived in the darkness and death of their own sensual activities sometimes he felt he was going mad with a sense of absolute beauty perceived by him in her through his senses it was something too much for him and in everything was this same almost sinister terrifying beauty but in the revelations of her body through contact with his body was the ultimate beauty to know which was almost death in itself and yet for the knowledge of which he would have undergone endless torture he would have forfeited anything anything rather than forego his right even to the instep of her foot and the place from which the toes radiated out the little miraculous white plain from which ran the little hillocks of the toes and the folded dimpling hollows between the toes he felt he would have died rather than forfeit this  this was what their love had become a sensuality violent and extreme as death they had no conscious intimacy no tenderness of love it was all the lust and the infinite maddening intoxication of the sense a passion of death  he had always all his life had a secret dread of absolute beauty it had always been like a fetish to him something to fear really for it was immoral and against mankind so he had turned to the gothic form which always asserted the broken desire of mankind in its pointed arches escaping the rolling absolute beauty of the round arch  but now he had given way and with infinite sensual violence gave himself to the realization of this supreme immoral absolute beauty in the body of woman it seemed to him that it came to being in the body of woman under his touch under his touch even under his sight it was there but when he neither saw nor touched the perfect place it was not perfect it was not there and he must make it exist  but still the thing terrified him awful and threatening it was dangerous to a degree even whilst he gave himself to it it was pure darkness also all the shameful things of the body revealed themselves to him now with a sort of sinister tropical beauty all the shameful natural and unnatural acts of sensual voluptuousness which he and the woman partook of together created together they had their heavy beauty and their delight shame what was it it was part of extreme delight it was that part of delight of which man is usually afraid why afraid the secret shameful things are most terribly beautiful  they accepted shame and were one with it in their most unlicensed pleasures it was incorporated it was a bud that blossomed into beauty and heavy fundamental gratification  their outward life went on much the same but the inward life was revolutionized the children became less important the parents were absorbed in their own living  and gradually brangwen began to find himself free to attend to the outside life as well his intimate life was so violently active that it set another man in him free and this new man turned with interest to public life to see what part he could take in it this would give him scope for new activity activity of a kind for which he was now created and released he wanted to be unanimous with the whole of purposive mankind  at this time education was in the forefront as a subject of interest there was the talk of new swedish methods of handwork instruction and so on brangwen embraced sincerely the idea of handwork in schools for the first time he began to take real interest in a public affair he had at length from his profound sensual activity developed a real purposive self  there was talk of nightschools and of handicraft classes he wanted to start a woodwork class in cossethay to teach carpentry and joinery and woodcarving to the village boys two nights a week this seemed to him a supremely desirable thing to be doing his pay would be very littleand when he had it he spent it all on extra wood and tools but he was very happy and keen in his new public spirit  he started his nightclasses in woodwork when he was thirty years old by this time he had five children the last a boy but boy or girl mattered very little to him he had a natural bloodaffection for his children and he liked them as they turned up boys or girls only he was fondest of ursula somehow she seemed to be at the back of his new nightschool venture  the house by the yew trees was in connection with the great human endeavour at last it gained a new vigour thereby  to ursula a child of eight the increase in magic was considerable she heard all the talk she saw the parish room fitted up as a workshop the parish room was a high stone barnlike ecclesiastical building standing away by itself in the brangwens second garden across the lane she was always attracted by its age and its stranded obsoleteness now she watched preparations made she sat on the flight of stone steps that came down from the porch to the garden and heard her father and the vicar talking and planning and working then an inspector came a very strange man and stayed talking with her father all one evening everything was settled and twelve boys enrolled their names it was very exciting  but to ursula everything her father did was magic whether he came from ilkeston with news of the town whether he went across to the church with his music or his tools on a sunny evening whether he sat in his white surplice at the organ on sundays leading the singing with his strong tenor voice or whether he were in the workshop with the boys he was always a centre of magic and fascination to her his voice sounding out in command cheerful laconic had always a twang in it that sent a thrill over her blood and hypnotized her she seemed to run in the shadow of some dark potent secret of which she would not of whose existence even she dared not become conscious it cast such a spell over her and so darkened her mind    chapter ix  the marsh and the flood  there was always regular connection between the yew cottage and the marsh yet the two households remained separate distinct  after annas marriage the marsh became the home of the two boys tom and fred tom was a rather short goodlooking youth with crisp black hair and long black eyelashes and soft dark possessed eyes he had a quick intelligence from the high school he went to london to study he had an instinct for attracting people of character and energy he gave place entirely to the other person and at the same time kept himself independent he scarcely existed except through other people when he was alone he was unresolved when he was with another man he seemed to add himself to the other make the other bigger than life size so that a few people loved him and attained a sort of fulfilment in him he carefully chose these few  he had a subtle quick critical intelligence a mind that was like a scale or balance there was something of a woman in all this  in london he had been the favourite pupil of an engineer a clever man who became wellknown at the time when tom brangwen had just finished his studies through this master the youth kept acquaintance with various individual outstanding characters he never asserted himself he seemed to be there to estimate and establish the rest he was like a presence that makes us aware of our own being so that he was while still young connected with some of the most energetic scientific and mathematical people in london they took him as an equal quiet and perceptive and impersonal as he was he kept his place and learned how to value others in just degree he was there like a judgment besides he was very goodlooking of medium stature but beautifully proportioned dark with fine colouring always perfectly healthy  his father allowed him a liberal pocketmoney besides which he had a sort of post as assistant to his chief then from time to time the young man appeared at the marsh curiously attractive welldressed reserved having by nature a subtle refined manner and he set the change in the farm  fred the younger brother was a brangwen largeboned blueeyed english he was his fathers very son the two men father and son were supremely at ease with one another fred was succeeding to the farm  between the elder brother and the younger existed an almost passionate love tom watched over fred with a womans poignant attention and selfless care fred looked up to tom as to something miraculous that which he himself would aspire to be were he great also  so that after annas departure the marsh began to take on a new tone the boys were gentlemen tom had a rare nature and had risen high fred was sensitive and fond of reading he pondered ruskin and then the agnostic writings like all the brangwens he was very much a thing to himself though fond of people and indulgent to them having an exaggerated respect for them  there was a rather uneasy friendship between him and one of the young hardys at the hall the two households were different yet the young men met on shy terms of equality  it was young tom brangwen with his dark lashes and beautiful colouring his soft inscrutable nature his strange repose and his informed air added to his position in london who seemed to emphasize the superior foreign element in the marsh when he appeared perfectly dressed as if soft and affable and yet quite removed from everybody he created an uneasiness in people he was reserved in the minds of the cossethay and ilkeston acquaintances to a different remote world  he and his mother had a kind of affinity the affection between them was of a mute distant character but radical his father was always uneasy and slightly deferential to his eldest son tom also formed the link that kept the marsh in real connection with the skrebenskys now quite important people in their own district  so a change in tone came over the marsh tom brangwen the father as he grew older seemed to mature into a gentlemanfarmer his figure lent itself burly and handsome his face remained fresh and his blue eyes as full of light his thick hair and beard had turned gradually to a silky whiteness it was his custom to laugh a great deal in his acquiescent wilful manner things had puzzled him very much so he had taken the line of easy goodhumoured acceptance he was not responsible for the frame of things yet he was afraid of the unknown in life  he was fairly welloff his wife was there with him a different being from himself yet somewhere vitally connected with himwho was he to understand where and how his two sons were gentlemen they were men distinct from himself they had separate beings of their own yet they were connected with himself it was all adventurous and puzzling yet one remained vital within ones own existence whatever the offshoots  so handsome and puzzled he laughed and stuck to himself as the only thing he could stick to his youngness and the wonder remained almost the same in him he became indolent he developed a luxuriant ease fred did most of the farmwork the father saw to the more important transactions he drove a good mare and sometimes he rode his cob he drank in the hotels and the inns with betterclass farmers and proprietors he had welltodo acquaintances among men but one class suited him no better than another  his wife as ever had no acquaintances her hair was threaded now with grey her face grew older in form without changing in expression she seemed the same as when she had come to the marsh twentyfive years ago save that her health was more fragile she seemed always to haunt the marsh rather than to live there she was never part of the life something she represented was alien there she remained a stranger within the gates in some ways fixed and impervious in some ways curiously refining she caused the separateness and individuality of all the marsh inmates the friability of the household  when young tom brangwen was twentythree years old there was some breach between him and his chief which was never explained and he went away to italy then to america he came home for a while then went to germany always the same goodlooking carefullydressed attractive young man in perfect health yet somehow outside of everything in his dark eyes was a deep misery which he wore with the same ease and pleasantness as he wore his closesitting clothes  to ursula he was a romantic alluring figure he had a grace of bringing beautiful presents a box of expensive sweets such as cossethay had never seen or he gave her a hairbrush and a long slim mirror of motherofpearl all pale and glimmering and exquisite or he sent her a little necklace of rough stones amethyst and opal and brilliants and garnet he spoke other languages easily and fluently his nature was curiously gracious and insinuating with all that he was undefinably an outsider he belonged to nowhere to no society  anna brangwen had left her intimacy with her father undeveloped since the time of her marriage at her marriage it had been abandoned he and she had drawn a reserve between them anna went more to her mother  then suddenly the father died  it happened one springtime when ursula was about eight years old he tom brangwen drove off on a saturday morning to the market in nottingham saying he might not be back till late as there was a special show and then a meeting he had to attend his family understood that he would enjoy himself  the season had been rainy and dreary in the evening it was pouring with rain fred brangwen unsettled uneasy did not go out as was his wont he smoked and read and fidgeted hearing always the trickling of water outside this wet black night seemed to cut him off and make him unsettled aware of himself aware that he wanted something else aware that he was scarcely living there seemed to him to be no root to his life no place for him to get satisfied in he dreamed of going abroad but his instinct knew that change of place would not solve his problem he wanted change deep vital change of living and he did not know how to get it  tilly an old woman now came in saying that the labourers who had been suppering up said the yard and everywhere was just a slew of water he heard in indifference but he hated a desolate raw wetness in the world he would leave the marsh  his mother was in bed at last he shut his book his mind was blank he walked upstairs intoxicated with depression and anger and intoxicated with depression and anger locked himself into sleep  tilly set slippers before the kitchen fire and she also went to bed leaving the door unlocked then the farm was in darkness in the rain  at eleven oclock it was still raining tom brangwen stood in the yard of the angel nottingham and buttoned his coat  oh well he said cheerfully its rained on me before put er in jack my lad put her inthart a rare old cock jackyboy wi a belly on thee as does credit to thy drink if not to thy corn co up lass lets get off ter th old homestead oh my heart what a wetness in the night therell be no volcanoes after this hey jack my beautiful young slender feller which of us is noah it seems as though the waterworks is bursted ducks and ayquatic fowl ll be king o the castle at this ratedove an olive branch an all stand up then gel stand up were not stoppin here all night even if you thought we was im dashed if the jumping rain wouldnt make anybody think they was drunk hey jackdoes rainwater wash the sense in or does it wash it out and he laughed to himself at the joke  he was always ashamed when he had to drive after he had been drinking always apologetic to the horse his apologetic frame made him facetious he was aware of his inability to walk quite straight nevertheless his will kept stiff and attentive in all his fuddleness  he mounted and bowled off through the gates of the innyard the mare went well he sat fixed the rain beating on his face his heavy body rode motionless in a kind of sleep one centre of attention was kept fitfully burning the rest was dark he concentrated his last attention on the fact of driving along the road he knew so well he knew it so well he watched for it attentively with an effort of will  he talked aloud to himself sententious in his anxiety as if he were perfectly sober whilst the mare bowled along and the rain beat on him he watched the rain before the giglamps the faint gleaming of the shadowy horses body the passing of the dark hedges  its not a fit night to turn a dog out he said to himself aloud its high time as it did a bit of clearing up ill be damned if it isnt it was a lot of use putting those ten loads of cinders on th road theyll be washed to kingdomcome if it doesnt alter well its our freds lookout if they are hes topsawyer as far as those things go i dont see why i should concern myself they can wash to kingdomcome and back again for what i care i suppose they would be washed back again some day thats how things are th rain tumbles down just to mount up in clouds again so they say theres no more water on the earth than there was in the year naught thats the story my boy if you understand it theres no more today than there was a thousand years agonor no less either you cant wear water out no my boy itll give you the goby try to wear it out and it takes its hook into vapour it has its fingers at its nose to you it turns into cloud and falleth as rain on the just and unjust i wonder if im the just or the unjust  he started awake as the trap lurched deep into a rut and he wakened to the point in his journey he had travelled some distance since he was last conscious  but at length he reached the gate and stumbled heavily down reeling gripping fast to the trap he descended into several inches of water  be damned he said angrily be damned to the miserable slop  and he led the horse washing through the gate he was quite drunk now moving blindly in habit everywhere there was water underfoot  the raised causeway of the house and the farmstead was dry however but there was a curious roar in the night which seemed to be made in the darkness of his own intoxication reeling blinded almost without consciousness he carried his parcels and the rug and cushions into the house dropped them and went out to put up the horse  now he was at home he was a sleepwalker waiting only for the moment of activity to stop very deliberately and carefully he led the horse down the slope to the cartshed she shied and backed  why whas amiss he hiccupped plodding steadily on and he was again in a wash of water the horse splashed up water as he went it was thickly dark save for the giglamps and they lit on a rippling surface of water  well thats a knockout he said as he came to the cartshed and was wading in six inches of water but everything seemed to him amusing he laughed to think of six inches of water being in the cartshed  he backed in the mare she was restive he laughed at the fun of untackling the mare with a lot of water washing round his feet he laughed because it upset her whats amiss whats amiss a drop o water wont hurt you as soon as he had undone the traces she walked quickly away  he hung up the shafts and took the giglamp as he came out of the familiar jumble of shafts and wheels in the shed the water in little waves came washing strongly against his legs he staggered and almost fell  well what the deuce he said staring round at the running water in the black watery night  he went to meet the running flood sinking deeper and deeper his soul was full of great astonishment he had to go and look where it came from though the ground was going from under his feet he went on down towards the pond shakily he rather enjoyed it he was kneedeep and the water was pulling heavily he stumbled reeled sickeningly  fear took hold of him gripping tightly to the lamp he reeled and looked round the water was carrying his feet away he was dizzy he did not know which way to turn the water was whirling whirling the whole black night was swooping in rings he swayed uncertainly at the centre of all the attack reeling in dismay in his soul he knew he would fall  as he staggered something in the water struck his legs and he fell instantly he was in the turmoil of suffocation he fought in a black horror of suffocation fighting wrestling but always borne down borne inevitably down still he wrestled and fought to get himself free in the unutterable struggle of suffocation but he always fell again deeper something struck his head a great wonder of anguish went over him then the blackness covered him entirely  in the utter darkness the unconscious drowning body was rolled along the waters pouring washing filling in the place the cattle woke up and rose to their feet the dog began to yelp and the unconscious drowning body was washed along in the black swirling darkness passively  mrs brangwen woke up and listened with preternaturally sharp senses she heard the movement of all the darkness that swirled outside for a moment she lay still then she went to the window she heard the sharp rain and the deep running of water she knew her husband was outside  fred she called fred  away in the night was a hoarse brutal roar of a mass of water rushing downwards  she went downstairs she could not understand the multiplied running of water stepping down the step into the kitchen she put her foot into water the kitchen was flooded where did it come from she could not understand  water was running in out of the scullery she paddled through barefoot to see water was bubbling fiercely under the outer door she was afraid then something washed against her something twined under her foot it was the riding whip on the table were the rug and the cushion and the parcel from the gig  he had come home  tom she called afraid of her own voice  she opened the door water ran in with a horrid sound everywhere was moving water a sound of waters  tom she cried standing in her nightdress with the candle calling into the darkness and the flood out of the doorway  tom tom  and she listened fred appeared behind her in trousers and shirt  where is he he asked  he looked at the flood then at his mother she seemed small and uncanny elvish in her nightdress  go upstairs he said hell be in th stable  toom toom cried the elderly woman with a long unnatural penetrating call that chilled her son to the marrow he quickly pulled on his boots and his coat  go upstairs mother he said ill go an see where he is  toom tooom rang out the shrill unearthly cry of the small woman there was only the noise of water and the mooing of uneasy cattle and the long yelping of the dog clamouring in the darkness  fred brangwen splashed out into the flood with a lantern his mother stood on a chair in the doorway watching him go it was all water water running flashing under the lantern  tom tom tooom came her long unnatural cry ringing over the night it made her son feel cold in his soul  and the unconscious drowning body of the father rolled on below the house driven by the black water towards the highroad  tilly appeared a skirt over her nightdress she saw her mistress clinging on the top of a chair in the open doorway a candle burning on the table  gods sake cried the old servingwoman the cuts burst that embankments broke down whativer are we goin to do  mrs brangwen watched her son and the lantern go along the upper causeway to the stable then she saw the dark figure of a horse then her son hung the lamp in the stable and the light shone out faintly on him as he untackled the mare the mother saw the soft blazed face of the horse thrust forward into the stabledoor the stables were still above the flood but the water flowed strongly into the house  its getting higher said tilly hasnt master come in  mrs brangwen did not hear  isnt he theere she called in her farreaching terrifying voice  no came the short answer out of the night  go and loook for him  his mothers voice nearly drove the youth mad  he put the halter on the horse and shut the stable door he came splashing back through the water the lantern swinging  the unconscious drowning body was pushed past the house in the deepest current fred brangwen came to his mother  ill go to th cartshed he said  toom tooom rang out the strong inhuman cry fred brangwens blood froze his heart was very angry he gripped his veins in a frenzy why was she yelling like this he could not bear the sight of her perched on a chair in her white nightdress in the doorway elvish and horrible  hes taken the mare out of the trap so hes all right he said growling pretending to be normal  but as he descended to the cartshed he sank into a foot of water he heard the rushing in the distance he knew the canal had broken down the water was running deeper  the trap was there all right but no signs of his father the young man waded down to the pond the water rose above his knees it swirled and forced him he drew back  is he theeere came the maddening cry of the mother  no was the sharp answer  toomtooom came the piercing free unearthly call it seemed high and supernatural almost pure fred brangwen hated it it nearly drove him mad so awfully it sang out almost like a song  the water was flowing fuller into the house  youd better go up to beebys and bring him and arthur down and tell mrs beeby to fetch wilkinson said fred to tilly he forced his mother to go upstairs  i know your father is drowned she said in a curious dismay  the flood rose through the night till it washed the kettle off the hob in the kitchen mrs brangwen sat alone at a window upstairs she called no more the men were busy with the pigs and the cattle they were coming with a boat for her  towards morning the rain ceased the stars came out over the noise and the terrifying clucking and trickling of the water then there was a pallor in the east the light began to come in the ruddy light of the dawn she saw the waters spreading out moving sluggishly the buildings rising out of a waste of water birds began to sing drowsily and as if slightly hoarse with the dawn it grew brighter up the second field was the great raw gap in the canal embankment  mrs brangwen went from window to window watching the flood somebody had brought a little boat the light grew stronger the red gleam was gone off the floodwaters day took place mrs brangwen went from the front of the house to the back looking out intent and unrelaxing on the pallid morning of spring  she saw a glimpse of her husbands buff coat in the floods as the water rolled the body against the garden hedge she called to the men in the boat she was glad he was found they dragged him out of the hedge they could not lift him into the boat fred brangwen jumped into the water up to his waist and half carried the body of his father through the flood to the road hay and twigs and dirt were in the beard and hair the youth pushed through the water crying loudly without tears like a stricken animal the mother at the window cried making no trouble  the doctor came but the body was dead they carried it up to cossethay to annas house  when anna brangwen heard the news she pressed back her head and rolled her eyes as if something were reaching forward to bite at her throat she pressed back her head her mind was driven back to sleep since she had married and become a mother the girl she had been was forgotten now the shock threatened to break in upon her and sweep away all her intervening life make her as a girl of eighteen again loving her father so she pressed back away from the shock she clung to her present life  it was when they brought him to her house dead and in his wet clothes his wet sodden clothes fully dressed as he came from market yet all sodden and inert that the shock really broke into her and she was terrified a big soaked inert heap he was who had been to her the image of power and strong life  almost in horror she began to take the wet things from him to pull off him the incongruous marketclothes of a welltodo farmer the children were sent away to the vicarage the dead body lay on the parlour floor anna quickly began to undress him laid his fob and seals in a wet heap on the table her husband and the woman helped her they cleared and washed the body and laid it on the bed  there it looked still and grand he was perfectly calm in death and now he was laid in line inviolable unapproachable to anna he was the majesty of the inaccessible male the majesty of death it made her still and awestricken almost glad  lydia brangwen the mother also came and saw the impressive inviolable body of the dead man she went pale seeing death he was beyond change or knowledge absolute laid in line with the infinite what had she to do with him he was a majestic abstraction made visible now for a moment inviolate absolute and who could lay claim to him who could speak of him of the him who was revealed in the stripped moment of transit from life into death neither the living nor the dead could claim him he was both the one and the other inviolable inaccessibly himself  i shared life with you i belong in my own way to eternity said lydia brangwen her heart cold knowing her own singleness  i did not know you in life you are beyond me supreme now in death said anna brangwen awestricken almost glad  it was the sons who could not bear it fred brangwen went about with a set blanched face and shut hands his heart full of hatred and rage for what had been done to his father bleeding also with desire to have his father again to see him to hear him again he could not bear it  tom brangwen only arrived on the day of the funeral he was quiet and controlled as ever he kissed his mother who was still darkfaced inscrutable he shook hands with his brother without looking at him he saw the great coffin with its black handles he even read the nameplate tom brangwen of the marsh farm born  died   the goodlooking still face of the young man crinkled up for a moment in a terrible grimace then resumed its stillness the coffin was carried round to the church the funeral bell tanged at intervals the mourners carried their wreaths of white flowers the mother the polish woman went with dark abstract face on her sons arm he was goodlooking as ever his face perfectly motionless and somehow pleasant fred walked with anna she strange and winsome he with a face like wood stiff unyielding  only afterwards ursula flitting between the currant bushes down the garden saw her uncle tom standing in his black clothes erect and fashionable but his fists lifted and his face distorted his lips curled back from his teeth in a horrible grin like an animal which grimaces with torment whilst his body panted quick like a panting dogs he was facing the open distance panting and holding still then panting rapidly again but his face never changing from its almost bestial look of torture the teeth all showing the nose wrinkled up the eyes unseeing fixed  terrified ursula slipped away and when her uncle tom was in the house again grave and very quiet so that he seemed almost to affect gravity to pretend grief she watched his still handsome face imagining it again in its distortion but she saw the nose was rather thick rather russian under its transparent skin she remembered the teeth under the carefully cut moustache were small and sharp and spaced she could see him in all his elegant demeanour bestial almost corrupt and she was frightened she never forgot to look for the bestial frightening side of him after this  he said goodbye to his mother and went away at once ursula almost shrank from his kiss now she wanted it nevertheless and the little revulsion as well  at the funeral and after the funeral will brangwen was madly in love with his wife the death had shaken him but death and all seemed to gather in him into a mad overwhelming passion for his wife she seemed so strange and winsome he was almost beside himself with desire for her  and she took him she seemed ready for him she wanted him  the grandmother stayed a while at the yew cottage till the marsh was restored then she returned to her own rooms quiet and it seemed wanting nothing fred threw himself into the work of restoring the farm that his father was killed there seemed to make it only the more intimate and the more inevitably his own place  there was a saying that the brangwens always died a violent death to them all except perhaps tom it seemed almost natural yet fred went about obstinate his heart fixed he could never forgive the unknown this murder of his father  after the death of the father the marsh was very quiet mrs brangwen was unsettled she could not sit all the evening peacefully as she could before and during the day she was always rising to her feet and hesitating as if she must go somewhere and were not quite sure whither  she was seen loitering about the garden in her little woollen jacket she was often driven out in the gig sitting beside her son and watching the countryside or the streets of the town with a childish candid uncanny face as if it all were strange to her  the children ursula and gudrun and theresa went by the garden gate on their way to school the grandmother would have them call in each time they passed she would have them come to the marsh for dinner she wanted children about her  of her sons she was almost afraid she could see the sombre passion and desire and dissatisfaction in them and she wanted not to see it any more even fred with his blue eyes and his heavy jaw troubled her there was no peace he wanted something he wanted love passion and he could not find them but why must he trouble her why must he come to her with his seething and suffering and dissatisfactions she was too old  tom was more restrained reserved he kept his body very still but he troubled her even more she could not but see the black depths of disintegration in his eyes the sudden glance upon her as if she could save him as if he would reveal himself  and how could age save youth youth must go to youth always the storm could she not lie in peace these years in the quiet apart from life no always the swell must heave upon her and break against the barriers always she must be embroiled in the seethe and rage and passion endless endless going on for ever and she wanted to draw away she wanted at last her own innocence and peace she did not want her sons to force upon her any more the old brutal story of desire and offerings and deep deephidden rage of unsatisfied men against women she wanted to be beyond it all to know the peace and innocence of age  she had never been a woman to work much so that now she would stand often at the gardengate watching the scant world go by and the sight of children pleased her made her happy she had usually an apple or a few sweets in her pocket she liked children to smile at her  she never went to her husbands grave she spoke of him simply as if he were alive sometimes the tears would run down her face in helpless sadness then she recovered and was herself again happy  on wet days she stayed in bed her bedroom was her city of refuge where she could lie down and muse and muse sometimes fred would read to her but that did not mean much she had so many dreams to dream over such an unsifted store she wanted time  her chief friend at this period was ursula the little girl and the musing fragile woman of sixty seemed to understand the same language at cossethay all was activity and passion everything moved upon poles of passion then there were four children younger than ursula a throng of babies all the time many lives beating against each other  so that for the eldest child the peace of the grandmothers bedroom was exquisite here ursula came as to a hushed paradisal land here her own existence became simple and exquisite to her as if she were a flower  always on saturdays she came down to the marsh and always clutching a little offering either a little mat made of strips of coloured woven paper or a tiny basket made in the kindergarten lesson or a little crayon drawing of a bird  when she appeared in the doorway tilly ancient but still in authority would crane her skinny neck to see who it was  oh its you is it she said i thought we should be seein you my word thats a bobbydazzlin posy youve brought  it was curious how tilly preserved the spirit of tom brangwen who was dead in the marsh ursula always connected her with her grandfather  this day the child had brought a tight little nosegay of pinks white ones with a rim of pink ones she was very proud of it and very shy because of her pride  your granmothers in her bed wipe your shoes well if youre goin up and dont go burstin in on her like a skyrocket my word but thats a fine posy did you do it all by yourself an all  tilly stealthily ushered her into the bedroom the child entered with a strange dragging hesitation characteristic of her when she was moved her grandmother was sitting up in bed wearing a little grey woollen jacket  the child hesitated in silence near the bed clutching the nosegay in front of her her childish eyes were shining the grandmothers grey eyes shone with a similar light  how pretty she said how pretty you have made them what a darling little bunch  ursula glowing thrust them into her grandmothers hand saying i made them you  that is how the peasants tied them at home said the grandmother pushing the pinks with her fingers and smelling them just such tight little bunches and they make wreaths for their hairthey weave the stalks then they go round with wreaths in their hair and wearing their best aprons  ursula immediately imagined herself in this storyland  did you used to have a wreath in your hair grandmother  when i was a little girl i had golden hair something like katies then i used to have a wreath of little blue flowers oh so blue that come when the snow is gone andrey the coachman used to bring me the very first  they talked and then tilly brought the teatray set for two ursula had a special green and gold cup kept for herself at the marsh there was thin bread and butter and cress for tea it was all special and wonderful she ate very daintily with little fastidious bites  why do you have two weddingrings grandmothermust you asked the child noticing her grandmothers ivory coloured hand with blue veins above the tray  if i had two husbands child  ursula pondered a moment  then you must wear both rings together  yes  which was my grandfathers ring  the woman hesitated  this grandfather whom you knew this was his ring the red one the yellow one was your other grandfathers whom you never knew  ursula looked interestedly at the two rings on the proffered finger  where did he buy it you she asked  this one in warsaw i think  you didnt know my own grandfather then  not this grandfather  ursula pondered this fascinating intelligence  did he have white whiskers as well  no his beard was dark you have his brows i think  ursula ceased and became selfconscious she at once identified herself with her polish grandfather  and did he have brown eyes  yes dark eyes he was a clever man as quick as a lion he was never still  lydia still resented lensky when she thought of him she was always younger than he she was always twenty or twentyfive and under his domination he incorporated her in his ideas as if she were not a person herself as if she were just his aidedecamp or part of his baggage or one among his surgical appliances she still resented it and he was always only thirty he had died when he was thirtyfour she did not feel sorry for him he was older than she yet she still ached in the thought of those days  did you like my first grandfather best asked ursula  i liked them both said the grandmother  and thinking she became again lenskys girlbride he was of good family of better family even than her own for she was half german she was a young girl in a house of insecure fortune and he an intellectual a clever surgeon and physician had loved her how she had looked up to him she remembered her first transports when he talked to her the important young man with the severe black beard he had seemed so wonderful such an authority after her own lax household his gravity and confident hard authority seemed almost godlike to her for she had never known it in her life all her surroundings had been loose lax disordered a welter  miss lydia will you marry me he had said to her in german in his grave yet tremulous voice she had been afraid of his dark eyes upon her they did not see her they were fixed upon her and he was hard confident she thrilled with the excitement of it and accepted during the courtship his kisses were a wonder to her she always thought about them and wondered over them she never wanted to kiss him back in her idea the man kissed and the woman examined in her soul the kisses she had received  she had never quite recovered from her prostration of the first days or nights of marriage he had taken her to vienna and she was utterly alone with him utterly alone in another world everything everything foreign even he foreign to her then came the real marriage passion came to her and she became his slave he was her lord her lord she was the girlbride the slave she kissed his feet she had thought it an honour to touch his body to unfasten his boots for two years she had gone on as his slave crouching at his feet embracing his knees  children had come he had followed his ideas she was there for him just to keep him in condition she was to him one of the baser or material conditions necessary for his welfare in prosecuting his ideas of nationalism of liberty of science  but gradually at twentythree twentyfour she began to realize that she too might consider these ideas by his acceptance of her selfsubordination he exhausted the feeling in her there were those of his associates who would discuss the ideas with her though he did not wish to do so himself she adventured into the minds of other men his then was not the only male mind she did not exist then just as his attribute she began to perceive the attention of other men an excitement came over her she remembered now the men who had paid her court when she was married in warsaw  then the rebellion broke out and she was inspired too she would go as a nurse at her husbands side he worked like a lion he wore his life out and she followed him helplessly but she disbelieved in him he was so separate he ignored so much he counted too much on himself his work his ideasdid nothing else matter  then the children were dead and for her everything became remote he became remote she saw him she saw him go white when he heard the news then frown as if he thought why have they died now when i have no time to grieve  he has no time to grieve she had said in her remote awful soul he has no time it is so important what he does he is then so selfimportant this halffrenzied man nothing matters but this work of rebellion he has not time to grieve nor to think of his children he had not time even to beget them really  she had let him go on alone but in the chaos she had worked by his side again and out of the chaos she had fled with him to london  he was a broken cold man he had no affection for her nor for anyone he had failed in his work so everything had failed he stiffened and died  she could not subscribe he had failed everything had failed yet behind the failure was the unyielding passion of life the individual effort might fail but not the human joy she belonged to the human joy  he died and went his way but not before there was another child and this little ursula was his grandchild she was glad of it for she still honoured him though he had been mistaken  she lydia brangwen was sorry for him now he was deadhe had scarcely lived he had never known her he had lain with her but he had never known her he had never received what she could give him he had gone away from her empty so he had never lived so he had died and passed away yet there had been strength and power in him  she could scarcely forgive him that he had never lived if it were not for anna and for this little ursula who had his brows there would be no more left of him than of a broken vessel thrown away and just remembered  tom brangwen had served her he had come to her and taken from her he had died and gone his way into death but he had made himself immortal in his knowledge with her so she had her place here in life and in immortality for he had taken his knowledge of her into death so that she had her place in death in my fathers house are many mansions  she loved both her husbands to one she had been a naked little girlbride running to serve him the other she loved out of fulfilment because he was good and had given her being because he had served her honourably and become her man one with her  she was established in this stretch of life she had come to herself during her first marriage she had not existed except through him he was the substance and she the shadow running at his feet she was very glad she had come to her own self she was grateful to brangwen she reached out to him in gratitude into death  in her heart she felt a vague tenderness and pity for her first husband who had been her lord he was so wrong when he died she could not bear it that he had never lived never really become himself and he had been her lord strange it all had been why had he been her lord he seemed now so far off so without bearing on her  which did you grandmother  what  like best  i liked them both i married the first when i was quite a girl then i loved your grandfather when i was a woman there is a difference  they were silent for a time  did you cry when my first grandfather died the child asked  lydia brangwen rocked herself on the bed thinking aloud  when we came to england he hardly ever spoke he was too much concerned to take any notice of anybody he grew thinner and thinner till his cheeks were hollow and his mouth stuck out he wasnt handsome any more i knew he couldnt bear being beaten i thought everything was lost in the world only i had your mother a baby it was no use my dying  he looked at me with his black eyes almost as if he hated me when he was ill and said it only wanted this it only wanted that i should leave you and a young child to starve in this london i told him we should not starve but i was young and foolish and frightened which he knew  he was bitter and he never gave way he lay beating his brains to see what he could do i dont know what you will do he said i am no good i am a failure from beginning to end i cannot even provide for my wife and child  but you see it was not for him to provide for us my life went on though his stopped and i married your grandfather  i ought to have known i ought to have been able to say to him dont be so bitter dont die because this has failed you are not the beginning and the end but i was too young he had never let me become myself i thought he was truly the beginning and the end so i let him take all upon himself yet all did not depend on him life must go on and i must marry your grandfather and have your uncle tom and your uncle fred we cannot take so much upon ourselves  the childs heart beat fast as she listened to these things she could not understand but she seemed to feel faroff things it gave her a deep joyous thrill to know she hailed from far off from poland and that darkbearded impressive man strange her antecedents were and she felt fate on either side of her terrible  almost every day ursula saw her grandmother and every time they talked together till the grandmothers sayings and stories told in the complete hush of the marsh bedroom accumulated with mystic significance and became a sort of bible to the child  and ursula asked her deepest childish questions of her grandmother  will somebody love me grandmother  many people love you child we all love you  but when i am grown up will somebody love me  yes some man will love you child because its your nature and i hope it will be somebody who will love you for what you are and not for what he wants of you but we have a right to what we want  ursula was frightened hearing these things her heart sank she felt she had no ground under her feet she clung to her grandmother here was peace and security here from her grandmothers peaceful room the door opened on to the greater space the past which was so big that all it contained seemed tiny loves and births and deaths tiny units and features within a vast horizon that was a great relief to know the tiny importance of the individual within the great past    chapter x  the widening circle  it was very burdensome to ursula that she was the eldest of the family by the time she was eleven she had to take to school gudrun and theresa and catherine the boy william always called billy so that he should not be confused with his father was a lovable rather delicate child of three so he stayed at home as yet there was another baby girl called cassandra  the children went for a time to the little church school just near the marsh it was the only place within reach and being so small mrs brangwen felt safe in sending her children there though the village boys did nickname ursula urtler and gudrun goodrunner and theresa teapot  gudrun and ursula were comates the second child with her long sleepy body and her endless chain of fancies would have nothing to do with realities she was not for them she was for her own fancies ursula was the one for realities so gudrun left all such to her elder sister and trusted in her implicitly indifferently ursula had a great tenderness for her comate sister  it was no good trying to make gudrun responsible she floated along like a fish in the sea perfect within the medium of her own difference and being other existence did not trouble her only she believed in ursula and trusted to ursula  the eldest child was very much fretted by her responsibility for the other young ones especially theresa a sturdy boldeyed thing had a faculty for warfare  our ursula billy pillins has lugged my hair  what did you say to him  i said nothing  then the brangwen girls were in for a feud with the pillinses or phillipses  you wont pull my hair again billy pillins said theresa walking with her sisters and looking superbly at the freckled redhaired boy  why shant i retorted billy pillins  you wont because you dursnt said the tiresome theresa  you come here then teapot an see if i dursna  up marched teapot and immediately billy pillins lugged her black snaky locks in a rage she flew at him immediately in rushed ursula and gudrun and little katie in clashed the other phillipses clem and walter and eddie anthony then there was a fray the brangwen girls were wellgrown and stronger than many boys but for pinafores and long hair they would have carried easy victories they went home however with hair lugged and pinafores torn it was a joy to the phillips boys to rip the pinafores of the brangwen girls  then there was an outcry mrs brangwen would not have it no she would not all her innate dignity and standoffishness rose up then there was the vicar lecturing the school it was a sad thing that the boys of cossethay could not behave more like gentlemen to the girls of cossethay indeed what kind of boy was it that should set upon a girl and kick her and beat her and tear her pinafore that boy deserved severe castigation and the name of coward for no boy who was not a cowardetc etc  meanwhile much hangdog fury in the pillinses hearts much virtue in the brangwen girls particularly in theresas and the feud continued with periods of extraordinary amity when ursula was clem phillipss sweetheart and gudrun was walters and theresa was billys and even the tiny katie had to be eddie antnys sweetheart there was the closest union at every possible moment the little gang of brangwens and phillipses flew together yet neither ursula nor gudrun would have any real intimacy with the phillips boys it was a sort of fiction to them this alliance and this dubbing of sweethearts  again mrs brangwen rose up  ursula i will not have you raking the roads with lads so i tell you now stop it and the rest will stop it  how ursula hated always to represent the little brangwen club she could never be herself no she was always ursulagudruntheresacatherineand later even billy was added on to her moreover she did not want the phillipses either she was out of taste with them  however the brangwenpillins coalition readily broke down owing to the unfair superiority of the brangwens the brangwens were rich they had free access to the marsh farm the school teachers were almost respectful to the girls the vicar spoke to them on equal terms the brangwen girls presumed they tossed their heads  youre not ivrybody urtler brangwin uglymug said clem phillips his face going very red  im better than you for all that retorted urtler  you think you arewi a face like thatugly mugurtler brangwin he began to jeer trying to set all the others in cry against her then there was hostility again how she hated their jeering she became cold against the phillipses ursula was very proud in her family the brangwen girls had all a curious blind dignity even a kind of nobility in their bearing by some result of breed and upbringing they seemed to rush along their own lives without caring that they existed to other people never from the start did it occur to ursula that other people might hold a low opinion of her she thought that whosoever knew her knew she was enough and accepted her as such she thought it was a world of people like herself she suffered bitterly if she were forced to have a low opinion of any person and she never forgave that person  this was maddening to many little people all their lives the brangwens were meeting folk who tried to pull them down to make them seem little curiously the mother was aware of what would happen and was always ready to give her children the advantage of the move  when ursula was twelve and the common school and the companionship of the village children niggardly and begrudging was beginning to affect her anna sent her with gudrun to the grammar school in nottingham this was a great release for ursula she had a passionate craving to escape from the belittling circumstances of life the little jealousies the little differences the little meannesses it was a torture to her that the phillipses were poorer and meaner than herself that they used mean little reservations took petty little advantages she wanted to be with her equals but not by diminishing herself she did want clem phillips to be her equal but by some puzzling painful fate or other when he was really there with her he produced in her a tight feeling in the head she wanted to beat her forehead to escape  then she found that the way to escape was easy one departed from the whole circumstance one went away to the grammar school and left the little school the meagre teachers the phillipses whom she had tried to love but who had made her fail and whom she could not forgive she had an instinctive fear of petty people as a deer is afraid of dogs because she was blind she could not calculate nor estimate people she must think that everybody was just like herself  she measured by the standard of her own people her father and mother her grandmother her uncles her beloved father so utterly simple in his demeanour yet with his strong dark soul fixed like a root in unexpressed depths that fascinated and terrified her her mother so strangely free of all money and convention and fear entirely indifferent to the world standing by herself without connection her grandmother who had come from so far and was centred in so wide an horizon people must come up to these standards before they could be ursulas people  so even as a girl of twelve she was glad to burst the narrow boundary of cossethay where only limited people lived outside was all vastness and a throng of real proud people whom she would love  going to school by train she must leave home at a quarter to eight in the morning and she did not arrive again till halfpast five at evening of this she was glad for the house was small and overful it was a storm of movement whence there had been no escape she hated so much being in charge  the house was a storm of movement the children were healthy and turbulent the mother only wanted their animal wellbeing to ursula as she grew a little older it became a nightmare when she saw later a rubens picture with storms of naked babies and found this was called fecundity she shuddered and the world became abhorrent to her she knew as a child what it was to live amidst storms of babies in the heat and swelter of fecundity and as a child she was against her mother passionately against her mother she craved for some spirituality and stateliness  in bad weather home was a bedlam children dashed in and out of the rain to the puddles under the dismal yew trees across the wet flagstones of the kitchen whilst the cleaningwoman grumbled and scolded children were swarming on the sofa children were kicking the piano in the parlour to make it sound like a beehive children were rolling on the hearthrug legs in air pulling a book in two between them children fiendish ubiquitous were stealing upstairs to find out where our ursula was whispering at bedroom doors hanging on the latch calling mysteriously ursula ursula to the girl who had locked herself in to read and it was hopeless the locked door excited their sense of mystery she had to open to dispel the lure these children hung on to her with roundeyed excited questions  the mother flourished amid all this  better have them noisy than ill she said  but the growing girls in turn suffered bitterly ursula was just coming to the stage when andersen and grimm were being left behind for the idylls of the king and romantic lovestories    elaine the fair elaine the lovable    elaine the lily maid of astolat    high in her chamber in a tower to the east    guarded the sacred shield of launcelot  how she loved it how she leaned in her bedroom window with her black rough hair on her shoulders and her warm face all rapt and gazed across at the churchyard and the little church which was a turreted castle whence launcelot would ride just now would wave to her as he rode by his scarlet cloak passing behind the dark yew trees and between the open space whilst she ah she would remain the lonely maid high up and isolated in the tower polishing the terrible shield weaving it a covering with a true device and waiting waiting always remote and high  at which point there would be a faint scuffle on the stairs a lightpitched whispering outside the door and a creaking of the latch then billy excited whispering  its lockedits locked  then the knocking kicking at the door with childish knees and the urgent childish  ursulaour ursula ursula eh our ursula  no reply  ursula ehour ursula the name was shouted now still no answer  mother she wont answer came the yell shes dead  go awayim not dead what do you want came the angry voice of the girl  open the door our ursula came the complaining cry it was all over she must open the door she heard the screech of the bucket downstairs dragged across the flagstones as the woman washed the kitchen floor and the children were prowling in the bedroom asking  what were you doing what had you locked the door for then she discovered the key of the parish room and betook herself there and sat on some sacks with her books there began another dream  she was the only daughter of the old lord she was gifted with magic day followed day of rapt silence whilst she wandered ghostlike in the hushed ancient mansion or flitted along the sleeping terraces  here a grave grief attacked her that her hair was dark she must have fair hair and a white skin she was rather bitter about her black mane  never mind she would dye it when she grew up or bleach it in the sun till it was bleached fair meanwhile she wore a fair white coif of pure venetian lace  she flitted silently along the terraces where jewelled lizards basked upon the stone and did not move when her shadow fell upon them in the utter stillness she heard the tinkle of the fountain and smelled the roses whose blossoms hung rich and motionless so she drifted drifted on the wistful feet of beauty past the water and the swans to the noble park where underneath a great oak a doe all dappled lay with her four fine feet together her fawn nestling suncoloured beside her  oh and this doe was her familiar it would talk to her because she was a magician it would tell her stories as if the sunshine spoke  then one day she left the door of the parish room unlocked careless and unheeding as she always was the children found their way in katie cut her finger and howled billy hacked notches in the fine chisels and did much damage there was a great commotion  the crossness of the mother was soon finished ursula locked up the room again and considered all was over then her father came in with the notched tools his forehead knotted  who the deuce opened the door he cried in anger  it was ursula who opened the door said her mother he had a duster in his hand he turned and flapped the cloth hard across the girls face the cloth stung for a moment the girl was as if stunned then she remained motionless her face closed and stubborn but her heart was blazing in spite of herself the tears surged higher in spite of her they surged higher  in spite of her her face broke she made a curious gulping grimace and the tears were falling so she went away desolate but her blazing heart was fierce and unyielding he watched her go and a pleasurable pain filled him a sense of triumph and easy power followed immediately by acute pity  im sure that was unnecessaryto hit the girl across the face said the mother coldly  a flip with the duster wont hurt her he said  nor will it do her any good  for days for weeks ursulas heart burned from this rebuff she felt so cruelly vulnerable did he not know how vulnerable she was how exposed and wincing he of all people knew and he wanted to do this to her he wanted to hurt her right through her closest sensitiveness he wanted to treat her with shame to maim her with insult  her heart burnt in isolation like a watchfire lighted she did not forget she did not forget she never forgot when she returned to her love for her father the seed of mistrust and defiance burned unquenched though covered up far from sight she no longer belonged to him unquestioned slowly slowly the fire of mistrust and defiance burned in her burned away her connection with him  she ran a good deal alone having a passion for all moving active things she loved the little brooks wherever she found a little running water she was happy it seemed to make her run and sing in spirit along with it she could sit for hours by a brook or stream on the roots of the alders and watch the water hasten dancing over the stones or among the twigs of a fallen branch sometimes little fish vanished before they had become real like hallucinations sometimes wagtails ran by the waters brink sometimes other little birds came to drink she saw a kingfisher darting blueand then she was very happy the kingfisher was the key to the magic world he was witness of the border of enchantment  but she must move out of the intricately woven illusion of her life the illusion of a father whose life was an odyssey in an outer world the illusion of her grandmother of realities so shadowy and faroff that they became as mystic symbolspeasantgirls with wreaths of blue flowers in their hair the sledges and the depths of winter the darkbearded young grandfather marriage and war and death then the multitude of illusions concerning herself how she was truly a princess of poland how in england she was under a spell she was not really this ursula brangwen then the mirage of her reading out of the multicoloured illusion of this her life she must move on to the grammar school in nottingham  she was shy and she suffered for one thing she bit her nails and had a cruel consciousness in her fingertips a shame an exposure out of all proportion this shame haunted her she spent hours of torture conjuring how she might keep her gloves on if she might say her hands were scalded if she might seem to forget to take off her gloves  for she was going to inherit her own estate when she went to the high school there each girl was a lady there she was going to walk among free souls her comates and her equals and all petty things would be put away ah if only she did not bite her nails if only she had not this blemish she wanted so much to be perfectwithout spot or blemish living the high noble life  it was a grief to her that her father made such a poor introduction he was brief as ever like a boy saying his errand and his clothes looked illfitting and casual whereas ursula would have liked robes and a ceremonial of introduction to this her new estate  she made a new illusion of school miss grey the headmistress had a certain silvery schoolmistressy beauty of character the school itself had been a gentlemans house dark sombre lawns separated it from the dark select avenue but its rooms were large and of good appearance and from the back one looked over lawns and shrubbery over the trees and the grassy slope of the arboretum to the town which heaped the hollow with its roofs and cupolas and its shadows  so ursula seated herself upon the hill of learning looking down on the smoke and confusion and the manufacturing engrossed activity of the town she was happy up here in the grammar school she fancied the air was finer beyond the factory smoke she wanted to learn latin and greek and french and mathematics she trembled like a postulant when she wrote the greek alphabet for the first time  she was upon another hillslope whose summit she had not scaled there was always the marvellous eagerness in her heart to climb and to see beyond a latin verb was virgin soil to her she sniffed a new odour in it it meant something though she did not know what it meant but she gathered it up it was significant when she knew that      x2y2  x  yxy  then she felt that she had grasped something that she was liberated into an intoxicating air rare and unconditioned and she was very glad as she wrote her french exercise  jai donne le pain a mon petit frere  in all these things there was the sound of a bugle to her heart exhilarating summoning her to perfect places she never forgot her brown longmans first french grammar nor her via latina with its red edges nor her little grey algebra book there was always a magic in them  at learning she was quick intelligent instinctive but she was not thorough if a thing did not come to her instinctively she could not learn it and then her mad rage of loathing for all lessons her bitter contempt of all teachers and schoolmistresses her recoil to a fierce animal arrogance made her detestable  she was a free unabateable animal she declared in her revolts there was no law for her nor any rule she existed for herself alone then ensued a long struggle with everybody in which she broke down at last when she had run the full length of her resistance and sobbed her heart out desolate and afterwards in a chastened washedout bodiless state she received the understanding that would not come before and went her way sadder and wiser  ursula and gudrun went to school together gudrun was a shy quiet wild creature a thin slip of a thing hanging back from notice or twisting past to disappear into her own world again she seemed to avoid all contact instinctively and pursued her own intent way pursuing halfformed fancies that had no relation to anyone else  she was not clever at all she thought ursula clever enough for two ursula understood so why should she gudrun bother herself the younger girl lived her religious responsible life in her sister by proxy for herself she was indifferent and intent as a wild animal and as irresponsible  when she found herself at the bottom of the class she laughed lazily and was content saying she was safe now she did not mind her fathers chagrin nor her mothers tinge of mortification  what do i pay for you to go to nottingham for her father asked exasperated  well dad you know you neednt pay for me she replied nonchalant im ready to stop at home  she was happy at home ursula was not slim and unwilling abroad gudrun was easy in her own house as a wild thing in its lair whereas ursula attentive and keen abroad at home was reluctant uneasy unwilling to be herself or unable  nevertheless sunday remained the maximum day of the week for both ursula turned passionately to it to the sense of eternal security it gave she suffered anguish of fears during the weekdays for she felt strong powers that would not recognize her there was upon her always a fear and a dislike of authority she felt she could always do as she wanted if she managed to avoid a battle with authority and the authorised powers but if she gave herself away she would be lost destroyed there was always the menace against her  this strange sense of cruelty and ugliness always imminent ready to seize hold upon her this feeling of the grudging power of the mob lying in wait for her who was the exception formed one of the deepest influences of her life wherever she was at school among friends in the street in the train she instinctively abated herself made herself smaller feigned to be less than she was for fear that her undiscovered self should be seen pounced upon attacked by brutish resentment of the commonplace the average self  she was fairly safe at school now she knew how to take her place there and how much of herself to reserve but she was free only on sundays when she was but a girl of fourteen she began to feel a resentment growing against her in her own home she knew she was the disturbing influence there but as yet on sundays she was free really free free to be herself without fear or misgiving  even at its stormiest sunday was a blessed day ursula woke to it with a feeling of immense relief she wondered why her heart was so light then she remembered it was sunday a gladness seemed to burst out around her a feeling of great freedom the whole world was for twentyfour hours revoked put back only the sunday world existed  she loved the very confusion of the household it was lucky if the children slept till seven oclock usually soon after six a chirp was heard a voice an excited chirrup began announcing the creation of a new day there was a thudding of quick little feet and the children were up and about scampering in their shirts with pink legs and glistening flossy hair all clean from the saturdays night bathing their souls excited by their bodies cleanliness  as the house began to teem with rushing halfnaked clean children one of the parents rose either the mother easy and slatternly with her thick dark hair loosely coiled and slipping over one ear or the father warm and comfortable with ruffled black hair and shirt unbuttoned at the neck  then the girls upstairs heard the continual  now then billy what are you up to in the fathers strong vibrating voice or the mothers dignified  i have said cassie i will not have it  it was amazing how the fathers voice could ring out like a gong without his being in the least moved and how the mother could speak like a queen holding an audience though her blouse was sticking out all round and her hair was not fastened up and the children were yelling a pandemonium  gradually breakfast was produced and the elder girls came down into the babel whilst halfnaked children flitted round like the wrong ends of cherubs as gudrun said watching the bare little legs and the chubby tails appearing and disappearing  gradually the young ones were captured and nightdresses finally removed ready for the clean sunday shirt but before the sunday shirt was slipped over the fleecy head away darted the naked body to wallow in the sheepskin which formed the parlour rug whilst the mother walked after protesting sharply holding the shirt like a noose and the fathers bronze voice rang out and the naked child wallowing on its back in the deep sheepskin announced gleefully  im bading in the sea mother  why should i walk after you with your shirt said the mother get up now  im bading in the sea mother repeated the wallowing naked figure  we say bathing not bading said the mother with her strange indifferent dignity i am waiting here with your shirt  at length shirts were on and stockings were paired and little trousers buttoned and little petticoats tied behind the besetting cowardice of the family was its shirking of the garter question  where are your garters cassie  i dont know  well look for them  but not one of the elder brangwens would really face the situation after cassie had grovelled under all the furniture and blacked up all her sunday cleanliness to the infinite grief of everybody the garter was forgotten in the new washing of the young face and hands  later ursula would be indignant to see miss cassie marching into church from sunday school with her stocking sluthered down to her ankle and a grubby knee showing  its disgraceful cried ursula at dinner people will think were pigs and the children are never washed  never mind what people think said the mother superbly i see that the child is bathed properly and if i satisfy myself i satisfy everybody she cant keep her stocking up and no garter and it isnt the childs fault she was let to go without one  the garter trouble continued in varying degrees but till each child wore long skirts or long trousers it was not removed  on this day of decorum the brangwen family went to church by the highroad making a detour outside all the gardenhedge rather than climb the wall into the churchyard there was no law of this from the parents the children themselves were the wardens of the sabbath decency very jealous and instant with each other  it came to be gradually that after church on sundays the house was really something of a sanctuary with peace breathing like a strange bird alighted in the rooms indoors only reading and taletelling and quiet pursuits such as drawing were allowed out of doors all playing was to be carried on unobtrusively if there were noise yelling or shouting then some fierce spirit woke up in the father and the elder children so that the younger were subdued afraid of being excommunicated  the children themselves preserved the sabbath if ursula in her vanity sang    il était un bergère    et ronronron petit patapon  theresa was sure to cry  thats not a sunday song our ursula  you dont know replied ursula superior nevertheless she wavered and her song faded down before she came to the end  because though she did not know it her sunday was very precious to her she found herself in a strange undefined place where her spirit could wander in dreams unassailed  the whiterobed spirit of christ passed between olive trees it was a vision not a reality and she herself partook of the visionary being there was the voice in the night calling samuel samuel and still the voice called in the night but not this night nor last night but in the unfathomed night of sunday of the sabbath silence  there was sin the serpent in whom was also wisdom there was judas with the money and the kiss  but there was no actual sin if ursula slapped theresa across the face even on a sunday that was not sin the everlasting it was misbehaviour if billy played truant from sunday school he was bad he was wicked but he was not a sinner  sin was absolute and everlasting wickedness and badness were temporary and relative when billy catching up the local jargon called cassie a sinner everybody detested him yet when there came to the marsh a flippettyfloppetty foxhound puppy he was mischievously christened sinner  the brangwens shrank from applying their religion to their own immediate actions they wanted the sense of the eternal and immortal not a list of rules for everyday conduct therefore they were badlybehaved children headstrong and arrogant though their feelings were generous they had moreoverintolerable to their ordinary neighboursa proud gesture that did not fit with the jealous idea of the democratic christian so that they were always extraordinary outside of the ordinary  how bitterly ursula resented her first acquaintance with evangelical teachings she got a peculiar thrill from the application of salvation to her own personal case jesus died for me he suffered for me there was a pride and a thrill in it followed almost immediately by a sense of dreariness jesus with holes in his hands and feet it was distasteful to her the shadowy jesus with the stigmata that was her own vision but jesus the actual man talking with teeth and lips telling one to put ones finger into his wounds like a villager gloating in his sores repelled her she was enemy of those who insisted on the humanity of christ if he were just a man living in ordinary human life then she was indifferent  but it was the jealousy of vulgar people which must insist on the humanity of christ it was the vulgar mind which would allow nothing extrahuman nothing beyond itself to exist it was the dirty desecrating hands of the revivalists which wanted to drag jesus into this everyday life to dress jesus up in trousers and frockcoat to compel him to a vulgar equality of footing it was the impudent suburban soul which would ask what would jesus do if he were in my shoes  against all this the brangwens stood at bay if any one it was the mother who was caught by or who was most careless of the vulgar clamour she would have nothing extrahuman she never really subscribed all her life to brangwens mystical passion  but ursula was with her father as she became adolescent thirteen fourteen she set more and more against her mothers practical indifference to ursula there was something callous almost wicked in her mothers attitude what did anna brangwen in these years care for god or jesus or angels she was the immediate life of today children were still being born to her she was throng with all the little activities of her family and almost instinctively she resented her husbands slavish service to the church his dark subject hankering to worship an unseen god what did the unrevealed god matter when a man had a young family that needed fettling for let him attend to the immediate concerns of his life not go projecting himself towards the ultimate  but ursula was all for the ultimate she was always in revolt against babies and muddled domesticity to her jesus was another world he was not of this world he did not thrust his hands under her face and pointing to his wounds say  look ursula brangwen i got these for your sake now do as youre told  to her jesus was beautifully remote shining in the distance like a white moon at sunset a crescent moon beckoning as it follows the sun out of our ken sometimes dark clouds standing very far off pricking up into a clear yellow band of sunset of a winter evening reminded her of calvary sometimes the full moon rising bloodred upon the hill terrified her with the knowledge that christ was now dead hanging heavy and dead upon the cross  on sundays this visionary world came to pass she heard the long hush she knew the marriage of dark and light was taking place in church the voice sounded reechoing not from this world as if the church itself were a shell that still spoke the language of creation  the sons of god saw the daughters of men that they were fair and they took them wives of all which they chose  and the lord said my spirit shall not always strive with man for that he also is flesh yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years  there were giants in the earth in those days and also after that when the sons of god came in unto the daughters of men and they bare children unto them the same became mighty men which were of old men of renown  over this ursula was stirred as by a call from far off in those days would not the sons of god have found her fair would she not have been taken to wife by one of the sons of god it was a dream that frightened her for she could not understand it  who were the sons of god was not jesus the only begotten son was not adam the only man created from god yet there were men not begotten by adam who were these and whence did they come they too must derive from god had god many offspring besides adam and besides jesus children whose origin the children of adam cannot recognize and perhaps these children these sons of god had known no expulsion no ignominy of the fall  these came on free feet to the daughters of men and saw they were fair and took them to wife so that the women conceived and brought forth men of renown this was a genuine fate she moved about in the essential days when the sons of god came in unto the daughters of men  nor would any comparison of myths destroy her passion in the knowledge jove had become a bull or a man in order to love a mortal woman he had begotten in her a giant a hero  very good so he had in greece for herself she was no grecian woman not jove nor pan nor any of those gods not even bacchus nor apollo could come to her but the sons of god who took to wife the daughters of men these were such as should take her to wife  she clung to the secret hope the aspiration she lived a dual life one where the facts of daily life encompassed everything being legion and the other wherein the facts of daily life were superseded by the eternal truth so utterly did she desire the sons of god should come to the daughters of men and she believed more in her desire and its fulfilment than in the obvious facts of life the fact that a man was a man did not state his descent from adam did not exclude that he was also one of the unhistoried unaccountable sons of god as yet she was confused but not denied  again she heard the voice  it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into heaven  but it was explained the needles eye was a little gateway for foot passengers through which the great humped camel with his load could not possibly squeeze himself or perhaps at a great risk if he were a little camel he might get through for one could not absolutely exclude the rich man from heaven said the sunday school teachers  it pleased her also to know that in the east one must use hyperbole or else remain unheard because the eastern man must see a thing swelling to fill all heaven or dwindled to a mere nothing before he is suitably impressed she immediately sympathized with this eastern mind  yet the words continued to have a meaning that was untouched either by the knowledge of gateways or hyperboles the historical or local or psychological interest in the words was another thing there remained unaltered the inexplicable value of the saying what was this relation between a needles eye a rich man and heaven what sort of a needles eye what sort of a rich man what sort of heaven who knows it means the absolute world and can never be more than half interpreted in terms of the relative world  but must one apply the speech literally was her father a rich man couldnt he get to heaven or was he only a halfrich man or was he merely a poor man at any rate unless he gave everything away to the poor he would find it much harder to get to heaven the needles eye would be too tight for him she almost wished he were penniless poor if one were coming to the base of it any man was rich who was not as poor as the poorest  she had her qualms when in imagination she saw her father giving away their piano and the two cows and the capital at the bank to the labourers of the district so that they the brangwens should be as poor as the wherrys and she did not want it she was impatient  very well she thought well forego that heaven thats allat any rate the needles eye sort and she dismissed the problem she was not going to be as poor as the wherrys not for all the sayings on earththe miserable squalid wherrys  so she reverted to the nonliteral application of the scriptures her father very rarely read but he had collected many books of reproductions and he would sit and look at these curiously intent like a child yet with a passion that was not childish he loved the early italian painters but particularly giotto and fra angelico and filippo lippi the great compositions cast a spell over him how many times had he turned to raphaels dispute of the sacrament or fra angelicos last judgment or the beautiful complicated renderings of the adoration of the magi and always each time he received the same gradual fulfilment of delight it had to do with the establishment of a whole mystical architectural conception which used the human figure as a unit sometimes he had to hurry home and go to the fra angelico last judgment the pathway of open graves the huddled earth on either side the seemly heaven arranged above the singing process to paradise on the one hand the stuttering descent to hell on the other completed and satisfied him he did not care whether or not he believed in devils or angels the whole conception gave him the deepest satisfaction and he wanted nothing more  ursula accustomed to these pictures from her childhood hunted out their detail she adored fra angelicos flowers and light and angels she liked the demons and enjoyed the hell but the representation of the encircled god surrounded by all the angels on high suddenly bored her the figure of the most high bored her and roused her resentment was this the culmination and the meaning of it all this draped null figure the angels were so lovely and the light so beautiful and only for this to surround such a banality for god  she was dissatisfied but not fit as yet to criticize there was yet so much to wonder over winter came pine branches were torn down in the snow the green pine needles looked rich upon the ground there was the wonderful starry straight track of a pheasants footsteps across the snow imprinted so clear there was the lobbing mark of the rabbit two holes abreast two holes following behind the hare shoved deeper shafts slanting and his two hind feet came down together and made one large pit the cat podded little holes and birds made a lacy pattern  gradually there gathered the feeling of expectation christmas was coming in the shed at nights a secret candle was burning a sound of veiled voices was heard the boys were learning the old mystery play of st george and beelzebub twice a week by lamplight there was choir practice in the church for the learning of old carols brangwen wanted to hear the girls went to these practices everywhere was a sense of mystery and rousedness everybody was preparing for something  the time came near the girls were decorating the church with cold fingers binding holly and fir and yew about the pillars till a new spirit was in the church the stone broke out into dark rich leaf the arches put forth their buds and cold flowers rose to blossom in the dim mystic atmosphere ursula must weave mistletoe over the door and over the screen and hang a silver dove from a sprig of yew till dusk came down and the church was like a grove  in the cowshed the boys were blacking their faces for a dressrehearsal the turkey hung dead with opened speckled wings in the dairy the time was come to make pies in readiness  the expectation grew more tense the star was risen into the sky the songs the carols were ready to hail it the star was the sign in the sky earth too should give a sign as evening drew on hearts beat fast with anticipation hands were full of ready gifts there were the tremulously expectant words of the church service the night was past and the morning was come the gifts were given and received joy and peace made a flapping of wings in each heart there was a great burst of carols the peace of the world had dawned strife had passed away every hand was linked in hand every heart was singing  it was bitter though that christmas day as it drew on to evening and night became a sort of bank holiday flat and stale the morning was so wonderful but in the afternoon and evening the ecstasy perished like a nipped thing like a bud in a false spring alas that christmas was only a domestic feast a feast of sweetmeats and toys why did not the grownups also change their everyday hearts and give way to ecstasy where was the ecstasy  how passionately the brangwens craved for it the ecstasy the father was troubled darkfaced and disconsolate on christmas night because the passion was not there because the day was become as every day and hearts were not aflame upon the mother was a kind of absentness as ever as if she were exiled for all her life where was the fiery heart of joy now the coming was fulfilled where was the star the magis transport the thrill of new being that shook the earth  still it was there even if it were faint and inadequate the cycle of creation still wheeled in the church year after christmas the ecstasy slowly sank and changed sunday followed sunday trailing a fine movement a finely developed transformation over the heart of the family the heart that was big with joy that had seen the star and had followed to the inner walls of the nativity that there had swooned in the great light must now feel the light slowly withdrawing a shadow falling darkening the chill crept in silence came over the earth and then all was darkness the veil of the temple was rent each heart gave up the ghost and sank dead  they moved quietly a little wanness on the lips of the children at good friday feeling the shadow upon their hearts then pale with a deathly scent came the lilies of resurrection that shone coldly till the comforter was given  but why the memory of the wounds and the death surely christ rose with healed hands and feet sound and strong and glad surely the passage of the cross and the tomb was forgotten but noalways the memory of the wounds always the smell of graveclothes a small thing was resurrection compared with the cross and the death in this cycle  so the children lived the year of christianity the epic of the soul of mankind year by year the inner unknown drama went on in them their hearts were born and came to fulness suffered on the cross gave up the ghost and rose again to unnumbered days untired having at least this rhythm of eternity in a ragged inconsequential life  but it was becoming a mechanical action now this drama birth at christmas for death at good friday on easter sunday the lifedrama was as good as finished for the resurrection was shadowy and overcome by the shadow of death the ascension was scarce noticed a mere confirmation of death  what was the hope and the fulfilment nay was it all only a useless afterdeath a wan bodiless afterdeath alas and alas for the passion of the human heart that must die so long before the body was dead  for from the grave after the passion and the trial of anguish the body rose torn and chill and colourless did not christ say mary and when she turned with outstretched hands to him did he not hasten to add touch me not for i am not yet ascended to my father  then how could the hands rejoice or the heart be glad seeing themselves repulsed alas for the resurrection of the dead body alas for the wavering glimmering appearance of the risen christ alas for the ascension into heaven which is a shadow within death a complete passing away  alas that so soon the drama is over that life is ended at thirtythree that the half of the year of the soul is cold and historiless alas that a risen christ has no place with us alas that the memory of the passion of sorrow and death and the grave holds triumph over the pale fact of resurrection  but why why shall i not rise with my body whole and perfect shining with strong life why when mary says rabboni shall i not take her in my arms and kiss her and hold her to my breast why is the risen body deadly and abhorrent with wounds  the resurrection is to life not to death shall i not see those who have risen again walk here among men perfect in body and spirit whole and glad in the flesh living in the flesh loving in the flesh begetting children in the flesh arrived at last to wholeness perfect without scar or blemish healthy without fear of ill health is this not the period of manhood and of joy and fulfilment after the resurrection who shall be shadowed by death and the cross being risen and who shall fear the mystic perfect flesh that belongs to heaven  can i not then walk this earth in gladness being risen from sorrow can i not eat with my brother happily and with joy kiss my beloved after my resurrection celebrate my marriage in the flesh with feastings go about my business eagerly in the joy of my fellows is heaven impatient for me and bitter against this earth that i should hurry off or that i should linger pale and untouched is the flesh which was crucified become as poison to the crowds in the street or is it as a strong gladness and hope to them as the first flower blossoming out of the earths humus    chapter xii  first love  as ursula passed from girlhood towards womanhood gradually the cloud of selfresponsibility gathered upon her she became aware of herself that she was a separate entity in the midst of an unseparated obscurity that she must go somewhere she must become something and she was afraid troubled why oh why must one grow up why must one inherit this heavy numbing responsibility of living an undiscovered life out of the nothingness and the undifferentiated mass to make something of herself but what in the obscurity and pathlessness to take a direction but whither how take even one step and yet how stand still this was torment indeed to inherit the responsibility of ones own life  the religion which had been another world for her a glorious sort of playworld where she lived climbing the tree with the shortstatured man walking shakily on the sea like the disciple breaking the bread into five thousand portions like the lord giving a great picnic to five thousand people now fell away from reality and became a tale a myth an illusion which however much one might assert it to be true an historical fact one knew was not trueat least for this presentday life of ours there could within the limits of this life we know be no feeding of the five thousand and the girl had come to the point where she held that that which one cannot experience in daily life is not true for oneself  so the old duality of life wherein there had been a weekday world of people and trains and duties and reports and besides that a sunday world of absolute truth and living mystery of walking upon the waters and being blinded by the face of the lord of following the pillar of cloud across the desert and watching the bush that crackled yet did not burn away this old unquestioned duality suddenly was found to be broken apart the weekday world had triumphed over the sunday world the sunday world was not real or at least not actual and one lived by action  only the weekday world mattered she herself ursula brangwen must know how to take the weekday life her body must be a weekday body held in the worlds estimate her soul must have a weekday value known according to the worlds knowledge  well then there was a weekday life to live of action and deeds and so there was a necessity to choose ones action and ones deeds one was responsible to the world for what one did  nay one was more than responsible to the world one was responsible to oneself there was some puzzling tormenting residue of the sunday world within her some persistent sunday self which insisted upon a relationship with the now shedaway vision world how could one keep up a relationship with that which one denied her task was now to learn the weekday life  how to act that was the question whither to go how to become oneself one was not oneself one was merely a halfstated question how to become oneself how to know the question and the answer of oneself when one was merely an unfixed somethingnothing blowing about like the winds of heaven undefined unstated  she turned to the visions which had spoken faroff words that ran along the blood like ripples of an unseen wind she heard the words again she denied the vision for she must be a weekday person to whom visions were not true and she demanded only the weekday meaning of the words  there were words spoken by the vision and words must have a weekday meaning since words were weekday stuff let them speak now let them bespeak themselves in weekday terms the vision should translate itself into weekday terms  sell all thou hast and give to the poor she heard on sunday morning that was plain enough plain enough for monday morning too as she went down the hill to the station going to school she took the saying with her  sell all thou hast and give to the poor  did she want to do that did she want to sell her pearlbacked brush and mirror her silver candlestick her pendant her lovely little necklace and go dressed in drab like the wherrys the unlovely uncombed wherrys who were the poor to her she did not  she walked this monday morning on the verge of misery for she did want to do what was right and she didnt want to do what the gospels said she didnt want to be poorreally poor the thought was a horror to her to live like the wherrys so ugly to be at the mercy of everybody  sell that thou hast and give to the poor  one could not do it in real life how dreary and hopeless it made her  nor could one turn the other cheek theresa slapped ursula on the face ursula in a mood of christian humility silently presented the other side of her face which theresa in exasperation at the challenge also hit whereupon ursula with boiling heart went meekly away  but anger and deep writhing shame tortured her so she was not easy till she had again quarrelled with theresa and had almost shaken her sisters head off  thatll teach you she said grimly  and she went away unchristian but clean  there was something unclean and degrading about this humble side of christianity ursula suddenly revolted to the other extreme  i hate the wherrys and i wish they were dead why does my father leave us in the lurch like this making us be poor and insignificant why is he not more if we had a father as he ought to be he would be earl william brangwen and i should be the lady ursula what right have i to be poor crawling along the lane like vermin if i had my rights i should be seated on horseback in a green ridinghabit and my groom would be behind me and i should stop at the gates of the cottages and enquire of the cottage woman who came out with a child in her arms how did her husband who had hurt his foot and i would pat the flaxen head of the child stooping from my horse and i would give her a shilling from my purse and order nourishing food to be sent from the hall to the cottage  so she rode in her pride and sometimes she dashed into flames to rescue a forgotten child or she dived into the canal locks and supported a boy who was seized with cramp or she swept up a toddling infant from the feet of a runaway horse always imaginatively of course  but in the end there returned the poignant yearning from the sunday world as she went down in the morning from cossethay and saw ilkeston smoking blue and tender upon its hill then her heart surged with faroff words  oh jerusalem jerusalemhow often would i have gathered thy children together as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings and ye would not  the passion rose in her for christ for the gathering under the wings of security and warmth but how did it apply to the weekday world what could it mean but that christ should clasp her to his breast as a mother clasps her child and oh for christ for him who could hold her to his breast and lose her there oh for the breast of man where she should have refuge and bliss for ever all her senses quivered with passionate yearning  vaguely she knew that christ meant something else that in the visionworld he spoke of jerusalem something that did not exist in the everyday world it was not houses and factories he would hold in his bosom nor householders nor factoryworkers nor poor people but something that had no part in the weekday world nor seen nor touched with weekday hands and eyes  yet she must have it in weekday termsshe must for all her life was a weekday life now this was the whole so he must gather her body to his breast that was strong with a broad bone and which sounded with the beating of the heart and which was warm with the life of which she partook the life of the running blood  so she craved for the breast of the son of man to lie there and she was ashamed in her soul ashamed for whereas christ spoke for the vision to answer she answered from the weekday fact it was a betrayal a transference of meaning from the vision world to the matteroffact world so she was ashamed of her religious ecstasy and dreaded lest any one should see it  early in the year when the lambs came and shelters were built of straw and on her uncles farm the men sat at night with a lantern and a dog then again there swept over her this passionate confusion between the vision world and the weekday world again she felt jesus in the countryside ah he would lift up the lambs in his arms ah and she was the lamb again in the morning going down the lane she heard the ewe call and the lambs came running shaking and twinkling with newborn bliss and she saw them stooping nuzzling groping to the udder to find the teats whilst the mother turned her head gravely and sniffed her own and they were sucking vibrating with bliss on their little long legs their throats stretched up their new bodies quivering to the stream of bloodwarm loving milk  oh and the bliss the bliss she could scarcely tear herself away to go to school the little noses nuzzling at the udder the little bodies so glad and sure the little black legs crooked the mother standing still yielding herself to their quivering attractionthen the mother walked calmly away  jesusthe vision worldthe everyday worldall mixed inextricably in a confusion of pain and bliss it was almost agony the confusion the inextricability jesus the vision speaking to her who was nonvisionary and she would take his words of the spirit and make them to pander to her own carnality  this was a shame to her the confusing of the spirit world with the material world in her own soul degraded her she answered the call of the spirit in terms of immediate everyday desire  come unto me all ye that labour and are heavyladen and i will give you rest  it was the temporal answer she gave she leapt with sensuous yearning to respond to christ if she could go to him really and lay her head on his breast to have comfort to be made much of caressed like a child  all the time she walked in a confused heat of religious yearning she wanted jesus to love her deliciously to take her sensuous offering to give her sensuous response for weeks she went in a muse of enjoyment  and all the time she knew underneath that she was playing false accepting the passion of jesus for her own physical satisfaction but she was in such a daze such a tangle how could she get free  she hated herself she wanted to trample on herself destroy herself how could one become free she hated religion because it lent itself to her confusion she abused everything she wanted to become hard indifferent brutally callous to everything but just the immediate need the immediate satisfaction to have a yearning towards jesus only that she might use him to pander to her own soft sensation use him as a means of reacting upon herself maddened her in the end there was then no jesus no sentimentality with all the bitter hatred of helplessness she hated sentimentality  at this period came the young skrebensky she was nearly sixteen years old a slim smouldering girl deeply reticent yet lapsing into unreserved expansiveness now and then when she seemed to give away her whole soul but when in fact she only made another counterfeit of her soul for outward presentation she was sensitive in the extreme always tortured always affecting a callous indifference to screen herself  she was at this time a nuisance on the face of the earth with her spasmodic passion and her slumberous torment she seemed to go with all her soul in her hands yearning to the other person yet all the while deep at the bottom of her was a childish antagonism of distrust she thought she loved everybody and believed in everybody but because she could not love herself nor believe in herself she mistrusted everybody with the mistrust of a serpent or a captured bird her starts of revulsion and hatred were more inevitable than her impulses of love  so she wrestled through her dark days of confusion soulless uncreated unformed  one evening as she was studying in the parlour her head buried in her hands she heard new voices in the kitchen speaking at once from its apathy her excitable spirit started and strained to listen it seemed to crouch to lurk under cover tense glaring forth unwilling to be seen  there were two strange mens voices one soft and candid veiled with soft candour the other veiled with easy mobility running quickly ursula sat quite tense shocked out of her studies lost she listened all the time to the sound of the voices scarcely heeding the words  the first speaker was her uncle tom she knew the naive candour covering the girding and savage misery of his soul who was the other speaker whose voice ran on so easy yet with an inflamed pulse it seemed to hasten and urge her forward that other voice  i remember you the young mans voice was saying i remember you from the first time i saw you because of your dark eyes and fair face  mrs brangwen laughed shy and pleased  you were a curlyheaded little lad she said  was i yes i know they were very proud of my curls  and a laugh ran to silence  you were a very wellmannered lad i remember said her father  oh did i ask you to stay the night i always used to ask people to stay the night i believe it was rather trying for my mother  there was a general laugh ursula rose she had to go  at the click of the latch everybody looked round the girl hung in the doorway seized with a moments fierce confusion she was going to be goodlooking now she had an attractive gawkiness as she hung a moment not knowing how to carry her shoulders her dark hair was tied behind her yellowbrown eyes shone without direction behind her in the parlour was the soft light of a lamp upon open books  a superficial readiness took her to her uncle tom who kissed her greeting her with warmth making a show of intimate possession of her and at the same time leaving evident his own complete detachment  but she wanted to turn to the stranger he was standing back a little waiting he was a young man with very clear greyish eyes that waited until they were called upon before they took expression  something in his selfpossessed waiting moved her and she broke into a confused rather beautiful laugh as she gave him her hand catching her breath like an excited child his hand closed over hers very close very near he bowed and his eyes were watching her with some attention she felt proudher spirit leapt to life  you dont know mr skrebensky ursula came her uncle toms intimate voice she lifted her face with an impulsive flash to the stranger as if to declare a knowledge laughing her palpitating excited laugh  his eyes became confused with roused lights his detached attention changed to a readiness for her he was a young man of twentyone with a slender figure and soft brown hair brushed up on the german fashion straight from his brow  are you staying long she asked  ive got a months leave he said glancing at tom brangwen but ive various places i must go toput in some time here and there  he brought her a strong sense of the outer world it was as if she were set on a hill and could feel vaguely the whole world lying spread before her  what have you a months leave from she asked  im in the engineersin the army  oh she exclaimed glad  were taking you away from your studies said her uncle tom  oh no she replied quickly  skrebensky laughed young and inflammable  she wont wait to be taken away said her father but that seemed clumsy she wished he would leave her to say her own things  dont you like study asked skrebensky turning to her putting the question from his own case  i like some things said ursula i like latin and frenchand grammar  he watched her and all his being seemed attentive to her then he shook his head  i dont he said they say all the brains of the army are in the engineers i think thats why i joined themto get the credit of other peoples brains  he said this quizzically and with chagrin and she became alert to him it interested her whether he had brains or not he was interesting his directness attracted her his independent motion she was aware of the movement of his life over against hers  i dont think brains matter she said  what does matter then came her uncle toms intimate caressing halfjeering voice  she turned to him  it matters whether people have courage or not she said  courage for what asked her uncle  for everything  tom brangwen gave a sharp little laugh the mother and father sat silent with listening faces skrebensky waited she was speaking for him  everythings nothing laughed her uncle  she disliked him at that moment  she doesnt practice what she preaches said her father stirring in his chair and crossing one leg over the other she has courage for mighty little  but she would not answer skrebensky sat still waiting his face was irregular almost ugly flattish with a rather thick nose but his eyes were pellucid strangely clear his brown hair was soft and thick as silk he had a slight moustache his skin was fine his figure slight beautiful beside him her uncle tom looked fullblown her father seemed uncouth yet he reminded her of her father only he was finer and he seemed to be shining and his face was almost ugly  he seemed simply acquiescent in the fact of his own being as if he were beyond any change or question he was himself there was a sense of fatality about him that fascinated her he made no effort to prove himself to other people let it be accepted for what it was his own being in its isolation it made no excuse or explanation for itself  so he seemed perfectly even fatally established he did not asked to be rendered before he could exist before he could have relationship with another person  this attracted ursula very much she was so used to unsure people who took on a new being with every new influence her uncle tom was always more or less what the other person would have him in consequence one never knew the real uncle tom only a fluid unsatisfactory flux with a more or less consistent appearance  but let skrebensky do what he would betray himself entirely he betrayed himself always upon his own responsibility he permitted no question about himself he was irrevocable in his isolation  so ursula thought him wonderful he was so finely constituted and so distinct selfcontained selfsupporting this she said to herself was a gentleman he had a nature like fate the nature of an aristocrat  she laid hold of him at once for her dreams here was one such as those sons of god who saw the daughters of men that they were fair he was no son of adam adam was servile had not adam been driven cringing out of his native place had not the human race been a beggar ever since seeking its own being but anton skrebensky could not beg he was in possession of himself of that and no more other people could not really give him anything nor take anything from him his soul stood alone  she knew that her mother and father acknowledged him the house was changed there had been a visit paid to the house once three angels stood in abrahams doorway and greeted him and stayed and ate with him leaving his household enriched for ever when they went  the next day she went down to the marsh according to invitation the two men were not come home then looking through the window she saw the dogcart drive up and skrebensky leapt down she saw him draw himself together jump laugh to her uncle who was driving then come towards her to the house he was so spontaneous and revealed in his movements he was isolated within his own clear fine atmosphere and as still as if fated  his resting in his own fate gave him an appearance of indolence almost of languor he made no exuberant movement when he sat down he seemed to go loose languid  we are a little late he said  where have you been  we went to derby to see a friend of my fathers  who  it was an adventure to her to put direct questions and get plain answers she knew she might do it with this man  why he is a clergyman toohe is my guardianone of them  ursula knew that skrebensky was an orphan  where is really your home now she asked  my homei wonder i am very fond of my colonelcolonel hepburn then there are my aunts but my real home i suppose is the army  do you like being on your own  his clear greenishgrey eyes rested on her a moment and as he considered he did not see her  i suppose so he said you see my fatherwell he was never acclimatized here he wantedi dont know what he wantedbut it was a strain and my motheri always knew she was too good to me i could feel her being too good to memy mother then i went away to school so early and i must say the outside world was always more naturally a home to me than the vicaragei dont know why  do you feel like a bird blown out of its own latitude she asked using a phrase she had met  no no i find everything very much as i like it  he seemed more and more to give her a sense of the vast world a sense of distances and large masses of humanity it drew her as a scent draws a bee from afar but also it hurt her  it was summer and she wore cotton frocks the third time he saw her she had on a dress with fine blueandwhite stripes with a white collar and a large white hat it suited her golden warm complexion  i like you best in that dress he said standing with his head slightly on one side and appreciating her in a perceiving critical fashion  she was thrilled with a new life for the first time she was in love with a vision of herself she saw as it were a fine little reflection of herself in his eyes and she must act up to this she must be beautiful her thoughts turned swiftly to clothes her passion was to make a beautiful appearance her family looked on in amazement at the sudden transformation of ursula she became elegant really elegant in figured cotton frocks she made for herself and hats she bent to her fancy an inspiration was upon her  he sat with a sort of languor in her grandmothers rocking chair rocking slowly languidly backward and forward as ursula talked to him  you are not poor are you she said  poor in money i have about a hundred and fifty a year of my ownso i am poor or rich as you like i am poor enough in fact  but you will earn money  i shall have my payi have my pay now ive got my commission that is another hundred and fifty  you will have more though  i shant have more than 200 pounds a year for ten years to come i shall always be poor if i have to live on my pay  do you mind it  being poor not nownot very much i may later peoplethe officers are good to me colonel hepburn has a sort of fancy for mehe is a rich man i suppose  a chill went over ursula was he going to sell himself in some way  is colonel hepburn married  yeswith two daughters  but she was too proud at once to care whether colonel hepburns daughter wanted to marry him or not  there came a silence gudrun entered and skrebensky still rocked languidly on the chair  you look very lazy said gudrun  i am lazy he answered  you look really floppy she said  i am floppy he answered  cant you stop asked gudrun  noits the perpetuum mobile  you look as if you hadnt a bone in your body  thats how i like to feel  i dont admire your taste  thats my misfortune  and he rocked on  gudrun seated herself behind him and as he rocked back she caught his hair between her finger and thumb so that it tugged him as he swung forward again he took no notice there was only the sound of the rockers on the floor in silence like a crab gudrun caught a strand of his hair each time he rocked back ursula flushed and sat in some pain she saw the irritation gathering on his brow  at last he leapt up suddenly like a steel spring going off and stood on the hearthrug  damn it why cant i rock he asked petulantly fiercely  ursula loved him for his sudden steellike start out of the languor he stood on the hearthrug fuming his eyes gleaming with anger  gudrun laughed in her deep mellow fashion  men dont rock themselves she said  girls dont pull mens hair he said  gudrun laughed again  ursula sat amused but waiting and he knew ursula was waiting for him it roused his blood he had to go to her to follow her call  once he drove her to derby in the dogcart he belonged to the horsey set of the sappers they had lunch in an inn and went through the market pleased with everything he bought her a copy of wuthering heights from a bookstall then they found a little fair in progress and she said  my father used to take me in the swingboats  did you like it he asked  oh it was fine she said  would you like to go now  love it she said though she was afraid but the prospect of doing an unusual exciting thing was attractive to her  he went straight to the stand paid the money and helped her to mount he seemed to ignore everything but just what he was doing other people were mere objects of indifference to him she would have liked to hang back but she was more ashamed to retreat from him than to expose herself to the crowd or to dare the swingboat his eyes laughed and standing before her with his sharp sudden figure he set the boat swinging she was not afraid she was thrilled his colour flushed his eyes shone with a roused light and she looked up at him her face like a flower in the sun so bright and attractive so they rushed through the bright air up at the sky as if flung from a catapult then falling terribly back she loved it the motion seemed to fan their blood to fire they laughed feeling the flames  after the swingboats they went on the roundabouts to calm down he twisting astride on his jerky wooden steed towards her and always seeming at his ease enjoying himself a zest of antagonism to the convention made him fully himself as they sat on the whirling carousal with the music grinding out she was aware of the people on the earth outside and it seemed that he and she were riding carelessly over the faces of the crowd riding for ever buoyantly proudly gallantly over the upturned faces of the crowd moving on a high level spurning the common mass  when they must descend and walk away she was unhappy feeling like a giant suddenly cut down to ordinary level at the mercy of the mob  they left the fair to return for the dogcart passing the large church ursula must look in but the whole interior was filled with scaffolding fallen stone and rubbish were heaped on the floor bits of plaster crunched underfoot and the place reechoed to the calling of secular voices and to blows of the hammer  she had come to plunge in the utter gloom and peace for a moment bringing all her yearning that had returned on her uncontrolled after the reckless riding over the face of the crowd in the fair after pride she wanted comfort solace for pride and scorn seemed to hurt her most of all  and she found the immemorial gloom full of bits of falling plaster and dust of floating plaster smelling of old lime having scaffolding and rubbish heaped about dust cloths over the altar  let us sit down a minute she said  they sat unnoticed in the back pew in the gloom and she watched the dirty disorderly work of bricklayers and plasterers workmen in heavy boots walking grinding down the aisles calling out in a vulgar accent  hi mate has them corner mouldins come  there were shouts of coarse answer from the roof of the church the place echoed desolate  skrebensky sat close to her everything seemed wonderful if dreadful to her the world tumbling into ruins and she and he clambering unhurt lawless over the face of it all he sat close to her touching her and she was aware of his influence upon her but she was glad it excited her to feel the press of him upon her as if his being were urging her to something  as they drove home he sat near to her and when he swayed to the cart he swayed in a voluptuous lingering way against her lingering as he swung away to recover balance without speaking he took her hand across under the wrap and with his unseeing face lifted to the road his soul intent he began with his one hand to unfasten the buttons of her glove to push back her glove from her hand carefully laying bare her hand and the closeworking instinctive subtlety of his fingers upon her hand sent the young girl mad with voluptuous delight his hand was so wonderful intent as a living creature skilfully pushing and manipulating in the dark underworld removing her glove and laying bare her palm her fingers then his hand closed over hers so firm so close as if the flesh knitted to one thing his hand and hers meanwhile his face watched the road and the ears of the horse he drove with steady attention through the villages and she sat beside him rapt glowing blinded with a new light neither of them spoke in outward attention they were entirely separate but between them was the compact of his flesh with hers in the handclasp  then in a strange voice affecting nonchalance and superficiality he said to her  sitting in the church there reminded me of ingram  who is ingram she asked  she also affected calm superficiality but she knew that something forbidden was coming  he is one of the other men with me down at chathama subalternbut a year older than i am  and why did the church remind you of him  well he had a girl in rochester and they always sat in a particular corner in the cathedral for their lovemaking  how nice she cried impulsively  they misunderstood each other  it had its disadvantages though the verger made a row about it  what a shame why shouldnt they sit in a cathedral  i suppose they all think it a profanityexcept you and ingram and the girl  i dont think it a profanityi think its right to make love in a cathedral  she said this almost defiantly in despite of her own soul  he was silent  and was she nice  who emily yes she was rather nice she was a milliner and she wouldnt be seen in the streets with ingram it was rather sad really because the verger spied on them and got to know their names and then made a regular row it was a common tale afterwards  what did she do  she went to london into a big shop ingram still goes up to see her  does he love her  its a year and a half hes been with her now  what was she like  emily little shyviolet sort of girl with nice eyebrows  ursula meditated this it seemed like real romance of the outer world  do all men have lovers she asked amazed at her own temerity but her hand was still fastened with his and his face still had the same unchanging fixity of outward calm  theyre always mentioning some amazing fine woman or other and getting drunk to talk about her most of them dash up to london the moment they are free  what for  to some amazing fine woman or other  what sort of woman  various her name changes pretty frequently as a rule one of the fellows is a perfect maniac he keeps a suitcase always ready and the instant he is at liberty he bolts with it to the station and changes in the train no matter who is in the carriage off he whips his tunic and performs at least the top half of his toilet  ursula quivered and wondered  why is he in such a hurry she asked  her throat was becoming hard and difficult  hes got a woman in his mind i suppose  she was chilled hardened and yet this world of passions and lawlessness was fascinating to her it seemed to her a splendid recklessness her adventure in life was beginning it seemed very splendid  that evening she stayed at the marsh till after dark and skrebensky escorted her home for she could not go away from him and she was waiting waiting for something more  in the warm of the early night with the shadows new about them she felt in another harder more beautiful less personal world now a new state should come to pass  he walked near to her and with the same silent intent approach put his arm round her waist and softly very softly drew her to him till his arm was hard and pressed in upon her she seemed to be carried along floating her feet scarce touching the ground borne upon the firm moving surface of his body upon whose side she seemed to lie in a delicious swoon of motion and whilst she swooned his face bent nearer to her her head was leaned on his shoulder she felt his warm breath on her face then softly oh softly so softly that she seemed to faint away his lips touched her cheek and she drifted through strands of heat and darkness  still she waited in her swoon and her drifting waited like the sleeping beauty in the story she waited and again his face was bent to hers his lips came warm to her face their footsteps lingered and ceased they stood still under the trees whilst his lips waited on her face waited like a butterfly that does not move on a flower she pressed her breast a little nearer to him he moved put both his arms round her and drew her close  and then in the darkness he bent to her mouth softly and touched her mouth with his mouth she was afraid she lay still on his arm feeling his lips on her lips she kept still helpless then his mouth drew near pressing open her mouth a hot drenching surge rose within her she opened her lips to him in pained poignant eddies she drew him nearer she let him come farther his lips came and surging surging soft oh soft yet oh like the powerful surge of water irresistible till with a little blind cry she broke away  she heard him breathing heavily strangely beside her a terrible and magnificent sense of his strangeness possessed her but she shrank a little now within herself hesitating they continued to walk on quivering like shadows under the ash trees of the hill where her grandfather had walked with his daffodils to make his proposal and where her mother had gone with her young husband walking close upon him as ursula was now walking upon skrebensky  ursula was aware of the dark limbs of the trees stretching overhead clothed with leaves and of fine ash leaves tressing the summer night  they walked with their bodies moving in complex unity close together he held her hand and they went the long way round by the road to be farther always she felt as if she were supported off her feet as if her feet were light as little breezes in motion  he would kiss her againbut not again that night with the same deepreaching kiss she was aware now aware of what a kiss might be and so it was more difficult to come to him  she went to bed feeling all warm with electric warmth as if the gush of dawn were within her upholding her and she slept deeply sweetly oh so sweetly in the morning she felt sound as an ear of wheat fragrant and firm and full  they continued to be lovers in the first wondering state of unrealization ursula told nobody she was entirely lost in her own world  yet some strange affectation made her seek for a spurious confidence she had at school a quiet meditative serioussouled friend called ethel and to ethel must ursula confide the story ethel listened absorbedly with bowed unbetraying head whilst ursula told her secret oh it was so lovely his gentle delicate way of making love ursula talked like a practiced lover  do you think asked ursula it is wicked to let a man kiss youreal kisses not flirting  i should think said ethel it depends  he kissed me under the ash trees on cossethay hilldo you think it was wrong  when  on thursday night when he was seeing me homebut real kissesreal he is an officer in the army  what time was it asked the deliberate ethel  i dont knowabout halfpast nine  there was a pause  i think its wrong said ethel lifting her head with impatience you dont know him  she spoke with some contempt  yes i do he is half a pole and a baron too in england he is equivalent to a lord my grandmother was his fathers friend  but the two friends were hostile it was as if ursula wanted to divide herself from her acquaintances in asserting her connection with anton as she now called him  he came a good deal to cossethay because her mother was fond of him anna brangwen became something of a grande dame with skrebensky very calm taking things for granted  arent the children in bed cried ursula petulantly as she came in with the young man  they will be in bed in half an hour said the mother  there is no peace cried ursula  the children must live ursula said her mother  and skrebensky was against ursula in this why should she be so insistent  but then as ursula knew he did not have the perpetual tyranny of young children about him he treated her mother with great courtliness to which mrs brangwen returned an easy friendly hospitality something pleased the girl in her mothers calm assumption of state it seemed impossible to abate mrs brangwens position she could never be beneath anyone in public relation between brangwen and skrebensky there was an unbridgeable silence sometimes the two men made a slight conversation but there was no interchange ursula rejoiced to see her father retreating into himself against the young man  she was proud of skrebensky in the house his lounging languorous indifference irritated her and yet cast a spell over her she knew it was the outcome of a spirit of laissezaller combined with profound young vitality yet it irritated her deeply  notwithstanding she was proud of him as he lounged in his lambent fashion in her home he was so attentive and courteous to her mother and to herself all the time it was wonderful to have his awareness in the room she felt rich and augmented by it as if she were the positive attraction and he the flow towards her and his courtesy and his agreement might be all her mothers but the lambent flicker of his body was for herself she held it  she must ever prove her power  i meant to show you my little woodcarving she said  im sure its not worth showing that said her father  would you like to see it she asked leaning towards the door  and his body had risen from the chair though his face seemed to want to agree with her parents  it is in the shed she said  and he followed her out of the door whatever his feelings might be  in the shed they played at kisses really played at kisses it was a delicious exciting game she turned to him her face all laughing like a challenge and he accepted the challenge at once he twined his hand full of her hair and gently with his hand wrapped round with hair behind her head gradually brought her face nearer to his whilst she laughed breathless with challenge and his eyes gleamed with answer with enjoyment of the game and he kissed her asserting his will over her and she kissed him back asserting her deliberate enjoyment of him daring and reckless and dangerous they knew it was their game each playing with fire not with love a sort of defiance of all the world possessed her in itshe would kiss him just because she wanted to and a daredevilry in him like a cynicism a cut at everything he pretended to serve retaliated in him  she was very beautiful then so wide opened so radiant so palpitating exquisitely vulnerable and poignantly wrongly throwing herself to risk it roused a sort of madness in him like a flower shaking and wideopened in the sun she tempted him and challenged him and he accepted the challenge something went fixed in him and under all her laughing poignant recklessness was the quiver of tears that almost sent him mad mad with desire with pain whose only issue was through possession of her body  so shaken afraid they went back to her parents in the kitchen and dissimulated but something was roused in both of them that they could not now allay it intensified and heightened their senses they were more vivid and powerful in their being but under it all was a poignant sense of transience it was a magnificent selfassertion on the part of both of them he asserted himself before her he felt himself infinitely male and infinitely irresistible she asserted herself before him she knew herself infinitely desirable and hence infinitely strong and after all what could either of them get from such a passion but a sense of his or of her own maximum self in contradistinction to all the rest of life wherein was something finite and sad for the human soul at its maximum wants a sense of the infinite  nevertheless it was begun now this passion and must go on the passion of ursula to know her own maximum self limited and so defined against him she could limit and define herself against him the male she could be her maximum self female oh female triumphant for one moment in exquisite assertion against the male in supreme contradistinction to the male  the next afternoon when he came prowling she went with him across to the church her father was gradually gathering in anger against him her mother was hardening in anger against her but the parents were naturally tolerant in action  they went together across the churchyard ursula and skrebensky and ran to hiding in the church it was dimmer in there than the sunny afternoon outside but the mellow glow among the bowed stone was very sweet the windows burned in ruby and in blue they made magnificent arras to their bower of secret stone  what a perfect place for a rendezvous he said in a hushed voice glancing round  she too glanced round the familiar interior the dimness and stillness chilled her but her eyes lit up with daring here here she would assert her indomitable gorgeous female self here here she would open her female flower like a flame in this dimness that was more passionate than light  they hung apart a moment then wilfully turned to each other for the desired contact she put her arms round him she cleaved her body to his and with her hands pressed upon his shoulders on his back she seemed to feel right through him to know his young tense body right through and it was so fine so hard yet so exquisitely subject and under her control she reached him her mouth and drank his full kiss drank it fuller and fuller  and it was so good it was very very good she seemed to be filled with his kiss filled as if she had drunk strong glowing sunshine she glowed all inside the sunshine seemed to beat upon her heart underneath she had drunk so beautifully  she drew away and looked at him radiant exquisitely glowingly beautiful and satisfied but radiant as an illumined cloud  to him this was bitter that she was so radiant and satisfied she laughed upon him blind to him so full of her own bliss never doubting but that he was the same as she was and radiant as an angel she went with him out of the church as if her feet were beams of light that walked on flowers for footsteps  he went beside her his soul clenched his body unsatisfied was she going to make this easy triumph over him for him there was now no selfbliss only pain and confused anger  it was high summer and the hayharvest was almost over it would be finished on saturday on saturday however skrebensky was going away he could not stay any longer  having decided to go he became very tender and loving to her kissing her gently with such soft sweet insidious closeness that they were both of them intoxicated  the very last friday of his stay he met her coming out of school and took her to tea in the town then he had a motorcar to drive her home  her excitement at riding in a motorcar was greatest of all he too was very proud of this last coup he saw ursula kindle and flare up to the romance of the situation she raised her head like a young horse snuffing with wild delight  the car swerved round a corner and ursula was swung against skrebensky the contact made her aware of him with a swift foraging impulse she sought for his hand and clasped it in her own so close so combined as if they were two children  the wind blew in on ursulas face the mud flew in a soft wild rush from the wheels the country was blackish green with the silver of new hay here and there and masses of trees under a silvergleaming sky  her hand tightened on his with a new consciousness troubled they did not speak for some time but sat handfast with averted shining faces  and every now and then the car swung her against him and they waited for the motion to bring them together yet they stared out of the windows mute  she saw the familiar country racing by but now it was no familiar country it was wonderland there was the hemlock stone standing on its grassy hill strange it looked on this wet early summer evening remote in a magic land some rooks were flying out of the trees  ah if only she and skrebensky could get out dismount into this enchanted land where nobody had ever been before then they would be enchanted people they would put off the dull customary self if she were wandering there on that hillslope under a silvery changing sky in which many rooks melted like hurrying showers of blots if they could walk past the wetted hayswaths smelling the early evening and pass in to the wood where the honeysuckle scent was sweet on the cold tang in the air and showers of drops fell when one brushed a bough cold and lovely on the face  but she was here with him in the car close to him and the wind was rushing on her lifted eager face blowing back the hair he turned and looked at her at her face clean as a chiselled thing her hair chiselled back by the wind her fine nose keen and lifted  it was agony to him seeing her swift and cleancut and virgin he wanted to kill himself and throw his detested carcase at her feet his desire to turn round on himself and rend himself was an agony to him  suddenly she glanced at him he seemed to be crouching towards her reaching he seemed to wince between the brows but instantly seeing her lighted eyes and radiant face his expression changed his old reckless laugh shone to her she pressed his hand in utter delight and he abided and suddenly she stooped and kissed his hand bent her head and caught it to her mouth in generous homage and the blood burned in him yet he remained still he made no move  she started they were swinging into cossethay skrebensky was going to leave her but it was all so magic her cup was so full of bright wine her eyes could only shine  he tapped and spoke to the man the car swung up by the yew trees she gave him her hand and said goodbye naive and brief as a schoolgirl and she stood watching him go her face shining the fact of his driving on meant nothing to her she was so filled by her own bright ecstacy she did not see him go for she was filled with light which was of him bright with an amazing light as she was how could she miss him  in her bedroom she threw her arms in the air in clear pain of magnificence oh it was her transfiguration she was beyond herself she wanted to fling herself into all the hidden brightness of the air it was there it was there if she could but meet it  but the next day she knew he had gone her glory had partly died downbut never from her memory it was too real yet it was gone by leaving a wistfulness a deeper yearning came into her soul a new reserve  she shrank from touch and question she was very proud but very new and very sensitive oh that no one should lay hands on her  she was happier running on by herself oh it was a joy to run along the lanes without seeing things yet being with them it was such a joy to be alone with all ones riches  the holidays came when she was free she spent most of her time running on by herself curled up in a squirrelplace in the garden lying in a hammock in the coppice while the birds came nearnearso near oh in rainy weather she flitted to the marsh and lay hidden with her book in a hayloft  all the time she dreamed of him sometimes definitely but when she was happiest only vaguely he was the warm colouring of her dreams he was the hot blood beating within them  when she was less happy out of sorts she pondered over his appearance his clothes the buttons with his regimental badge which he had given her or she tried to imagine his life in barracks or she conjured up a vision of herself as she appeared in his eyes  his birthday was in august and she spent some pains on making him a cake she felt that it would not be in good taste for her to give him a present  their correspondence was brief mostly an exchange of postcards not at all frequent but with her cake she must send him a letter  dear anton the sunshine has come back specially for your birthday i think i made the cake myself and wish you many happy returns of the day dont eat it if it is not good mother hopes you will come and see us when you are near enough   i am   your sincere friend   ursula brangwen  it bored her to write a letter even to him after all writing words on paper had nothing to do with him and her  the fine weather had set in the cutting machine went on from dawn till sunset chattering round the fields she heard from skrebensky he too was on duty in the country on salisbury plain he was now a second lieutenant in a field troop he would have a few days off shortly and would come to the marsh for the wedding  fred brangwen was going to marry a schoolmistress out of ilkeston as soon as cornharvest was at an end  the dim blueandgold of a hot sweet autumn saw the close of the cornharvest to ursula it was as if the world had opened its softest purest flower its chicory flower its meadow saffron the sky was blue and sweet the yellow leaves down the lane seemed like free wandering flowers as they chittered round the feet making a keen poignant almost unbearable music to her heart and the scents of autumn were like a summer madness to her she fled away from the little purplered buttonchrysanthemums like a frightened dryad the bright yellow little chrysanthemums smelled so strong her feet seemed to dither in a drunken dance  then her uncle tom appeared always like the cynical bacchus in the picture he would have a jolly wedding a harvest supper and a wedding feast in one a tent in the home close and a band for dancing and a great feast out of doors  fred demurred but tom must be satisfied also laura a handsome clever girl the bride she also must have a great and jolly feast it appealed to her educated sense she had been to salisbury training college knew folksongs and morrisdancing  so the preparations were begun directed by tom brangwen a marquee was set up on the home close two large bonfires were prepared musicians were hired feast made ready  skrebensky was to come arriving in the morning ursula had a new white dress of soft crepe and a white hat she liked to wear white with her black hair and clear golden skin she looked southern or rather tropical like a creole she wore no colour whatsoever  she trembled that day as she appeared to go down to the wedding she was to be a bridesmaid skrebensky would not arrive till afternoon the wedding was at two oclock  as the weddingparty returned home skrebensky stood in the parlour at the marsh through the window he saw tom brangwen who was best man coming up the garden path most elegant in cutaway coat and white slip and spats with ursula laughing on his arm tom brangwen was handsome with his womanish colouring and dark eyes and black closecut moustache but there was something subtly coarse and suggestive about him for all his beauty his strange bestial nostrils opened so hard and wide and his wellshaped head almost disquieting in its nakedness rather bald from the front and all its soft fulness betrayed  skrebensky saw the man rather than the woman she saw only the slender unchangeable youth waiting there inscrutable like her fate he was beyond her with his loose slightly horsey appearance that made him seem very manly and foreign yet his face was smooth and soft and impressionable she shook hands with him and her voice was like the rousing of a bird startled by the dawn  isnt it nice she cried to have a wedding  there were bits of coloured confetti lodged on her dark hair  again the confusion came over him as if he were losing himself and becoming all vague undefined inchoate yet he wanted to be hard manly horsey and he followed her  there was a light tea and the guests scattered the real feast was for the evening ursula walked out with skrebensky through the stackyard to the fields and up the embankment to the canalside  the new cornstacks were big and golden as they went by an army of white geese marched aside in braggart protest ursula was light as a white ball of down skrebensky drifted beside her indefinite his old from loosened and another self grey vague drifting out as from a bud they talked lightly of nothing  the blue way of the canal wound softly between the autumn hedges on towards the greenness of a small hill on the left was the whole black agitation of colliery and railway and the town which rose on its hill the church tower topping all the round white dot of the clock on the tower was distinct in the evening light  that way ursula felt was the way to london through the grim alluring seethe of the town on the other hand was the evening mellow over the green watermeadows and the winding alder trees beside the river and the pale stretches of stubble beyond there the evening glowed softly and even a peewit was flapping in solitude and peace  ursula and anton skrebensky walked along the ridge of the canal between the berries on the hedges were crimson and bright red above the leaves the glow of evening and the wheeling of the solitary peewit and the faint cry of the birds came to meet the shuffling noise of the pits the dark fuming stress of the town opposite and they two walked the blue strip of waterway the ribbon of sky between  he was looking ursula thought very beautiful because of a flush of sunburn on his hands and face he was telling her how he had learned to shoe horses and select cattle fit for killing  do you like to be a soldier she asked  i am not exactly a soldier he replied  but you only do things for wars she said  yes  would you like to go to war  i well it would be exciting if there were a war i would want to go  a strange distracted feeling came over her a sense of potent unrealities  why would you want to go  i should be doing something it would be genuine its a sort of toylife as it is  but what would you be doing if you went to war  i would be making railways or bridges working like a nigger  but youd only make them to be pulled down again when the armies had done with them it seems just as much a game  if you call war a game  what is it  its about the most serious business there is fighting  a sense of hard separateness came over her  why is fighting more serious than anything else she asked  you either kill or get killedand i suppose it is serious enough killing  but when youre dead you dont matter any more she said  he was silenced for a moment  but the result matters he said it matters whether we settle the mahdi or not  not to younor mewe dont care about khartoum  you want to have room to live in and somebody has to make room  but i dont want to live in the desert of saharado you she replied laughing with antagonism  i dontbut weve got to back up those who do  why have we  where is the nation if we dont  but we arent the nation there are heaps of other people who are the nation  they might say they werent either  well if everybody said it there wouldnt be a nation but i should still be myself she asserted brilliantly  you wouldnt be yourself if there were no nation  why not  because youd just be a prey to everybody and anybody  how a prey  theyd come and take everything youd got  well they couldnt take much even then i dont care what they take id rather have a robber who carried me off than a millionaire who gave me everything you can buy  thats because you are a romanticist  yes i am i want to be romantic i hate houses that never go away and people just living in the houses its all so stiff and stupid i hate soldiers they are stiff and wooden what do you fight for really  i would fight for the nation  for all that you arent the nation what would you do for yourself  i belong to the nation and must do my duty by the nation  but when it didnt need your services in particularwhen there is no fighting what would you do then  he was irritated  i would do what everybody else does  what  nothing i would be in readiness for when i was needed  the answer came in exasperation  it seems to me she answered as if you werent anybodyas if there werent anybody there where you are are you anybody really you seem like nothing to me  they had walked till they had reached a wharf just above a lock there an empty barge painted with a red and yellow cabin hood but with a long coalblack hold was lying moored a man lean and grimy was sitting on a box against the cabinside by the door smoking and nursing a baby that was wrapped in a drab shawl and looking into the glow of evening a woman bustled out sent a pail dashing into the canal drew her water and bustled in again childrens voices were heard a thin blue smoke ascended from the cabin chimney there was a smell of cooking  ursula white as a moth lingered to look skrebensky lingered by her the man glanced up  good evening he called half impudent half attracted he had blue eyes which glanced impudently from his grimy face  good evening said ursula delighted isnt it nice now  ay said the man very nice  his mouth was red under his ragged sandy moustache his teeth were white as he laughed  oh but stammered ursula laughing it is why do you say it as if it werent  appen for them as is childtnursin its none so rosy  may i look inside your barge asked ursula  theres nobodyll stop you you come if you like  the barge lay at the opposite bank at the wharf it was the annabel belonging to j ruth of loughborough the man watched ursula closely from his keen twinkling eyes his fair hair was wispy on his grimed forehead two dirty children appeared to see who was talking  ursula glanced at the great lock gates they were shut and the water was sounding spurting and trickling down in the gloom beyond on this side the bright water was almost to the top of the gate she went boldly across and round to the wharf  stooping from the bank she peeped into the cabin where was a red glow of fire and the shadowy figure of a woman she did want to go down  youll mess your frock said the man warningly  ill be careful she answered may i come  ay come if you like  she gathered her skirts lowered her foot to the side of the boat and leapt down laughing coaldust flew up  the woman came to the door she was plump and sandyhaired young with an odd stubby nose  oh you will make a mess of yourself she cried surprised and laughing with a little wonder  i did want to see isnt it lovely living on a barge asked ursula  i dont live on one altogether said the woman cheerfully  shes got her parlour an her plush suite in loughborough said her husband with just pride  ursula peeped into the cabin where saucepans were boiling and some dishes were on the table it was very hot then she came out again the man was talking to the baby it was a blueeyed freshfaced thing with floss of redgold hair  is it a boy or a girl she asked  its a girlarent you a girl eh he shouted at the infant shaking his head its little face wrinkled up into the oddest funniest smile  oh cried ursula oh the dear oh how nice when she laughs  shell laugh hard enough said the father  what is her name asked ursula  she hasnt got a name shes not worth one said the man are you you fagend o nothing he shouted to the baby the baby laughed  no weve been that busy weve never took her to th registry office came the womans voice she was born on th boat here  but you know what youre going to call her asked ursula  we did think of gladys emly said the mother  we thought of nowt o th sort said the father  hark at him what do you want cried the mother in exasperation  shell be called annabel after th boat she was born on  shes not so there said the mother viciously defiant  the father sat in humorous malice grinning  well youll see he said  and ursula could tell by the womans vibrating exasperation that he would never give way  theyre all nice names she said call her gladys annabel emily  nay thats heavyladen if you like he answered  you see cried the woman hes that pigheaded  and shes so nice and she laughs and she hasnt even got a name crooned ursula to the child  let me hold her she added  he yielded her the child that smelt of babies but it had such blue wide china blue eyes and it laughed so oddly with such a taking grimace ursula loved it she cooed and talked to it it was such an odd exciting child  whats your name the man suddenly asked of her  my name is ursulaursula brangwen she replied  ursula he exclaimed dumbfounded  there was a saint ursula its a very old name she added hastily in justification  hey mother he called  there was no answer  pem he called cant yhear  what came the short answer  what about ursula he grinned  what about what came the answer and the woman appeared in the doorway ready for combat  ursulaits the lasss name there he said gently  the woman looked the young girl up and down evidently she was attracted by her slim graceful new beauty her effect of white elegance and her tender way of holding the child  why how do you write it the mother asked awkward now she was touched ursula spelled out her name the man looked at the woman a bright confused flush came over the mothers face a sort of luminous shyness  its not a common name is it she exclaimed excited as by an adventure  are you goin to have it then he asked  id rather have it than annabel she said decisively  an id rather have it than gladys emler he replied  there was a silence ursula looked up  will you really call her ursula she asked  ursula ruth replied the man laughing vainly as pleased as if he had found something  it was now ursulas turn to be confused  it does sound awfully nice she said i must give her something and i havent got anything at all  she stood in her white dress wondering down there in the barge the lean man sitting near to her watched her as if she were a strange being as if she lit up his face his eyes smiled on her boldly and yet with exceeding admiration underneath  could i give her my necklace she said  it was the little necklace made of pieces of amethyst and topaz and pearl and crystal strung at intervals on a little golden chain which her uncle tom had given her she was very fond of it she looked at it lovingly when she had taken it from her neck  is it valuable the man asked her curiously  i think so she replied  the stones and pearl are real it is worth three or four pounds said skrebensky from the wharf above ursula could tell he disapproved of her  i must give it to your babymay i she said to the bargee  he flushed and looked away into the evening  nay he said its not for me to say  what would your father and mother say cried the woman curiously from the door  it is my own said ursula and she dangled the little glittering string before the baby the infant spread its little fingers but it could not grasp ursula closed the tiny hand over the jewel the baby waved the bright ends of the string ursula had given her necklace away she felt sad but she did not want it back  the jewel swung from the babys hand and fell in a little heap on the coaldusty bottom of the barge the man groped for it with a kind of careful reverence ursula noticed the coarsened blunted fingers groping at the little jewelled heap the skin was red on the back of the hand the fair hairs glistened stiffly it was a thin sinewy capable hand nevertheless and ursula liked it he took up the necklace carefully and blew the coaldust from it as it lay in the hollow of his hand he seemed still and attentive he held out his hand with the necklace shining small in its hard black hollow  take it back he said  ursula hardened with a kind of radiance  no she said it belongs to little ursula  and she went to the infant and fastened the necklace round its warm soft weak little neck  there was a moment of confusion then the father bent over his child  what do you say he said do you say thank you do you say thank you ursula  her names ursula now said the mother smiling a little bit ingratiatingly from the door and she came out to examine the jewel on the childs neck  it is ursula isnt it said ursula brangwen  the father looked up at her with an intimate halfgallant halfimpudent but wistful look his captive soul loved her but his soul was captive he knew always  she wanted to go he set a little ladder for her to climb up to the wharf she kissed the child which was in its mothers arms then she turned away the mother was effusive the man stood silent by the ladder  ursula joined skrebensky the two young figures crossed the lock above the shining yellow water the bargeman watched them go  i loved them she was saying he was so gentleoh so gentle and the baby was such a dear  was he gentle said skrebensky the woman had been a servant im sure of that  ursula winced  but i loved his impudenceit was so gentle underneath  she went hastening on gladdened by having met the grimy lean man with the ragged moustache he gave her a pleasant warm feeling he made her feel the richness of her own life skrebensky somehow had created a deadness round her a sterility as if the world were ashes  they said very little as they hastened home to the big supper he was envying the lean father of three children for his impudent directness and his worship of the woman in ursula a worship of body and soul together the mans body and soul wistful and worshipping the body and spirit of the girl with a desire that knew the inaccessibility of its object but was only glad to know that the perfect thing existed glad to have had a moment of communion  why could not he himself desire a woman so why did he never really want a woman not with the whole of him never loved never worshipped only just physically wanted her  but he would want her with his body let his soul do as it would a kind of flame of physical desire was gradually beating up in the marsh kindled by tom brangwen and by the fact of the wedding of fred the shy fair stiffset farmer with the handsome halfeducated girl tom brangwen with all his secret power seemed to fan the flame that was rising the bride was strongly attracted by him and he was exerting his influence on another beautiful fair girl chill and burning as the sea who said witty things which he appreciated making her glint with more like phosphorescence and her greenish eyes seemed to rock a secret and her hands like motherofpearl seemed luminous transparent as if the secret were burning visible in them  at the end of supper during dessert the music began to play violins and flutes everybodys face was lit up a glow of excitement prevailed when the little speeches were over and the port remained unreached for any more those who wished were invited out to the open for coffee the night was warm  bright stars were shining the moon was not yet up and under the stars burned two great red flameless fires and round these lights and lanterns hung the marquee stood open before a fire with its lights inside  the young people flocked out into the mysterious night there was sound of laughter and voices and a scent of coffee the farmbuildings loomed dark in the background figures pale and dark flitted about intermingling the red fire glinted on a white or a silken skirt the lanterns gleamed on the transient heads of the wedding guests  to ursula it was wonderful she felt she was a new being the darkness seemed to breathe like the sides of some great beast the haystacks loomed halfrevealed a crowd of them a dark fecund lair just behind waves of delirious darkness ran through her soul she wanted to let go she wanted to reach and be amongst the flashing stars she wanted to race with her feet and be beyond the confines of this earth she was mad to be gone it was as if a hound were straining on the leash ready to hurl itself after a nameless quarry into the dark and she was the quarry and she was also the hound the darkness was passionate and breathing with immense unperceived heaving it was waiting to receive her in her flight and how could she startand how could she let go she must leap from the known into the unknown her feet and hands beat like a madness her breast strained as if in bonds  the music began and the bonds began to slip tom brangwen was dancing with the bride quick and fluid and as if in another element inaccessible as the creatures that move in the water fred brangwen went in with another partner the music came in waves one couple after another was washed and absorbed into the deep underwater of the dance  come said ursula to skrebensky laying her hand on his arm  at the touch of her hand on his arm his consciousness melted away from him he took her into his arms as if into the sure subtle power of his will and they became one movement one dual movement dancing on the slippery grass it would be endless this movement it would continue for ever it was his will and her will locked in a trance of motion two wills locked in one motion yet never fusing never yielding one to the other it was a glaucous intertwining delicious flux and contest in flux  they were both absorbed into a profound silence into a deep fluid underwater energy that gave them unlimited strength all the dancers were waving intertwined in the flux of music shadowy couples passed and repassed before the fire the dancing feet danced silently by into the darkness it was a vision of the depths of the underworld under the great flood  there was a wonderful rocking of the darkness slowly a great slow swinging of the whole night with the music playing lightly on the surface making the strange ecstatic rippling on the surface of the dance but underneath only one great flood heaving slowly backwards to the verge of oblivion slowly forward to the other verge the heart sweeping along each time and tightening with anguish as the limit was reached and the movement at crises turned and swept back  as the dance surged heavily on ursula was aware of some influence looking in upon her something was looking at her some powerful glowing sight was looking right into her not upon her but right at her out of the great distance and yet imminent the powerful overwhelming watch was kept upon her and she danced on and on with skrebensky while the great white watching continued balancing all in its revelation  the moon has risen said anton as the music ceased and they found themselves suddenly stranded like bits of jetsam on a shore she turned and saw a great white moon looking at her over the hill and her breast opened to it she was cleaved like a transparent jewel to its light she stood filled with the full moon offering herself her two breasts opened to make way for it her body opened wide like a quivering anemone a soft dilated invitation touched by the moon she wanted the moon to fill in to her she wanted more more communion with the moon consummation but skrebensky put his arm round her and led her away he put a big dark cloak round her and sat holding her hand whilst the moonlight streamed above the glowing fires  she was not there patiently she sat under the cloak with skrebensky holding her hand but her naked self was away there beating upon the moonlight dashing the moonlight with her breasts and her knees in meeting in communion she half started to go in actuality to fling away her clothing and flee away away from this dark confusion and chaos of people to the hill and the moon but the people stood round her like stones like magnetic stones and she could not go in actuality skrebensky like a loadstone weighed on her the weight of his presence detained her she felt the burden of him the blind persistent inert burden he was inert and he weighed upon her she sighed in pain oh for the coolness and entire liberty and brightness of the moon oh for the cold liberty to be herself to do entirely as she liked she wanted to get right away she felt like bright metal weighted down by dark impure magnetism he was the dross people were the dross if she could but get away to the clean free moonlight  dont you like me tonight said his low voice the voice of the shadow over her shoulder she clenched her hands in the dewy brilliance of the moon as if she were mad  dont you like me tonight repeated the soft voice  and she knew that if she turned she would die a strange rage filled her a rage to tear things asunder her hands felt destructive like metal blades of destruction  let me alone she said  a darkness an obstinacy settled on him too in a kind of inertia he sat inert beside her she threw off her cloak and walked towards the moon silverwhite herself he followed her closely  the music began again and the dance he appropriated her there was a fierce white cold passion in her heart but he held her close and danced with her always present like a soft weight upon her bearing her down was his body against her as they danced he held her very close so that she could feel his body the weight of him sinking settling upon her overcoming her life and energy making her inert along with him she felt his hands pressing behind her upon her but still in her body was the subdued cold indomitable passion she liked the dance it eased her put her into a sort of trance but it was only a kind of waiting of using up the time that intervened between her and her pure being she left herself against him she let him exert all his power over her to bear her down she received all the force of his power she even wished he might overcome her she was cold and unmoved as a pillar of salt  his will was set and straining with all its tension to encompass him and compel her if he could only compel her he seemed to be annihilated she was cold and hard and compact of brilliance as the moon itself and beyond him as the moonlight was beyond him never to be grasped or known if he could only set a bond round her and compel her  so they danced four or five dances always together always his will becoming more tense his body more subtle playing upon her and still he had not got her she was hard and bright as ever intact but he must weave himself round her enclose her enclose her in a net of shadow of darkness so she would be like a bright creature gleaming in a net of shadows caught then he would have her he would enjoy her how he would enjoy her when she was caught  at last when the dance was over she would not sit down she walked away he came with his arm round her keeping her upon the movement of his walking and she seemed to agree she was bright as a piece of moonlight as bright as a steel blade he seemed to be clasping a blade that hurt him yet he would clasp her if it killed him  they went towards the stackyard there he saw with something like terror the great new stacks of corn glistening and gleaming transfigured silvery and present under the nightblue sky throwing dark substantial shadows but themselves majestic and dimly present she like glimmering gossamer seemed to burn among them as they rose like cold fires to the silverybluish air all was intangible a burning of cold glimmering whitishsteely fires he was afraid of the great moonconflagration of the cornstacks rising above him his heart grew smaller it began to fuse like a bead he knew he would die  she stood for some moments out in the overwhelming luminosity of the moon she seemed a beam of gleaming power she was afraid of what she was looking at him at his shadowy unreal wavering presence a sudden lust seized her to lay hold of him and tear him and make him into nothing her hands and wrists felt immeasurably hard and strong like blades he waited there beside her like a shadow which she wanted to dissipate destroy as the moonlight destroys a darkness annihilate have done with she looked at him and her face gleamed bright and inspired she tempted him  and an obstinacy in him made him put his arm round her and draw her to the shadow she submitted let him try what he could do let him try what he could do he leaned against the side of the stack holding her the stack stung him keenly with a thousand cold sharp flames still obstinately he held her  and timorously his hands went over her over the salt compact brilliance of her body if he could but have her how he would enjoy her if he could but net her brilliant cold saltburning body in the soft iron of his own hands net her capture her hold her down how madly he would enjoy her he strove subtly but with all his energy to enclose her to have her and always she was burning and brilliant and hard as salt and deadly yet obstinately all his flesh burning and corroding as if he were invaded by some consuming scathing poison still he persisted thinking at last he might overcome her even in his frenzy he sought for her mouth with his mouth though it was like putting his face into some awful death she yielded to him and he pressed himself upon her in extremity his soul groaning over and over  let me comelet me come  she took him in the kiss hard her kiss seized upon him hard and fierce and burning corrosive as the moonlight she seemed to be destroying him he was reeling summoning all his strength to keep his kiss upon her to keep himself in the kiss  but hard and fierce she had fastened upon him cold as the moon and burning as a fierce salt till gradually his warm soft iron yielded yielded and she was there fierce corrosive seething with his destruction seething like some cruel corrosive salt around the last substance of his being destroying him destroying him in the kiss and her soul crystallized with triumph and his soul was dissolved with agony and annihilation so she held him there the victim consumed annihilated she had triumphed he was not any more  gradually she began to come to herself gradually a sort of daytime consciousness came back to her suddenly the night was struck back into its old accustomed mild reality gradually she realized that the night was common and ordinary that the great blistering transcendent night did not really exist she was overcome with slow horror where was she what was this nothingness she felt the nothingness was skrebensky was he really therewho was he he was silent he was not there what had happened had she been mad what horrible thing had possessed her she was filled with overpowering fear of herself overpowering desire that it should not be that other burning corrosive self she was seized with a frenzied desire that what had been should never be remembered never be thought of never be for one moment allowed possible she denied it with all her might with all her might she turned away from it she was good she was loving her heart was warm her blood was dark and warm and soft she laid her hand caressively on antons shoulder  isnt it lovely she said softly coaxingly caressingly and she began to caress him to life again for he was dead and she intended that he should never know never become aware of what had been she would bring him back from the dead without leaving him one trace of fact to remember his annihilation by  she exerted all her ordinary warm self she touched him she did him homage of loving awareness and gradually he came back to her another man she was soft and winning and caressing she was his servant his adoring slave and she restored the whole shell of him she restored the whole form and figure of him but the core was gone his pride was bolstered up his blood ran once more in pride but there was no core to him as a distinct male he had no core his triumphant flaming overweening heart of the intrinsic male would never beat again he would be subject now reciprocal never the indomitable thing with a core of overweening unabateable fire she had abated that fire she had broken him  but she caressed him she would not have him remember what had been she would not remember herself  kiss me anton kiss me she pleaded  he kissed her but she knew he could not touch her his arms were round her but they had not got her she could feel his mouth upon her but she was not at all compelled by it  kiss me she whispered in acute distress kiss me  and he kissed her as she bade him but his heart was hollow she took his kisses outwardly but her soul was empty and finished  looking away she saw the delicate glint of oats dangling from the side of the stack in the moonlight something proud and royal and quite impersonal she had been proud with them where they were she had been also but in this temporary warm world of the commonplace she was a kind good girl she reached out yearningly for goodness and affection she wanted to be kind and good  they went home through the night that was all pale and glowing around with shadows and glimmerings and presences distinctly she saw the flowers in the hedgebottoms she saw the thin raked sheaves flung white upon the thorny hedge  how beautiful how beautiful it was she thought with anguish how wildly happy she was tonight since he had kissed her but as he walked with his arm round her waist she turned with a great offering of herself to the night that glistened tremendous a magnificent godly moon white and candid as a bridegroom flowers silvery and transformed filling up the shadows  he kissed her again under the yew trees at home and she left him she ran from the intrusion of her parents at home to her bedroom where looking out on the moonlit country she stretched up her arms hard hard in bliss agony offering herself to the blond debonair presence of the night  but there was a wound of sorrow she had hurt herself as if she had bruised herself in annihilating him she covered up her two young breasts with her hands covering them to herself and covering herself with herself she crouched in bed to sleep  in the morning the sun shone she got up strong and dancing skrebensky was still at the marsh he was coming to church how lovely how amazing life was on the fresh sunday morning she went out to the garden among the yellows and the deepvibrating reds of autumn she smelled the earth and felt the gossamer the cornfields across the country were pale and unreal everywhere was the intense silence of the sunday morning filled with unacquainted noises she smelled the body of the earth it seemed to stir its powerful flank beneath her as she stood in the bluish air came the powerful exudation the peace was the peace of strong exhausted breathing the reds and yellows and the white gleam of stubble were the quivers and motion of the last subsiding transports and clear bliss of fulfilment  the churchbells were ringing when he came she looked up in keen anticipation at his entry but he was troubled and his pride was hurt he seemed very much clothed she was conscious of his tailored suit  wasnt it lovely last night she whispered to him  yes he said but his face did not open nor become free  the service and the singing in church that morning passed unnoticed by her she saw the coloured glow of the windows the forms of the worshippers only she glanced at the book of genesis which was her favourite book in the bible  and god blessed noah and his sons and said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth  and the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth and upon every fowl of the air upon all that moveth upon the earth and upon all the fishes in the sea into your hand are they delivered  every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you even as the green herb have i given you all things  but ursula was not moved by the history this morning multiplying and replenishing the earth bored her altogether it seemed merely a vulgar and stockraising sort of business she was left quite cold by mans stockbreeding lordship over beast and fishes  and you be ye fruitful and multiply bring forth abundantly in the earth and multiply therein  in her soul she mocked at this multiplication every cow becoming two cows every turnip ten turnips  and god said this is the token of the covenant which i make between me and you and every living creature that is with you for perpetual generations  i do set my bow in the cloud and it shall be a token of a covenant between me and the earth  and it shall come to pass when i bring a cloud over the earth that a bow shall be seen in the cloud  and i will remember my covenant which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh  destroy all flesh why flesh in particular who was this lord of flesh after all how big was the flood perhaps a few dryads and fauns had just run into the hills and the farther valleys and woods frightened but most had gone on blithely unaware of any flood at all unless the nymphs should tell them it pleased ursula to think of the naiads in asia minor meeting the nereids at the mouth of the streams where the sea washed against the fresh sweet tide and calling to their sisters the news of noahs flood they would tell amusing accounts of noah in his ark some nymphs would relate how they had hung on the side of the ark peeped in and heard noah and shem and ham and japeth sitting in their place under the rain saying how they four were the only men on earth now because the lord had drowned all the rest so that they four would have everything to themselves and be masters of every thing subtenants under the great proprietor  ursula wished she had been a nymph she would have laughed through the window of the ark and flicked drops of the flood at noah before she drifted away to people who were less important in their proprietor and their flood  what was god after all if maggots in a dead dog be but god kissing carrion what then is not god she was surfeited of this god she was weary of the ursula brangwen who felt troubled about god what ever god was he was and there was no need for her to trouble about him she felt she had now all licence  skrebensky sat beside her listening to the sermon to the voice of law and order the very hairs of your head are all numbered he did not believe it he believed his own things were quite at his own disposal you could do as you liked with your own things so long as you left other peoples alone  ursula caressed him and made love to him nevertheless he knew she wanted to react upon him and to destroy his being she was not with him she was against him but her making love to him her complete admiration of him in open life gratified him  she caught him out of himself and they were lovers in a young romantic almost fantastic way he gave her a little ring they put it in rhine wine in their glass and she drank then he drank they drank till the ring lay exposed at the bottom of the glass then she took the simple jewel and tied it on a thread round her neck where she wore it  he asked her for a photograph when he was going away she went in great excitement to the photographer with five shillings the result was an ugly little picture of herself with her mouth on one side she wondered over it and admired it  he saw only the live face of the girl the picture hurt him he kept it he always remembered it but he could scarcely bear to see it there was a hurt to his soul in the clear fearless face that was touched with abstraction its abstraction was certainly away from him  then war was declared with the boers in south africa and everywhere was a fizz of excitement he wrote that he might have to go and he sent her a box of sweets  she was slightly dazed at the thought of his going to the war not knowing how to feel it was a sort of romantic situation that she knew so well in fiction she hardly understood it in fact underneath a top elation was a sort of dreariness deep ashy disappointment  however she secreted the sweets under her bed and ate them all herself when she went to bed and when she woke in the morning all the time she felt very guilty and ashamed but she simply did not want to share them  that box of sweets remained stuck in her mind afterwards why had she secreted them and eaten them every one why she did not feel guiltyshe only knew she ought to feel guilty and she could not make up her mind curiously monumental that box of sweets stood up now it was empty it was a crux for her what was she to think of it  the idea of war altogether made her feel uneasy uneasy when men began organized fighting with each other it seemed to her as if the poles of the universe were cracking and the whole might go tumbling into the bottomless pit a horrible bottomless feeling she had yet of course there was the minted superscription of romance and honour and even religion about war she was very confused  skrebensky was busy he could not come to see her she asked for no assurance no security what was between them was and could not be altered by avowals she knew that by instinct she trusted to the intrinsic reality  but she felt an agony of helplessness she could do nothing vaguely she knew the huge powers of the world rolling and crashing together darkly clumsily stupidly yet colossal so that one was brushed along almost as dust helpless helpless swirling like dust yet she wanted so hard to rebel to rage to fight but with what  could she with her hands fight the face of the earth beat the hills in their places yet her breast wanted to fight to fight the whole world and these two small hands were all she had to do it with  the months went by and it was christmasthe snowdrops came there was a little hollow in the wood near cossethay where snowdrops grew wild she sent him some in a box and he wrote her a quick little note of thanksvery grateful and wistful he seemed her eyes grew childlike and puzzled puzzled from day to day she went on helpless carried along by all that must happen  he went about at his duties giving himself up to them at the bottom of his heart his self the soul that aspired and had true hope of selfeffectuation lay as dead stillborn a dead weight in his womb who was he to hold important his personal connection what did a man matter personally he was just a brick in the whole great social fabric the nation the modern humanity his personal movements were small and entirely subsidiary the whole form must be ensured not ruptured for any personal reason whatsoever since no personal reason could justify such a breaking what did personal intimacy matter one had to fill ones place in the whole the great scheme of mans elaborate civilization that was all the whole matteredbut the unit the person had no importance except as he represented the whole  so skrebensky left the girl out and went his way serving what he had to serve and enduring what he had to endure without remark to his own intrinsic life he was dead and he could not rise again from the dead his soul lay in the tomb his life lay in the established order of things he had his five senses too they were to be gratified apart from this he represented the great established extant idea of life and as this he was important and beyond question  the good of the greatest number was all that mattered that which was the greatest good for them all collectively was the greatest good for the individual and so every man must give himself to support the state and so labour for the greatest good of all one might make improvements in the state perhaps but always with a view to preserving it intact  no highest good of the community however would give him the vital fulfilment of his soul he knew this but he did not consider the soul of the individual sufficiently important he believed a man was important in so far as he represented all humanity  he could not see it was not born in him to see that the highest good of the community as it stands is no longer the highest good of even the average individual he thought that because the community represents millions of people therefore it must be millions of times more important than any individual forgetting that the community is an abstraction from the many and is not the many themselves now when the statement of the abstract good for the community has become a formula lacking in all inspiration or value to the average intelligence then the common good becomes a general nuisance representing the vulgar conservative materialism at a low level  and by the highest good of the greatest number is chiefly meant the material prosperity of all classes skrebensky did not really care about his own material prosperity if he had been pennilesswell he would have taken his chances therefore how could he find his highest good in giving up his life for the material prosperity of everybody else what he considered an unimportant thing for himself he could not think worthy of every sacrifice on behalf of other people and that which he would consider of the deepest importance to himself as an individualoh he said you mustnt consider the community from that standpoint nonowe know what the community wants it wants something solid it wants good wages equal opportunities good conditions of living thats what the community wants it doesnt want anything subtle or difficult duty is very plainkeep in mind the material the immediate welfare of every man thats all  so there came over skrebensky a sort of nullity which more and more terrified ursula she felt there was something hopeless which she had to submit to she felt a great sense of disaster impending day after day was made inert with a sense of disaster she became morbidly sensitive depressed apprehensive it was anguish to her when she saw one rook slowly flapping in the sky that was a sign of illomen and the foreboding became so black and so powerful in her that she was almost extinguished  yet what was the matter at the worst he was only going away why did she mind what was it she feared she did not know only she had a black dread possessing her when she went at night and saw the big flashing stars they seemed terrible by day she was always expecting some charge to be made against her  he wrote in march to say that he was going to south africa in a short time but before he went he would snatch a day at the marsh  as if in a painful dream she waited suspended unresolved she did not know she could not understand only she felt that all the threads of her fate were being held taut in suspense she only wept sometimes as she went about saying blindly  i am so fond of him i am so fond of him  he came but why did he come she looked at him for a sign he gave no sign he did not even kiss her he behaved as if he were an affable usual acquaintance this was superficial but what did it hide she waited for him she wanted him to make some sign  so the whole of the day they wavered and avoided contact until evening then laughing saying he would be back in six months time and would tell them all about it he shook hands with her mother and took his leave  ursula accompanied him into the lane the night was windy the yew trees seethed and hissed and vibrated the wind seemed to rush about among the chimneys and the churchtower it was dark  the wind blew ursulas face and her clothes cleaved to her limbs but it was a surging turgid wind instinct with compressed vigour of life and she seemed to have lost skrebensky out there in the strong urgent night she could not find him  where are you she asked  here came his bodiless voice  and groping she touched him a fire like lightning drenched them  anton she said  what he answered  she held him with her hands in the darkness she felt his body again with hers  dont leave mecome back to me she said  yes he said holding her in his arms  but the male in him was scotched by the knowledge that she was not under his spell nor his influence he wanted to go away from her he rested in the knowledge that tomorrow he was going away his life was really elsewhere his life was elsewherehis life was elsewherethe centre of his life was not what she would have she was differentthere was a breach between them they were hostile worlds  you will come back to me she reiterated  yes he said and he meant it but as one keeps an appointment not as a man returning to his fulfilment  so she kissed him and went indoors lost he walked down to the marsh abstracted the contact with her hurt him and threatened him he shrank he had to be free of her spirit for she would stand before him like the angel before balaam and drive him back with a sword from the way he was going into a wilderness  the next day she went to the station to see him go she looked at him she turned to him but he was always so strange and nullso null he was so collected she thought it was that which made him null strangely nothing he was  ursula stood near him with a mute pale face which he would rather not see there seemed some shame at the very root of life cold dead shame for her  the three made a noticeable group on the station the girl in her fur cap and tippet and her olive green costume pale tense with youth isolated unyielding the soldierly young man in a crush hat and a heavy overcoat his face rather pale and reserved above his purple scarf his whole figure neutral then the elder man a fashionable bowler hat pressed low over his dark brows his face warmcoloured and calm his whole figure curiously suggestive of fullblooded indifference he was the eternal audience the chorus the spectator at the drama in his own life he would have no drama  the train was rushing up ursulas heart heaved but the ice was frozen too strong upon it  goodbye she said lifting her hand her face laughing with her peculiar blind almost dazzling laugh she wondered what he was doing when he stooped and kissed her he should be shaking hands and going  goodbye she said again  he picked up his little bag and turned his back on her there was a hurry along the train ah here was his carriage he took his seat tom brangwen shut the door and the two men shook hands as the whistle went  goodbyeand good luck said brangwen  thank yougoodbye  the train moved off skrebensky stood at the carriage window waving but not really looking to the two figures the girl and the warmcoloured almost effeminatelydressed man ursula waved her handkerchief the train gathered speed it grew smaller and smaller still it ran in a straight line the speck of white vanished the rear of the train was small in the distance still she stood on the platform feeling a great emptiness about her in spite of herself her mouth was quivering she did not want to cry her heart was dead cold  her uncle tom had gone to an automatic machine and was getting matches  would you like some sweets he said turning round  her face was covered with tears she made curious downward grimaces with her mouth to get control yet her heart was not cryingit was cold and earthy  what kind would you likeany persisted her uncle  i should love some peppermint drops she said in a strange normal voice from her distorted face but in a few moments she had gained control of herself and was still detached  let us go into the town he said and he rushed her into a train moving to the town station they went to a cafe to drink coffee she sat looking at people in the street and a great wound was in her breast a cold imperturbability in her soul  this cold imperturbability of spirit continued in her now it was as if some disillusion had frozen upon her a hard disbelief part of her had gone cold apathetic she was too young too baffled to understand or even to know that she suffered much and she was too deeply hurt to submit  she had her blind agonies when she wanted him she wanted him but from the moment of his departure he had become a visionary thing of her own all her roused torment and passion and yearning she turned to him  she kept a diary in which she wrote impulsive thoughts seeing the moon in the sky her own heart surcharged she went and wrote  if i were the moon i know where i would fall down  it meant so much to her that sentenceshe put into it all the anguish of her youth and her young passion and yearning she called to him from her heart wherever she went her limbs vibrated with anguish towards him wherever she was the radiating force of her soul seemed to travel to him endlessly endlessly and in her souls own creation find him  but who was he and where did he exist in her own desire only  she received a postcard from him and she put it in her bosom it did not mean much to her really the second day she lost it and never even remembered she had had it till some days afterwards  the long weeks went by there came the constant bad news of the war and she felt as if all outside there in the world were a hurt a hurt against her and something in her soul remained cold apathetic unchanging  her life was always only partial at this time never did she live completely there was the cold unliving part of her yet she was madly sensitive she could not bear herself when a dirty redeyed old woman came begging of her in the street she started away as from an unclean thing and then when the old woman shouted acrid insults after her she winced her limbs palpitated with insane torment she could not bear herself whenever she thought of the redeyed old woman a sort of madness ran in inflammation over her flesh and her brain she almost wanted to kill herself  and in this state her sexual life flamed into a kind of disease within her she was so overwrought and sensitive that the mere touch of coarse wool seemed to tear her nerves    chapter xii  shame  ursula had only two more terms at school she was studying for her matriculation examination it was dreary work for she had very little intelligence when she was disjointed from happiness stubbornness and a consciousness of impending fate kept her halfheartedly pinned to it she knew that soon she would want to become a selfresponsible person and her dread was that she would be prevented an allcontaining will in her for complete independence complete social independence complete independence from any personal authority kept her dullishly at her studies for she knew that she had always her price of ransomher femaleness she was always a woman and what she could not get because she was a human being fellow to the rest of mankind she would get because she was a female other than the man in her femaleness she felt a secret riches a reserve she had always the price of freedom  however she was sufficiently reserved about this last resource the other things should be tried first there was the mysterious mans world to be adventured upon the world of daily work and duty and existence as a working member of the community against this she had a subtle grudge she wanted to make her conquest also of this mans world  so she ground away at her work never giving it up some things she liked her subjects were english latin french mathematics and history once she knew how to read french and latin the syntax bored her most tedious was the close study of english literature why should one remember the things one read something in mathematics their cold absoluteness fascinated her but the actual practice was tedious some people in history puzzled her and made her ponder but the political parts angered her and she hated ministers only in odd streaks did she get a poignant sense of acquisition and enrichment and enlarging from her studies one afternoon reading as you like it once when with her blood she heard a passage of latin and she knew how the blood beat in a romans body so that ever after she felt she knew the romans by contact she enjoyed the vagaries of english grammar because it gave her pleasure to detect the live movements of words and sentences and mathematics the very sight of the letters in algebra had a real lure for her  she felt so much and so confusedly at this time that her face got a queer wondering halfscared look as if she were not sure what might seize upon her at any moment out of the unknown  odd little bits of information stirred unfathomable passion in her when she knew that in the tiny brown buds of autumn were folded minute and complete the finished flowers of the summer nine months hence tiny folded up and left there waiting a flash of triumph and love went over her  i could never die while there was a tree she said passionately sententiously standing before a great ash in worship  it was the people who somehow walked as an upright menace to her her life at this time was unformed palpitating essentially shrinking from all touch she gave something to other people but she was never herself since she had no self she was not afraid nor ashamed before trees and birds and the sky but she shrank violently from people ashamed she was not as they were fixed emphatic but a wavering undefined sensibility only without form or being  gudrun was at this time a great comfort and shield to her the younger girl was a lithe farouche animal who mistrusted all approach and would have none of the petty secrecies and jealousies of schoolgirl intimacy she would have no truck with the tame cats nice or not because she believed that they were all only untamed cats with a nasty untrustworthy habit of tameness  this was a great standback for ursula who suffered agonies when she thought a person disliked her no matter how much she despised that other person how could anyone dislike her ursula brangwen the question terrified her and was unanswerable she sought refuge in gudruns natural proud indifference  it had been discovered that gudrun had a talent for drawing this solved the problem of the girls indifference to all study it was said of her she can draw marvellously  suddenly ursula found a queer awareness existed between herself and her classmistress miss inger the latter was a rather beautiful woman of twentyeight a fearlessseeming clean type of modern girl whose very independence betrays her sorrow she was clever and expert in what she did accurate quick commanding  to ursula she had always given pleasure because of her clear decided yet graceful appearance she carried her head high a little thrown back and ursula thought there was a look of nobility in the way she twisted her smooth brown hair upon her head she always wore clean attractive wellfitting blouses and a wellmade skirt everything about her was so wellordered betraying a fine clear spirit that it was a pleasure to sit in her class  her voice was just as ringing and clear and with unwavering finelytouched modulation her eyes were blue clear proud she gave one altogether the sense of a finemettled scrupulously groomed person and of an unyielding mind yet there was an infinite poignancy about her a great pathos in her lonely proudly closed mouth  it was after skrebensky had gone that there sprang up between the mistress and the girl that strange awareness then the unspoken intimacy that sometimes connects two people who may never even make each others acquaintance before they had always been good friends in the undistinguished way of the classroom with the professional relationship of mistress and scholar always present now however another thing came to pass when they were in the room together they were aware of each other almost to the exclusion of everything else winifred inger felt a hot delight in the lessons when ursula was present ursula felt her whole life begin when miss inger came into the room then with the beloved subtlyintimate teacher present the girl sat as within the rays of some enrichening sun whose intoxicating heat poured straight into her veins  the state of bliss when miss inger was present was supreme in the girl but always eager eager as she went home ursula dreamed of the schoolmistress made infinite dreams of things she could give her of how she might make the elder woman adore her  miss inger was a bachelor of arts who had studied at newnham she was a clergymans daughter of good family but what ursula adored so much was her fine upright athletic bearing and her indomitably proud nature she was proud and free as a man yet exquisite as a woman  the girls heart burned in her breast as she set off for school in the morning so eager was her breast so glad her feet to travel towards the beloved ah miss inger how straight and fine was her back how strong her loins how calm and free her limbs  ursula craved ceaselessly to know if miss inger cared for her as yet no definite sign had been passed between the two yet surely surely miss inger loved her too was fond of her liked her at least more than the rest of the scholars in the class yet she was never certain it might be that miss inger cared nothing for her and yet and yet with blazing heart ursula felt that if only she could speak to her touch her she would know  the summer term came and with it the swimming class miss inger was to take the swimming class then ursula trembled and was dazed with passion her hopes were soon to be realized she would see miss inger in her bathing dress  the day came in the great bath the water was glimmering pale emerald green a lovely glimmering mass of colour within the whitish marblelike confines overhead the light fell softly and the great green body of pure water moved under it as someone dived from the side  ursula trembling hardly able to contain herself pulled off her clothes put on her tight bathingsuit and opened the door of her cabin two girls were in the water the mistress had not appeared she waited a door opened miss inger came out dressed in a rustred tunic like a greek girls tied round the waist and a red silk handkerchief round her head how lovely she looked her knees were so white and strong and proud and she was firmbodied as diana she walked simply to the side of the bath and with a negligent movement flung herself in for a moment ursula watched the white smooth strong shoulders and the easy arms swimming then she too dived into the water  now ah now she was swimming in the same water with her dear mistress the girl moved her limbs voluptuously and swam by herself deliciously yet with a craving of unsatisfaction she wanted to touch the other to touch her to feel her  i will race you ursula came the wellmodulated voice  ursula started violently she turned to see the warm unfolded face of her mistress looking at her to her she was acknowledged laughing her own beautiful startled laugh she began to swim the mistress was just ahead swimming with easy strokes ursula could see the head put back the water flickering upon the white shoulders the strong legs kicking shadowily and she swam blinded with passion ah the beauty of the firm white cool flesh ah the wonderful firm limbs ah if she did not so despise her own thin dusky fragment of a body if only she too were fearless and capable  she swam on eagerly not wanting to win only wanting to be near her mistress to swim in a race with her they neared the end of the bath the deep end miss inger touched the pipe swung herself round and caught ursula round the waist in the water and held her for a moment  i won said miss inger laughing  there was a moment of suspense ursulas heart was beating so fast she clung to the rail and could not move her dilated warm unfolded glowing face turned to the mistress as if to her very sun  goodbye said miss inger and she swam away to the other pupils taking professional interest in them  ursula was dazed she could still feel the touch of the mistresss body against her ownonly this only this the rest of the swimming time passed like a trance when the call was given to leave the water miss inger walked down the bath towards ursula her rustred thin tunic was clinging to her the whole body was defined firm and magnificent as it seemed to the girl  i enjoyed our race ursula did you said miss inger  the girl could only laugh with revealed open glowing face  the love was now tacitly confessed but it was some time before any further progress was made ursula continued in suspense in inflamed bliss  then one day when she was alone the mistress came near to her and touching her cheek with her fingers said with some difficulty  would you like to come to tea with me on saturday ursula  the girl flushed all gratitude  well go to a lovely little bungalow on the soar shall we i stay the weekends there sometimes  ursula was beside herself she could not endure till the saturday came her thoughts burned up like a fire if only it were saturday if only it were saturday  then saturday came and she set out miss inger met her in sawley and they walked about three miles to the bungalow it was a moist warm cloudy day  the bungalow was a tiny tworoomed shanty set on a steep bank everything in it was exquisite in delicious privacy the two girls made tea and then they talked ursula need not be home till about ten oclock  the talk was led by a kind of spell to love miss inger was telling ursula of a friend how she had died in childbirth and what she had suffered then she told of a prostitute and of some of her experiences with men  as they talked thus on the little verandah of the bungalow the night fell there was a little warm rain  it is really stifling said miss inger  they watched a train whose lights were pale in the lingering twilight rushing across the distance  it will thunder said ursula  the electric suspense continued the darkness sank they were eclipsed  i think i shall go and bathe said miss inger out of the cloudblack darkness  at night said ursula  it is best at night will you come  i should like to  it is quite safethe grounds are private we had better undress in the bungalow for fear of the rain then run down  shyly stiffly ursula went into the bungalow and began to remove her clothes the lamp was turned low she stood in the shadow by another chair winifred inger was undressing  soon the naked shadowy figure of the elder girl came to the younger  are you ready she said  one moment  ursula could hardly speak the other naked woman stood by stood near silent ursula was ready  they ventured out into the darkness feeling the soft air of night upon their skins  i cant see the path said ursula  it is here said the voice and the wavering pallid figure was beside her a hand grasping her arm and the elder held the younger close against her close as they went down and by the side of the water she put her arms round her and kissed her and she lifted her in her arms close saying softly  i shall carry you into the water  ursula lay still in her mistresss arms her forehead against the beloved maddening breast  i shall put you in said winifred  but ursula twined her body about her mistress  after awhile the rain came down on their flushed hot limbs startling delicious a sudden icecold shower burst in a great weight upon them they stood up to it with pleasure ursula received the stream of it upon her breasts and her limbs it made her cold and a deep bottomless silence welled up in her as if bottomless darkness were returning upon her  so the heat vanished away she was chilled as if from a waking up she ran indoors a chill nonexistent thing wanting to get away she wanted the light the presence of other people the external connection with the many above all she wanted to lose herself among natural surroundings  she took her leave of her mistress and returned home she was glad to be on the station with a crowd of saturdaynight people glad to sit in the lighted crowded railway carriage only she did not want to meet anybody she knew she did not want to talk she was alone immune  all this stir and seethe of lights and people was but the rim the shores of a great inner darkness and void she wanted very much to be on the seething partially illuminated shore for within her was the void reality of dark space  for a time miss inger her mistress was gone she was only a dark void and ursula was free as a shade walking in an underworld of extinction of oblivion ursula was glad with a kind of motionless lifeless gladness that her mistress was extinct gone out of her  in the morning however the love was there again burning burning she remembered yesterday and she wanted more always more she wanted to be with her mistress all separation from her mistress was a restriction from living why could she not go to her today today why must she pace about revoked at cossethay whilst her mistress was elsewhere she sat down and wrote a burning passionate loveletter she could not help it  the two women became intimate their lives seemed suddenly to fuse into one inseparable ursula went to winifreds lodging she spent there her only living hours winifred was very fond of waterof swimming of rowing she belonged to various athletic clubs many delicious afternoons the two girls spent in a light boat on the river winifred always rowing indeed winifred seemed to delight in having ursula in her charge in giving things to the girl in filling and enrichening her life  so that ursula developed rapidly during the few months of her intimacy with her mistress winifred had had a scientific education she had known many clever people she wanted to bring ursula to her own position of thought  they took religion and rid it of its dogmas its falsehoods winifred humanized it all gradually it dawned upon ursula that all the religion she knew was but a particular clothing to a human aspiration the aspiration was the real thingthe clothing was a matter almost of national taste or need the greeks had a naked apollo the christians a whiterobed christ the buddhists a royal prince the egyptians their osiris religions were local and religion was universal christianity was a local branch there was as yet no assimilation of local religions into universal religion  in religion there were the two great motives of fear and love the motive of fear was as great as the motive of love christianity accepted crucifixion to escape from fear do your worst to me that i may have no more fear of the worst but that which was feared was not necessarily all evil and that which was loved not necessarily all good fear shall become reverence and reverence is submission in identification love shall become triumph and triumph is delight in identification  so much she talked of religion getting the gist of many writings in philosophy she was brought to the conclusion that the human desire is the criterion of all truth and all good truth does not lie beyond humanity but is one of the products of the human mind and feeling there is really nothing to fear the motive of fear in religion is base and must be left to the ancient worshippers of power worship of moloch  we do not worship power in our enlightened souls power is degenerated to money and napoleonic stupidity  ursula could not help dreaming of moloch her god was not mild and gentle neither lamb nor dove he was the lion and the eagle not because the lion and the eagle had power but because they were proud and strong they were themselves they were not passive subjects of some shepherd or pets of some loving woman or sacrifices of some priest she was weary to death of mild passive lambs and monotonous doves if the lamb might lie down with the lion it would be a great honour to the lamb but the lions powerful heart would suffer no diminishing she loved the dignity and selfpossession of lions  she did not see how lambs could love lambs could only be loved they could only be afraid and tremblingly submit to fear and become sacrificial or they could submit to love and become beloveds in both they were passive raging destructive lovers seeking the moment when fear is greatest and triumph is greatest the fear not greater than the triumph the triumph not greater than the fear these were no lambs nor doves she stretched her own limbs like a lion or a wild horse her heart was relentless in its desires it would suffer a thousand deaths but it would still be a lions heart when it rose from death a fiercer lion she would be a surer knowing herself different from and separate from the great conflicting universe that was not herself  winifred inger was also interested in the womens movement  the men will do no morethey have lost the capacity for doing said the elder girl they fuss and talk but they are really inane they make everything fit into an old inert idea love is a dead idea to them they dont come to one and love one they come to an idea and they say you are my idea so they embrace themselves as if i were any mans idea as if i exist because a man has an idea of me as if i will be betrayed by him lend him my body as an instrument for his idea to be a mere apparatus of his dead theory but they are too fussy to be able to act they are all impotent they cant take a woman they come to their own idea every time and take that they are like serpents trying to swallow themselves because they are hungry  ursula was introduced by her friend to various women and men educated unsatisfied people who still moved within the smug provincial society as if they were nearly as tame as their outward behaviour showed but who were inwardly raging and mad  it was a strange world the girl was swept into like a chaos like the end of the world she was too young to understand it all yet the inoculation passed into her through her love for her mistress  the examination came and then school was over it was the long vacation winifred inger went away to london ursula was left alone in cossethay a terrible outcast almost poisonous despair possessed her it was no use doing anything or being anything she had no connection with other people her lot was isolated and deadly there was nothing for her anywhere but this black disintegration yet within all the great attack of disintegration upon her she remained herself it was the terrible core of all her suffering that she was always herself never could she escape that she could not put off being herself  she still adhered to winifred inger but a sort of nausea was coming over her she loved her mistress but a heavy clogged sense of deadness began to gather upon her from the other womans contact and sometimes she thought winifred was ugly clayey her female hips seemed big and earthy her ankles and her arms were too thick she wanted some fine intensity instead of this heavy cleaving of moist clay that cleaves because it has no life of its own  winifred still loved ursula she had a passion for the fine flame of the girl she served her endlessly would have done anything for her  come with me to london she pleaded to the girl i will make it nice for youyou shall do lots of things you will enjoy  no said ursula stubbornly and dully no i dont want to go to london i want to be by myself  winifred knew what this meant she knew that ursula was beginning to reject her the fine unquenchable flame of the younger girl would consent no more to mingle with the perverted life of the elder woman winifred knew it would come but she too was proud at the bottom of her was a black pit of despair she knew perfectly well that ursula would cast her off  and that seemed like the end of her life but she was too hopeless to rage wisely economizing what was left of ursulas love she went away to london leaving the beloved girl alone  and after a fortnight ursulas letters became tender again loving her uncle tom had invited her to go and stay with him he was managing a big new colliery in yorkshire would winifred come too  for now ursula was imagining marriage for winifred she wanted her to marry her uncle tom winifred knew this she said she would come to wiggiston she would now let fate do as it liked with her since there was nothing remaining to be done tom brangwen also saw ursulas intention he too was at the end of his desires he had done the things he had wanted to they had all ended in a disintegrated lifelessness of soul which he hid under an utterly tolerant goodhumour he no longer cared about anything on earth neither man nor woman nor god nor humanity he had come to a stability of nullification he did not care any more neither about his body nor about his soul only he would preserve intact his own life only the simple superficial fact of living persisted he was still healthy he lived therefore he would fill each moment that had always been his creed it was not instinctive easiness it was the inevitable outcome of his nature when he was in the absolute privacy of his own life he did as he pleased unscrupulous without any ulterior thought he believed neither in good nor evil each moment was like a separate little island isolated from time and blank unconditioned by time  he lived in a large new house of red brick standing outside a mass of homogeneous redbrick dwellings called wiggiston wiggiston was only seven years old it had been a hamlet of eleven houses on the edge of healthy halfagricultural country then the great seam of coal had been opened in a year wiggiston appeared a great mass of pinkish rows of thin unreal dwellings of five rooms each the streets were like visions of pure ugliness a greyblack macadamized road asphalt causeways held in between a flat succession of wall window and door a newbrick channel that began nowhere and ended nowhere everything was amorphous yet everything repeated itself endlessly only now and then in one of the housewindows vegetables or small groceries were displayed for sale  in the middle of the town was a large open shapeless space or marketplace of black trodden earth surrounded by the same flat material of dwellings new redbrick becoming grimy small oblong windows and oblong doors repeated endlessly with just at one corner a great and gaudy public house and somewhere lost on one of the sides of the square a large window opaque and darkish green which was the post office  the place had the strange desolation of a ruin colliers hanging about in gangs and groups or passing along the asphalt pavements heavily to work seemed not like living people but like spectres the rigidity of the blank streets the homogeneous amorphous sterility of the whole suggested death rather than life there was no meeting place no centre no artery no organic formation there it lay like the new foundations of a redbrick confusion rapidly spreading like a skindisease  just outside of this on a little hill was tom brangwens big redbrick house it looked from the front upon the edge of the place a meaningless squalor of ashpits and closets and irregular rows of the backs of houses each with its small activity made sordid by barren cohesion with the rest of the small activities farther off was the great colliery that went night and day and all around was the country green with two winding streams ragged with gorse and heath the darker woods in the distance  the whole place was just unreal just unreal even now when he had been there for two years tom brangwen did not believe in the actuality of the place it was like some gruesome dream some ugly dead amorphous mood become concrete  ursula and winifred were met by the motorcar at the raw little station and drove through what seemed to them like the horrible raw beginnings of something the place was a moment of chaos perpetuated persisting chaos fixed and rigid ursula was fascinated by the many men who were theregroups of men standing in the streets four or five men walking in a gang together their dogs running behind or before they were all decently dressed and most of them rather gaunt the terrible gaunt repose of their bearing fascinated her like creatures with no more hope but which still live and have passionate being within some utterly unliving shell they passed meaninglessly along with strange isolated dignity it was as if a hard horny shell enclosed them all  shocked and startled ursula was carried to her uncle toms house he was not yet at home his house was simply but well furnished he had taken out a dividing wall and made the whole front of the house into a large library with one end devoted to his science it was a handsome room appointed as a laboratory and reading room but giving the same sense of hard mechanical activity activity mechanical yet inchoate and looking out on the hideous abstraction of the town and at the green meadows and rough country beyond and at the great mathematical colliery on the other side  they saw tom brangwen walking up the curved drive he was getting stouter but with his bowler hat worn well set down on his brows he looked manly handsome curiously like any other man of action his colour was as fresh his health as perfect as ever he walked like a man rather absorbed  winifred inger was startled when he entered the library his coat fastened and correct his head bald to the crown but not shiny rather like something naked that one is accustomed to see covered and his dark eyes liquid and formless he seemed to stand in the shadow like a thing ashamed and the clasp of his hand was so soft and yet so forceful that it chilled the heart she was afraid of him repelled by him and yet attracted  he looked at the athletic seemingly fearless girl and he detected in her a kinship with his own dark corruption immediately he knew they were akin  his manner was polite almost foreign and rather cold he still laughed in his curious animal fashion suddenly wrinkling up his wide nose and showing his sharp teeth the fine beauty of his skin and his complexion some almost waxen quality hid the strange repellent grossness of him the slight sense of putrescence the commonness which revealed itself in his rather fat thighs and loins  winifred saw at once the deferential slightly servile slightly cunning regard he had for ursula which made the girl at once so proud and so perplexed  but is this place as awful as it looks the young girl asked a strain in her eyes  it is just what it looks he said it hides nothing  why are the men so sad  are they sad he replied  they seem unutterably unutterably sad said ursula out of a passionate throat  i dont think they are that they just take it for granted  what do they take for granted  thisthe pits and the place altogether  why dont they alter it she passionately protested  they believe they must alter themselves to fit the pits and the place rather than alter the pits and the place to fit themselves it is easier he said  and you agree with them burst out his niece unable to bear it you think like they dothat living human beings must be taken and adapted to all kinds of horrors we could easily do without the pits  he smiled uncomfortably cynically ursula felt again the revolt of hatred from him  i suppose their lives are not really so bad said winifred inger superior to the zolaesque tragedy  he turned with his polite distant attention  yes they are pretty bad the pits are very deep and hot and in some places wet the men die of consumption fairly often but they earn good wages  how gruesome said winifred inger  yes he replied gravely it was his grave solid selfcontained manner which made him so much respected as a colliery manager  the servant came in to ask where they would have tea  put it in the summerhouse mrs smith he said  the fairhaired goodlooking young woman went out  is she married and in service asked ursula  she is a widow her husband died of consumption a little while ago brangwen gave a sinister little laugh he lay there in the houseplace at her mothers and five or six other people in the house and died very gradually i asked her if his death wasnt a great trouble to her well she said he was very fretful towards the last never satisfied never easy always fretfretting an never knowing what would satisfy him so in one way it was a relief when it was overfor him and for everybody they had only been married two years and she has one boy i asked her if she hadnt been very happy oh yes sir we was very comfortable at first till he took badoh we was very comfortableoh yesbut you see you get used to it ive had my father and two brothers go off just the same you get used to it  its a horrible thing to get used to said winifred inger with a shudder  yes he said still smiling but thats how they are shell be getting married again directly one man or anotherit does not matter very much theyre all colliers  what do you mean asked ursula theyre all colliers  it is with the women as with us he replied her husband was john smith loader we reckoned him as a loader he reckoned himself as a loader and so she knew he represented his job marriage and home is a little sideshow  the women know it right enough and take it for what its worth one man or another it doesnt matter all the world the pit matters round the pit there will always be the sideshows plenty of em  he looked round at the red chaos the rigid amorphous confusion of wiggiston  every man his own little sideshow his home but the pit owns every man the women have what is left whats left of this man or what is left of thatit doesnt matter altogether the pit takes all that really matters  it is the same everywhere burst out winifred it is the office or the shop or the business that gets the man the woman gets the bit the shop cant digest what is he at home a man he is a meaningless lumpa standing machine a machine out of work  they know they are sold said tom brangwen thats where it is they know they are sold to their job if a woman talks her throat out what difference can it make the mans sold to his job so the women dont bother they take what they can catchand vogue la galère  arent they very strict here asked miss inger  oh no mrs smith has two sisters who have just changed husbands theyre not very particularneither are they very interested they go dragging along what is left from the pits theyre not interested enough to be very immoralit all amounts to the same thing moral or immoraljust a question of pitwages the most moral duke in england makes two hundred thousand a year out of these pits he keeps the morality end up  ursula sat blacksouled and very bitter hearing the two of them talk there seemed something ghoulish even in their very deploring of the state of things they seemed to take a ghoulish satisfaction in it the pit was the great mistress ursula looked out of the window and saw the proud demonlike colliery with her wheels twinkling in the heavens the formless squalid mass of the town lying aside it was the squalid heap of sideshows the pit was the main show the raison detre of all  how terrible it was there was a horrible fascination in ithuman bodies and lives subjected in slavery to that symmetric monster of the colliery there was a swooning perverse satisfaction in it for a moment she was dizzy  then she recovered felt herself in a great loneliness wherein she was sad but free she had departed no more would she subscribe to the great colliery to the great machine which has taken us all captives in her soul she was against it she disowned even its power it had only to be forsaken to be inane meaningless and she knew it was meaningless but it needed a great passionate effort of will on her part seeing the colliery still to maintain her knowledge that it was meaningless  but her uncle tom and her mistress remained there among the horde cynically reviling the monstrous state and yet adhering to it like a man who reviles his mistress yet who is in love with her she knew her uncle tom perceived what was going on but she knew moreover that in spite of his criticism and condemnation he still wanted the great machine his only happy moments his only moments of pure freedom were when he was serving the machine then and then only when the machine caught him up was he free from the hatred of himself could he act wholely without cynicism and unreality  his real mistress was the machine and the real mistress of winifred was the machine she too winifred worshipped the impure abstraction the mechanisms of matter there there in the machine in service of the machine was she free from the clog and degradation of human feeling there in the monstrous mechanism that held all matter living or dead in its service did she achieve her consummation and her perfect unison her immortality  hatred sprang up in ursulas heart if she could she would smash the machine her souls action should be the smashing of the great machine if she could destroy the colliery and make all the men of wiggiston out of work she would do it let them starve and grub in the earth for roots rather than serve such a moloch as this  she hated her uncle tom she hated winifred inger they went down to the summerhouse for tea it was a pleasant place among a few trees at the end of a tiny garden on the edge of a field her uncle tom and winifred seemed to jeer at her to cheapen her she was miserable and desolate but she would never give way  her coldness for winifred should never cease she knew it was over between them she saw gross ugly movements in her mistress she saw a clayey inert unquickened flesh that reminded her of the great prehistoric lizards one day her uncle tom came in out of the broiling sunshine heated from walking then the perspiration stood out upon his head and brow his hand was wet and hot and suffocating in its clasp he too had something marshy about himthe succulent moistness and turgidity and the same brackish nauseating effect of a marsh where life and decaying are one  he was repellent to her who was so dry and fine in her fire her very bones seemed to bid him keep his distance from her  it was in these weeks that ursula grew up she stayed two weeks at wiggiston and she hated it all was grey dry ash cold and dead and ugly but she stayed she stayed also to get rid of winifred the girls hatred and her sense of repulsiveness in her mistress and in her uncle seemed to throw the other two together they drew together as if against her  in hardness and bitterness of soul ursula knew that winifred was become her uncles lover she was glad she had loved them both now she wanted to be rid of them both their marshy bittersweet corruption came sick and unwholesome in her nostrils anything to get out of the foetid air she would leave them both for ever leave for ever their strange soft halfcorrupt element anything to get away  one night winifred came all burning into ursulas bed and put her arms round the girl holding her to herself in spite of unwillingness and said  dear my dearshall i marry mr brangwenshall i  the clinging heavy muddy question weighed on ursula intolerably  has he asked you she said using all her might of hard resistance  hes asked me said winifred do you want me to marry him ursula  yes said ursula  the arms tightened more on her  i knew you did my sweetand i will marry him youre fond of him arent you  ive been awfully fond of himever since i was a child  i knowi know i can see what you like in him he is a man by himself he has something apart from the rest  yes said ursula  but hes not like you my dearha hes not as good as you theres something even objectionable in himhis thick thighs  ursula was silent  but ill marry him my dearit will be best now say you love me  a sort of profession was extorted out of the girl nevertheless her mistress went away sighing to weep in her own chamber  in two days time ursula left wiggiston miss inger went to nottingham there was an engagement between her and tom brangwen which the uncle seemed to vaunt as if it were an assurance of his validity  brangwen and winifred inger continued engaged for another term then they married brangwen had reached the age when he wanted children he wanted children neither marriage nor the domestic establishment meant anything to him he wanted to propagate himself he knew what he was doing he had the instinct of a growing inertia of a thing that chooses its place of rest in which to lapse into apathy complete profound indifference he would let the machinery carry him husband father pitmanager warm clay lifted through the recurrent action of day after day by the great machine from which it derived its motion as for winifred she was an educated woman and of the same sort as himself she would make a good companion she was his mate    chapter xiii  the mans world  ursula came back to cossethay to fight with her mother her schooldays were over she had passed the matriculation examination now she came home to face that empty period between school and possible marriage  at first she thought it would be just like holidays all the time she would feel just free her soul was in chaos blinded suffering maimed she had no will left to think about herself for a time she must just lapse  but very shortly she found herself up against her mother her mother had at this time the power to irritate and madden the girl continuously there were already seven children yet mrs brangwen was again with child the ninth she had borne one had died of diphtheria in infancy  even this fact of her mothers pregnancy enraged the eldest girl mrs brangwen was so complacent so utterly fulfilled in her breeding she would not have the existence at all of anything but the immediate physical common things ursula inflamed in soul was suffering all the anguish of youths reaching for some unknown ordeal that it cant grasp cant even distinguish or conceive maddened she was fighting all the darkness she was up against and part of this darkness was her mother to limit as her mother did everything to the ring of physical considerations and complacently to reject the reality of anything else was horrible not a thing did mrs brangwen care about but the children the house and a little local gossip and she would not be touched she would let nothing else live near her she went about big with child slovenly easy having a certain lax dignity taking her own time pleasing herself always always doing things for the children and feeling that she thereby fulfilled the whole of womanhood  this long trance of complacent childbearing had kept her young and undeveloped she was scarcely a day older than when gudrun was born all these years nothing had happened save the coming of the children nothing had mattered but the bodies of her babies as her children came into consciousness as they began to suffer their own fulfilment she cast them off but she remained dominant in the house brangwen continued in a kind of rich drowse of physical heat in connection with his wife they were neither of them quite personal quite defined as individuals so much were they pervaded by the physical heat of breeding and rearing their young  how ursula resented it how she fought against the close physical limited life of herded domesticity calm placid unshakeable as ever mrs brangwen went about in her dominance of physical maternity  there were battles ursula would fight for things that mattered to her she would have the children less rude and tyrannical she would have a place in the house but her mother pulled her down pulled her down with all the cunning instinct of a breeding animal mrs brangwen ridiculed and held cheap ursulas passions her ideas her pronunciations ursula would try to insist in her own home on the right of women to take equal place with men in the field of action and work  ay said the mother theres a good crop of stockings lying ripe for mending let that be your field of action  ursula disliked mending stockings and this retort maddened her she hated her mother bitterly after a few weeks of enforced domestic life she had had enough of her home the commonness the triviality the immediate meaninglessness of it all drove her to frenzy she talked and stormed ideas she corrected and nagged at the children she turned her back in silent contempt on her breeding mother who treated her with supercilious indifference as if she were a pretentious child not to be taken seriously  brangwen was sometimes dragged into the trouble he loved ursula therefore he always had a sense of shame almost of betrayal when he turned on her so he turned fiercely and scathingly and with a wholesale brutality that made ursula go white mute and numb her feelings seemed to be becoming deadened in her her temper hard and cold  brangwen himself was in one of his states or flux after all these years he began to see a loophole of freedom for twenty years he had gone on at this office as a draughtsman doing work in which he had no interest because it seemed his allotted work the growing up of his daughters their developing rejection of old forms set him also free  he was a man of ceaseless activity blindly like a mole he pushed his way out of the earth that covered him working always away from the physical element in which his life was captured slowly blindly gropingly with what initiative was left to him he made his way towards individual expression and individual form  at last after twenty years he came back to his woodcarving almost to the point where he had left off his adam and eve panel when he was courting but now he had knowledge and skill without vision he saw the puerility of his young conceptions he saw the unreal world in which they had been conceived he now had a new strength in his sense of reality he felt as if he were real as if he handled real things he had worked for many years at cossethay building the organ for the church restoring the woodwork gradually coming to a knowledge of beauty in the plain labours now he wanted again to carve things that were utterances of himself  but he could not quite hitch onalways he was too busy too uncertain confused wavering he began to study modelling to his surprise he found he could do it modelling in clay in plaster he produced beautiful reproductions really beautiful then he setto to make a head of ursula in high relief in the donatello manner in his first passion he got a beautiful suggestion of his desire but the pitch of concentration would not come with a little ash in his mouth he gave up he continued to copy or to make designs by selecting motives from classic stuff he loved the della robbia and donatello as he had loved fra angelico when he was a young man his work had some of the freshness the naive alertness of the early italians but it was only reproduction  having reached his limit in modelling he turned to painting but he tried watercolour painting after the manner of any other amateur he got his results but was not much interested after one or two drawings of his beloved church which had the same alertness as his modelling he seemed to be incongruous with the modern atmospheric way of painting so that his church tower stood up really stood and asserted its standing but was ashamed of its own lack of meaning he turned away again  he took up jewellery read benvenuto cellini pored over reproductions of ornament and began to make pendants in silver and pearl and matrix the first things he did in his start of discovery were really beautiful those later were more imitative but starting with his wife he made a pendant each for all his womenfolk then he made rings and bracelets  then he took up beaten and chiselled metal work when ursula left school he was making a silver bowl of lovely shape how he delighted in it almost lusted after it  all this time his only connection with the real outer world was through his winter evening classes which brought him into contact with state education about all the rest he was oblivious and entirely indifferenteven about the war the nation did not exist to him he was in a private retreat of his own that had neither nationality nor any great adherent  ursula watched the newspapers vaguely concerning the war in south africa they made her miserable and she tried to have as little to do with them as possible but skrebensky was out there he sent her an occasional postcard but it was as if she were a blank wall in his direction without windows or outgoing she adhered to the skrebensky of her memory  her love for winifred inger wrenched her life as it seemed from the roots and native soil where skrebensky had belonged to it and she was aridly transplanted he was really only a memory she revived his memory with strange passion after the departure of winifred he was to her almost the symbol of her real life it was as if through him in him she might return to her own self which she was before she had loved winifred before this deadness had come upon her this pitiless transplanting but even her memories were the work of her imagination  she dreamed of him and her as they had been together she could not dream of him progressively of what he was doing now of what relation he would have to her now only sometimes she wept to think how cruelly she had suffered when he left herah how she had suffered she remembered what she had written in her diary  if i were the moon i know where i would fall down  ah it was a dull agony to her to remember what she had been then for it was remembering a dead self all that was dead after winifred she knew the corpse of her young loving self she knew its grave and the young living self she mourned for had scarcely existed it was the creature of her imagination  deep within her a cold despair remained unchanging and unchanged no one would ever love her nowshe would love no one the body of love was killed in her after winifred there was something of the corpse in her she would live she would go on but she would have no lovers no lover would want her any more she herself would want no lover the vividest little flame of desire was extinct in her for ever the tiny vivid germ that contained the bud of her real self her real love was killed she would go on growing as a plant she would do her best to produce her minor flowers but her leading flower was dead before it was born all her growth was the conveying of a corpse of hope  the miserable weeks went on in the poky house crammed with children what was her lifea sordid formless disintegrated nothing ursula brangwen a person without worth or importance living in the mean village of cossethay within the sordid scope of ilkeston ursula brangwen at seventeen worthless and unvalued neither wanted nor needed by anybody and conscious herself of her own dead value it would not bear thinking of  but still her dogged pride held its own she might be defiled she might be a corpse that should never be loved she might be a corerotten stalk living upon the food that others provided yet she would give in to nobody  gradually she became conscious that she could not go on living at home as she was doing without place or meaning or worth the very children that went to school held her uselessness in contempt she must do something  her father said she had plenty to do to help her mother from her parents she would never get more than a hit in the face she was not a practical person she thought of wild things of running away and becoming a domestic servant of asking some man to take her  she wrote to the mistress of the high school for advice  i cannot see very clearly what you should do ursula came the reply unless you are willing to become an elementary school teacher you have matriculated and that qualifies you to take a post as uncertificated teacher in any school at a salary of about fifty pounds a year  i cannot tell you how deeply i sympathize with you in your desire to do something you will learn that mankind is a great body of which you are one useful member you will take your own place at the great task which humanity is trying to fulfil that will give you a satisfaction and a selfrespect which nothing else could give  ursulas heart sank it was a cold dreary satisfaction to think of yet her cold will acquiesced this was what she wanted  you have an emotional nature the letter went on a quick natural response if only you could learn patience and selfdiscipline i do not see why you should not make a good teacher the least you could do is to try you need only serve a year or perhaps two years as uncertificated teacher then you would go to one of the training colleges where i hope you would take your degree i most strongly urge and advise you to keep up your studies always with the intention of taking a degree that will give you a qualification and a position in the world and will give you more scope to choose your own way  i shall be proud to see one of my girls win her own economical independence which means so much more than it seems i shall be glad indeed to know that one more of my girls has provided for herself the means of freedom to choose for herself  it all sounded grim and desperate ursula rather hated it but her mothers contempt and her fathers harshness had made her raw at the quick she knew the ignominy of being a hangeron she felt the festering thorn of her mothers animal estimation  at length she had to speak hard and shut down and silent within herself she slipped out one evening to the workshed she heard the taptaptap of the hammer upon the metal her father lifted his head as the door opened his face was ruddy and bright with instinct as when he was a youth his black moustache was cut close over his wide mouth his black hair was fine and close as ever but there was about him an abstraction a sort of instrumental detachment from human things he was a worker he watched his daughters hard expressionless face a hot anger came over his breast and belly  what now he said  cant i she answered looking aside not looking at him cant i go out to work  go out to work what for  his voice was so strong and ready and vibrant it irritated her  i want some other life than this  a flash of strong rage arrested all his blood for a moment  some other life he repeated why what other life do you want  she hesitated  something else besides housework and hanging about and i want to earn something  her curious brutal hardness of speech and the fierce invincibility of her youth which ignored him made him also harden with anger  and how do you think youre going to earn anything he asked  i can become a teacherim qualified by my matric  he wished her matric in hell  and how much are you qualified to earn by your matric he asked jeering  fifty pounds a year she said  he was silent his power taken out of his hand  he had always hugged a secret pride in the fact that his daughters need not go out to work with his wifes money and his own they had four hundred a year they could draw on the capital if need be later on he was not afraid for his old age his daughters might be ladies  fifty pounds a year was a pound a weekwhich was enough for her to live on independently  and what sort of a teacher do you think youd make you havent the patience of a jackgnat with your own brothers and sisters let alone with a class of children and i thought you didnt like dirty boardschool brats  theyre not all dirty  youd find theyre not all clean  there was silence in the workshop the lamplight fell on the burned silver bowl that lay between him on mallet and furnace and chisel brangwen stood with a queer catlike light on his face almost like a smile but it was no smile  can i try she said  you can do what the deuce you like and go where you like  her face was fixed and expressionless and indifferent it always sent him to a pitch of frenzy to see it like that he kept perfectly still  cold without any betrayal of feeling she turned and left the shed he worked on with all his nerves jangled then he had to put down his tools and go into the house  in a bitter tone of anger and contempt he told his wife ursula was present there was a brief altercation closed by mrs brangwens saying in a tone of biting superiority and indifference  let her find out what its like shell soon have had enough  the matter was left there but ursula considered herself free to act for some days she made no move she was reluctant to take the cruel step of finding work for she shrank with extreme sensitiveness and shyness from new contact new situations then at length a sort of doggedness drove her her soul was full of bitterness  she went to the free library in ilkeston copied out addresses from the schoolmistress and wrote for application forms after two days she rose early to meet the postman as she expected there were three long envelopes  her heart beat painfully as she went up with them to her bedroom her fingers trembled she could hardly force herself to look at the long official forms she had to fill in the whole thing was so cruel so impersonal yet it must be done  name surname first  in a trembling hand she wrote brangwenursula  age and date of birth  after a long time considering she filled in that line  qualifications with date of examination  with a little pride she wrote  london matriculation examination  previous experience and where obtained  her heart sank as she wrote  none  still there was much to answer it took her two hours to fill in the three forms then she had to copy her testimonials from her headmistress and from the clergyman  at last however it was finished she had sealed the three long envelopes in the afternoon she went down to ilkeston to post them she said nothing of it all to her parents as she stamped her long letters and put them into the box at the main postoffice she felt as if already she was out of the reach of her father and mother as if she had connected herself with the outer greater world of activity the manmade world  as she returned home she dreamed again in her own fashion her old gorgeous dreams one of her applications was to gillingham in kent one to kingstononthames and one to swanwick in derbyshire  gillingham was such a lovely name and kent was the garden of england so that in gillingham an old old village by the hopfields where the sun shone softly she came out of school in the afternoon into the shadow of the plane trees by the gate and turned down the sleepy road towards the cottage where cornflowers poked their blue heads through the old wooden fence and phlox stood built up of blossom beside the path  a delicate silverhaired lady rose with delicate ivory hands uplifted as ursula entered the room and  oh my dear what do you think  what is it mrs wetherall  frederick had come home nay his manly step was heard on the stair she saw his strong boots his blue trousers his uniformed figure and then his face clean and keen as an eagles and his eyes lit up with the glamour of strange seas ah strange seas that had woven through his soul as he descended into the kitchen  this dream with its amplifications lasted her a mile of walking then she went to kingstononthames  kingstononthames was an old historic place just south of london there lived the wellborn dignified souls who belonged to the metropolis but who loved peace there she met a wonderful family of girls living in a large old queen anne house whose lawns sloped to the river and in an atmosphere of stately peace she found herself among her souls intimates they loved her as sisters they shared with her all noble thoughts  she was happy again in her musings she spread her poor clipped wings and flew into the pure empyrean  day followed day she did not speak to her parents then came the return of her testimonials from gillingham she was not wanted neither at swanwick the bitterness of rejection followed the sweets of hope her bright feathers were in the dust again  then suddenly after a fortnight came an intimation from kingstononthames she was to appear at the education office of that town on the following thursday for an interview with the committee her heart stood still she knew she would make the committee accept her now she was afraid now that her removal was imminent her heart quivered with fear and reluctance but underneath her purpose was fixed  she passed shadowily through the day unwilling to tell her news to her mother waiting for her father suspense and fear were strong upon her she dreaded going to kingston her easy dreams disappeared from the grasp of reality  and yet as the afternoon wore away the sweetness of the dream returned again kingstononthamesthere was such sound of dignity to her the shadow of history and the glamour of stately progress enveloped her the palaces would be old and darkened the place of kings obscured yet it was a place of kings for herrichard and henry and wolsey and queen elizabeth she divined great lawns with noble trees and terraces whose steps the water washed softly where the swans sometimes came to earth still she must see the stately gorgeous barge of the queen float down the crimson carpet put upon the landing stairs the gentlemen in their purplevelvet cloaks bareheaded standing in the sunshine grouped on either side waiting  sweet thames run softly till i end my song  evening came her father returned home sanguine and alert and detached as ever he was less real than her fancies she waited whilst he ate his tea he took big mouthfuls big bites and ate unconsciously with the same abandon an animal gives to its food  immediately after tea he went over to the church it was choirpractice and he wanted to try the tunes on his organ  the latch of the big door clicked loudly as she came after him but the organ rolled more loudly still he was unaware he was practicing the anthem she saw his small jetblack head and alert face between the candleflames his slim body sagged on the musicstool his face was so luminous and fixed the movements of his limbs seemed strange apart from him the sound of the organ seemed to belong to the very stone of the pillars like sap running in them  then there was a close of music and silence  father she said  he looked round as if at an apparition ursula stood shadowily within the candlelight  what now he said not coming to earth  it was difficult to speak to him  ive got a situation she said forcing herself to speak  youve got what he answered unwilling to come out of his mood of organplaying he closed the music before him  ive got a situation to go to  then he turned to her still abstracted unwilling  oh wheres that he said  at kingstononthames i must go on thursday for an interview with the committee  you must go on thursday  yes  and she handed him the letter he read it by the light of the candles  ursula brangwen yew tree cottage cossethay derbyshire  dear madam you are requested to call at the above offices on thursday next the 10th at 1130 am for an interview with the committee referring to your application for the post of assistant mistress at the wellingborough green schools  it was very difficult for brangwen to take in this remote and official information glowing as he was within the quiet of his church and his anthem music  well you neednt bother me with it now need you he said impatiently giving her back the letter  ive got to go on thursday she said  he sat motionless then he reached more music and there was a rushing sound of air then a long emphatic trumpetnote of the organ as he laid his hands on the keys ursula turned and went away  he tried to give himself again to the organ but he could not he could not get back all the time a sort of string was tugging tugging him elsewhere miserably  so that when he came into the house after choirpractice his face was dark and his heart black he said nothing however until all the younger children were in bed ursula however knew what was brewing  at length he asked  wheres that letter  she gave it to him he sat looking at it you are requested to call at the above offices on thursday next it was a cold official notice to ursula herself and had nothing to do with him so she existed now as a separate social individual it was for her to answer this note without regard to him he had even no right to interfere his heart was hard and angry  you had to do it behind our backs had you he said with a sneer and her heart leapt with hot pain she knew she was freeshe had broken away from him he was beaten  you said let her try she retorted almost apologizing to him  he did not hear he sat looking at the letter  education office kingstononthamesand then the typewritten miss ursula brangwen yew tree cottage cossethay it was all so complete and so final he could not but feel the new position ursula held as recipient of that letter it was an iron in his soul  well he said at length youre not going  ursula started and could find no words to clamour her revolt  if you think youre going dancin off to th other side of london youre mistaken  why not she cried at once hard fixed in her will to go  thats why not he said  and there was silence till mrs brangwen came downstairs  look here anna he said handing her the letter  she put back her head seeing a typewritten letter anticipating trouble from the outside world there was the curious sliding motion of her eyes as if she shut off her sentient maternal self and a kind of hard trance meaningless took its place thus meaningless she glanced over the letter careful not to take it in she apprehended the contents with her callous superficial mind her feeling self was shut down  what post is it she asked  she wants to go and be a teacher in kingstononthames at fifty pounds a year  oh indeed  the mother spoke as if it were a hostile fact concerning some stranger she would have let her go out of callousness mrs brangwen would begin to grow up again only with her youngest child her eldest girl was in the way now  shes not going all that distance said the father  i have to go where they want me cried ursula and its a good place to go to  what do you know about the place said her father harshly  and it doesnt matter whether they want you or not if your father says you are not to go said the mother calmly  how ursula hated her  you said i was to try the girl cried now ive got a place and im going to go  youre not going all that distance said her father  why dont you get a place at ilkeston where you can live at home asked gudrun who hated conflicts who could not understand ursulas uneasy way yet who must stand by her sister  there arent any places in ilkeston cried ursula and id rather go right away  if youd asked about it a place could have been got for you in ilkeston but you had to play miss highanmighty and go your own way said her father  ive no doubt youd rather go right away said her mother very caustic and ive no doubt youd find other people didnt put up with you for very long either youve too much opinion of yourself for your good  between the girl and her mother was a feeling of pure hatred there came a stubborn silence ursula knew she must break it  well theyve written to me and i sll have to go she said  where will you get the money from asked her father  uncle tom will give it me she said  again there was silence this time she was triumphant  then at length her father lifted his head his face was abstracted he seemed to be abstracting himself to make a pure statement  well youre not going all that distance away he said ill ask mr burt about a place here im not going to have you by yourself at the other side of london  but ive got to go to kingston said ursula theyve sent for me  theyll do without you he said  there was a trembling silence when she was on the point of tears  well she said low and tense you can put me off this but im going to have a place im not going to stop at home  nobody wants you to stop at home he suddenly shouted going livid with rage  she said no more her nature had gone hard and smiling in its own arrogance in its own antagonistic indifference to the rest of them this was the state in which he wanted to kill her she went singing into the parlour     cest la mère michel qui a perdu son chat    qui cri par la fenetre questce qui le lue renda  during the next days ursula went about bright and hard singing to herself making love to the children but her soul hard and cold with regard to her parents nothing more was said the hardness and brightness lasted for four days then it began to break up so at evening she said to her father  have you spoken about a place for me  i spoke to mr burt  what did he say  theres a committee meeting tomorrow hell tell me on friday  so she waited till friday kingstononthames had been an exciting dream here she could feel the hard raw reality so she knew that this would come to pass because nothing was ever fulfilled she found except in the hard limited reality she did not want to be a teacher in ilkeston because she knew ilkeston and hated it but she wanted to be free so she must take her freedom where she could  on friday her father said there was a place vacant in brinsley street school this could most probably be secured for her at once without the trouble of application  her heart halted brinsley street was a school in a poor quarter and she had had a taste of the common children of ilkeston they had shouted after her and thrown stones still as a teacher she would be in authority and it was all unknown she was excited the very forest of dry sterile brick had some fascination for her it was so hard and ugly so relentlessly ugly it would purge her of some of her floating sentimentality  she dreamed how she would make the little ugly children love her she would be so personal teachers were always so hard and impersonal there was no vivid relationship she would make everything personal and vivid she would give herself she would give give give all her great stores of wealth to her children she would make them so happy and they would prefer her to any teacher on the face of the earth  at christmas she would choose such fascinating christmas cards for them and she would give them such a happy party in one of the classrooms  the headmaster mr harby was a short thickset rather common man she thought but she would hold before him the light of grace and refinement he would have her in such high esteem before long she would be the gleaming sun of the school the children would blossom like little weeds the teachers like tall hard plants would burst into rare flower  the monday morning came it was the end of september and a drizzle of fine rain like veils round her making her seem intimate a world to herself she walked forward to the new land the old was blotted out the veil would be rent that hid the new world she was gripped hard with suspense as she went down the hill in the rain carrying her dinnerbag  through the thin rain she saw the town a black extensive mount she must enter in upon it she felt at once a feeling of repugnance and of excited fulfilment but she shrank  she waited at the terminus for the tram here it was beginning before her was the station to nottingham whence theresa had gone to school half an hour before behind her was the little church school she had attended when she was a child when her grandmother was alive her grandmother had been dead two years now there was a strange woman at the marsh with her uncle fred and a small baby behind her was cossethay and blackberries were ripe on the hedges  as she waited at the tramterminus she reverted swiftly to her childhood her teasing grandfather with his fair beard and blue eyes and his big monumental body he had got drowned her grandmother whom ursula would sometimes say she had loved more than anyone else in the world the little church school the phillips boys one was a soldier in the life guards now one was a collier with a passion she clung to the past  but as she dreamed of it she heard the tramcar grinding round a bend rumbling dully she saw it draw into sight and hum nearer it sidled round the loop at the terminus and came to a standstill looming above her some shadowy grey people stepped from the far end the conductor was walking in the puddles swinging round the pole  she mounted into the wet comfortless tram whose floor was dark with wet whose windows were all steamed and she sat in suspense it had begun her new existence  one other passenger mounteda sort of charwoman with a drab wet coat ursula could not bear the waiting of the tram the bell clanged there was a lurch forward the car moved cautiously down the wet street she was being carried forward into her new existence her heart burned with pain and suspense as if something were cutting her living tissue  often oh often the tram seemed to stop and wet cloaked people mounted and sat mute and grey in stiff rows opposite her their umbrellas between their knees the windows of the tram grew more steamy opaque she was shut in with these unliving spectral people even yet it did not occur to her that she was one of them the conductor came down issuing tickets each little ring of his clipper sent a pang of dread through her but her ticket surely was different from the rest  they were all going to work she also was going to work her ticket was the same she sat trying to fit in with them but fear was at her bowels she felt an unknown terrible grip upon her  at bath street she must dismount and change trams she looked uphill it seemed to lead to freedom she remembered the many saturday afternoons she had walked up to the shops how free and careless she had been  ah her tram was sliding gingerly downhill she dreaded every yard of her conveyance the car halted she mounted hastily  she kept turning her head as the car ran on because she was uncertain of the street at last her heart a flame of suspense trembling she rose the conductor rang the bell brusquely  she was walking down a small mean wet street empty of people the school squatted low within its railed asphalt yard that shone black with rain the building was grimy and horrible dry plants were shadowily looking through the windows  she entered the arched doorway of the porch the whole place seemed to have a threatening expression imitating the churchs architecture for the purpose of domineering like a gesture of vulgar authority she saw that one pair of feet had paddled across the flagstone floor of the porch the place was silent deserted like an empty prison waiting the return of tramping feet  ursula went forward to the teachers room that burrowed in a gloomy hole she knocked timidly  come in called a surprised mans voice as from a prison cell she entered the dark little room that never got any sun the gas was lighted naked and raw at the table a thin man in shirtsleeves was rubbing a paper on a jellytray he looked up at ursula with his narrow sharp face said good morning then turned away again and stripped the paper off the tray glancing at the violetcoloured writing transferred before he dropped the curled sheet aside among a heap  ursula watched him fascinated in the gaslight and gloom and the narrowness of the room all seemed unreal  isnt it a nasty morning she said  yes he said its not much of weather  but in here it seemed that neither morning nor weather really existed this place was timeless he spoke in an occupied voice like an echo ursula did not know what to say she took off her waterproof  am i early she asked  the man looked first at a little clock then at her his eyes seemed to be sharpened to needlepoints of vision  twentyfive past he said youre the second to come im first this morning  ursula sat down gingerly on the edge of a chair and watched his thin red hands rubbing away on the white surface of the paper then pausing pulling up a corner of the sheet peering and rubbing away again there was a great heap of curled whiteandscribbled sheets on the table  must you do so many asked ursula  again the man glanced up sharply he was about thirty or thirtythree years old thin greenish with a long nose and a sharp face his eyes were blue and sharp as points of steel rather beautiful the girl thought  sixtythree he answered  so many she said gently then she remembered  but theyre not all for your class are they she added  why arent they he replied a fierceness in his voice  ursula was rather frightened by his mechanical ignoring of her and his directness of statement it was something new to her she had never been treated like this before as if she did not count as if she were addressing a machine  it is too many she said sympathetically  youll get about the same he said  that was all she received she sat rather blank not knowing how to feel still she liked him he seemed so cross there was a queer sharp keenedge feeling about him that attracted her and frightened her at the same time it was so cold and against his nature  the door opened and a short neutraltinted young woman of about twentyeight appeared  oh ursula the newcomer exclaimed you are here early my word ill warrant you dont keep it up thats mr williamsons peg this is yours standard five teacher always has this arent you going to take your hat off  miss violet harby removed ursulas waterproof from the peg on which it was hung to one a little farther down the row she had already snatched the pins from her own stuff hat and jammed them through her coat she turned to ursula as she pushed up her frizzed flat duncoloured hair  isnt it a beastly morning she exclaimed beastly and if theres one thing i hate above another its a wet monday morningpack of kids trailing in anyhownohow and no holding em  she had taken a black pinafore from a newspaper package and was tying it round her waist  youve brought an apron havent you she said jerkily glancing at ursula ohyoull want one youve no idea what a sight youll look before halfpast four what with chalk and ink and kids dirty feetwell i can send a boy down to mammas for one  oh it doesnt matter said ursula  oh yesi can send easily cried miss harby  ursulas heart sank everybody seemed so cocksure and so bossy how was she going to get on with such jolty jerky bossy people and miss harby had not spoken a word to the man at the table she simply ignored him ursula felt the callous crude rudeness between the two teachers  the two girls went out into the passage a few children were already clattering in the porch  jim richards called miss harby hard and authoritative a boy came sheepishly forward  shall you go down to our house for me eh said miss harby in a commanding condescending coaxing voice she did not wait for an answer go down and ask mamma to send me one of my school pinas for miss brangwenshall you  the boy muttered a sheepish yes miss and was moving away  hey called miss harby come herenow what are you going for what shall you say to mamma  a school pina muttered the boy  please mrs harby miss harby says will you send her another school pinafore for miss brangwen because shes come without one  yes miss muttered the boy head ducked and was moving off miss harby caught him back holding him by the shoulder  what are you going to say  please mrs harby miss harby wants a pinny for miss brangwin muttered the boy very sheepishly  miss brangwen laughed miss harby pushing him away here youd better have my umbrellawait a minute  the unwilling boy was rigged up with miss harbys umbrella and set off  dont take long over it called miss harby after him then she turned to ursula and said brightly  oh hes a caution that ladbut not bad you know  no ursula agreed weakly  the latch of the door clicked and they entered the big room ursula glanced down the place its rigid long silence was official and chilling halfway down was a glass partition the doors of which were open a clock ticked reechoing and miss harbys voice sounded double as she said  this is the big roomstandard fivesixandsevenheres your placefive  she stood in the near end of the great room there was a small high teachers desk facing a squadron of long benches two high windows in the wall opposite  it was fascinating and horrible to ursula the curious unliving light in the room changed her character she thought it was the rainy morning then she looked up again because of the horrid feeling of being shut in a rigid inflexible air away from all feeling of the ordinary day and she noticed that the windows were of ribbed suffused glass  the prison was round her now she looked at the walls colour washed pale green and chocolate at the large windows with frowsy geraniums against the pale glass at the long rows of desks arranged in a squadron and dread filled her this was a new world a new life with which she was threatened but still excited she climbed into her chair at her teachers desk it was high and her feet could not reach the ground but must rest on the step lifted up there off the ground she was in office how queer how queer it all was how different it was from the mist of rain blowing over cossethay as she thought of her own village a spasm of yearning crossed her it seemed so far off so lost to her  she was here in this hard stark realityreality it was queer that she should call this the reality which she had never known till today and which now so filled her with dread and dislike that she wished she might go away this was the reality and cossethay her beloved beautiful wellknown cossethay which was as herself unto her that was minor reality this prison of a school was reality here then she would sit in state the queen of scholars here she would realize her dream of being the beloved teacher bringing light and joy to her children but the desks before her had an abstract angularity that bruised her sentiment and made her shrink she winced feeling she had been a fool in her anticipations she had brought her feelings and her generosity to where neither generosity nor emotion were wanted and already she felt rebuffed troubled by the new atmosphere out of place  she slid down and they returned to the teachers room it was queer to feel that one ought to alter ones personality she was nobody there was no reality in herself the reality was all outside of her and she must apply herself to it  mr harby was in the teachers room standing before a big open cupboard in which ursula could see piles of pink blottingpaper heaps of shiny new books boxes of chalk and bottles of coloured inks it looked a treasure store  the schoolmaster was a short sturdy man with a fine head and a heavy jowl nevertheless he was goodlooking with his shapely brows and nose and his great hanging moustache he seemed absorbed in his work and took no notice of ursulas entry there was something insulting in the way he could be so actively unaware of another person so occupied  when he had a moment of absence he looked up from the table and said goodmorning to ursula there was a pleasant light in his brown eyes he seemed very manly and incontrovertible like something she wanted to push over  you had a wet walk he said to ursula  oh i dont mind im used to it she replied with a nervous little laugh  but already he was not listening her words sounded ridiculous and babbling he was taking no notice of her  you will sign your name here he said to her as if she were some childand the time when you come and go  ursula signed her name in the time book and stood back no one took any further notice of her she beat her brains for something to say but in vain  id let them in now said mr harby to the thin man who was very hastily arranging his papers  the assistant teacher made no sign of acquiescence and went on with what he was doing the atmosphere in the room grew tense at the last moment mr brunt slipped into his coat  you will go to the girls lobby said the schoolmaster to ursula with a fascinating insulting geniality purely official and domineering  she went out and found miss harby and another girl teacher in the porch on the asphalt yard the rain was falling a toneless bell tangtangtanged drearily overhead monotonously insistently it came to an end then mr brunt was seen bareheaded standing at the other gate of the school yard blowing shrill blasts on a whistle and looking down the rainy dreary street  boys in gangs and streams came trotting up running past the master and with a loud clatter of feet and voices over the yard to the boys porch girls were running and walking through the other entrance  in the porch where ursula stood there was a great noise of girls who were tearing off their coats and hats and hanging them on the racks bristling with pegs there was a smell of wet clothing a tossing out of wet draggled hair a noise of voices and feet  the mass of girls grew greater the rage around the pegs grew steadier the scholars tended to fall into little noisy gangs in the porch then violet harby clapped her hands clapped them louder with a shrill quiet girls quiet  there was a pause the hubbub died down but did not cease  what did i say cried miss harby shrilly  there was almost complete silence sometimes a girl rather late whirled into the porch and flung off her things  leadersin place commanded miss harby shrilly  pairs of girls in pinafores and long hair stood separate in the porch  standard four five and sixfall in cried miss harby  there was a hubbub which gradually resolved itself into three columns of girls two and two standing smirking in the passage in among the pegracks other teachers were putting the lower classes into ranks  ursula stood by her own standard five they were jerking their shoulders tossing their hair nudging writhing staring grinning whispering and twisting  a sharp whistle was heard and standard six the biggest girls set off led by miss harby ursula with her standard five followed after she stood beside a smirking grinning row of girls waiting in a narrow passage what she was herself she did not know  suddenly the sound of a piano was heard and standard six set off hollowly down the big room the boys had entered by another door the piano played on a march tune standard five followed to the door of the big room mr harby was seen away beyond at his desk mr brunt guarded the other door of the room ursulas class pushed up she stood near them they glanced and smirked and shoved  go on said ursula  they tittered  go on said ursula for the piano continued  the girls broke loosely into the room mr harby who had seemed immersed in some occupation away at his desk lifted his head and thundered  halt  there was a halt the piano stopped the boys who were just starting through the other door pushed back the harsh subdued voice of mr brunt was heard then the booming shout of mr harby from far down the room  who told standard five girls to come in like that  ursula crimsoned her girls were glancing up at her smirking their accusation  i sent them in mr harby she said in a clear struggling voice there was a moment of silence then mr harby roared from the distance  go back to your places standard five girls  the girls glanced up at ursula accusing rather jeering fugitive they pushed back ursulas heart hardened with ignominious pain  forwardmarch came mr brunts voice and the girls set off keeping time with the ranks of boys  ursula faced her class some fiftyfive boys and girls who stood filling the ranks of the desks she felt utterly nonexistent she had no place nor being there she faced the block of children  down the room she heard the rapid firing of questions she stood before her class not knowing what to do she waited painfully her block of children fifty unknown faces watched her hostile ready to jeer she felt as if she were in torture over a fire of faces and on every side she was naked to them of unutterable length and torture the seconds went by  then she gathered courage she heard mr brunt asking questions in mental arithmetic she stood near to her class so that her voice need not be raised too much and faltering uncertain she said  seven hats at twopence hapenny each  a grin went over the faces of the class seeing her commence she was red and suffering then some hands shot up like blades and she asked for the answer  the day passed incredibly slowly she never knew what to do there came horrible gaps when she was merely exposed to the children and when relying on some pert little girl for information she had started a lesson she did not know how to go on with it properly the children were her masters she deferred to them she could always hear mr brunt like a machine always in the same hard high inhuman voice he went on with his teaching oblivious of everything and before this inhuman number of children she was always at bay she could not get away from it there it was this class of fifty collective children depending on her for command for command it hated and resented it made her feel she could not breathe she must suffocate it was so inhuman they were so many that they were not children they were a squadron she could not speak as she would to a child because they were not individual children they were a collective inhuman thing  dinnertime came and stunned bewildered solitary she went into the teachers room for dinner never had she felt such a stranger to life before it seemed to her she had just disembarked from some strange horrible state where everything was as in hell a condition of hard malevolent system and she was not really free the afternoon drew at her like some bondage  the first week passed in a blind confusion she did not know how to teach and she felt she never would know mr harby came down every now and then to her class to see what she was doing she felt so incompetent as he stood by bullying and threatening so unreal that she wavered became neutral and nonexistent but he stood there watching with the listeninggenial smile of the eyes that was really threatening he said nothing he made her go on teaching she felt she had no soul in her body then he went away and his going was like a derision the class was his class she was a wavering substitute he thrashed and bullied he was hated but he was master though she was gentle and always considerate of her class yet they belonged to mr harby and they did not belong to her like some invincible source of the mechanism he kept all power to himself and the class owned his power and in school it was power and power alone that mattered  soon ursula came to dread him and at the bottom of her dread was a seed of hate for she despised him yet he was master of her then she began to get on all the other teachers hated him and fanned their hatred among themselves for he was master of them and the children he stood like a wheel to make absolute his authority over the herd that seemed to be his one reason in life to hold blind authority over the school his teachers were his subjects as much as the scholars only because they had some authority his instinct was to detest them  ursula could not make herself a favourite with him from the first moment she set hard against him she set against violet harby also mr harby was however too much for her he was something she could not come to grips with something too strong for her she tried to approach him as a young bright girl usually approaches a man expecting a little chivalrous courtesy but the fact that she was a girl a woman was ignored or used as a matter for contempt against her she did not know what she was nor what she must be she wanted to remain her own responsive personal self  so she taught on she made friends with the standard three teacher maggie schofield miss schofield was about twenty years old a subdued girl who held aloof from the other teachers she was rather beautiful meditative and seemed to live in another lovelier world  ursula took her dinner to school and during the second week ate it in miss schofields room standard three classroom stood by itself and had windows on two sides looking on to the playground it was a passionate relief to find such a retreat in the jarring school for there were pots of chrysanthemums and coloured leaves and a big jar of berries there were pretty little pictures on the wall photogravure reproductions from greuze and reynoldss age of innocence giving an air of intimacy so that the room with its window space its smaller tidier desks its touch of pictures and flowers made ursula at once glad here at last was a little personal touch to which she could respond  it was monday she had been at school a week and was getting used to the surroundings though she was still an entire foreigner in herself she looked forward to having dinner with maggie that was the bright spot in the day maggie was so strong and remote walking with slow sure steps down a hard road carrying the dream within her ursula went through the class teaching as through a meaningless daze  her class tumbled out at midday in haphazard fashion she did not realize what host she was gathering against herself by her superior tolerance her kindness and her laisseraller they were gone and she was rid of them and that was all she hurried away to the teachers room  mr brunt was crouching at the small stove putting a little rice pudding into the oven he rose then and attentively poked in a small saucepan on the hob with a fork then he replaced the saucepan lid  arent they done asked ursula gaily breaking in on his tense absorption  she always kept a bright blithe manner and was pleasant to all the teachers for she felt like the swan among the geese of superior heritage and belonging and her pride at being the swan in this ugly school was not yet abated  not yet replied mr brunt laconic  i wonder if my dish is hot she said bending down at the oven she half expected him to look for her but he took no notice she was hungry and she poked her finger eagerly in the pot to see if her brussels sprouts and potatoes and meat were ready they were not  dont you think its rather jolly bringing dinner she said to mr brunt  i dont know as i do he said spreading a serviette on a corner of the table and not looking at her  i suppose it is too far for you to go home  yes he said then he rose and looked at her he had the bluest fiercest most pointed eyes that she had ever met he stared at her with growing fierceness  if i were you miss brangwen he said menacingly i should get a bit tighter hand over my class  ursula shrank  would you she asked sweetly yet in terror arent i strict enough  because he repeated taking no notice of her theyll get you down if you dont tackle em pretty quick theyll pull you down and worry you till harby gets you shiftedthats how itll be you wont be here another six weeksand he filled his mouth with foodif you dont tackle em and tackle em quick  oh but ursula said resentfully ruefully the terror was deep in her  harbyll not help you this is what hell dohell let you go on getting worse and worse till either you clear out or he clears you out it doesnt matter to me except that youll leave a class behind you as i hope i shant have to cope with  she heard the accusation in the mans voice and felt condemned but still school had not yet become a definite reality to her she was shirking it it was reality but it was all outside her and she fought against mr brunts representation she did not want to realize  will it be so terrible she said quivering rather beautiful but with a slight touch of condescension because she would not betray her own trepidation  terrible said the man turning to his potatoes again i dunno about terrible  i do feel frightened said ursula the children seem so  what said miss harby entering at that moment  why said ursula mr brunt says i ought to tackle my class and she laughed uneasily  oh you have to keep order if you want to teach said miss harby hard superior trite  ursula did not answer she felt non valid before them  if you want to be let to live you have said mr brunt  well if you cant keep order what good are you said miss harby  an youve got to do it by yourselfhis voice rose like the bitter cry of the prophets youll get no help from anybody  oh indeed said miss harby some people cant be helped and she departed  the air of hostility and disintegration of wills working in antagonistic subordination was hideous mr brunt subordinate afraid acid with shame frightened her ursula wanted to run she only wanted to clear out not to understand  then miss schofield came in and with her another more restful note ursula at once turned for confirmation to the newcomer maggie remained personal within all this unclean system of authority  is the big anderson here she asked of mr brunt and they spoke of some affair about two scholars coldly officially  miss schofield took her brown dish and ursula followed with her own the cloth was laid in the pleasant standard three room there was a jar with two or three monthly roses on the table  it is so nice in here you have made it different said ursula gaily but she was afraid the atmosphere of the school was upon her  the big room said miss schofield ha its misery to be in it  she too spoke with bitterness she too lived in the ignominious position of an upper servant hated by the master above and the class beneath she was she knew liable to attack from either side at any minute or from both at once for the authorities would listen to the complaints of parents and both would turn round on the mongrel authority the teacher  so there was a hard bitter withholding in maggie schofield even as she poured out her savoury mess of big golden beans and brown gravy  it is vegetarian hotpot said miss schofield would you like to try it  i should love to said ursula  her own dinner seemed coarse and ugly beside this savoury clean dish  ive never eaten vegetarian things she said but i should think they can be good  im not really a vegetarian said maggie i dont like to bring meat to school  no said ursula i dont think i do either  and again her soul rang an answer to a new refinement a new liberty if all vegetarian things were as nice as this she would be glad to escape the slight uncleanness of meat  how good she cried  yes said miss schofield and she proceeded to tell her the receipt the two girls passed on to talk about themselves ursula told all about the high school and about her matriculation bragging a little she felt so poor here in this ugly place miss schofield listened with brooding handsome face rather gloomy  couldnt you have got to some better place than this she asked at length  i didnt know what it was like said ursula doubtfully  ah said miss schofield and she turned aside her head with a bitter motion  is it as horrid as it seems asked ursula frowning lightly in fear  it is said miss schofield bitterly hait is hateful  ursulas heart sank seeing even miss schofield in the deadly bondage  it is mr harby said maggie schofield breaking forth  i dont think i could live again in the big roommr brunts voice and mr harbyah  she turned aside her head with a deep hurt some things she could not bear  is mr harby really horrid asked ursula venturing into her own dread  hewhy hes just a bully said miss schofield raising her shamed dark eyes that flamed with tortured contempt hes not bad as long as you keep in with him and refer to him and do everything in his waybutits all so mean its just a question of fighting on both sidesand those great louts  she spoke with difficulty and with increased bitterness she had evidently suffered her soul was raw with ignominy ursula suffered in response  but why is it so horrid she asked helplessly  you cant do anything said miss schofield hes against you on one side and he sets the children against you on the other the children are simply awful youve got to make them do everything everything everything has got to come out of you whatever they learn youve got to force it into themand thats how it is  ursula felt her heart fail inside her why must she grasp all this why must she force learning on fiftyfive reluctant children having all the time an ugly rude jealousy behind her ready to throw her to the mercy of the herd of children who would like to rend her as a weaker representative of authority a great dread of her task possessed her she saw mr brunt miss harby miss schofield all the schoolteachers drudging unwillingly at the graceless task of compelling many children into one disciplined mechanical set reducing the whole set to an automatic state of obedience and attention and then of commanding their acceptance of various pieces of knowledge the first great task was to reduce sixty children to one state of mind or being this state must be produced automatically through the will of the teacher and the will of the whole school authority imposed upon the will of the children the point was that the headmaster and the teachers should have one will in authority which should bring the will of the children into accord but the headmaster was narrow and exclusive the will of the teachers could not agree with his their separate wills refused to be so subordinated so there was a state of anarchy leaving the final judgment to the children themselves which authority should exist  so there existed a set of separate wills each straining itself to the utmost to exert its own authority children will never naturally acquiesce to sitting in a class and submitting to knowledge they must be compelled by a stronger wiser will against which will they must always strive to revolt so that the first great effort of every teacher of a large class must be to bring the will of the children into accordance with his own will and this he can only do by an abnegation of his personal self and an application of a system of laws for the purpose of achieving a certain calculable result the imparting of certain knowledge whereas ursula thought she was going to become the first wise teacher by making the whole business personal and using no compulsion she believed entirely in her own personality  so that she was in a very deep mess in the first place she was offering to a class a relationship which only one or two of the children were sensitive enough to appreciate so that the mass were left outsiders therefore against her secondly she was placing herself in passive antagonism to the one fixed authority of mr harby so that the scholars could more safely harry her she did not know but her instinct gradually warned her she was tortured by the voice of mr brunt on it went jarring harsh full of hate but so monotonous it nearly drove her mad always the same set harsh monotony the man was become a mechanism working on and on and on but the personal man was in subdued friction all the time it was horribleall hate must she be like this she could feel the ghastly necessity she must become the sameput away the personal self become an instrument an abstraction working upon a certain material the class to achieve a set purpose of making them know so much each day and she could not submit yet gradually she felt the invincible iron closing upon her the sun was being blocked out often when she went out at playtime and saw a luminous blue sky with changing clouds it seemed just a fantasy like a piece of painted scenery her heart was so black and tangled in the teaching her personal self was shut in prison abolished she was subjugate to a bad destructive will how then could the sky be shining there was no sky there was no luminous atmosphere of outofdoors only the inside of the school was realhard concrete real and vicious  she would not yet however let school quite overcome her she always said it is not a permanency it will come to an end she could always see herself beyond the place see the time when she had left it on sundays and on holidays when she was away at cossethay or in the woods where the beechleaves were fallen she could think of st philips church school and by an effort of will put it in the picture as a dirty little lowsquatting building that made a very tiny mound under the sky while the great beechwoods spread immense about her and the afternoon was spacious and wonderful moreover the children the scholars they were insignificant little objects far away oh far away and what power had they over her free soul a fleeting thought of them as she kicked her way through the beechleaves and they were gone but her will was tense against them all the time  all the while they pursued her she had never had such a passionate love of the beautiful things about her sitting on top of the tramcar at evening sometimes school was swept away as she saw a magnificent sky settling down and her breast her very hands clamoured for the lovely flare of sunset it was poignant almost to agony her reaching for it she almost cried aloud seeing the sundown so lovely  for she was held away it was no matter how she said to herself that school existed no more once she had left it it existed it was within her like a dark weight controlling her movement it was in vain the highspirited proud young girl flung off the school and its association with her she was miss brangwen she was standard five teacher she had her most important being in her work now  constantly haunting her like a darkness hovering over her heart and threatening to swoop down over it at every moment was the sense that somehow somehow she was brought down bitterly she denied unto herself that she was really a schoolteacher leave that to the violet harbys she herself would stand clear of the accusation it was in vain she denied it  within herself some recording hand seemed to point mechanically to a negation she was incapable of fulfilling her task she could never for a moment escape from the fatal weight of the knowledge  and so she felt inferior to violet harby miss harby was a splendid teacher she could keep order and inflict knowledge on a class with remarkable efficiency it was no good ursulas protesting to herself that she was infinitely infinitely the superior of violet harby she knew that violet harby succeeded where she failed and this in a task which was almost a test of her she felt something all the time wearing upon her wearing her down she went about in these first weeks trying to deny it to say she was free as ever she tried not to feel at a disadvantage before miss harby tried to keep up the effect of her own superiority but a great weight was on her which violet harby could bear and she herself could not  though she did not give in she never succeeded her class was getting in worse condition she knew herself less and less secure in teaching it ought she to withdraw and go home again ought she to say she had come to the wrong place and so retire her very life was at test  she went on doggedly blindly waiting for a crisis mr harby had now begun to persecute her her dread and hatred of him grew and loomed larger and larger she was afraid he was going to bully her and destroy her he began to persecute her because she could not keep her class in proper condition because her class was the weak link in the chain which made up the school  one of the offences was that her class was noisy and disturbed mr harby as he took standard seven at the other end of the room she was taking composition on a certain morning walking in among the scholars some of the boys had dirty ears and necks their clothing smelled unpleasantly but she could ignore it she corrected the writing as she went  when you say their fur is brown how do you write their she asked  there was a little pause the boys were always jeeringly backward in answering they had begun to jeer at her authority altogether  please miss their spelled a lad loudly with a note of mockery  at that moment mr harby was passing  stand up hill he called in a big voice  everybody started ursula watched the boy he was evidently poor and rather cunning a stiff bit of hair stood straight off his forehead the rest fitted close to his meagre head he was pale and colourless  who told you to call out thundered mr harby  the boy looked up and down with a guilty air and a cunning cynical reserve  please sir i was answering he replied with the same humble insolence  go to my desk  the boy set off down the room the big black jacket hanging in dejected folds about him his thin legs rather knocked at the knees going already with the paupers crawl his feet in their big boots scarcely lifted ursula watched him in his crawling slinking progress down the room he was one of her boys when he got to the desk he looked round half furtively with a sort of cunning grin and a pathetic leer at the big boys in standard vii then pitiable pale in his dejected garments he lounged under the menace of the headmasters desk with one thin leg crooked at the knee and the foot struck out sideways his hands in the lowhanging pockets of his mans jacket  ursula tried to get her attention back to the class the boy gave her a little horror and she was at the same time hot with pity for him she felt she wanted to scream she was responsible for the boys punishment mr harby was looking at her handwriting on the board he turned to the class  pens down  the children put down their pens and looked up  fold arms  they pushed back their books and folded arms  ursula stuck among the back forms could not extricate herself  what is your composition about asked the headmaster every hand shot up the  stuttered some voice in its eagerness to answer  i wouldnt advise you to call out said mr harby he would have a pleasant voice full and musical but for the detestable menace that always tailed in it he stood unmoved his eyes twinkling under his bushy black eyebrows watching the class there was something fascinating in him as he stood and again she wanted to scream she was all jarred she did not know what she felt  well alice he said  the rabbit piped a girls voice  a very easy subject for standard five  ursula felt a slight shame of incompetence she was exposed before the class and she was tormented by the contradictoriness of everything mr harby stood so strong and so male with his black brows and clear forehead the heavy jaw the big overhanging moustache such a man with strength and male power and a certain blind native beauty she might have liked him as a man and here he stood in some other capacity bullying over such a trifle as a boys speaking out without permission yet he was not a little fussy man he seemed to have some cruel stubborn evil spirit he was imprisoned in a task too small and petty for him which yet in a servile acquiescence he would fulfil because he had to earn his living he had no finer control over himself only this blind dogged wholesale will he would keep the job going since he must and this job was to make the children spell the word caution correctly and put a capital letter after a fullstop so at this he hammered with his suppressed hatred always suppressing himself till he was beside himself ursula suffered bitterly as he stood short and handsome and powerful teaching her class it seemed such a miserable thing for him to be doing he had a decent powerful rude soul what did he care about the composition on the rabbit yet his will kept him there before the class threshing the trivial subject it was habit with him now to be so little and vulgar out of place she saw the shamefulness of his position felt the fettered wickedness in him which would blaze out into evil rage in the long run so that he was like a persistent strong creature tethered it was really intolerable the jarring was torture to her she looked over the silent attentive class that seemed to have crystallized into order and rigid neutral form this he had it in his power to do to crystallize the children into hard mute fragments fixed under his will his brute will which fixed them by sheer force  she too must learn to subdue them to her will she must for it was her duty since the school was such he had crystallized the class into order but to see him a strong powerful man using all his power for such a purpose seemed almost horrible there was something hideous about it the strange genial light in his eye was really vicious and ugly his smile was one of torture he could not be impersonal he could not have a clear pure purpose he could only exercise his own brute will he did not believe in the least in the education he kept inflicting year after year upon the children so he must bully only bully even while it tortured his strong wholesome nature with shame like a spur always galling he was so blind and ugly and out of place ursula could not bear it as he stood there the whole situation was wrong and ugly  the lesson was finished mr harby went away at the far end of the room she heard the whistle and the thud of the cane her heart stood still within her she could not bear it no she could not bear it when the boy was beaten it made her sick she felt that she must go out of this school this tortureplace and she hated the schoolmaster thoroughly and finally the brute had he no shame he should never be allowed to continue the atrocity of this bullying cruelty then hill came crawling back blubbering piteously there was something desolate about this blubbering that nearly broke her heart for after all if she had kept her class in proper discipline this would never have happened hill would never have called out and been caned  she began the arithmetic lesson but she was distracted the boy hill sat away on the back desk huddled up blubbering and sucking his hand it was a long time she dared not go near nor speak to him she felt ashamed before him and she felt she could not forgive the boy for being the huddled blubbering object all wet and snivelled which he was  she went on correcting the sums but there were too many children she could not get round the class and hill was on her conscience at last he had stopped crying and sat bunched over his hands playing quietly then he looked up at her his face was dirty with tears his eyes had a curious washed look like the sky after rain a sort of wanness he bore no malice he had already forgotten and was waiting to be restored to the normal position  go on with your work hill she said  the children were playing over their arithmetic and she knew cheating thoroughly she wrote another sum on the blackboard she could not get round the class she went again to the front to watch some were ready some were not what was she to do  at last it was time for recreation she gave the order to cease working and in some way or other got her class out of the room then she faced the disorderly litter of blotted uncorrected books of broken rulers and chewed pens and her heart sank in sickness the misery was getting deeper  the trouble went on and on day after day she had always piles of books to mark myriads of errors to correct a heartwearying task that she loathed and the work got worse and worse when she tried to flatter herself that the composition grew more alive more interesting she had to see that the handwriting grew more and more slovenly the books more filthy and disgraceful she tried what she could but it was of no use but she was not going to take it seriously why should she why should she say to herself that it mattered if she failed to teach a class to write perfectly neatly why should she take the blame unto herself  pay day came and she received four pounds two shillings and one penny she was very proud that day she had never had so much money before and she had earned it all herself she sat on the top of the tramcar fingering the gold and fearing she might lose it she felt so established and strong because of it and when she got home she said to her mother  it is pay day today mother  ay said her mother coolly  then ursula put down fifty shillings on the table  that is my board she said  ay said her mother letting it lie  ursula was hurt yet she had paid her scot she was free she paid for what she had there remained moreover thirtytwo shillings of her own she would not spend any she who was naturally a spendthrift because she could not bear to damage her fine gold  she had a standing ground now apart from her parents she was something else besides the mere daughter of william and anna brangwen she was independent she earned her own living she was an important member of the working community she was sure that fifty shillings a month quite paid for her keep if her mother received fifty shillings a month for each of the children she would have twenty pounds a month and no clothes to provide very well then  ursula was independent of her parents she now adhered elsewhere now the board of education was a phrase that rang significant to her and she felt whitehall far beyond her as her ultimate home in the government she knew which minister had supreme control over education and it seemed to her that in some way he was connected with her as her father was connected with her  she had another self another responsibility she was no longer ursula brangwen daughter of william brangwen she was also standard five teacher in st philips school and it was a case now of being standard five teacher and nothing else for she could not escape  neither could she succeed that was her horror as the weeks passed on there was no ursula brangwen free and jolly there was only a girl of that name obsessed by the fact that she could not manage her class of children at weekends there came days of passionate reaction when she went mad with the taste of liberty when merely to be free in the morning to sit down at her embroidery and stitch the coloured silks was a passion of delight for the prison house was always awaiting her this was only a respite as her chained heart knew well so that she seized hold of the swift hours of the weekend and wrung the last drop of sweetness out of them in a little cruel frenzy  she did not tell anybody how this state was a torture to her she did not confide either to gudrun or to her parents how horrible she found it to be a schoolteacher but when sunday night came and she felt the monday morning at hand she was strung up tight with dreadful anticipation because the strain and the torture was near again  she did not believe that she could ever teach that great brutish class in that brutal school ever ever and yet if she failed she must in some way go under she must admit that the mans world was too strong for her she could not take her place in it she must go down before mr harby and all her life henceforth she must go on never having freed herself of the mans world never having achieved the freedom of the great world of responsible work maggie had taken her place there she had even stood level with mr harby and got free of him and her soul was always wandering in faroff valleys and glades of poetry maggie was free yet there was something like subjection in maggies very freedom mr harby the man disliked the reserved woman maggie mr harby the schoolmaster respected his teacher miss schofield  for the present however ursula only envied and admired maggie she herself had still to get where maggie had got she had still to make her footing she had taken up a position on mr harbys ground and she must keep it for he was now beginning a regular attack on her to drive her away out of his school she could not keep order her class was a turbulent crowd and the weak spot in the schools work therefore she must go and someone more useful must come in her place someone who could keep discipline  the headmaster had worked himself into an obsession of fury against her he only wanted her gone she had come she had got worse as the weeks went on she was absolutely no good his system which was his very life in school the outcome of his bodily movement was attacked and threatened at the point where ursula was included she was the danger that threatened his body with a blow a fall and blindly thoroughly moving from strong instinct of opposition he set to work to expel her  when he punished one of her children as he had punished the boy hill for an offence against himself he made the punishment extra heavy with the significance that the extra stroke came in because of the weak teacher who allowed all these things to be when he punished for an offence against her he punished lightly as if offences against her were not significant which all the children knew and they behaved accordingly  every now and again mr harby would swoop down to examine exercise books for a whole hour he would be going round the class taking book after book comparing page after page whilst ursula stood aside for all the remarks and faultfinding to be pointed at her through the scholars it was true since she had come the composition books had grown more and more untidy disorderly filthy mr harby pointed to the pages done before her regime and to those done after and fell into a passion of rage many children he sent out to the front with their books and after he had thoroughly gone through the silent and quivering class he caned the worst offenders well in front of the others thundering in real passion of anger and chagrin  such a condition in a class i cant believe it it is simply disgraceful i cant think how you have been let to get like it every monday morning i shall come down and examine these books so dont think that because there is nobody paying any attention to you that you are free to unlearn everything you ever learned and go back till you are not fit for standard three i shall examine all books every monday  then in a rage he went away with his cane leaving ursula to confront a pale quivering class whose childish faces were shut in blank resentment fear and bitterness whose souls were full of anger and contempt for her rather than of the master whose eyes looked at her with the cold inhuman accusation of children and she could hardly make mechanical words to speak to them when she gave an order they obeyed with an insolent offhandedness as if to say as for you do you think we would obey you but for the master she sent the blubbering caned boys to their seats knowing that they too jeered at her and her authority holding her weakness responsible for what punishment had overtaken them and she knew the whole position so that even her horror of physical beating and suffering sank to a deeper pain and became a moral judgment upon her worse than any hurt  she must during the next week watch over her books and punish any fault her soul decided it coldly her personal desire was dead for that day at least she must have nothing more of herself in school she was to be standard five teacher only that was her duty in school she was nothing but standard five teacher ursula brangwen must be excluded  so that pale shut at last distant and impersonal she saw no longer the child how his eyes danced or how he had a queer little soul that could not be bothered with shaping handwriting so long as he dashed down what he thought she saw no children only the task that was to be done and keeping her eyes there on the task and not on the child she was impersonal enough to punish where she could otherwise only have sympathized understood and condoned to approve where she would have been merely uninterested before but her interest had no place any more  it was agony to the impulsive bright girl of seventeen to become distant and official having no personal relationship with the children for a few days after the agony of the monday she succeeded and had some success with her class but it was a state not natural to her and she began to relax  then came another infliction there were not enough pens to go round the class she sent to mr harby for more he came in person  not enough pens miss brangwen he said with the smile and calm of exceeding rage against her  no we are six short she said quaking  oh how is that he said menacingly then looking over the class he asked  how many are there here today  fiftytwo said ursula but he did not take any notice counting for himself  fiftytwo he said and how many pens are there staples  ursula was now silent he would not heed her if she answered since he had addressed the monitor  thats a very curious thing said mr harby looking over the silent class with a slight grin of fury all the childish faces looked up at him blank and exposed  a few days ago there were sixty pens for this classnow there are fortyeight what is fortyeight from sixty williams there was a sinister suspense in the question a thin ferretfaced boy in a sailor suit started up exaggeratedly  please sir he said then a slow sly grin came over his face he did not know there was a tense silence the boy dropped his head then he looked up again a little cunning triumph in his eyes twelve he said  i would advise you to attend said the headmaster dangerously the boy sat down  fortyeight from sixty is twelve so there are twelve pens to account for have you looked for them staples  yes sir  then look again  the scene dragged on two pens were found ten were missing then the storm burst  am i to have you thieving besides your dirt and bad work and bad behaviour the headmaster began not content with being the worstbehaved and dirtiest class in the school you are thieves into the bargain are you it is a very funny thing pens dont melt into the air pens are not in the habit of mizzling away into nothing what has become of them then they must be somewhere what has become of them for they must be found and found by standard five they were lost by standard five and they must be found  ursula stood and listened her heart hard and cold she was so much upset that she felt almost mad something in her tempted her to turn on the headmaster and tell him to stop about the miserable pens but she did not she could not  after every session morning and evening she had the pens counted still they were missing and pencils and indiarubbers disappeared she kept the class staying behind till the things were found but as soon as mr harby had gone out of the room the boys began to jump about and shout and at last they bolted in a body from the school  this was drawing near a crisis she could not tell mr harby because while he would punish the class he would make her the cause of the punishment and her class would pay her back with disobedience and derision already there was a deadly hostility grown up between her and the children after keeping in the class at evening to finish some work she would find boys dodging behind her calling after her brangwen brangwenproudacre  when she went into ilkeston of a saturday morning with gudrun she heard again the voices yelling after her  brangwen brangwen  she pretended to take no notice but she coloured with shame at being held up to derision in the public street she ursula brangwen of cossethay could not escape from the standard five teacher which she was in vain she went out to buy ribbon for her hat they called after her the boys she tried to teach  and one evening as she went from the edge of the town into the country stones came flying at her then the passion of shame and anger surpassed her she walked on unheeding beside herself because of the darkness she could not see who were those that threw but she did not want to know  only in her soul a change took place never more and never more would she give herself as individual to her class never would she ursula brangwen the girl she was the person she was come into contact with those boys she would be standard five teacher as far away personally from her class as if she had never set foot in st philips school she would just obliterate them all and keep herself apart take them as scholars only  so her face grew more and more shut and over her flayed exposed soul of a young girl who had gone open and warm to give herself to the children there set a hard insentient thing that worked mechanically according to a system imposed  it seemed she scarcely saw her class the next day she could only feel her will and what she would have of this class which she must grasp into subjection it was no good any more to appeal to play upon the better feelings of the class her swiftworking soul realized this  she as teacher must bring them all as scholars into subjection and this she was going to do all else she would forsake she had become hard and impersonal almost avengeful on herself as well as on them since the stone throwing she did not want to be a person to be herself any more after such humiliation she would assert herself for mastery be only teacher she was set now she was going to fight and subdue  she knew by now her enemies in the class the one she hated most was williams he was a sort of defective not bad enough to be so classed he could read with fluency and had plenty of cunning intelligence but he could not keep still and he had a kind of sickness very repulsive to a sensitive girl something cunning and etiolated and degenerate once he had thrown an inkwell at her in one of his mad little rages twice he had run home out of class he was a wellknown character  and he grinned up his sleeve at this girlteacher sometimes hanging round her to fawn on her but this made her dislike him more he had a kind of leechlike power  from one of the children she took a supple cane and this she determined to use when real occasion came one morning at composition she said to the boy williams  why have you made this blot  please miss it fell off my pen he whined out in the mocking voice that he was so clever in using the boys near snorted with laughter for williams was an actor he could tickle the feelings of his hearers subtly particularly he could tickle the children with him into ridiculing his teacher or indeed any authority of which he was not afraid he had that peculiar gaol instinct  then you must stay in and finish another page of composition said the teacher  this was against her usual sense of justice and the boy resented it derisively at twelve oclock she caught him slinking out  williams sit down she said  and there she sat and there he sat alone opposite to her on the back desk looking up at her with his furtive eyes every minute  please miss ive got to go an errand he called out insolently  bring me your book said ursula  the boy came out flapping his book along the desks he had not written a line  go back and do the writing you have to do said ursula and she sat at her desk trying to correct books she was trembling and upset and for an hour the miserable boy writhed and grinned in his seat at the end of that time he had done five lines  as it is so late now said ursula you will finish the rest this evening  the boy kicked his way insolently down the passage  the afternoon came again williams was there glancing at her and her heart beat thick for she knew it was a fight between them she watched him  during the geography lesson as she was pointing to the map with her cane the boy continually ducked his whitish head under the desk and attracted the attention of other boys  williams she said gathering her courage for it was critical now to speak to him what are you doing  he lifted his face the sorerimmed eyes half smiling there was something intrinsically indecent about him ursula shrank away  nothing he replied feeling a triumph  what are you doing she repeated her heartbeat suffocating her  nothing replied the boy insolently aggrieved comic  if i speak to you again you must go down to mr harby she said  but this boy was a match even for mr harby he was so persistent so cringing and flexible he howled so when he was hurt that the master hated more the teacher who sent him than he hated the boy himself for of the boy he was sick of the sight which williams knew he grinned visibly  ursula turned to the map again to go on with the geography lesson but there was a little ferment in the class williams spirit infected them all she heard a scuffle and then she trembled inwardly if they all turned on her this time she was beaten  please miss called a voice in distress  she turned round one of the boys she liked was ruefully holding out a torn celluloid collar she heard the complaint feeling futile  go in front wright she said  she was trembling in every fibre a big sullen boy not bad but very difficult slouched out to the front she went on with the lesson aware that williams was making faces at wright and that wright was grinning behind her she was afraid she turned to the map again and she was afraid  please miss williams came a sharp cry and a boy on the back row was standing up with drawn pained brows half a mocking grin on his pain half real resentment against williamsplease miss hes nipped meand he rubbed his leg ruefully  come in front williams she said  the ratlike boy sat with his pale smile and did not move  come in front she repeated definite now  i shant he cried snarling ratlike grinning something went click in ursulas soul her face and eyes set she went through the class straight the boy cowered before her glowering fixed eyes but she advanced on him seized him by the arm and dragged him from his seat he clung to the form it was the battle between him and her her instinct had suddenly become calm and quick she jerked him from his grip and dragged him struggling and kicking to the front he kicked her several times and clung to the forms as he passed but she went on the class was on its feet in excitement she saw it and made no move  she knew if she let go the boy he would dash to the door already he had run home once out of her class so she snatched her cane from the desk and brought it down on him he was writhing and kicking she saw his face beneath her white with eyes like the eyes of a fish stony yet full of hate and horrible fear and she loathed him the hideous writhing thing that was nearly too much for her in horror lest he should overcome her and yet at the heart quite calm she brought down the cane again and again whilst he struggled making inarticulate noises and lunging vicious kicks at her with one hand she managed to hold him and now and then the cane came down on him he writhed like a mad thing but the pain of the strokes cut through his writhing vicious cowards courage bit deeper till at last with a long whimper that became a yell he went limp she let him go and he rushed at her his teeth and eyes glinting there was a second of agonized terror in her heart he was a beast thing then she caught him and the cane came down on him a few times madly in a frenzy he lunged and writhed to kick her but again the cane broke him he sank with a howling yell on the floor and like a beaten beast lay there yelling  mr harby had rushed up towards the end of this performance  whats the matter he roared  ursula felt as if something were going to break in her  ive thrashed him she said her breast heaving forcing out the words on the last breath the headmaster stood choked with rage helpless she looked at the writhing howling figure on the floor  get up she said the thing writhed away from her she took a step forward she had realized the presence of the headmaster for one second and then she was oblivious of it again  get up she said and with a little dart the boy was on his feet his yelling dropped to a mad blubber he had been in a frenzy  go and stand by the radiator she said  as if mechanically blubbering he went  the headmaster stood robbed of movement or speech his face was yellow his hands twitched convulsively but ursula stood stiff not far from him nothing could touch her now she was beyond mr harby she was as if violated to death  the headmaster muttered something turned and went down the room whence from the far end he was heard roaring in a mad rage at his own class  the boy blubbered wildly by the radiator ursula looked at the class there were fifty pale still faces watching her a hundred round eyes fixed on her in an attentive expressionless stare  give out the history readers she said to the monitors  there was dead silence as she stood there she could hear again the ticking of the clock and the chock of piles of books taken out of the low cupboard then came the faint flap of books on the desks the children passed in silence their hands working in unison they were no longer a pack but each one separated into a silent closed thing  take page 125 and read that chapter said ursula  there was a click of many books opened the children found the page and bent their heads obediently to read and they read mechanically  ursula who was trembling violently went and sat in her high chair the blubbering of the boy continued the strident voice of mr brunt the roar of mr harby came muffled through the glass partition and now and then a pair of eyes rose from the readingbook rested on her a moment watchful as if calculating impersonally then sank again  she sat still without moving her eyes watching the class unseeing she was quite still and weak she felt that she could not raise her hand from the desk if she sat there for ever she felt she could not move again nor utter a command it was a quarterpast four she almost dreaded the closing of the school when she would be alone  the class began to recover its ease the tension relaxed williams was still crying mr brunt was giving orders for the closing of the lesson ursula got down  take your place williams she said  he dragged his feet across the room wiping his face on his sleeve as he sat down he glanced at her furtively his eyes still redder now he looked like some beaten rat  at last the children were gone mr harby trod by heavily without looking her way or speaking mr brunt hesitated as she was locking her cupboard  if you settle clarke and letts in the same way miss brangwen youll be all right he said his blue eyes glancing down in a strange fellowship his long nose pointing at her  shall i she laughed nervously she did not want anybody to talk to her  as she went along the street clattering on the granite pavement she was aware of boys dodging behind her something struck her hand that was carrying her bag bruising her as it rolled away she saw that it was a potato her hand was hurt but she gave no sign soon she would take the tram  she was afraid and strange it was to her quite strange and ugly like some dream where she was degraded she would have died rather than admit it to anybody she could not look at her swollen hand something had broken in her she had passed a crisis williams was beaten but at a cost  feeling too much upset to go home she rode a little farther into the town and got down from the tram at a small teashop there in the dark little place behind the shop she drank her tea and ate breadandbutter she did not taste anything the taking of tea was just a mechanical action to cover over her existence there she sat in the dark obscure little place without knowing only unconsciously she nursed the back of her hand which was bruised  when finally she took her way home it was sunset red across the west she did not know why she was going home there was nothing for her there she had true only to pretend to be normal there was nobody she could speak to nowhere to go for escape but she must keep on under this red sunset alone knowing the horror in humanity that would destroy her and with which she was at war yet it had to be so  in the morning again she must go to school she got up and went without murmuring even to herself she was in the hands of some bigger stronger coarser will  school was fairly quiet but she could feel the class watching her ready to spring on her her instinct was aware of the class instinct to catch her if she were weak but she kept cold and was guarded  williams was absent from school in the middle of the morning there was a knock at the door someone wanted the headmaster mr harby went out heavily angrily nervously he was afraid of irate parents after a moment in the passage he came again into school  sturgess he called to one of his larger boys stand in front of the class and write down the name of anyone who speaks will you come this way miss brangwen  he seemed vindictively to seize upon her  ursula followed him and found in the lobby a thin woman with a whitish skin not illdressed in a grey costume and a purple hat  i called about vernon said the woman speaking in a refined accent there was about the woman altogether an appearance of refinement and of cleanliness curiously contradicted by her half beggars deportment and a sense of her being unpleasant to touch like something going bad inside she was neither a lady nor an ordinary working mans wife but a creature separate from society by her dress she was not poor  ursula knew at once that she was williams mother and that he was vernon she remembered that he was always clean and welldressed in a sailor suit and he had this same peculiar half transparent unwholesomeness rather like a corpse  i wasnt able to send him to school today continued the woman with a false grace of manner he came home last night so illhe was violently sicki thought i should have to send for the doctoryou know he has a weak heart  the woman looked at ursula with her pale dead eyes  no replied the girl i did not know  she stood still with repulsion and uncertainty mr harby large and male with his overhanging moustache stood by with a slight ugly smile at the corner of his eyes the woman went on insidiously not quite human  oh yes he has had heart disease ever since he was a child that is why he isnt very regular at school and it is very bad to beat him he was awfully ill this morningi shall call on the doctor as i go back  who is staying with him now then put in the deep voice of the schoolmaster cunningly  oh i left him with a woman who comes in to help meand who understands him but i shall call in the doctor on my way home  ursula stood still she felt vague threats in all this but the woman was so utterly strange to her that she did not understand  he told me he had been beaten continued the woman and when i undressed him to put him to bed his body was covered with marksi could show them to any doctor  mr harby looked at ursula to answer she began to understand the woman was threatening to take out a charge of assault on her son against her perhaps she wanted money  i caned him she said he was so much trouble  im sorry if he was troublesome said the woman but he must have been shamefully beaten i could show the marks to any doctor im sure it isnt allowed if it was known  i caned him while he kept kicking me said ursula getting angry because she was half excusing herself mr harby standing there with the twinkle at the side of his eyes enjoying the dilemma of the two women  im sure im sorry if he behaved badly said the woman but i cant think he deserved beating as he has been i cant send him to school and really cant afford to pay the doctoris it allowed for the teachers to beat the children like that mr harby  the headmaster refused to answer ursula loathed herself and loathed mr harby with his twinkling cunning and malice on the occasion the other miserable woman watched her chance  it is an expense to me and i have a great struggle to keep my boy decent  ursula still would not answer she looked out at the asphalt yard where a dirty rag of paper was blowing  and it isnt allowed to beat a child like that i am sure especially when he is delicate  ursula stared with a set face on the yard as if she did not hear she loathed all this and had ceased to feel or to exist  though i know he is troublesome sometimesbut i think it was too much his body is covered with marks  mr harby stood sturdy and unmoved waiting now to have done with the twinkling tiny wrinkles of an ironical smile at the corners of his eyes he felt himself master of the situation  and he was violently sick i couldnt possibly send him to school today he couldnt keep his head up  yet she had no answer  you will understand sir why he is absent she said turning to mr harby  oh yes he said rough and offhand ursula detested him for his male triumph and she loathed the woman she loathed everything  you will try to have it remembered sir that he has a weak heart he is so sick after these things  yes said the headmaster ill see about it  i know he is troublesome the woman only addressed herself to the male nowbut if you could have him punished without beatinghe is really delicate  ursula was beginning to feel upset harby stood in rather superb mastery the woman cringing to him to tickle him as one tickles trout  i had come to explain why he was away this morning sir you will understand  she held out her hand harby took it and let it go surprised and angry  good morning she said and she gave her gloved seedy hand to ursula she was not illlooking and had a curious insinuating way very distasteful yet effective  good morning mr harby and thank you  the figure in the grey costume and the purple hat was going across the school yard with a curious lingering walk ursula felt a strange pity for her and revulsion from her she shuddered she went into the school again  the next morning williams turned up looking paler than ever very neat and nicely dressed in his sailor blouse he glanced at ursula with a halfsmile cunning subdued ready to do as she told him there was something about him that made her shiver she loathed the idea of having laid hands on him his elder brother was standing outside the gate at playtime a youth of about fifteen tall and thin and pale he raised his hat almost like a gentleman but there was something subdued insidious about him too  who is it said ursula  its the big williams said violet harby roughly she was here yesterday wasnt she  yes  its no good her comingher characters not good enough for her to make any trouble  ursula shrank from the brutality and the scandal but it had some vague horrid fascination how sordid everything seemed she felt sorry for the queer woman with the lingering walk and those queer insidious boys the williams in her class was wrong somewhere how nasty it was altogether  so the battle went on till her heart was sick she had several more boys to subjugate before she could establish herself and mr harby hated her almost as if she were a man she knew now that nothing but a thrashing would settle some of the big louts who wanted to play cat and mouse with her mr harby would not give them the thrashing if he could help it for he hated the teacher the stuckup insolent highschool miss with her independence  now wright what have you done this time he would say genially to the boy who was sent to him from standard five for punishment and he left the lad standing lounging wasting his time  so that ursula would appeal no more to the headmaster but when she was driven wild she seized her cane and slashed the boy who was insolent to her over head and ears and hands and at length they were afraid of her she had them in order  but she had paid a great price out of her own soul to do this it seemed as if a great flame had gone through her and burnt her sensitive tissue she who shrank from the thought of physical suffering in any form had been forced to fight and beat with a cane and rouse all her instincts to hurt and afterwards she had been forced to endure the sound of their blubbering and desolation when she had broken them to order  oh and sometimes she felt as if she would go mad what did it matter what did it matter if their books were dirty and they did not obey she would rather in reality that they disobeyed the whole rules of the school than that they should be beaten broken reduced to this crying hopeless state she would rather bear all their insults and insolences a thousand times than reduce herself and them to this bitterly she repented having got beside herself and having tackled the boy she had beaten  yet it had to be so she did not want to do it yet she had to oh why why had she leagued herself to this evil system where she must brutalize herself to live why had she become a schoolteacher why why  the children had forced her to the beatings no she did not pity them she had come to them full of kindness and love and they would have torn her to pieces they chose mr harby well then they must know her as well as mr harby they must first be subjugate to her for she was not going to be made nought no neither by them nor by mr harby nor by all the system around her she was not going to be put down prevented from standing free it was not to be said of her she could not take her place and carry out her task she would fight and hold her place in this state also in the world of work and mans convention  she was isolated now from the life of her childhood a foreigner in a new life of work and mechanical consideration she and maggie in their dinnerhours and their occasional teas at the little restaurant discussed life and ideas maggie was a great suffragette trusting in the vote to ursula the vote was never a reality she had within her the strange passionate knowledge of religion and living far transcending the limits of the automatic system that contained the vote but her fundamental organic knowledge had as yet to take form and rise to utterance for her as for maggie the liberty of woman meant something real and deep she felt that somewhere in something she was not free and she wanted to be she was in revolt for once she were free she could get somewhere ah the wonderful real somewhere that was beyond her the somewhere that she felt deep deep inside her  in coming out and earning her own living she had made a strong cruel move towards freeing herself but having more freedom she only became more profoundly aware of the big want she wanted so many things she wanted to read great beautiful books and be rich with them she wanted to see beautiful things and have the joy of them for ever she wanted to know big free people and there remained always the want she could put no name to  it was so difficult there were so many things so much to meet and surpass and one never knew where one was going it was a blind fight she had suffered bitterly in this school of st philips she was like a young filly that has been broken in to the shafts and has lost its freedom and now she was suffering bitterly from the agony of the shafts the agony the galling the ignominy of her breaking in this wore into her soul but she would never submit to shafts like these she would never submit for long but she would know them she would serve them that she might destroy them  she and maggie went to all kinds of places together to big suffrage meetings in nottingham to concerts to theatres to exhibitions of pictures ursula saved her money and bought a bicycle and the two girls rode to lincoln to southwell and into derbyshire they had an endless wealth of things to talk about and it was a great joy finding discovering  but ursula never told about winifred inger that was a sort of secret sideshow to her life never to be opened she did not even think of it it was the closed door she had not the strength to open  once she was broken in to her teaching ursula began gradually to have a new life of her own again she was going to college in eighteen months time then she would take her degree and she wouldah she would perhaps be a big woman and lead a movement who knowsat any rate she would go to college in eighteen months time all that mattered now was work work  and till college she must go on with this teaching in st philips school which was always destroying her but which she could now manage without spoiling all her life she would submit to it for a time since the time had a definite limit  the classteaching itself at last became almost mechanical it was a strain on her an exhausting wearying strain always unnatural but there was a certain amount of pleasure in the sheer oblivion of teaching so much work to do so many children to see after so much to be done that ones self was forgotten when the work had become like habit to her and her individual soul was left out had its growth elsewhere then she could be almost happy  her real individual self drew together and became more coherent during these two years of teaching during the struggle against the odds of class teaching it was always a prison to her the school but it was a prison where her wild chaotic soul became hard and independent when she was well enough and not tired then she did not hate the teaching she enjoyed getting into the swing of work of a morning putting forth all her strength making the thing go it was for her a strenuous form of exercise and her soul was left to rest it had the time of torpor in which to gather itself together in strength again but the teaching hours were too long the tasks too heavy and the disciplinary condition of the school too unnatural for her she was worn very thin and quivering  she came to school in the morning seeing the hawthorn flowers wet the little rosy grains swimming in a bowl of dew the larks quivered their song up into the new sunshine and the country was so glad it was a violation to plunge into the dust and greyness of the town  so that she stood before her class unwilling to give herself up to the activity of teaching to turn her energy that longed for the country and for joy of early summer into the dominating of fifty children and the transferring to them some morsels of arithmetic there was a little absentness about her she could not force herself into forgetfulness a jar of buttercups and foolsparsley in the windowbottom kept her away in the meadows where in the lush grass the moondaisies were halfsubmerged and a spray of pink ragged robin yet before her were faces of fifty children they were almost like big daisies in a dimness of the grass  a brightness was on her face a little unreality in her teaching she could not quite see her children she was struggling between two worlds her own world of young summer and flowers and this other world of work and the glimmer of her own sunlight was between her and her class  then the morning passed with a strange farawayness and quietness dinnertime came when she and maggie ate joyously with all the windows open and then they went out into st philips churchyard where was a shadowy corner under red hawthorn trees and there they talked and read shelley or browning or some work about woman and labour  and when she went back to school ursula lived still in the shadowy corner of the graveyard where pinkred petals lay scattered from the hawthorn tree like myriad tiny shells on a beach and a church bell sometimes rang sonorously and sometimes a bird called out whilst maggies voice went on low and sweet  these days she was happy in her soul oh she was so happy that she wished she could take her joy and scatter it in armfuls broadcast she made her children happy too with a little tingling of delight but to her the children were not a school class this afternoon they were flowers birds little bright animals children anything they only were not standard five she felt no responsibility for them it was for once a game this teaching and if they got their sums wrong what matter and she would take a pleasant bit of reading and instead of history with dates she would tell a lovely tale and for grammar they could have a bit of written analysis that was not difficult because they had done it before    she shall be sportive as a fawn    that wild with glee across the lawn    or up the mountain springs  she wrote that from memory because it pleased her  so the golden afternoon passed away and she went home happy she had finished her day of school and was free to plunge into the glowing evening of cossethay and she loved walking home but it had not been school it had been playing at school beneath red hawthorn blossom  she could not go on like this the quarterly examination was coming and her class was not ready it irritated her that she must drag herself away from her happy self and exert herself with all her strength to force to compel this heavy class of children to work hard at arithmetic they did not want to work she did not want to compel them and yet some second conscience gnawed at her telling her the work was not properly done it irritated her almost to madness and she let loose all the irritation in the class then followed a day of battle and hate and violence when she went home raw feeling the golden evening taken away from her herself incarcerated in some dark heavy place and chained there with a consciousness of having done badly at work  what good was it that it was summer that right till evening when the corncrakes called the larks would mount up into the light to sing once more before nightfall what good was it all when she was out of tune when she must only remember the burden and shame of school that day  and still she hated school still she cried she did not believe in it why should the children learn and why should she teach them it was all so much milling the wind what folly was it that made life into this the fulfilling of some stupid factitious duty it was all so made up so unnatural the school the sums the grammar the quarterly examinations the registersit was all a barren nothing  why should she give her allegiance to this world and let it so dominate her that her own world of warm sun and growing sapfilled life was turned into nothing she was not going to do it she was not going to be a prisoner in the dry tyrannical manworld she was not going to care about it what did it matter if her class did ever so badly in the quarterly examination let itwhat did it matter  nevertheless when the time came and the report on her class was bad she was miserable and the joy of the summer was taken away from her she was shut up in gloom she could not really escape from this world of system and work out into her fields where she was happy she must have her place in the working world be a recognized member with full rights there it was more important to her than fields and sun and poetry at this time but she was only the more its enemy  it was a very difficult thing she thought during the long hours of intermission in the summer holidays to be herself her happy self that enjoyed so much to lie in the sun to play and swim and be content and also to be a schoolteacher getting results out of a class of children she dreamed fondly of the time when she need not be a teacher any more but vaguely she knew that responsibility had taken place in her for ever and as yet her prime business was to work  the autumn passed away the winter was at hand ursula became more and more an inhabitant of the world of work and of what is called life she could not see her future but a little way off was college and to the thought of this she clung fixedly she would go to college and get her two or three years training free of cost already she had applied and had her place appointed for the coming year  so she continued to study for her degree she would take french latin english mathematics and botany she went to classes in ilkeston she studied at evening for there was this world to conquer this knowledge to acquire this qualification to attain and she worked with intensity because of a want inside her that drove her on almost everything was subordinated now to this one desire to take her place in the world what kind of place it was to be she did not ask herself the blind desire drove her on she must take her place  she knew she would never be much of a success as an elementary school teacher but neither had she failed she hated it but she had managed it  maggie had left st philips school and had found a more congenial post the two girls remained friends they met at evening classes they studied and somehow encouraged a firm hope each in the other they did not know whither they were making nor what they ultimately wanted but they knew they wanted now to learn to know and to do  they talked of love and marriage and the position of woman in marriage maggie said that love was the flower of life and blossomed unexpectedly and without law and must be plucked where it was found and enjoyed for the brief hour of its duration  to ursula this was unsatisfactory she thought she still loved anton skrebensky but she did not forgive him that he had not been strong enough to acknowledge her he had denied her how then could she love him how then was love so absolute she did not believe it she believed that love was a way a means not an end in itself as maggie seemed to think and always the way of love would be found but whither did it lead  i believe there are many men in the world one might lovethere is not only one man said ursula  she was thinking of skrebensky her heart was hollow with the knowledge of winifred inger  but you must distinguish between love and passion said maggie adding with a touch of contempt men will easily have a passion for you but they wont love you  yes said ursula vehemently the look of suffering almost of fanaticism on her face passion is only part of love and it seems so much because it cant last that is why passion is never happy  she was staunch for joy for happiness and permanency in contrast with maggie who was for sadness and the inevitable passingaway of things ursula suffered bitterly at the hands of life maggie was always single always withheld so she went in a heavy brooding sadness that was almost meat to her in ursulas last winter at st philips the friendship of the two girls came to a climax it was during this winter that ursula suffered and enjoyed most keenly maggies fundamental sadness of enclosedness maggie enjoyed and suffered ursulas struggles against the confines of her life and then the two girls began to drift apart as ursula broke from that form of life wherein maggie must remain enclosed    chapter xiv  the widening circle  maggies people the schofields lived in the large gardeners cottage that was half a farm behind belcote hall the hall was too damp to live in so the schofields were caretakers gamekeepers farmers all in one the father was gamekeeper and stockbreeder the eldest son was marketgardener using the big hall gardens the second son was farmer and gardener there was a large family as at cossethay  ursula loved to stay at belcote to be treated as a grand lady by maggies brothers they were goodlooking men the eldest was twentysix years old he was the gardener a man not very tall but strong and well made with brown sunny easy eyes and a face handsomely hewn brown with a long fair moustache which he pulled as he talked to ursula  the girl was excited because these men attended to her when she came near she could make their eyes light up and quiver she could make anthony the eldest twist and twist his moustache she knew she could move them almost at will with her light laughter and chatter they loved her ideas watched her as she talked vehemently about politics or economics and she while she talked saw the goldenbrown eyes of anthony gleam like the eyes of a satyr as they watched her he did not listen to her words he listened to her it excited her  he was like a faun pleased when she would go with him over his hothouses to look at the green and pretty plants at the pink primulas nodding among their leaves and cinarrias flaunting purple and crimson and white she asked about everything and he told her very exactly and minutely in a queer pedantic way that made her want to laugh yet she was really interested in what he did and he had the curious light in his face like the light in the eyes of the goat that was tethered by the farmyard gate  she went down with him into the warmish cellar where already in the darkness the little yellow knobs of rhubarb were coming he held the lantern down to the dark earth she saw the tiny knobend of the rhubarb thrusting upwards upon the thick red stem thrusting itself like a knob of flame through the soft soil his face was turned up to her the light glittered on his eyes and his teeth as he laughed with a faint musical neigh he looked handsome and she heard a new sound in her ears the faintlymusical neighing laugh of anthony whose moustache twisted up and whose eyes were luminous with a cold steady arrogantlaughing glare there seemed a little prance of triumph in his movement she could not rid herself of a movement of acquiescence a touch of acceptance yet he was so humble his voice was so caressing he held his hand for her to step on when she must climb a wall and she stepped on the living firmness of him that quivered firmly under her weight  she was aware of him as if in a mesmeric state in her ordinary sense she had nothing to do with him but the peculiar ease and unnoticeableness of his entering the house the power of his cold gleaming light on her when he looked at her was like a bewitchment in his eyes as in the pale grey eyes of a goat there seemed some of that steady hard fire of moonlight which has nothing to do with the day it made her alert and yet her mind went out like an extinguished thing she was all senses all her senses were alive  then she saw him on sunday dressed up in sunday clothes trying to impress her and he looked ridiculous she clung to the ridiculous effect of his stiff sunday clothes  she was always conscious of some unfaithfulness to maggie on anthonys score poor maggie stood apart as if betrayed maggie and anthony were enemies by instinct ursula had to go back to her friend brimming with affection and a poignancy of pity which maggie received with a little stiffness then poetry and books and learning took the place of anthony with his goats movements and his cold gleaming humour  while ursula was at belcote the snow fell in the morning a covering of snow weighed on the rhododendron bushes  shall we go out said maggie  she had lost some of her leaders sureness and was now tentative a little in reserve from her friend  they took the key of the gate and wandered into the park it was a white world on which dark trees and tree masses stood under a sky keen with frost the two girls went past the hall that was shuttered and silent their footprints marking the snow on the drive down the park a long way off a man was carrying armfuls of hay across the snow he was a small dark figure like an animal moving in its unawareness  ursula and maggie went on exploring down to a tinkling chilly brook that had worn the snow away in little scoops and ran dark between they saw a robin glance its bright eyes and burst scarlet and grey into the hedge then some pertlymarked bluetits scuffled meanwhile the brook slid on coldly chuckling to itself  the girls wandered across the snowy grass to where the artificial fishponds lay under thin ice there was a big tree with a thick trunk twisted with ivy that hung almost horizontal over the ponds ursula climbed joyfully into this and sat amid bosses of bright ivy and dull berries some ivy leaves were like green spears held out and tipped with snow the ice was seen beneath them  maggie took out a book and sitting lower down the trunk began to read coleridges christabel ursula half listened she was wildly thrilled then she saw anthony coming across the snow with his confident slightly strutting stride his face looked brown and hard against the snow smiling with a sort of tense confidence  hello she called to him  a response went over his face his head was lifted in an answering jerking gesture  hello he said youre like a bird in there  and ursulas laugh rang out she answered to the peculiar reedy twang in his penetrating voice  she did not think of anthony yet she lived in a sort of connection with him in his world one evening she met him as she was coming down the lane and they walked side by side  i think its so lovely here she cried  do you he said im glad you like it  there was a curious confidence in his voice  oh i love it what more does one want than to live in this beautiful place and make things grow in your garden it is like the garden of eden  is it he said with a little laugh yeswell its not so bad he was hesitating the pale gleam was strong in his eyes he was looking at her steadily watching her as an animal might something leaped in her soul she knew he was going to suggest to her that she should be as he was  would you like to stay here with me he asked tentatively  she blenched with fear and with the intense sensation of proffered licence suggested to her  they had come to the gate  how she asked you arent alone here  we could marry he answered in the strange coldlygleaming insinuating tone that chilled the sunshine into moonlight all substantial things seemed transformed shadows and dancing moonlight were real and all cold inhuman gleaming sensations she realized with something like terror that she was going to accept this she was going inevitably to accept him his hand was reaching out to the gate before them she stood still his flesh was hard and brown and final she seemed to be in the grip of some insult  i couldnt she answered involuntarily  he gave the same brief neighing little laugh very sad and bitter now and slotted back the bar of the gate yet he did not open for a moment they both stood looking at the fire of sunset that quivered among the purple twigs of the trees she saw his brown hard wellhewn face gleaming with anger and humiliation and submission he was an animal that knows that it is subdued her heart flamed with sensation of him of the fascinating thing he offered her and with sorrow and with an inconsolable sense of loneliness her soul was an infant crying in the night he had no soul oh and why had she he was the cleaner  she turned away she turned round from him and saw the east flushed strangely rose the moon coming yellow and lovely upon a rosy sky above the darkening bluish snow all this so beautiful all this so lovely he did not see it he was one with it but she saw it and was one with it her seeing separated them infinitely  they went on in silence down the path following their different fates the trees grew darker and darker the snow made only a dimness in an unreal world and like a shadow the day had gone into a faintly luminous snowy evening while she was talking aimlessly to him to keep him at a distance yet to keep him near her and he walked heavily he opened the garden gate for her quietly and she was entering into her own pleasances leaving him outside the gate  then even whilst she was escaping or trying to escape this feeling of pain came maggie the next day saying  i wouldnt make anthony love you ursula if you dont want him it is not nice  but maggie i never made him love me cried ursula dismayed and suffering and feeling as if she had done something base  she liked anthony though all her life at intervals she returned to the thought of him and of that which he offered but she was a traveller she was a traveller on the face of the earth and he was an isolated creature living in the fulfilment of his own senses  she could not help it that she was a traveller she knew anthony that he was not one but oh ultimately and finally she must go on and on seeking the goal that she knew she did draw nearer to  she was wearing away her second and last cycle at st philips as the months went she ticked them off first october then november december january she was careful always to subtract a month from the remainder for the summer holidays she saw herself travelling round a circle only an arc of which remained to complete then she was in the open like a bird tossed into midair a bird that had learned in some measure to fly  there was college ahead that was her midair unknown spacious come college and she would have broken from the confines of all the life she had known for her father was also going to move they were all going to leave cossethay  brangwen had kept his carelessness about his circumstances he knew his work in the lace designing meant little to him personally he just earned his wage by it he did not know what meant much to him living close to anna brangwen his mind was always suffused through with physical heat he moved from instinct to instinct groping always groping on  when it was suggested to him that he might apply for one of the posts as handwork instructor posts about to be created by the nottingham education committee it was as if a space had been given to him into which he could remove from his hot dusky enclosure he sent in his application confidently expectantly he had a sort of belief in his supernatural fate the inevitable weariness of his daily work had stiffened some of his muscles and made a slight deadness in his ruddy alert face now he might escape  he was full of the new possibilities and his wife was acquiescent she was willing now to have a change she too was tired of cossethay the house was too small for the growing children and since she was nearly forty years old she began to come awake from her sleep of motherhood her energy moved more outwards the din of growing lives roused her from her apathy she too must have her hand in making life she was quite ready to move taking all her brood it would be better now if she transplanted them for she had borne her last child it would be growing up  so that in her easy unused fashion she talked plans and arrangements with her husband indifferent really as to the method of the change since a change was coming even if it did not come in this way it would come in another  the house was full of ferment ursula was wild with excitement at last her father was going to be something socially so long he had been a social cypher without form or standing now he was going to be art and handwork instructor for the county of nottingham that was really a status it was a position he would be a specialist in his way and he was an uncommon man ursula felt they were all getting a foothold at last he was coming to his own who else that she knew could turn out from his own fingers the beautiful things her father could produce she felt he was certain of this new job  they would move they would leave this cottage at cossethay which had grown too small for them they would leave cossethay where the children had all been born and where they were always kept to the same measure for the people who had known them as children along with the other village boys and girls would never could never understand that they should grow up different they had held urtler brangwen one of themselves and had given her her place in her native village as in a family and the bond was strong but now when she was growing to something beyond what cossethay would allow or understand the bond between her and her old associates was becoming a bondage  ello ursler ow are yer goin on they said when they met her and it demanded of her in the old voice the old response and something in her must respond and belong to people who knew her but something else denied bitterly what was true of her ten years ago was not true now and something else which she was and must be they could neither see nor allow they felt it there nevertheless something beyond them and they were injured they said she was proud and conceited that she was too big for her shoes nowadays they said she neednt pretend because they knew what she was they had known her since she was born they quoted this and that about her and she was ashamed because she did feel different from the people she had lived amongst it hurt her that she could not be at her ease with them any more and yetand yetones kite will rise on the wind as far as ever one has string to let it go it tugs and tugs and will go and one is glad the further it goes even it everybody else is nasty about it so cossethay hampered her and she wanted to go away to be free to fly her kite as high as she liked she wanted to go away to be free to stand straight up to her own height  so that when she knew that her father had the new post and that the family would move she felt like skipping on the face of the earth and making psalms of joy the old bound shell of cossethay was to be cast off and she was to dance away into the blue air she wanted to dance and sing  she made dreams of the new place she would live in where stately cultured people of high feeling would be friends with her and she would live with the noble in the land moving to a large freedom of feeling she dreamed of a rich proud simple girlfriend who had never known mr harby and his like nor ever had a note in her voice of bondaged contempt and fear as maggie had  and she gave herself to all that she loved in cossethay passionately because she was going away now she wandered about to her favourite spots there was a place where she went trespassing to find the snowdrops that grew wild it was evening and the winterdarkened meadows were full of mystery when she came to the woods an oak tree had been newly chopped down in the dell pale drops of flowers glimmered many under the hazels and by the sharp golden splinters of wood that were splashed about the greygreen blades of snowdrop leaves pricked unheeding the drooping still little flowers were without heed  ursula picked some lovingly in an ecstasy the golden chips of wood shone yellow like sunlight the snowdrops in the twilight were like the first stars of night and she alone amongst them was wildly happy to have found her way into such a glimmering dusk to the intimate little flowers and the splash of wood chips like sunshine over the twilight of the ground she sat down on the felled tree and remained awhile remote  going home she left the purplish dark of the trees for the open lane where the puddles shone long and jewellike in the ruts the land about her was darkened and the sky a jewel overhead oh how amazing it was to her it was almost too much she wanted to run and sing and cry out for very wildness and poignancy but she could not run and sing and cry out in such a way as to cry out the deep things in her heart so she was still and almost sad with loneliness  at easter she went again to maggies home for a few days she was however shy and fugitive she saw anthony how suggestive he was to look on and how his eyes had a sort of supplicating light that was rather beautiful she looked at him and she looked again for him to become real to her but it was her own self that was occupied elsewhere she seemed to have some other being  and she turned to spring and the opening buds there was a large pear tree by a wall and it was full thronged with tiny greygreen buds myriads she stood before it arrested with delight and a realization went deep into her heart there was so great a host in array behind the cloud of pale dim green so much to come forthso much sunshine to pour down  so the weeks passed on trancelike and pregnant the pear tree at cossethay burst into bloom against the cottageend like a wave burst into foam then gradually the bluebells came blue as water standing thin in the level places under the trees and bushes flowing in more and more till there was a flood of azure and palegreen leaves burning and tiny birds with fiery little song and flight then swiftly the flood sank and was gone and it was summer  there was to be no going to the seaside for a holiday the holiday was the removal from cossethay  they were going to live near willey green which place was most central for brangwen it was an old quiet village on the edge of the thronged collierydistrict so that it served in its quaintness of odd old cottages lingering in their sunny gardens as a sort of bower or pleasaunce to the sprawling collierytownlet of beldover a pleasant walkround for the colliers on sunday morning before the publichouses opened  in willey green stood the grammar school where brangwen was occupied for two days during the week and where experiments in education were being carried on  ursula wanted to live in willey green on the remoter side towards southwell and sherwood forest there it was so lovely and romantic but out into the world meant out into the world will brangwen must become modern  he bought with his wifes money a fairly large house in the new redbrick part of beldover it was a villa built by the widow of the late colliery manager and stood in a quiet new little sidestreet near the large church  ursula was rather sad instead of having arrived at distinction they had come to new redbrick suburbia in a grimy small town  mrs brangwen was happy the rooms were splendidly largea splendid diningroom drawingroom and kitchen besides a very pleasant study downstairs everything was admirably appointed the widow had settled herself in lavishly she was a native of beldover and had intended to reign almost queen her bathroom was white and silver her stairs were of oak her chimneypieces were massive and oaken with bulging columnar supports  good and substantial was the keynote but ursula resented the stout inflated prosperity implied everywhere she made her father promise to chisel down the bulging oaken chimneypieces chisel them flat that sort of important paunch was very distasteful to her her father was himself long and loosely built what had he to do with so much good and substantial importance  they bought a fair amount also of the widows furniture it was in common good tastethe great wilton carpet the large round table the chesterfield covered with glossy chintz in roses and birds it was all really very sunny and nice with large windows and a view right across the shallow valley  after all they would be as one of their acquaintances said among the elite of beldover they would represent culture and as there was no one of higher social importance than the doctors the collierymanagers and the chemists they would shine with their della robbia beautiful madonna their lovely reliefs from donatello their reproductions from botticelli nay the large photographs of the primavera and the aphrodite and the nativity in the diningroom the ordinary receptionroom would make dumb the mouth of beldover  and after all it is better to be princess in beldover than a vulgar nobody in the country  there was great preparation made for the removal of the whole brangwen family ten in all the house in beldover was prepared the house in cossethay was dismantled come the end of the schoolterm the removal would begin  ursula left school at the end of july when the summer holiday commenced the morning outside was bright and sunny and the freedom got inside the schoolroom this last day it was as if the walls of the school were going to melt away already they seemed shadowy and unreal it was breakingup morning soon scholars and teachers would be outside each going his own way the irons were struck off the sentence was expired the prison was a momentary shadow halting about them the children were carrying away books and inkwell and rolling up maps all their faces were bright with gladness and goodwill there was a bustle of cleaning and clearing away all marks of this last term of imprisonment they were all breaking free busily eagerly ursula made up her totals of attendances in the register with pride she wrote down the thousands to so many thousands of children had she given another sessionss lessons it looked tremendous the excited hours passed slowly in suspense then at last it was over for the last time she stood before her children whilst they said their prayers and sang a hymn then it was over  goodbye children she said i shall not forget you and you must not forget me  no miss cried the children in chorus with shining faces  she stood smiling on them moved as they filed out then she gave her monitors their term sixpences and they too departed cupboards were locked blackboards washed ink wells and dusters removed the place stood bare and vacated she had triumphed over it it was a shell now she had fought a good fight here and it had not been altogether unenjoyable she owed some gratitude even to this hard vacant place that stood like a memorial or a trophy so much of her life had been fought for and won and lost here something of this school would always belong to her something of her to it she acknowledged it and now came the leavetaking  in the teachers room the teachers were chatting and loitering talking excitedly of where they were going to the isle of man to llandudno to yarmouth they were eager and attached to each other like comrades leaving a ship  then it was mr harbys turn to make a speech to ursula he looked handsome with his silvergrey temples and black brows and his imperturbable male solidity  well he said we must say goodbye to miss brangwen and wish her all good fortune for the future i suppose we shall see her again some time and hear how she is getting on  oh yes said ursula stammering blushing laughing oh yes i shall come and see you  then she realized that this sounded too personal and she felt foolish  miss schofield suggested these two books he said putting a couple of volumes on the table i hope you will like them  ursula feeling very shy picked up the books there was a volume of swinburnes poetry and a volume of merediths  oh i shall love them she said thank you very muchthank you all so muchit is so  she stuttered to an end and very red turned the leaves of the books eagerly pretending to be taking the first pleasure but really seeing nothing  mr harbys eyes were twinkling he alone was at his ease master of the situation it was pleasing to him to make ursula the gift and for once extend good feeling to his teachers as a rule it was so difficult each one was so strained in resentment under his rule  yes he said we hoped you would like the choice  he looked with his peculiar challenging smile for a moment then returned to his cupboards  ursula felt very confused she hugged her books loving them and she felt that she loved all the teachers and mr harby it was very confusing  at last she was out she cast one hasty glance over the school buildings squatting on the asphalt yard in the hot glistening sun one look down the wellknown road and turned her back on it all something strained in her heart she was going away  well good luck said the last of the teachers as she shook hands at the end of the road well expect you back some day  he spoke in irony she laughed and broke away she was free as she sat on the top of the tram in the sunlight she looked round her with tremendous delight she had left something which had meant much to her she would not go to school any more and do the familiar things queer there was a little pang amid her exultation of fear not of regret yet how she exulted this morning  she was tremulous with pride and joy she loved the two books they were tokens to her representing the fruit and trophies of her two years which thank god were over  to ursula brangwen with best wishes for her future and in warm memory of the time she spent in st philips school was written in the headmasters neat scrupulous handwriting she could see the careful hand holding the pen the thick fingers with tufts of black hair on the back of each one  he had signed all the teachers had signed she liked having all their signatures she felt she loved them all they were her fellowworkers she carried away from the school a pride she could never lose she had her place as comrade and sharer in the work of the school her fellow teachers had signed to her as one of them and she was one of all workers she had put in her tiny brick to the fabric man was building she had qualified herself as cobuilder  then the day for the home removal came ursula rose early to pack up the remaining goods the carts arrived lent by her uncle at the marsh in the lull between hay and corn harvest the goods roped in the cart ursula mounted her bicycle and sped away to beldover  the house was hers she entered its cleanscrubbed silence the diningroom had been covered with a thick rush matting hard and of the beautiful luminous clean colour of sundried reeds the walls were pale grey the doors were darker grey ursula admired it very much as the sun came through the large windows streaming in  she flung open doors and windows to the sunshine flowers were bright and shining round the small lawn which stood above the road looking over the raw field opposite which would later be built upon no one came so she wandered down the garden at the back of the wall the eight bells of the church rang the hour she could hear the many sounds of the town about her  at last the cart was seen coming round the corner familiar furniture piled undignified on top tom her brother and theresa marching on foot beside the mass proud of having walked ten miles or more from the tram terminus ursula poured out beer and the men drank thirstily by the door a second cart was coming her father appeared on his motor bicycle there was the staggering transport of furniture up the steps to the little lawn where it was deposited all pellmell in the sunshine very queer and discomforting  brangwen was a pleasant man to work with cheerful and easy ursula loved deciding him where the heavy things should stand she watched anxiously the struggle up the steps and through the doorways then the big things were in the carts set off again ursula and her father worked away carrying in all the light things that remained upon the lawn and putting them in place dinner time came they ate bread and cheese in the kitchen  well were getting on said brangwen cheerfully  two more loads arrived the afternoon passed away in a struggle with the furniture upstairs towards five oclock appeared the last loads consisting also of mrs brangwen and the younger children driven by uncle fred in the trap gudrun had walked with margaret from the station the whole family had come  there said brangwen as his wife got down from the cart now were all here  ay said his wife pleasantly  and the very brevity the silence of intimacy between the two made a home in the hearts of the children who clustered round feeling strange in the new place  everything was at sixes and sevens but a fire was made in the kitchen the hearthrug put down the kettle set on the hob and mrs brangwen began towards sunset to prepare the first meal ursula and gudrun were slaving in the bedrooms candles were rushing about then from the kitchen came the smell of ham and eggs and coffee and in the gaslight the scrambled meal began the family seemed to huddle together like a little camp in a strange place ursula felt a load of responsibility upon her caring for the halflittle ones the smallest kept near the mother  it was dark and the children went sleepy but excited to bed it was a long time before the sound of voices died out there was a tremendous sense of adventure  in the morning everybody was awake soon after dawn the children crying  when i wakened up i didnt know where i was  there were the strange sounds of the town and the repeated chiming of the big church bells so much harsher and more insistent than the little bells of cossethay they looked through the windows past the other new red houses to the wooded hill across the valley they had all a delightful sense of space and liberation space and light and air  but gradually all set to work they were a careless untidy family yet when once they set about to get the house in order the thing went with felicity and quickness by evening the place was roughly established  they would not have a servant to live in the house only a woman who could go home at night and they would not even have the woman yet they wanted to do as they liked in their own home with no stranger in the midst    chapter xv  the bitterness of ecstasy  a storm of industry raged on in the house ursula did not go to college till october so with a distinct feeling of responsibility as if she must express herself in this house she laboured arranging rearranging selecting contriving  she could use her fathers ordinary tools both for woodwork and metalwork so she hammered and tinkered her mother was quite content to have the thing done brangwen was interested he had a ready belief in his daughter he himself was at work putting up his workshed in the garden  at last she had finished for the time being the drawingroom was big and empty it had the good wilton carpet of which the family was so proud and the large couch and large chairs covered with shiny chintz and the piano a little sculpture in plaster that brangwen had done and not very much more it was too large and emptyfeeling for the family to occupy very much yet they liked to know it was there large and empty  the home was the diningroom there the hard rush floorcovering made the ground light reflecting light upon the bottom their hearts in the windowbay was a broad sunny seat the table was so solid one could not jostle it and the chairs so strong one could knock them over without hurting them the familiar organ that brangwen had made stood on one side looking peculiarly small the sideboard was comfortably reduced to normal proportions this was the family livingroom  ursula had a bedroom to herself it was really a servants bedroom small and plain its window looked over the back garden at other back gardens some of them old and very nice some of them littered with packingcases then at the backs of the houses whose fronts were the shops in high street or the genteel homes of the undermanager or the chief cashier facing the chapel  she had six weeks still before going to college in this time she nervously read over some latin and some botany and fitfully worked at some mathematics she was going into college as a teacher for her training but having already taken her matriculation examination she was entered for a university course at the end of a year she would sit for the intermediate arts then two years after for her ba so her case was not that of the ordinary schoolteacher she would be working among the private students who came only for pure education not for mere professional training she would be of the elect  for the next three years she would be more or less dependent on her parents again her training was free all college fees were paid by the government she had moreover a few pounds grant every year this would just pay for her train fares and her clothing her parents would only have to feed her she did not want to cost them much they would not be well off her father would earn only two hundred a year and a good deal of her mothers capital was spent in buying the house still there was enough to get along with  gudrun was attending the art school at nottingham she was working particularly at sculpture she had a gift for this she loved making little models in clay of children or of animals already some of these had appeared in the students exhibition in the castle and gudrun was a distinguished person she was chafing at the art school and wanted to go to london but there was not enough money neither would her parents let her go so far  theresa had left the high school she was a great strapping bold hussy indifferent to all higher claims she would stay at home the others were at school except the youngest when term started they would all be transferred to the grammar school at willey green  ursula was excited at making acquaintances in beldover the excitement soon passed she had tea at the clergymans at the chemists at the other chemists at the doctors at the undermanagersthen she knew practically everybody she could not take people very seriously though at the time she wanted to  she wandered the country on foot and on her bicycle finding it very beautiful in the forest direction between mansfield and southwell and worksop but she was here only skirmishing for amusement her real exploration would begin in college  term began she went into town each day by train the cloistered quiet of the college began to close around her  she was not at first disappointed the big college built of stone standing in the quiet street with a rim of grass and lime trees all so peaceful she felt it remote a magic land its architecture was foolish she knew from her father still it was different from that of all other buildings its rather pretty plaything gothic form was almost a style in the dirty industrial town  she liked the hall with its big stone chimneypiece and its gothic arches supporting the balcony above to be sure the arches were ugly the chimneypiece of cardboardlike carved stone with its armorial decoration looked silly just opposite the bicycle stand and the radiator whilst the great noticeboard with its fluttering papers seemed to slam away all sense of retreat and mystery from the far wall nevertheless amorphous as it might be there was in it a reminiscence of the wondrous cloistral origin of education her soul flew straight back to the medieval times when the monks of god held the learning of men and imparted it within the shadow of religion in this spirit she entered college  the harshness and vulgarity of the lobbies and cloakrooms hurt her at first why was it not all beautiful but she could not openly admit her criticism she was on holy ground  she wanted all the students to have a high pure spirit she wanted them to say only the real genuine things she wanted their faces to be still and luminous as the nuns and the monks faces  alas the girls chattered and giggled and were nervous they were dressed up and frizzed the men looked mean and clownish  still it was lovely to pass along the corridor with ones books in ones hands to push the swinging glasspanelled door and enter the big room where the first lecture would be given the windows were large and lofty the myriad brown students desks stood waiting the great blackboard was smooth behind the rostrum  ursula sat beside her window rather far back looking down she saw the lime trees turning yellow the tradesmans boy passing silent down the still autumnsunny street there was the world remote remote  here within the great whispering seashell that whispered all the while with reminiscence of all the centuries time faded away and the echo of knowledge filled the timeless silence  she listened she scribbled her notes with joy almost with ecstasy never for a moment criticizing what she heard the lecturer was a mouthpiece a priest as he stood blackgowned on the rostrum some strands of the whispering confusion of knowledge that filled the whole place seemed to be singled out and woven together by him till they became a lecture  at first she preserved herself from criticism she would not consider the professors as men ordinary men who ate bacon and pulled on their boots before coming to college they were the blackgowned priests of knowledge serving for ever in a remote hushed temple they were the initiated and the beginning and the end of the mystery was in their keeping  curious joy she had of the lectures it was a joy to hear the theory of education there was such freedom and pleasure in ranging over the very stuff of knowledge and seeing how it moved and lived and had its being how happy racine made her she did not know why but as the big lines of the drama unfolded themselves so steady so measured she felt a thrill as of being in the realm of the reality of latin she was doing livy and horace the curious intimate gossiping tone of the latin class suited horace yet she never cared for him nor even livy there was an entire lack of sternness in the gossipy classroom she tried hard to keep her old grasp of the roman spirit but gradually the latin became mere gossipstuff and artificiality to her a question of manners and verbosities  her terror was the mathematics class the lecturer went so fast her heart beat excitedly she seemed to be straining every nerve and she struggled hard during private study to get the stuff into control  then came the lovely peaceful afternoons in the botany laboratory there were few students how she loved to sit on her high stool before the bench with her pith and her razor and her material carefully mounting her slides carefully bringing her microscope into focus then turning with joy to record her observation drawing joyfully in her book if the slide were good  she soon made a college friend a girl who had lived in florence a girl who wore a wonderful purple or figured scarf draped over a plain dark dress she was dorothy russell daughter of a southcountry advocate dorothy lived with a maiden aunt in nottingham and spent her spare moments slaving for the womens social and political union she was quiet and intense with an ivory face and dark hair looped plain over her ears ursula was very fond of her but afraid of her she seemed so old and so relentless towards herself yet she was only twentytwo ursula always felt her to be a creature of fate like cassandra  the two girls had a close stern friendship dorothy worked at all things with the same passion never sparing herself she came closest to ursula during the botany hours for she could not draw ursula made beautiful and wonderful drawings of the sections under the microscope and dorothy always came to learn the manner of the drawing  so the first year went by in magnificent seclusion and activity of learning it was strenuous as a battle her college life yet remote as peace  she came to nottingham in the morning with gudrun the two sisters were distinguished wherever they went slim strong girls eager and extremely sensitive gudrun was the more beautiful of the two with her sleepy halflanguid girlishness that looked so soft and yet was balanced and inalterable underneath she wore soft easy clothing and hats which fell by themselves into a careless grace  ursula was much more carefully dressed but she was selfconscious always falling into depths of admiration of somebody else and modelling herself upon this other and so producing a hopeless incongruity when she dressed for practical purposes she always looked well in winter wearing a tweed coatandskirt and a small hat of black fur pulled over her eager palpitant face she seemed to move down the street in a drifting motion of suspense and exceeding sensitive receptivity  at the end of the first year ursula got through her intermediate arts examination and there came a lull in her eager activities she slackened off she relaxed altogether worn nervous and inflammable by the excitement of the preparation for the examination and by the sort of exaltation which carried her through the crisis itself she now fell into a quivering passivity her will all loosened  the family went to scarborough for a month gudrun and the father were busy at the handicraft holiday school there ursula was left a good deal with the children but when she could she went off by herself  she stood and looked out over the shining sea it was very beautiful to her the tears rose hot in her heart  out of the far far space there drifted slowly in to her a passionate unborn yearning there are so many dawns that have not yet risen it seemed as if from over the edge of the sea all the unrisen dawns were appealing to her all her unborn soul was crying for the unrisen dawns  as she sat looking out at the tender sea with its lovely swift glimmer the sob rose in her breast till she caught her lip suddenly under her teeth and the tears were forcing themselves from her and in her very sob she laughed why did she cry she did not want to cry it was so beautiful that she laughed it was so beautiful that she cried  she glanced apprehensively round hoping no one would see her in this state  then came a time when the sea was rough she watched the water travelling in to the coast she watched a big wave running unnoticed to burst in a shock of foam against a rock enveloping all in a great white beauty to pour away again leaving the rock emerged black and teeming oh and if when the wave burst into whiteness it were only set free  sometimes she loitered along the harbour looking at the seabrowned sailors who in their close blue jerseys lounged on the harbourwall and laughed at her with impudent communicative eyes  there was established a little relation between her and them she never would speak to them or know any more of them yet as she walked by and they leaned on the seawall there was something between her and them something keen and delightful and painful she liked best the young one whose fair salty hair tumbled over his blue eyes he was so new and fresh and salt and not of this world  from scarborough she went to her uncle toms winifred had a small baby born at the end of the summer she had become strange and alien to ursula there was an unmentionable reserve between the two women tom brangwen was an attentive father a very domestic husband but there was something spurious about his domesticity ursula did not like him any more something ugly blatant in his nature had come out now making him shift everything over to a sentimental basis a materialistic unbeliever he carried it all off by becoming full of human feeling a warm attentive host a generous husband a model citizen and he was clever enough to rouse admiration everywhere and to take in his wife sufficiently she did not love him she was glad to live in a state of complacent selfdeception with him she worked according to him  ursula was relieved to go home she had still two peaceful years before her her future was settled for two years she returned to college to prepare for her final examination  but during this year the glamour began to depart from college the professors were not priests initiated into the deep mysteries of life and knowledge after all they were only middlemen handling wares they had become so accustomed to that they were oblivious of them what was latinso much dry goods of knowledge what was the latin class altogether but a sort of secondhand curio shop where one bought curios and learned the marketvalue of curios dull curios too on the whole she was as bored by the latin curiosities as she was by chinese and japanese curiosities in the antique shops antiquesthe very word made her soul fall flat and dead  the life went out of her studies why she did not know but the whole thing seemed sham spurious spurious gothic arches spurious peace spurious latinity spurious dignity of france spurious naivete of chaucer it was a secondhand dealers shop and one bought an equipment for an examination this was only a little sideshow to the factories of the town gradually the perception stole into her this was no religious retreat no perception of pure learning it was a little apprenticeshop where one was further equipped for making money the college itself was a little slovenly laboratory for the factory  a harsh and ugly disillusion came over her again the same darkness and bitter gloom from which she was never safe now the realization of the permanent substratum of ugliness under everything as she came to the college in the afternoon the lawns were frothed with daisies the lime trees hung tender and sunlit and green and oh the deep white froth of the daisies was anguish to see  for inside inside the college she knew she must enter the sham workshop all the while it was a sham store a sham warehouse with a single motive of material gain and no productivity it pretended to exist by the religious virtue of knowledge but the religious virtue of knowledge was become a flunkey to the god of material success  a sort of inertia came over her mechanically from habit she went on with her studies but it was almost hopeless she could scarcely attend to anything at the anglosaxon lecture in the afternoon she sat looking down out of the window hearing no word of beowulf or of anything else down below in the street the sunny grey pavement went beside the palisade a woman in a pink frock with a scarlet sunshade crossed the road a little white dog running like a fleck of light about her the woman with the scarlet sunshade came over the road a lilt in her walk a little shadow attending her ursula watched spellbound the woman with the scarlet sunshade and the flickering terrier was goneand whither whither  in what world of reality was the woman in the pink dress walking to what warehouse of dead unreality was she herself confined  what good was this place this college what good was anglosaxon when one only learned it in order to answer examination questions in order that one should have a higher commercial value later on she was sick with this long service at the inner commercial shrine yet what else was there was life all this and this only everywhere everything was debased to the same service everything went to produce vulgar things to encumber material life  suddenly she threw over french she would take honours in botany this was the one study that lived for her she had entered into the lives of the plants she was fascinated by the strange laws of the vegetable world she had here a glimpse of something working entirely apart from the purpose of the human world  college was barren cheap a temple converted to the most vulgar petty commerce had she not gone to hear the echo of learning pulsing back to the source of the mysterythe source of mystery and barrenly the professors in their gowns offered commercial commodity that could be turned to good account in the examination room readymade stuff too and not really worth the money it was intended to fetch which they all knew  all the time in the college now save when she was labouring in her botany laboratory for there the mystery still glimmered she felt she was degrading herself in a kind of trade of sham jewjaws  angry and stiff she went through her last term she would rather be out again earning her own living even brinsley street and mr harby seemed real in comparison her violent hatred of the ilkeston school was nothing compared with the sterile degradation of college but she was not going back to brinsley street either she would take her ba and become a mistress in some grammar school for a time  the last year of her college career was wheeling slowly round she could see ahead her examination and her departure she had the ash of disillusion gritting under her teeth would the next move turn out the same always the shining doorway ahead and then upon approach always the shining doorway was a gate into another ugly yard dirty and active and dead always the crest of the hill gleaming ahead under heaven and then from the top of the hill only another sordid valley full of amorphous squalid activity  no matter every hilltop was a little different every valley was somehow new cossethay and her childhood with her father the marsh and the little church school near the marsh and her grandmother and her uncles the high school at nottingham and anton skrebensky anton skrebensky and the dance in the moonlight between the fires then the time she could not think of without being blasted winifred inger and the months before becoming a schoolteacher then the horrors of brinsley street lapsing into comparative peacefulness maggie and maggies brother whose influence she could still feel in her veins when she conjured him up then college and dorothy russell who was now in france then the next move into the world again  already it was a history in every phase she was so different yet she was always ursula brangwen but what did it mean ursula brangwen she did not know what she was only she was full of rejection of refusal always always she was spitting out of her mouth the ash and grit of disillusion of falsity she could only stiffen in rejection in rejection she seemed always negative in her action  that which she was positively was dark and unrevealed it could not come forth it was like a seed buried in dry ash this world in which she lived was like a circle lighted by a lamp this lighted area lit up by mans completest consciousness she thought was all the world that here all was disclosed for ever yet all the time within the darkness she had been aware of points of light like the eyes of wild beasts gleaming penetrating vanishing and her soul had acknowledged in a great heave of terror only the outer darkness this inner circle of light in which she lived and moved wherein the trains rushed and the factories ground out their machineproduce and the plants and the animals worked by the light of science and knowledge suddenly it seemed like the area under an arclamp wherein the moths and children played in the security of blinding light not even knowing there was any darkness because they stayed in the light  but she could see the glimmer of dark movement just out of range she saw the eyes of the wild beast gleaming from the darkness watching the vanity of the camp fire and the sleepers she felt the strange foolish vanity of the camp which said beyond our light and our order there is nothing turning their faces always inward towards the sinking fire of illuminating consciousness which comprised sun and stars and the creator and the system of righteousness ignoring always the vast darkness that wheeled round about with halfrevealed shapes lurking on the edge  yea and no man dared even throw a firebrand into the darkness for if he did he was jeered to death by the others who cried fool antisocial knave why would you disturb us with bogeys there is no darkness we move and live and have our being within the light and unto us is given the eternal light of knowledge we comprise and comprehend the innermost core and issue of knowledge fool and knave how dare you belittle us with the darkness  nevertheless the darkness wheeled round about with grey shadowshapes of wild beasts and also with dark shadowshapes of the angels whom the light fenced out as it fenced out the more familiar beasts of darkness and some having for a moment seen the darkness saw it bristling with the tufts of the hyena and the wolf and some having given up their vanity of the light having died in their own conceit saw the gleam in the eyes of the wolf and the hyena that it was the flash of the sword of angels flashing at the door to come in that the angels in the darkness were lordly and terrible and not to be denied like the flash of fangs  it was a little while before easter in her last year of college when ursula was twentytwo years old that she heard again from skrebensky he had written to her once or twice from south africa during the first months of his service out there in the war and since had sent her a postcard every now and then at ever longer intervals he had become a first lieutenant and had stayed out in africa she had not heard of him now for more than two years  often her thoughts returned to him he seemed like the gleaming dawn yellow radiant of a long grey ashy day the memory of him was like the thought of the first radiant hours of morning and here was the blank grey ashiness of later daytime ah if he had only remained true to her she might have known the sunshine without all this toil and hurt and degradation of a spoiled day he would have been her angel he held the keys of the sunshine still he held them he could open to her the gates of succeeding freedom and delight nay if he had remained true to her he would have been the doorway to her into the boundless sky of happiness and plunging inexhaustible freedom which was the paradise of her soul ah the great range he would have opened to her the illimitable endless space for selfrealization and delight for ever  the one thing she believed in was in the love she had held for him it remained shining and complete a thing to hark back to and she said to herself when present things seemed a failure  ah i was fond of him as if with him the leading flower of her life had died  now she heard from him again the chief effect was pain the pleasure the spontaneous joy was not there any longer but her will rejoiced her will had fixed itself to him and the old excitement of her dreams stirred and woke up he was come the man with the wondrous lips that could send the kiss wavering to the very end of all space was he come back to her she did not believe  my dear ursula i am back in england again for a few months before going out again this time to india i wonder if you still keep the memory of our times together i have still got the little photograph of you you must be changed since then for it is about six years ago i am fully six years olderi have lived through another life since i knew you at cossethay i wonder if you would care to see me i shall come up to derby next week and i would call in nottingham and we might have tea together will you let me know i shall look for your answer   anton skrebensky  ursula had taken this letter from the rack in the hall at college and torn it open as she crossed to the womens room the world seemed to dissolve away from around her she stood alone in clear air  where could she go to be alone she fled away upstairs and through the private way to the reference library seizing a book she sat down and pondered the letter her heart beat her limbs trembled as in a dream she heard one gong sound in the college then strangely another the first lecture had gone by  hurriedly she took one of her notebooks and began to write  dear anton yes i still have the ring i should be very glad to see you again you can come here to college for me or i will meet you somewhere in the town will you let me know your sincere friend  trembling she asked the librarian who was her friend if he would give her an envelope she sealed and addressed her letter and went out bareheaded to post it when it was dropped into the pillarbox the world became a very still pale place without confines she wandered back to college to her pale dream like a first wan light of dawn  skrebensky came one afternoon the following week day after day she had hurried swiftly to the letterrack on her arrival at college in the morning and during the intervals between lectures several times swiftly with secretive fingers she had plucked his letter down from its public prominence and fled across the hall holding it fast and hidden she read her letters in the botany laboratory where her corner was always reserved to her  several letters and then he was coming it was friday afternoon he appointed she worked over her microscope with feverish activity able to give only half her attention yet working closely and rapidly she had on her slide some special stuff come up from london that day and the professor was fussy and excited about it at the same time as she focused the light on her field and saw the plantanimal lying shadowy in a boundless light she was fretting over a conversation she had had a few days ago with dr frankstone who was a woman doctor of physics in the college  no really dr frankstone had said i dont see why we should attribute some special mystery to lifedo you we dont understand it as we understand electricity even but that doesnt warrant our saying it is something special something different in kind and distinct from everything else in the universedo you think it does may it not be that life consists in a complexity of physical and chemical activities of the same order as the activities we already know in science i dont see really why we should imagine there is a special order of life and life alone  the conversation had ended on a note of uncertainty indefinite wistful but the purpose what was the purpose electricity had no soul light and heat had no soul was she herself an impersonal force or conjunction of forces like one of these she looked still at the unicellular shadow that lay within the field of light under her microscope it was alive she saw it moveshe saw the bright mist of its ciliary activity she saw the gleam of its nucleus as it slid across the plane of light what then was its will if it was a conjunction of forces physical and chemical what held these forces unified and for what purpose were they unified  for what purpose were the incalculable physical and chemical activities nodalized in this shadowy moving speck under her microscope what was the will which nodalized them and created the one thing she saw what was its intention to be itself was its purpose just mechanical and limited to itself  it intended to be itself but what self suddenly in her mind the world gleamed strangely with an intense light like the nucleus of the creature under the microscope suddenly she had passed away into an intenselygleaming light of knowledge she could not understand what it all was she only knew that it was not limited mechanical energy nor mere purpose of selfpreservation and selfassertion it was a consummation a being infinite self was a oneness with the infinite to be oneself was a supreme gleaming triumph of infinity  ursula sat abstracted over her microscope in suspense her soul was busy infinitely busy in the new world in the new world skrebensky was waiting for herhe would be waiting for her she could not go yet because her soul was engaged soon she would go  a stillness like passing away took hold of her far off down the corridors she heard the gong booming five oclock she must go yet she sat still  the other students were pushing back their stools and putting their microscopes away everything broke into turmoil she saw through the window students going down the steps with books under their arms talking all talking  a great craving to depart came upon her she wanted also to be gone she was in dread of the material world and in dread of her own transfiguration she wanted to run to meet skrebenskythe new life the reality  very rapidly she wiped her slides and put them back cleared her place at the bench active active active she wanted to run to meet skrebensky hastenhasten she did not know what she was to meet but it would be a new beginning she must hurry  she flitted down the corridor on swift feet her razor and notebooks and pencil in one hand her pinafore over her arm her face was lifted and tense with eagerness he might not be there  issuing from the corridor she saw him at once she knew him at once yet he was so strange he stood with the curious selfeffacing diffidence which so frightened her in wellbred young men whom she knew he stood as if he wished to be unseen he was very welldressed she would not admit to herself the chill like a sunshine of frost that came over her this was he the key the nucleus to the new world  he saw her coming swiftly across the hall a slim girl in a white flannel blouse and dark skirt with some of the abstraction and gleam of the unknown upon her and he started excited he was very nervous other students were loitering about the hall  she laughed with a blind dazzled face as she gave him her hand he too could not perceive her  in a moment she was gone to get her outdoor things then again as when she had been at school they walked out into the town to tea and they went to the same teashop  she knew a great difference in him the kinship was there the old kinship but he had belonged to a different world from hers it was as if they had cried a state of truce between him and her and in this truce they had met she knew vaguely in the first minute that they were enemies come together in a truce every movement and word of his was alien to her being  yet still she loved the fine texture of his face of his skin he was rather browner physically stronger he was a man now she thought his manliness made the strangeness in him when he was only a youth fluid he was nearer to her she thought a man must inevitably set into this strange separateness cold otherness of being he talked but not to her she tried to speak to him but she could not reach him  he seemed so balanced and sure he made such a confident presence he was a great rider so there was about him some of a horsemans sureness and habitual definiteness of decision also some of the horsemans animal darkness yet his soul was only the more wavering vague he seemed made up of a set of habitual actions and decisions the vulnerable variable quick of the man was inaccessible she knew nothing of it she could only feel the dark heavy fixity of his animal desire  this dumb desire on his part had brought him to her she was puzzled hurt by some hopeless fixity in him that terrified her with a cold feeling of despair what did he want his desires were so underground why did he not admit himself what did he want he wanted something that should be nameless she shrank in fear  yet she flashed with excitement in his dark subterranean male soul he was kneeling before her darkly exposing himself she quivered the dark flame ran over her he was waiting at her feet he was helpless at her mercy she could take or reject if she rejected him something would die in him for him it was life or death and yet all must be kept so dark the consciousness must admit nothing  how long she said are you staying in england  i am not surebut not later than july i believe  then they were both silent he was here in england for six months they had a space of six months between them he waited the same iron rigidity as if the world were made of steel possessed her again it was no use turning with flesh and blood to this arrangement of forged metal  quickly her imagination adjusted itself to the situation  have you an appointment in india she asked  yesi have just the six months leave  will you like being out there  i think sotheres a good deal of social life and plenty going onhunting poloand always a good horseand plenty of work any amount of work  he was always sidetracking always sidetracking his own soul she could see him so well out there in indiaone of the governing class superimposed upon an old civilization lord and master of a clumsier civilization than his own it was his choice he would become again an aristocrat invested with authority and responsibility having a great helpless populace beneath him one of the ruling class his whole being would be given over to the fulfilling and the executing of the better idea of the state and in india there would be real work to do the country did need the civilization which he himself represented it did need his roads and bridges and the enlightenment of which he was part he would go to india but that was not her road  yet she loved him the body of him whatever his decisions might be he seemed to want something of her he was waiting for her to decide of him it had been decided in her long ago when he had kissed her first he was her lover though good and evil should cease her will never relaxed though her heart and soul must be imprisoned and silenced he waited upon her and she accepted him for he had come back to her  a glow came into his face into his fine smooth skin his eyes goldgrey glowed intimately to her he burned up he caught fire and became splendid royal something like a tiger she caught his brilliant burnished glamour her heart and her soul were shut away fast down below hidden she was free of them she was to have her satisfaction  she became proud and erect like a flower putting itself forth in its proper strength his warmth invigorated her his beauty of form which seemed to glow out in contrast with the rest of people made her proud it was like deference to her and made her feel as if she represented before him all the grace and flower of humanity she was no mere ursula brangwen she was woman she was the whole of woman in the human order allcontaining universal how should she be limited to individuality  she was exhilarated she did not want to go away from him she had her place by him who should take her away  they came out of the cafe  is there anything you would like to do he said is there anything we can do  it was a dark windy night in march  there is nothing to do she said  which was the answer he wanted  let us walk thenwhere shall we walk he asked  shall we go to the river she suggested timidly  in a moment they were on the tram going down to trent bridge she was so glad the thought of walking in the dark farreaching watermeadows beside the full river transported her dark water flowing in silence through the big restless night made her feel wild  they crossed the bridge descended and went away from the lights in an instant in the darkness he took her hand and they went in silence with subtle feet treading the darkness the town fumed away on their left there were strange lights and sounds the wind rushed against the trees and under the bridge they walked close together powerful in unison he drew her very close held her with a subtle stealthy powerful passion as if they had a secret agreement which held good in the profound darkness the profound darkness was their universe  it is like it was before she said  yet it was not in the least as it was before nevertheless his heart was perfectly in accord with her they thought one thought  i knew i should come back he said at length  she quivered  did you always love me she asked  the directness of the question overcame him submerged him for a moment the darkness travelled massively along  i had to come back to you he said as if hypnotized you were always at the back of everything  she was silent with triumph like fate  i loved you she said always  the dark flame leaped up in him he must give her himself he must give her the very foundations of himself he drew her very close and they went on in silence  she started violently hearing voices they were near a stile across the dark meadows  its only lovers he said to her softly  she looked to see the dark figures against the fence wondering that the darkness was inhabited  only lovers will walk here tonight he said  then in a low vibrating voice he told her about africa the strange darkness the strange blood fear  i am not afraid of the darkness in england he said it is soft and natural to me it is my medium especially when you are here but in africa it seems massive and fluid with terrornot fear of anythingjust fear one breathes it like the smell of blood the blacks know it they worship it really the darkness one almost likes itthe fearsomething sensual  she thrilled again to him he was to her a voice out of the darkness he talked to her all the while in low tones about africa conveying something strange and sensual to her the negro with his loose soft passion that could envelop one like a bath gradually he transferred to her the hot fecund darkness that possessed his own blood he was strangely secret the whole world must be abolished he maddened her with his soft cajoling vibrating tones he wanted her to answer to understand a turgid teeming night heavy with fecundity in which every molecule of matter grew big with increase secretly urgent with fecund desire seemed to come to pass she quivered taut and vibrating almost pained and gradually he ceased telling her of africa there came a silence whilst they walked the darkness beside the massive river her limbs were rich and tense she felt they must be vibrating with a low profound vibration she could scarcely walk the deep vibration of the darkness could only be felt not heard  suddenly as they walked she turned to him and held him fast as if she were turned to steel  do you love me she cried in anguish  yes he said in a curious lapping voice unlike himself yes i love you  he seemed like the living darkness upon her she was in the embrace of the strong darkness he held her enclosed soft unutterably soft and with the unrelaxing softness of fate the relentless softness of fecundity she quivered and quivered like a tense thing that is struck but he held her all the time soft unending like darkness closed upon her omnipresent as the night he kissed her and she quivered as if she were being destroyed shattered the lighted vessel vibrated and broke in her soul the light fell struggled and went dark she was all dark willless having only the receptive will  he kissed her with his soft enveloping kisses and she responded to them completely her mind her soul gone out darkness cleaving to darkness she hung close to him pressed herself into soft flow of his kiss pressed herself down down to the source and core of his kiss herself covered and enveloped in the warm fecund flow of his kiss that travelled over her flowed over her covered her flowed over the last fibre of her so they were one stream one dark fecundity and she clung at the core of him with her lips holding open the very bottommost source of him  so they stood in the utter dark kiss that triumphed over them both subjected them knitted them into one fecund nucleus of the fluid darkness  it was bliss it was the nucleolating of the fecund darkness once the vessel had vibrated till it was shattered the light of consciousness gone then the darkness reigned and the unutterable satisfaction  they stood enjoying the unmitigated kiss taking it giving to it endlessly and still it was not exhausted their veins fluttered their blood ran together as one stream  till gradually a sleep a heaviness settled on them a drowse and out of the drowse a small light of consciousness woke up ursula became aware of the night around her the water lapping and running full just near the trees roaring and soughing in gusts of wind  she kept near to him in contact with him but she became ever more and more herself and she knew she must go to catch her train but she did not want to draw away from contact with him  at length they roused and set out no longer they existed in the unblemished darkness there was the glitter of a bridge the twinkle of lights across the river the big flare of the town in front and on their right  but still dark and soft and incontestable their bodies walked untouched by the lights darkness supreme and arrogant  the stupid lights ursula said to herself in her dark sensual arrogance the stupid artificial exaggerated town fuming its lights it does not exist really it rests upon the unlimited darkness like a gleam of coloured oil on dark water but what is itnothing just nothing  in the tram in the train she felt the same the lights the civic uniform was a trick played the people as they moved or sat were only dummies exposed she could see beneath their pale wooden pretence of composure and civic purposefulness the dark stream that contained them all they were like little paper ships in their motion but in reality each one was a dark blind eager wave urging blindly forward dark with the same homogeneous desire and all their talk and all their behaviour was sham they were dressedup creatures she was reminded of the invisible man who was a piece of darkness made visible only by his clothes  during the next weeks all the time she went about in the same dark richness her eyes dilated and shining like the eyes of a wild animal a curious halfsmile which seemed to be gibing at the civic pretence of all the human life about her  what are you you pale citizens her face seemed to say gleaming you subdued beast in sheeps clothing you primeval darkness falsified to a social mechanism  she went about in the sensual subconsciousness all the time mocking at the readymade artificial daylight of the rest  they assume selves as they assume suits of clothing she said to herself looking in mocking contempt at the stiffened neutralized men they think it better to be clerks or professors than to be the dark fertile beings that exist in the potential darkness what do you think you are her soul asked of the professor as she sat opposite him in class what do you think you are as you sit there in your gown and your spectacles you are a lurking bloodsniffing creature with eyes peering out of the jungle darkness snuffing for your desires that is what you are though nobody would believe it and you would be the very last to allow it  her soul mocked at all this pretence herself she kept on pretending she dressed herself and made herself fine she attended her lectures and scribbled her notes but all in a mood of superficial mocking facility she understood well enough their twoandtwomakefour tricks she was as clever as they were but caredid she care about their monkey tricks of knowledge or learning or civic deportment she did not care in the least  there was skrebensky there was her dark vital self outside the college the outer darkness skrebensky was waiting on the edge of the night he was attentive did he care  she was free as a leopard that sends up its raucous cry in the night she had the potent dark stream of her own blood she had the glimmering core of fecundity she had her mate her complement her sharer in fruition so she had all everything  skrebensky was staying in nottingham all the time he too was free he knew no one in this town he had no civic self to maintain he was free their trams and markets and theatres and public meetings were a shaken kaleidoscope to him he watched as a lion or a tiger may lie with narrowed eyes watching the people pass before its cage the kaleidoscopic unreality of people or a leopard lie blinking watching the incomprehensible feats of the keepers he despised it allit was all nonexistent their good professors their good clergymen their good political speakers their good earnest womenall the time he felt his soul was grinning grinning at the sight of them so many performing puppets all wood and rag for the performance  he watched the citizen a pillar of society a model saw the stiff goats legs which have become almost stiffened to wood in the desire to make them puppet in their action he saw the trousers formed to the puppetaction mans legs but mans legs become rigid and deformed ugly mechanical  he was curiously happy being alone now the glimmering grin was on his face he had no longer any necessity to take part in the performing tricks of the rest he had discovered the clue to himself he had escaped from the show like a wild beast escaped straight back into its jungle having a room in a quiet hotel he hired a horse and rode out into the country staying sometimes for the night in some village and returning the next day  he felt rich and abundant in himself everything he did was a voluptuous pleasure to himeither to ride on horseback or to walk or to lie in the sun or to drink in a publichouse he had no use for people nor for words he had an amused pleasure in everything a great sense of voluptuous richness in himself and of the fecundity of the universal night he inhabited the puppet shapes of people their woodmechanical voices he was remote from them  for there were always his meetings with ursula very often she did not go to college in the afternoon but walked with him instead or he took a motorcar or a dogcart and they drove into the country leaving the car and going away by themselves into the woods he had not taken her yet with subtle instinctive economy they went to the end of each kiss each embrace each pleasure in intimate contact knowing subconsciously that the last was coming it was to be their final entry into the source of creation  she took him home and he stayed a weekend at beldover with her family she loved having him in the house strange how he seemed to come into the atmosphere of her family with his laughing insidious grace they all loved him he was kin to them his raillery his warm voluptuous mocking presence was meat and joy to the brangwen household for this house was always quivering with darkness they put off their puppet form when they came home to lie and drowse in the sun  there was a sense of freedom amongst them all of the undercurrent of darkness among them all yet here at home ursula resented it it became distasteful to her and she knew that if they understood the real relationship between her and skrebensky her parents her father in particular would go mad with rage so subtly she seemed to be like any other girl who is more or less courted by a man and she was like any other girl but in her the antagonism to the social imposition was for the time complete and final  she waited every moment of the day for his next kiss she admitted it to herself in shame and bliss almost consciously she waited he waited but until the time came more unconsciously when the time came that he should kiss her again a prevention was an annihilation to him he felt his flesh go grey he was heavy with a corpselike inanition he did not exist if the time passed unfulfilled  he came to her finally in a superb consummation it was very dark and again a windy heavy night they had come down the lane towards beldover down to the valley they were at the end of their kisses and there was the silence between them they stood as at the edge of a cliff with a great darkness beneath  coming out of the lane along the darkness with the dark space spreading down to the wind and the twinkling lights of the station below the faroff windy chuff of a shunting train the tiny clinkclinkclink of the wagons blown between the wind the light of beldoveredge twinkling upon the blackness of the hill opposite the glow of the furnaces along the railway to the right their steps began to falter they would soon come out of the darkness into the lights it was like turning back it was unfulfilment two quivering unwilling creatures they lingered on the edge of the darkness peering out at the lights and the machineglimmer beyond they could not turn back to the worldthey could not  so lingering along they came to a great oak tree by the path in all its budding mass it roared to the wind and its trunk vibrated in every fibre powerful indomitable  we will sit down he said  and in the roaring circle under the tree that was almost invisible yet whose powerful presence received them they lay a moment looking at the twinkling lights on the darkness opposite saw the sweeping brand of a train past the edge of their darkened field  then he turned and kissed her and she waited for him the pain to her was the pain she wanted the agony was the agony she wanted she was caught up entangled in the powerful vibration of the night the man what was hea dark powerful vibration that encompassed her she passed away as on a dark wind far far away into the pristine darkness of paradise into the original immortality she entered the dark fields of immortality  when she rose she felt strangely free strong she was not ashamedwhy should she be he was walking beside her the man who had been with her she had taken him they had been together whither they had gone she did not know but it was as if she had received another nature she belonged to the eternal changeless place into which they had leapt together  her soul was sure and indifferent of the opinion of the world of artificial light as they went up the steps of the footbridge over the railway and met the trainpassengers she felt herself belonging to another world she walked past them immune a whole darkness dividing her from them when she went into the lighted diningroom at home she was impervious to the lights and the eyes of her parents her everyday self was just the same she merely had another stronger self that knew the darkness  this curious separate strength that existed in darkness and pride of night never forsook her she had never been more herself it could not occur to her that anybody not even the young man of the world skrebensky should have anything at all to do with her permanent self as for her temporal social self she let it look after itself  her whole soul was implicated with skrebenskynot the young man of the world but the undifferentiated man he was she was perfectly sure of herself perfectly strong stronger than all the world the world was not strongshe was strong the world existed only in a secondary senseshe existed supremely  she continued at college in her ordinary routine merely as a cover to her dark powerful underlife the fact of herself and with her skrebensky was so powerful that she took rest in the other she went to college in the morning and attended her classes flowering and remote  she had lunch with him in his hotel every evening she spent with him either in town at his rooms or in the country she made the excuse at home of evening study for her degree but she paid not the slightest attention to her study  they were both absolute and happy and calm the fact of their own consummate being made everything else so entirely subordinate that they were free the only thing they wanted as the days went by was more time to themselves they wanted the time to be absolutely their own  the easter vacation was approaching they agreed to go right away it would not matter if they did not come back they were indifferent to the actual facts  i suppose we ought to get married he said rather wistfully it was so magnificently free and in a deeper world as it was to make public their connection would be to put it in range with all the things which nullified him and from which he was for the moment entirely dissociated if he married he would have to assume his social self and the thought of assuming his social self made him at once diffident and abstract if she were his social wife if she were part of that complication of dead reality then what had his underlife to do with her ones social wife was almost a material symbol whereas now she was something more vivid to him than anything in conventional life could be she gave the complete lie to all conventional life he and she stood together dark fluid infinitely potent giving the living lie to the dead whole which contained them  he watched her pensive puzzled face  i dont think i want to marry you she said her brow clouded  it piqued him rather  why not he asked  lets think about it afterwards shall we she said  he was crossed yet he loved her violently  youve got a museau not a face he said  have i she cried her face lighting up like a pure flame she thought she had escaped yet he returnedhe was not satisfied  why he asked why dont you want to marry me  i dont want to be with other people she said i want to be like this ill tell you if ever i want to marry you  all right he said  he would rather the thing was left indefinite and that she took the responsibility  they talked of the easter vacation she thought only of complete enjoyment  they went to an hotel in piccadilly she was supposed to be his wife they bought a weddingring for a shilling from a shop in a poor quarter  they had revoked altogether the ordinary mortal world their confidence was like a possession upon them they were possessed perfectly and supremely free they felt proud beyond all question and surpassing mortal conditions  they were perfect therefore nothing else existed the world was a world of servants whom one civilly ignored wherever they went they were the sensuous aristocrats warm bright glancing with pure pride of the senses  the effect upon other people was extraordinary the glamour was cast from the young couple upon all they came into contact with waiters or chance acquaintances  oui monsieur le baron she would reply with a mocking courtesy to her husband  so they came to be treated as titled people he was an officer in the engineers they were just married going to india immediately  thus a tissue of romance was round them she believed she was a young wife of a titled husband on the eve of departure for india this the social fact was a delicious makebelief the living fact was that he and she were man and woman absolute and beyond all limitation  the days went bythey were to have three weeks togetherin perfect success all the time they themselves were reality all outside was tribute to them they were quite careless about money but they did nothing very extravagant he was rather surprised when he found that he had spent twenty pounds in a little under a week but it was only the irritation of having to go to the bank the machinery of the old system lasted for him not the system the money simply did not exist  neither did any of the old obligations they came home from the theatre had supper then flitted about in their dressinggowns they had a large bedroom and a corner sittingroom high up remote and very cosy they ate all their meals in their own rooms attended by a young german called hans who thought them both wonderful and answered assiduously  gewiss herr baronbitte sehr frau baronin  often they saw the pink of dawn away across the park the tower of westminster cathedral was emerging the lamps of piccadilly stringing away beside the trees of the park were becoming pale and mothlike the morning traffic was clockclocking down the shadowy road which had gleamed all night like metal down below running far ahead into the night beneath the lamps and which was now vague as in a mist because of the dawn  then as the flush of dawn became stronger they opened the glass doors and went on to the giddy balcony feeling triumphant as two angels in bliss looking down at the still sleeping world which would wake to a dutiful rumbling sluggish turmoil of unreality  but the air was cold they went into their bedroom and bathed before going to bed leaving the partition doors of the bathroom open so that the vapour came into the bedroom and faintly dimmed the mirror she was always in bed first she watched him as he bathed his quick unconscious movements the electric light glinting on his wet shoulders he stood out of the bath his hair all washed flat over his forehead and pressed the water out of his eyes he was slender and to her perfect a clean straightcut youth without a grain of superfluous body the brown hair on his body was soft and fine and adorable he was all beautifully flushed as he stood in the white bathapartment  he saw her warm dark litup face watching him from the pillowyet he did not see itit was always present and was to him as his own eyes he was never aware of the separate being of her she was like his own eyes and his own heart beating to him  so he went across to her to get his sleeping suit it was always a perfect adventure to go near to her she put her arms round him and snuffed his warm softened skin  scent she said  soap he answered  soap she repeated looking up with bright eyes they were both laughing always laughing  soon they were fast asleep asleep till midday close together sleeping one sleep then they awoke to the everchanging reality of their state they alone inhabited the world of reality all the rest lived on a lower sphere  whatever they wanted to do they did they saw a few peopledorothy whose guest she was supposed to be and a couple of friends of skrebensky young oxford men who called her mrs skrebensky with entire simplicity they treated her indeed with such respect that she began to think she was really quite of the whole universe of the old world as well as of the new she forgot she was outside the pale of the old world she thought she had brought it under the spell of her own real world and so she had  in such everchanging reality the weeks went by all the time they were an unknown world to each other every movement made by the one was a reality and an adventure to the other they did not want outside excitements they went to very few theatres they were often in their sittingroom high up over piccadilly with windows open on two sides and the door open on to the balcony looking over the green park or down upon the minute travelling of the traffic  then suddenly looking at a sunset she wanted to go she must be gone she must be gone at once and in two hours time they were at charing cross taking train for paris paris was his suggestion she did not care where it was the great joy was in setting out and for a few days she was happy in the novelty of paris  then for some reason she must call in rouen on the way back to london he had an instinctive mistrust of her desire for the place but perversely she wanted to go there it was as if she wanted to try its effect upon her  for the first time in rouen he had a cold feeling of death not afraid of any other man but of her she seemed to leave him she followed after something that was not him she did not want him the old streets the cathedral the age and the monumental peace of the town took her away from him she turned to it as if to something she had forgotten and wanted this was now the reality this great stone cathedral slumbering there in its mass which knew no transience nor heard any denial it was majestic in its stability its splendid absoluteness  her soul began to run by itself he did not realize nor did she yet in rouen he had the first deadly anguish the first sense of the death towards which they were wandering and she felt the first heavy yearning heavy heavy hopeless warning almost like a deep uneasy sinking into apathy hopelessness  they returned to london but still they had two days he began to tremble he grew feverish with the fear of her departure she had in her some fatal prescience that made her calm what would be would be  he remained fairly easy however still in his state of heightened glamour till she had gone and he had turned away from st pancras and sat on the tramcar going up pimlico to the angel to moorgate street on sunday evening  then the cold horror gradually soaked into him he saw the horror of the city road he realized the ghastly cold sordidness of the tramcar in which he sat cold stark ashen sterility had him surrounded where then was the luminous wonderful world he belonged to by rights how did he come to be thrown on this refuseheap where he was  he was as if mad the horror of the brick buildings of the tramcar of the ashengrey people in the street made him reeling and blind as if drunk he went mad he had lived with her in a close living pulsing world where everything pulsed with rich being now he found himself struggling amid an ashendry cold world of rigidity dead walls and mechanical traffic and creeping spectrelike people the life was extinct only ash moved and stirred or stood rigid there was a horrible clattering activity a rattle like the falling of dry slag cold and sterile it was as if the sunshine that fell were unnatural light exposing the ash of the town as if the lights at night were the sinister gleam of decomposition  quite mad beside himself he went to his club and sat with a glass of whisky motionless as if turned to clay he felt like a corpse that is inhabited with just enough life to make it appear as any other of the spectral unliving beings which we call people in our dead language her absence was worse than pain to him it destroyed his being  dead he went on from lunch to tea his face was all the time fixed and stiff and colourless his life was a dry mechanical movement yet even he wondered slightly at the awful misery that had overcome him how could he be so ashlike and extinct he wrote her a letter  i have been thinking that we must get married before long my pay will be more when i get out to india we shall be able to get along or if you dont want to go to india i could very probably stay here in england but i think you would like india you could ride and you would know just everybody out there perhaps if you stay on to take your degree we might marry immediately after that i will write to your father as soon as i hear from you  he went on disposing of her if only he could be with her all he wanted now was to marry her to be sure of her yet all the time he was perfectly perfectly hopeless cold extinct without emotion or connection  he felt as if his life were dead his soul was extinct the whole being of him had become sterile he was a spectre divorced from life he had no fullness he was just a flat shape day by day the madness accumulated in him the horror of notbeing possessed him  he went here there and everywhere but whatever he did he knew that only the cipher of him was there nothing was filled in he went to the theatre what he heard and saw fell upon a cold surface of consciousness which was now all that he was there was nothing behind it he could have no experience of any sort mechanical registering took place in him no more he had no being no contents neither had the people he came into contact with they were mere permutations of known quantities there was no roundness or fullness in this world he now inhabited everything was a dead shape mental arrangement without life or being  much of the time he was with friends and comrades then he forgot everything their activities made up for his own negation they engaged his negative horror  he only became happy when he drank and he drank a good deal then he was just the opposite to what he had been he became a warm diffuse glowing cloud in a warm diffuse formless fashion everything melted down into a rosy glow and he was the glow and everything was the glow everybody else was the glow and it was very nice very nice he would sing songs it was so nice  ursula went back to beldover shut and firm she loved skrebensky of that she was resolved she would allow nothing else  she read his long obsessed letter about getting married and going to india without any particular response she seemed to ignore what he said about marriage it did not come home to her he seemed throughout the greater part of his letter to be talking without much meaning  she replied to him pleasantly and easily she rarely wrote long letters  india sounds lovely i can just see myself on an elephant swaying between lanes of obsequious natives but i dont know if father would let me go we must see  i keep living over again the lovely times we have had but i dont think you liked me quite so much towards the end did you you did not like me when we left paris why didnt you  i love you very much i love your body it is so clear and fine i am glad you do not go naked or all the women would fall in love with you i am very jealous of it i love it so much  he was more or less satisfied with this letter but day after day he was walking about dead nonexistent  he could not come again to nottingham until the end of april then he persuaded her to go with him for a weekend to a friends house near oxford by this time they were engaged he had written to her father and the thing was settled he brought her an emerald ring of which she was very proud  her people treated her now with a little distance as if she had already left them they left her very much alone  she went with him for the three days in the country house near oxford it was delicious and she was very happy but the thing she remembered most was when getting up in the morning after he had gone back quietly to his own room having spent the night with her she found herself very rich in being alone and enjoying to the full her solitary room she drew up her blind and saw the plum trees in the garden below all glittering and snowy and delighted with the sunshine in full bloom under a blue sky they threw out their blossom they flung it out under the blue heavens the whitest blossom how excited it made her  she had to hurry through her dressing to go and walk in the garden under the plum trees before anyone should come and talk to her out she slipped and paced like a queen in fairy pleasaunces the blossom was silvershadowy when she looked up from under the tree at the blue sky there was a faint scent a faint noise of bees a wonderful quickness of happy morning  she heard the breakfast gong and went indoors  where have you been asked the others  i had to go out under the plum trees she said her face glowing like a flower it is so lovely  a shadow of anger crossed skrebenskys soul she had not wanted him to be there he hardened his will  at night there was a moon and the blossom glistened ghostly they went together to look at it she saw the moonlight on his face as he waited near her and his features were like silver and his eyes in shadow were unfathomable she was in love with him he was very quiet  they went indoors and she pretended to be tired so she went quickly to bed  dont be long coming to me she whispered as she was supposed to be kissing him good night  and he waited intent obsessed for the moment when he could come to her  she enjoyed him she made much of him she liked to put her fingers on the soft skin of his sides or on the softness of his back when he made the muscles hard underneath the muscles developed very strong through riding and she had a great thrill of excitement and passion because of the unimpressible hardness of his body that was so soft and smooth under her fingers that came to her with such absolute service  she owned his body and enjoyed it with all the delight and carelessness of a possessor but he had become gradually afraid of her body he wanted her he wanted her endlessly but there had come a tension into his desire a constraint which prevented his enjoying the delicious approach and the lovable close of the endless embrace he was afraid his will was always tense fixed  her final examination was at midsummer she insisted on sitting for it although she had neglected her work during the past months he also wanted her to go in for the degree then he thought she would be satisfied secretly he hoped she would fail so that she would be more glad of him  would you rather live in india or in england when we are married he asked her  oh in india by far she said with a careless lack of consideration which annoyed him  once she said with heat  i shall be glad to leave england everything is so meagre and paltry it is so unspirituali hate democracy  he became angry to hear her talk like this he did not know why somehow he could not bear it when she attacked things it was as if she were attacking him  what do you mean he asked her hostile why do you hate democracy  only the greedy and ugly people come to the top in a democracy she said because theyre the only people who will push themselves there only degenerate races are democratic  what do you want thenan aristocracy he asked secretly moved he always felt that by rights he belonged to the ruling aristocracy yet to hear her speak for his class pained him with a curious painful pleasure he felt he was acquiescing in something illegal taking to himself some wrong reprehensible advantages  i do want an aristocracy she cried and id far rather have an aristocracy of birth than of money who are the aristocrats nowwho are chosen as the best to rule those who have money and the brains for money it doesnt matter what else they have but they must have moneybrainsbecause they are ruling in the name of money  the people elect the government he said  i know they do but what are the people each one of them is a moneyinterest i hate it that anybody is my equal who has the same amount of money as i have i know i am better than all of them i hate them they are not my equals i hate equality on a money basis it is the equality of dirt  her eyes blazed at him he felt as if she wanted to destroy him she had gripped him and was trying to break him his anger sprang up against her at least he would fight for his existence with her a hard blind resistance possessed him  i dont care about money he said neither do i want to put my finger in the pie i am too sensitive about my finger  what is your finger to me she cried in a passion you with your dainty fingers and your going to india because you will be one of the somebodies there its a mere dodge your going to india  in what way a dodge he cried white with anger and fear  you think the indians are simpler than us and so youll enjoy being near them and being a lord over them she said and youll feel so righteous governing them for their own good who are you to feel righteous what are you righteous about in your governing your governing stinks what do you govern for but to make things there as dead and mean as they are here  i dont feel righteous in the least he said  then what do you feel its all such a nothingness what you feel and what you dont feel  what do you feel yourself he said arent you righteous in your own mind  yes i am because im against you and all your old dead things she cried  she seemed with the last words uttered in hard knowledge to strike down the flag that he kept flying he felt cut off at the knees a figure made worthless a horrible sickness gripped him as if his legs were really cut away and he could not move but remained a crippled trunk dependent worthless the ghastly sense of helplessness as if he were a mere figure that did not exist vitally made him mad beside himself  now even whilst he was with her this death of himself came over him when he walked about like a body from which all individual life is gone in this state he neither heard nor saw nor felt only the mechanism of his life continued  he hated her as far as in this state he could hate his cunning suggested to him all the ways of making her esteem him for she did not esteem him he left her and did not write to her he flirted with other women with gudrun  this last made her very fierce she was still fiercely jealous of his body in passionate anger she upbraided him because not being man enough to satisfy one woman he hung round others  dont i satisfy you he asked of her again going white to the throat  no she said youve never satisfied me since the first week in london you never satisfy me now what does it mean to me your having me she lifted her shoulders and turned aside her face in a motion of cold indifferent worthlessness  he felt he would kill her  when she had roused him to a pitch of madness when she saw his eyes all dark and mad with suffering then a great suffering overcame her soul a great inconquerable suffering and she loved him for oh she wanted to love him stronger than life or death was her craving to be able to love him  and at such moments when he was made with her destroying him when all his complacency was destroyed all his everyday self was broken and only the stripped rudimentary primal man remained demented with torture her passion to love him became love she took him again they came together in an overwhelming passion in which he knew he satisfied her  but it all contained a developing germ of death after each contact her anguished desire for him or for that which she never had from him was stronger her love was more hopeless after each contact his mad dependence on her was deepened his hope of standing strong and taking her in his own strength was weakened he felt himself a mere attribute of her  whitsuntide came just before her examination she was to have a few days of rest dorothy had inherited her patrimony and had taken a cottage in sussex she invited them to stay with her  they went down to dorothys neat low cottage at the foot of the downs here they could do as they liked ursula was always yearning to go to the top of the downs the white track wound up to the rounded summit and she must go  up there she could see the channel a few miles away the sea raised up and faintly glittering in the sky the isle of wight a shadow lifted in the far distance the river winding bright through the patterned plain to seaward arundel castle a shadowy bulk and then the rolling of the high smooth downs making a high smooth land under heaven acknowledging only the heavens in their great sunglowing strength and suffering only a few bushes to trespass on the intercourse between their great unabateable body and the changeful body of the sky  below she saw the villages and the woods of the weald and the train running bravely a gallant little thing running with all the importance of the world over the water meadows and into the gap of the downs waving its white steam yet all the while so little so little yet its courage carried it from end to end of the earth till there was no place where it did not go yet the downs in magnificent indifference bearing limbs and body to the sun drinking sunshine and seawind and seawet cloud into its golden skin with superb stillness and calm of being was not the downs still more wonderful the blind pathetic energetic courage of the train as it steamed tinily away through the patterned levels to the seas dimness so fast and so energetic made her weep where was it going it was going nowhere it was just going so blind so without goal or aim yet so hasty she sat on an old prehistoric earthwork and cried and the tears ran down her face the train had tunnelled all the earth blindly and uglily  and she lay face downwards on the downs that were so strong that cared only for their intercourse with the everlasting skies and she wished she could become a strong mound smooth under the sky bosom and limbs bared to all winds and clouds and bursts of sunshine  but she must get up again and look down from her foothold of sunshine down and away at the patterned level earth with its villages and its smoke and its energy so shortsighted the train seemed running to the distance so terrifying in their littleness the villages with such pettiness in their activity  skrebensky wandered dazed not knowing where he was or what he was doing with her all her passion seemed to be to wander up there on the downs and when she must descend to earth she was heavy up there she was exhilarated and free  she would not love him in a house any more she said she hated houses and particularly she hated beds there was something distasteful in his coming to her bed  she would stay the night on the downs up there he with her it was midsummer the days were glamorously long at about halfpast ten when the blueyblack darkness had at last fallen they took rugs and climbed the steep track to the summit of the downs he and she  up there the stars were big the earth below was gone into darkness she was free up there with the stars far out they saw tiny yellow lightsbut it was very far out at sea or on land she was free up among the stars  she took off her clothes and made him take off all his and they ran over the smooth moonless turf a long way more than a mile from where they had left their clothing running in the dark soft wind utterly naked as naked as the downs themselves her hair was loose and blew about her shoulders she ran swiftly wearing sandals when she set off on the long run to the dewpond  in the round dewpond the stars were untroubled she ventured softly into the water grasping at the stars with her hands  and then suddenly she started back running swiftly he was there beside her but only on sufferance he was a screen for her fears he served her she took him she clasped him clenched him close but her eyes were open looking at the stars it was as if the stars were lying with her and entering the unfathomable darkness of her womb fathoming her at last it was not him  the dawn came they stood together on a high place an earthwork of the stoneage men watching for the light it came over the land but the land was dark she watched a pale rim on the sky away against the darkened land the darkness became bluer a little wind was running in from the sea behind it seemed to be running to the pale rift of the dawn and she and he darkly on an outpost of the darkness stood watching for the dawn  the light grew stronger gushing up against the dark sapphire of the transparent night the light grew stronger whiter then over it hovered a flush of rose a flush of rose and then yellow pale newcreated yellow the whole quivering and poising momentarily over the fountain on the skys rim  the rose hovered and quivered burned fused to flame to a transient red while the yellow urged out in great waves thrown from the everincreasing fountain great waves of yellow flinging into the sky scattering its spray over the darkness which became bluer and bluer paler till soon it would itself be a radiance which had been darkness  the sun was coming there was a quivering a powerful terrifying swim of molten light then the molten source itself surged forth revealing itself the sun was in the sky too powerful to look at  and the ground beneath lay so still so peaceful only now and again a cock crew otherwise from the distant yellow hills to the pine trees at the foot of the downs everything was newly washed into being in a flood of new golden creation  it was so unutterably still and perfect with promise the goldenlighted distinct land that ursulas soul rocked and wept suddenly he glanced at her the tears were running over her cheeks her mouth was working strangely  what is the matter he asked  after a moments struggle with her voice  it is so beautiful she said looking at the glowing beautiful land it was so beautiful so perfect and so unsullied  he too realized what england would be in a few hours timea blind sordid strenuous activity all for nothing fuming with dirty smoke and running trains and groping in the bowels of the earth all for nothing a ghastliness came over him  he looked at ursula her face was wet with tears very bright like a transfiguration in the refulgent light nor was his the hand to wipe away the burning bright tears he stood apart overcome by a cruel ineffectuality  gradually a great helpless sorrow was rising in him but as yet he was fighting it away he was struggling for his own life he became very quiet and unaware of the things about him awaiting as it were her judgment on him  they returned to nottingham the time of her examination came she must go to london but she would not stay with him in an hotel she would go to a quiet little pension near the british museum  those quiet residential squares of london made a great impression on her mind they were very complete her mind seemed imprisoned in their quietness who was going to liberate her  in the evening her practical examinations being over he went with her to dinner at one of the hotels down the river near richmond it was golden and beautiful with yellow water and white and scarletstriped boatawnings and blue shadows under the trees  when shall we be married he asked her quietly simply as if it were a mere question of comfort  she watched the changing pleasuretraffic of the river he looked at her golden puzzled museau the knot gathered in his throat  i dont know she said  a hot grief gripped his throat  why dont you knowdont you want to be married he asked her  her head turned slowly her face puzzled like a boys face expressionless because she was trying to think looked towards his face she did not see him because she was preoccupied she did not quite know what she was going to say  i dont think i want to be married she said and her naive troubled puzzled eyes rested a moment on his then travelled away preoccupied  do you mean never or not just yet he asked  the knot in his throat grew harder his face was drawn as if he were being strangled  i mean never she said out of some far self which spoke for once beyond her  his drawn strangled face watched her blankly for a few moments then a strange sound took place in his throat she started came to herself and horrified saw him his head made a queer motion the chin jerked back against the throat the curious crowing hiccupping sound came again his face twisted like insanity and he was crying crying blind and twisted as if something were broken which kept him in control  tonydont she cried starting up  it tore every one of her nerves to see him he made groping movements to get out of his chair but he was crying uncontrollably noiselessly with his face twisted like a mask contorted and the tears running down the amazing grooves in his cheeks blindly his face always this horrible working mask he groped for his hat for his way down from the terrace it was eight oclock but still brightly light the other people were staring in great agitation part of which was exasperation she stayed behind paid the waiter with a halfsovereign took her yellow silk coat then followed skrebensky  she saw him walking with brittle blind steps along the path by the river she could tell by the strange stiffness and brittleness of his figure that he was still crying hurrying after him running she took his arm  tony she cried dont why are you like this what are you doing this for dont its not necessary  he heard and his manhood was cruelly coldly defaced yet it was no good he could not gain control of his face his face his breast were weeping violently as if automatically his will his knowledge had nothing to do with it he simply could not stop  she walked holding his arm silent with exasperation and perplexity and pain he took the uncertain steps of a blind man because his mind was blind with weeping  shall we go home shall we have a taxi she said  he could pay no attention very flustered very agitated she signalled indefinitely to a taxicab that was going slowly by the driver saluted and drew up she opened the door and pushed skrebensky in then took her own place her face was uplifted the mouth closed down she looked hard and cold and ashamed she winced as the drivers dark red face was thrust round upon her a fullblooded animal face with black eyebrows and a thick shortcut moustache  where to lady he said his white teeth showing again for a moment she was flustered  forty rutland square she said  he touched his cap and stolidly set the car in motion he seemed to have a league with her to ignore skrebensky  the latter sat as if trapped within the taxicab his face still working whilst occasionally he made quick slight movements of the head to shake away his tears he never moved his hands she could not bear to look at him she sat with face uplifted and averted to the window  at length when she had regained some control over herself she turned again to him he was much quieter his face was wet and twitched occasionally his hands still lay motionless but his eyes were quite still like a washed sky after rain full of a wan light and quite steady almost ghostlike  a pain flamed in her womb for him  i didnt think i should hurt you she said laying her hand very lightly tentatively on his arm the words came without my knowing they didnt mean anything really  he remained quite still hearing but washed all wan and without feeling she waited looking at him as if he were some curious notunderstandable creature  you wont cry again will you tony  some shame and bitterness against her burned him in the question she noticed how his moustache was soddened wet with tears taking her handkerchief she wiped his face the drivers heavy stolid back remained always turned to them as if conscious but indifferent skrebensky sat motionless whilst ursula wiped his face softly carefully and yet clumsily not as well as he would have wiped it himself  her handkerchief was too small it was soon wet through she groped in his pocket for his own then with its more ample capacity she carefully dried his face he remained motionless all the while then she drew his cheek to hers and kissed him his face was cold her heart was hurt she saw the tears welling quickly to his eyes again as if he were a child she again wiped away his tears by now she herself was on the point of weeping her underlip was caught between her teeth  so she sat still for fear of her own tears sitting close by him holding his hand warm and close and loving meanwhile the car ran on and a soft midsummer dusk began to gather for a long while they sat motionless only now and again her hand closed more closely lovingly over his hand then gradually relaxed  the dusk began to fall one or two lights appeared the driver drew up to light his lamps skrebensky moved for the first time leaning forward to watch the driver his face had always the same still clarified almost childlike look impersonal  they saw the drivers strange full dark face peering into the lamps under drawn brows ursula shuddered it was the face almost of an animal yet of a quick strong wary animal that had them within its knowledge almost within its power she clung closer to krebensky  my love she said to him questioningly when the car was again running in full motion  he made no movement or sound he let her hold his hand he let her reach forward in the gathering darkness and kiss his still cheek the crying had gone byhe would not cry any more he was whole and himself again  my love she repeated trying to make him notice her but as yet he could not  he watched the road they were running by kensington gardens for the first time his lips opened  shall we get out and go into the park he asked  yes she said quietly not sure what was coming  after a moment he took the tube from its peg she saw the stout strong selfcontained driver lean his head  stop at hyde park corner  the dark head nodded the car ran on just the same  presently they pulled up skrebensky paid the man ursula stood back she saw the driver salute as he received his tip and then before he set the car in motion turn and look at her with his quick powerful animals look his eyes very concentrated and the whites of his eyes flickering then he drove away into the crowd he had let her go she had been afraid  skrebensky turned with her into the park a band was still playing and the place was thronged with people they listened to the ebbing music then went aside to a dark seat where they sat closely hand in hand  then at length as out of the silence she said to him wondering  what hurt you so  she really did not know at this moment  when you said you wanted never to marry me he replied with a childish simplicity  but why did that hurt you so she said you neednt mind everything i say so particularly  i dont knowi didnt want to do it he said humbly ashamed  she pressed his hand warmly they sat close together watching the soldiers go by with their sweethearts the lights trailing in myriads down the great thoroughfares that beat on the edge of the park  i didnt know you cared so much she said also humbly  i didnt he said i was knocked over myselfbut i careall the world  his voice was so quiet and colourless it made her heart go pale with fear  my love she said drawing near to him but she spoke out of fear not out of love  i care all the worldi care for nothing elseneither in life nor in death he said in the same steady colourless voice of essential truth  than for what she murmured duskily  than for youto be with me  and again she was afraid was she to be conquered by this she cowered close to him very close to him they sat perfectly still listening to the great heavy beating sound of the town the murmur of lovers going by the footsteps of soldiers  she shivered against him  you are cold he said  a little  we will go and have some supper  he was now always quiet and decided and remote very beautiful he seemed to have some strange cold power over her  they went to a restaurant and drank chianti but his pale wan look did not go away  dont leave me tonight he said at length looking at her pleading he was so strange and impersonal she was afraid  but the people of my place she said quivering  i will explain to themthey know we are engaged  she sat pale and mute he waited  shall we go he said at length  where  to an hotel  her heart was hardened without answering she rose to acquiesce but she was now cold and unreal yet she could not refuse him it seemed like fate a fate she did not want  they went to an italian hotel somewhere and had a sombre bedroom with a very large bed clean but sombre the ceiling was painted with a bunch of flowers in a big medallion over the bed she thought it was pretty  he came to her and cleaved to her very close like steel cleaving and clinching on to her her passion was roused it was fierce but cold but it was fierce and extreme and good their passion this night he slept with her fast in his arms all night long he held her fast against him she was passive acquiscent but her sleep was not very deep nor very real  she woke in the morning to a sound of water dashed on a courtyard to sunlight streaming through a lattice she thought she was in a foreign country and skrebensky was there an incubus upon her  she lay still thinking whilst his arm was round her his head against her shoulders his body against hers just behind her he was still asleep  she watched the sunshine coming in bars through the persiennes and her immediate surroundings again melted away  she was in some other land some other world where the old restraints had dissolved and vanished where one moved freely not afraid of ones fellow men nor wary nor on the defensive but calm indifferent at ones ease vaguely in a sort of silver light she wandered at large and at ease the bonds of the world were broken this world of england had vanished away she heard a voice in the yard below calling  o giovannooogiovann  and she knew she was in a new country in a new life it was very delicious to lie thus still with ones soul wandering freely and simply in the silver light of some other simpler more finely natural world  but always there was a foreboding waiting to command her she became more aware of skrebensky she knew he was waking up she must modify her soul depart from her further world for him  she knew he was awake he lay still with a concrete stillness not as when he slept then his arm tightened almost convulsively upon her and he said half timidly  did you sleep well  very well  so did i  there was a pause  and do you love me he asked  she turned and looked at him searchingly he seemed outside her  i do she said  but she said it out of complacency and a desire not to be harried there was a curious breach of silence between them which frightened him  they lay rather late then he rang for breakfast she wanted to be able to go straight downstairs and away from the place when she got up she was happy in this room but the thought of the publicity of the hall downstairs rather troubled her  a young italian a sicilian dark and slightly pockmarked buttoned up in a sort of grey tunic appeared with the tray his face had an almost african imperturbability impassive incomprehensible  one might be in italy skrebensky said to him genially a vacant look almost like fear came on the fellows face he did not understand  this is like italy skrebensky explained  the face of the italian flashed with a noncomprehending smile he finished setting out the tray and was gone he did not understand he would understand nothing he disappeared from the door like a halfdomesticated wild animal it made ursula shudder slightly the quick sharpsighted intent animality of the man  skrebensky was beautiful to her this morning his face softened and transfused with suffering and with love his movements very still and gentle he was beautiful to her but she was detached from him by a chill distance always she seemed to be bearing up against the distance that separated them but he was unaware this morning he was transfused and beautiful she admired his movements the way he spread honey on his roll or poured out the coffee  when breakfast was over she lay still again on the pillows whilst he went through his toilet she watched him as he sponged himself and quickly dried himself with the towel his body was beautiful his movements intent and quick she admired him and she appreciated him without reserve he seemed completed now he aroused no fruitful fecundity in her he seemed added up finished she knew him all round not on any side did he lead into the unknown poignant almost passionate appreciation she felt for him but none of the dreadful wonder none of the rich fear the connection with the unknown or the reverence of love he was however unaware this morning his body was quiet and fulfilled his veins complete with satisfaction he was happy finished  again she went home but this time he went with her he wanted to stay by her he wanted her to marry him it was already july in early september he must sail for india he could not bear to think of going alone she must come with him nervously he kept beside her  her examination was finished her college career was over there remained for her now to marry or to work again she applied for no post it was concluded she would marry india tempted herthe strange strange land but with the thought of calcutta or bombay or of simla and of the european population india was no more attractive to her than nottingham  she had failed in her examination she had gone down she had not taken her degree it was a blow to her it hardened her soul  it doesnt matter he said what are the odds whether you are a bachelor of arts or not according to the london university all you know you know and if you are mrs skrebensky the ba is meaningless  instead of consoling her this made her harder more ruthless she was now up against her own fate it was for her to choose between being mrs skrebensky even baroness skrebensky wife of a lieutenant in the royal engineers the sappers as he called them living with the european population in indiaor being ursula brangwen spinster schoolmistress she was qualified by her intermediate arts examination she would probably even now get a post quite easily as assistant in one of the higher grade schools or even in willey green school which was she to do  she hated most of all entering the bondage of teaching once more very heartily she detested it yet at the thought of marriage and living with skrebensky amid the european population in india her soul was locked and would not budge she had very little feeling about it only there was a deadlock  skrebensky waited she waited everybody waited for the decision when anton talked to her and seemed insidiously to suggest himself as a husband to her she knew how utterly locked out he was on the other hand when she saw dorothy and discussed the matter she felt she would marry him promptly at once as a sharp disavowal of adherence with dorothys views  the situation was almost ridiculous  but do you love him asked dorothy  it isnt a question of loving him said ursula i love him well enoughcertainly more than i love anybody else in the world and i shall never love anybody else the same again we have had the flower of each other but i dont care about love i dont value it i dont care whether i love or whether i dont whether i have love or whether i havent what is it to me  and she shrugged her shoulders in fierce angry contempt  dorothy pondered rather angry and afraid  then what do you care about she asked exasperated  i dont know said ursula but something impersonal lovelovelovewhat does it meanwhat does it amount to so much personal gratification it doesnt lead anywhere  it isnt supposed to lead anywhere is it said dorothy satirically i thought it was the one thing which is an end in itself  then what does it matter to me cried ursula as an end in itself i could love a hundred men one after the other why should i end with a skrebensky why should i not go on and love all the types i fancy one after another if love is an end in itself there are plenty of men who arent anton whom i could lovewhom i would like to love  then you dont love him said dorothy  i tell you i doquite as much and perhaps more than i should love any of the others only there are plenty of things that arent in anton that i would love in the other men  what for instance  it doesnt matter but a sort of strong understanding in some men and then a dignity a directness something unquestioned that there is in working men and then a jolly reckless passionateness that you seea man who could really let go  dorothy could feel that ursula was already hankering after something else something that this man did not give her  the question is what do you want propounded dorothy is it just other men  ursula was silenced this was her own dread was she just promiscuous  because if it is continued dorothy youd better marry anton the other can only end badly  so out of fear of herself ursula was to marry skrebensky  he was very busy now preparing to go to india he must visit relatives and contract business he was almost sure of ursula now she seemed to have given in and he seemed to become again an important selfassured man  it was the first week in august and he was one of a large party in a bungalow on the lincolnshire coast it was a tennis golf motorcar motorboat party given by his greataunt a lady of social pretensions ursula was invited to spend the week with the party  she went rather reluctantly her marriage was more or less fixed for the twentyeighth of the month they were to sail for india on september the fifth one thing she knew in her subconsciousness and that was she would never sail for india  she and anton being important guests on account of the coming marriage had rooms in the large bungalow it was a big place with a great central hall two smaller writingrooms and then two corridors from which opened eight or nine bedrooms skrebensky was put on one corridor ursula on the other they felt very lost in the crowd  being lovers however they were allowed to be out alone together as much as they liked yet she felt very strange in this crowd of strange people uneasy as if she had no privacy she was not used to these homogeneous crowds she was afraid  she felt different from the rest of them with their hard easy shallow intimacy that seemed to cost them so little she felt she was not pronounced enough it was a kind of holdyourown unconventional atmosphere  she did not like it in crowds in assemblies of people she liked formality she felt she did not produce the right effect she was not effective she was not beautiful she was nothing even before skrebensky she felt unimportant almost inferior he could take his part very well with the rest  he and she went out into the night there was a moon behind clouds shedding a diffused light gleaming now and again in bits of smoky motherofpearl so they walked together on the wet ribbed sands near the sea hearing the run of the long heavy waves that made a ghostly whiteness and a whisper  he was sure of himself as she walked the soft silk of her dressshe wore a blue shantung fullskirtedblew away from the sea and flapped and clung to her legs she wished it would not everything seemed to give her away and she could not rouse herself to deny she was so confused  he would lead her away to a pocket in the sandhills secret amid the grey thornbushes and the grey glassy grass he held her close against him felt all her firm unutterably desirable mould of body through the fine fibre of the silk that fell about her limbs the silk slipping fierily on the hidden yet revealed roundness and firmness of her body her loins seemed to run in him like fire make his brain burn like brimstone she liked it the electric fire of the silk under his hands upon her limbs the fire flew over her as he drew nearer and nearer to discovery she vibrated like a jet of electric firm fluid in response yet she did not feel beautiful all the time she felt she was not beautiful to him only exciting she let him take her and he seemed mad mad with excited passion but she as she lay afterwards on the cold soft sand looking up at the blotted faintly luminous sky felt that she was as cold now as she had been before yet he breathing heavily seemed almost savagely satisfied he seemed revenged  a little wind wafted the sea grass and passed over her face where was the supreme fulfilment she would never enjoy why was she so cold so unroused so indifferent  as they went home and she saw the many hateful lights of the bungalow of several bungalows in a group he said softly  dont lock your door  id rather here she said  no dont we belong to each other dont let us deny it  she did not answer he took her silence for consent  he shared his room with another man  i suppose he said it wont alarm the house if i go across to happier regions  so long as you dont make a great row going and dont try the wrong door said the other man turning in to sleep  skrebensky went out in his widestriped sleeping suit he crossed the big dining hall whose low firelight smelled of cigars and whisky and coffee entered the other corridor and found ursulas room she was lying awake wideeyed and suffering she was glad he had come if only for consolation it was consolation to be held in his arms to feel his body against hers yet how foreign his arms and body were yet still not so horribly foreign and hostile as the rest of the house felt to her  she did not know how she suffered in this house she was healthy and exorbitantly full of interest so she played tennis and learned golf she rowed out and swam in the deep sea and enjoyed it very much indeed full of zest yet all the time among those others she felt shocked and wincing as if her violentlysensitive nakedness were exposed to the hard brutal material impact of the rest of the people  the days went by unmarked in a full almost strenuous enjoyment of ones own physique skrebensky was one among the others till evening came and he took her for himself she was allowed a great deal of freedom and was treated with a good deal of respect as a girl on the eve of marriage about to depart for another continent  the trouble began at evening then a yearning for something unknown came over her a passion for something she knew not what she would walk the foreshore alone after dusk expecting expecting something as if she had gone to a rendezvous the salt bitter passion of the sea its indifference to the earth its swinging definite motion its strength its attack and its salt burning seemed to provoke her to a pitch of madness tantalizing her with vast suggestions of fulfilment and then for personification would come skrebensky skrebensky whom she knew whom she was fond of who was attractive but whose soul could not contain her in its waves of strength nor his breast compel her in burning salty passion  one evening they went out after dinner across the low golf links to the dunes and the sea the sky had small faint stars all was still and faintly dark they walked together in silence then ploughed labouring through the heavy loose sand of the gap between the dunes they went in silence under the even faint darkness in the darker shadow of the sandhills  suddenly cresting the heavy sandy pass ursula lifted her head and shrank back momentarily frightened there was a great whiteness confronting her the moon was incandescent as a round furnace door out of which came the high blast of moonlight over the seaward half of the world a dazzling terrifying glare of white light they shrank back for a moment into shadow uttering a cry he felt his chest laid bare where the secret was heavily hidden he felt himself fusing down to nothingness like a bead that rapidly disappears in an incandescent flame  how wonderful cried ursula in low calling tones how wonderful  and she went forward plunging into it he followed behind she too seemed to melt into the glare towards the moon  the sands were as ground silver the sea moved in solid brightness coming towards them and she went to meet the advance of the flashing buoyant water she gave her breast to the moon her belly to the flashing heaving water he stood behind encompassed a shadow ever dissolving  she stood on the edge of the water at the edge of the solid flashing body of the sea and the wave rushed over her feet  i want to go she cried in a strong dominant voice i want to go  he saw the moonlight on her face so she was like metal he heard her ringing metallic voice like the voice of a harpy to him  she prowled ranging on the edge of the water like a possessed creature and he followed her he saw the froth of the wave followed by the hard bright water swirl over her feet and her ankles she swung out her arms to balance he expected every moment to see her walk into the sea dressed as she was and be carried swimming out  but she turned she walked to him  i want to go she cried again in the high hard voice like the scream of gulls  where he asked  i dont know  and she seized hold of his arm held him fast as if captive and walked him a little way by the edge of the dazzling dazing water  then there in the great flare of light she clinched hold of him hard as if suddenly she had the strength of destruction she fastened her arms round him and tightened him in her grip whilst her mouth sought his in a hard rending everincreasing kiss till his body was powerless in her grip his heart melted in fear from the fierce beaked harpys kiss the water washed again over their feet but she took no notice she seemed unaware she seemed to be pressing in her beaked mouth till she had the heart of him then at last she drew away and looked at himlooked at him he knew what she wanted he took her by the hand and led her across the foreshore back to the sandhills she went silently he felt as if the ordeal of proof was upon him for life or death he led her to a dark hollow  no here she said going out to the slope full under the moonshine she lay motionless with wideopen eyes looking at the moon he came direct to her without preliminaries she held him pinned down at the chest awful the fight the struggle for consummation was terrible it lasted till it was agony to his soul till he succumbed till he gave way as if dead lay with his face buried partly in her hair partly in the sand motionless as if he would be motionless now for ever hidden away in the dark buried only buried he only wanted to be buried in the goodly darkness only that and no more  he seemed to swoon it was a long time before he came to himself he was aware of an unusual motion of her breast he looked up her face lay like an image in the moonlight the eyes wide open rigid but out of the eyes slowly there rolled a tear that glittered in the moonlight as it ran down her cheek  he felt as if as the knife were being pushed into his already dead body with head strained back he watched drawn tense for some minutes watched the unaltering rigid face like metal in the moonlight the fixed unseeing eye in which slowly the water gathered shook with glittering moonlight then surcharged brimmed over and ran trickling a tear with its burden of moonlight into the darkness to fall in the sand  he drew gradually away as if afraid drew awayshe did not move he glanced at hershe lay the same could he break away he turned saw the open foreshore clear in front of him and he plunged away on and on ever farther from the horrible figure that lay stretched in the moonlight on the sands with the tears gathering and travelling on the motionless eternal face  he felt if ever he must see her again his bones must be broken his body crushed obliterated for ever and as yet he had the love of his own living body he wandered on a long long way till his brain drew dark and he was unconscious with weariness then he curled in the deepest darkness he could find under the seagrass and lay there without consciousness  she broke from her tense cramp of agony gradually though each movement was a goad of heavy pain gradually she lifted her dead body from the sands and rose at last there was now no moon for her no sea all had passed away she trailed her dead body to the house to her room where she lay down inert  morning brought her a new access of superficial life but all within her was cold dead inert skrebensky appeared at breakfast he was white and obliterated they did not look at each other nor speak to each other apart from the ordinary trivial talk of civil people they were separate they did not speak of what was between them during the remaining two days of their stay they were like two dead people who dare not recognize dare not see each other  then she packed her bag and put on her things there were several guests leaving together for the same train he would have no opportunity to speak to her  he tapped at her bedroom door at the last minute she stood with her umbrella in her hand he closed the door he did not know what to say  have you done with me he asked her at length lifting his head  it isnt me she said you have done with mewe have done with each other  he looked at her at the closed face which he thought so cruel and he knew he could never touch her again his will was broken he was seared but he clung to the life of his body  well what have i done he asked in a rather querulous voice  i dont know she said in the same dull feelingless voice it is finished it had been a failure  he was silent the words still burned his bowels  is it my fault he said looking up at length challenging the last stroke  you couldnt she began but she broke down  he turned away afraid to hear more she began to gather her bag her handkerchief her umbrella she must be gone now he was waiting for her to be gone  at length the carriage came and she drove away with the rest when she was out of sight a great relief came over him a pleasant banality in an instant everything was obliterated he was childishly amiable and companionable all the day long he was astonished that life could be so nice it was better than it had been before what a simple thing it was to be rid of her how friendly and simple everything felt to him what false thing had she been forcing on him  but at night he dared not be alone his roommate had gone and the hours of darkness were an agony to him he watched the window in suffering and terror when would this horrible darkness be lifted off him setting all his nerves he endured it he went to sleep with the dawn  he never thought of her only his terror of the hours of night grew on him obsessed him like a mania he slept fitfully with constant wakings of anguish the fear wore away the core of him  his plan was to sit up very late drink in company until one or halfpast one in the morning then he would get three hours of sleep of oblivion it was light by five oclock but he was shocked almost to madness if he opened his eyes on the darkness  in the daytime he was all right always occupied with the thing of the moment adhering to the trivial present which seemed to him ample and satisfying no matter how little and futile his occupations were he gave himself to them entirely and felt normal and fulfilled he was always active cheerful gay charming trivial only he dreaded the darkness and silence of his own bedroom when the darkness should challenge him upon his own soul that he could not bear as he could not bear to think about ursula he had no soul no background he never thought of ursula not once he gave her no sign she was the darkness the challenge the horror he turned to immediate things he wanted to marry quickly to screen himself from the darkness the challenge of his own soul he would marry his colonels daughter quickly without hesitation pursued by his obsession for activity he wrote to this girl telling her his engagement was brokenit had been a temporary infatuation which he less than any one else could understand now it was overand could he see his very dear friend soon he would not be happy till he had an answer  he received a rather surprised reply from the girl but she would be glad to see him she was living with her aunt he went down to her at once and proposed to her the first evening he was accepted the marriage took place quietly within fourteen days time ursula was not notified of the event in another week skrebensky sailed with his new wife to india    chapter xvi  the rainbow  ursula went home to beldover faint dim closed up she could scarcely speak or notice it was as if her energy were frozen her people asked her what was the matter she told them she had broken off the engagement with skrebensky they looked blank and angry but she could not feel any more  the weeks crawled by in apathy he would have sailed for india now she was scarcely interested she was inert without strength or interest  suddenly a shock ran through her so violent that she thought she was struck down was she with child she had been so stricken under the pain of herself and of him this had never occurred to her now like a flame it took hold of her limbs and body was she with child  in the first flaming hours of wonder she did not know what she felt she was as if tied to the stake the flames were licking her and devouring her but the flames were also good they seemed to wear her away to rest what she felt in her heart and her womb she did not know it was a kind of swoon  then gradually the heaviness of her heart pressed and pressed into consciousness what was she doing was she bearing a child bearing a child to what  her flesh thrilled but her soul was sick it seemed this child like the seal set on her own nullity yet she was glad in her flesh that she was with child she began to think that she would write to skrebensky that she would go out to him and marry him and live simply as a good wife to him what did the self the form of life matter only the living from day to day mattered the beloved existence in the body rich peaceful complete with no beyond no further trouble no further complication she had been wrong she had been arrogant and wicked wanting that other thing that fantastic freedom that illusory conceited fulfilment which she had imagined she could not have with skrebensky who was she to be wanting some fantastic fulfilment in her life was it not enough that she had her man her children her place of shelter under the sun was it not enough for her as it had been enough for her mother she would marry and love her husband and fill her place simply that was the ideal  suddenly she saw her mother in a just and true light her mother was simple and radically true she had taken the life that was given she had not in her arrogant conceit insisted on creating life to fit herself her mother was right profoundly right and she herself had been false trashy conceited  a great mood of humility came over her and in this humility a bondaged sort of peace she gave her limbs to the bondage she loved the bondage she called it peace in this state she sat down to write to skrebensky  since you left me i have suffered a great deal and so have come to myself i cannot tell you the remorse i feel for my wicked perverse behaviour it was given to me to love you and to know your love for me but instead of thankfully on my knees taking what god had given me i must have the moon in my keeping i must insist on having the moon for my own because i could not have it everything else must go  i do not know if you can ever forgive me i could die with shame to think of my behaviour with you during our last times and i dont know if i could ever bear to look you in the face again truly the best thing would be for me to die and cover my fantasies for ever but i find i am with child so that cannot be  it is your child and for that reason i must revere it and submit my body entirely to its welfare entertaining no thought of death which once more is largely conceit therefore because you once loved me and because this child is your child i ask you to have me back if you will cable me one word i will come to you as soon as i can i swear to you to be a dutiful wife and to serve you in all things for now i only hate myself and my own conceited foolishness i love youi love the thought of youyou were natural and decent all through whilst i was so false once i am with you again i shall ask no more than to rest in your shelter all my life  this letter she wrote sentence by sentence as if from her deepest sincerest heart she felt that now now she was at the depths of herself this was her true self forever with this document she would appear before god at the judgment day  for what had a woman but to submit what was her flesh but for childbearing her strength for her children and her husband the giver of life at last she was a woman  she posted her letter to his club to be forwarded to him in calcutta he would receive it soon after his arrival in indiawithin three weeks of his arrival there in a months time she would receive word from him then she would go  she was quite sure of him she thought only of preparing her garments and of living quietly peacefully till the time when she should join him again and her history would be concluded for ever the peace held like an unnatural calm for a long time she was aware however of a gathering restiveness a tumult impending within her she tried to run away from it she wished she could hear from skrebensky in answer to her letter so that her course should be resolved she should be engaged in fulfilling her fate it was this inactivity which made her liable to the revulsion she dreaded  it was curious how little she cared about his not having written to her before it was enough that she had sent her letter she would get the required answer that was all  one afternoon in early october feeling the seething rising to madness within her she slipped out in the rain to walk abroad lest the house should suffocate her everywhere was drenched wet and deserted the grimed houses glowed dull red the butt houses burned scarlet in a gleam of light under the glistening blackish purple slates ursula went on towards willey green she lifted her face and walked swiftly seeing the passage of light across the shallow valley seeing the colliery and its clouds of steam for a moment visionary in dim brilliance away in the chaos of rain then the veils closed again she was glad of the rains privacy and intimacy  making on towards the wood she saw the pale gleam of willey water through the cloud below she walked the open space where hawthorn trees streamed like hair on the wind and round bushes were presences slowing through the atmosphere it was very splendid free and chaotic  yet she hurried to the wood for shelter there the vast booming overhead vibrated down and encircled her treetrunks spanned the circle of tremendous sound myriads of treetrunks enormous and streaked black with water thrust like stanchions upright between the roaring overhead and the sweeping of the circle underfoot she glided between the treetrunks afraid of them they might turn and shut her in as she went through their martialled silence  so she flitted along keeping an illusion that she was unnoticed she felt like a bird that has flown in through the window of a hall where vast warriors sit at the board between their grave booming ranks she was hastening assuming she was unnoticed till she emerged with beating heart through the far window and out into the open upon the vivid green marshy meadow  she turned under the shelter of the common seeing the great veils of rain swinging with slow floating waves across the landscape she was very wet and a long way from home far enveloped in the rain and the waving landscape she must beat her way back through all this fluctuation back to stability and security  a solitary thing she took the track straight across the wilderness going back the path was a narrow groove in the turf between high sere tussocky grass it was scarcely more than a rabbit run so she moved swiftly along watching her footing going like a bird on the wind with no thought contained in motion but her heart had a small living seed of fear as she went through the wash of hollow space  suddenly she knew there was something else some horses were looming in the rain not near yet but they were going to be near she continued her path inevitably they were horses in the lee of a clump of trees beyond above her she pursued her way with bent head she did not want to lift her face to them she did not want to know they were there she went on in the wild track  she knew the heaviness on her heart it was the weight of the horses but she would circumvent them she would bear the weight steadily and so escape she would go straight on and on and be gone by  suddenly the weight deepened and her heart grew tense to bear it her breathing was laboured but this weight also she could bear she knew without looking that the horses were moving nearer what were they she felt the thud of their heavy hoofs on the ground what was it that was drawing near her what weight oppressing her heart she did not know she did not look  yet now her way was cut off they were blocking her back she knew they had gathered on a log bridge over the sedgy dike a dark heavy powerfully heavy knot yet her feet went on and on they would burst before her they would burst before her her feet went on and on and tense and more tense became her nerves and her veins they ran hot they ran white hot they must fuse and she must die  but the horses had burst before her in a sort of lightning of knowledge their movement travelled through her the quiver and strain and thrust of their powerful flanks as they burst before her and drew on beyond  she knew they had not gone she knew they awaited her still but she went on over the log bridge that their hoofs had churned and drummed she went on knowing things about them she was aware of their breasts gripped clenched narrow in a hold that never relaxed she was aware of their red nostrils flaming with long endurance and of their haunches so rounded so massive pressing pressing pressing to burst the grip upon their breasts pressing for ever till they went mad running against the walls of time and never bursting free their great haunches were smoothed and darkened with rain but the darkness and wetness of rain could not put out the hard urgent massive fire that was locked within these flanks never never  she went on drawing near she was aware of the great flash of hoofs a bluish iridescent flash surrounding a hollow of darkness large large seemed the bluish incandescent flash of the hoofiron large as a halo of lightning round the knotted darkness of the flanks like circles of lightning came the flash of hoofs from out of the powerful flanks  they were awaiting her again they had gathered under an oak tree knotting their awful blind triumphing flanks together and waiting waiting they were waiting for her approach as if from a far distance she was drawing near towards the line of twiggy oak trees where they made their intense darkness gathered on a single bank  she must draw near but they broke away they cantered round making a wide circle to avoid noticing her and cantered back into the open hillside behind her  they were behind her the way was open before her to the gate in the high hedge in the near distance so she could pass into the smaller cultivated field and so out to the highroad and the ordered world of man her way was clear she lulled her heart yet her heart was couched with fear couched with fear all along  suddenly she hesitated as if seized by lightning she seemed to fall yet found herself faltering forward with small steps the thunder of horses galloping down the path behind her shook her the weight came down upon her down to the moment of extinction she could not look round so the horses thundered upon her  cruelly they swerved and crashed by on her left hand she saw the fierce flanks crinkled and as yet inadequate the great hoofs flashing bright as yet only brandished about her and one by one the horses crashed by intent working themselves up  they had gone by brandishing themselves thunderously about her enclosing her they slackened their burst transport they slowed down and cantered together into a knot once more in the corner by the gate and the trees ahead of her they stirred they moved uneasily they settled their uneasy flanks into one group one purpose they were up against her  her heart was gone she had no more heart she knew she dare not draw near that concentrated knitted flank of the horsegroup had conquered it stirred uneasily awaiting her knowing its triumph it stirred uneasily with the uneasiness of awaited triumph her heart was gone her limbs were dissolved she was dissolved like water all the hardness and looming power was in the massive body of the horsegroup  her feet faltered she came to a standstill it was the crisis the horses stirred their flanks uneasily she looked away failing on her left two hundred yards down the slope the thick hedge ran parallel at one point there was an oak tree she might climb into the boughs of that oak tree and so round and drop on the other side of the hedge  shuddering with limbs like water dreading every moment to fall she began to work her way as if making a wide detour round the horsemass the horses stirred their flanks in a knot against her she trembled forward as if in a trance  then suddenly in a flame of agony she darted seized the rugged knots of the oak tree and began to climb her body was weak but her hands were as hard as steel she knew she was strong she struggled in a great effort till she hung on the bough she knew the horses were aware she gained her foothold on the bough the horses were loosening their knot stirring trying to realize she was working her way round to the other side of the tree as they started to canter towards her she fell in a heap on the other side of the hedge  for some moments she could not move then she saw through the rabbitcleared bottom of the hedge the great working hoofs of the horses as they cantered near she could not bear it she rose and walked swiftly diagonally across the field the horses galloped along the other side of the hedge to the corner where they were held up she could feel them there in their huddled group all the while she hastened across the bare field they were almost pathetic now her will alone carried her till trembling she climbed the fence under a leaning thorn tree that overhung the grass by the highroad the use went from her she sat on the fence leaning back against the trunk of the thorn tree motionless  as she sat there spent time and the flux of change passed away from her she lay as if unconscious upon the bed of the stream like a stone unconscious unchanging unchangeable whilst everything rolled by in transience leaving her there a stone at rest on the bed of the stream inalterable and passive sunk to the bottom of all change  she lay still a long time with her back against the thorn tree trunk in her final isolation some colliers passed tramping heavily up the wet road their voices sounding out their shoulders up to their ears their figures blotched and spectral in the rain some did not see her she opened her eyes languidly as they passed by then one man going alone saw her the whites of his eyes showed in his black face as he looked in wonderment at her he hesitated in his walk as if to speak to her out of frightened concern for her how she dreaded his speaking to her dreaded his questioning her  she slipped from her seat and went vaguely along the pathvaguely it was a long way home she had an idea that she must walk for the rest of her life wearily wearily step after step step after step and always along the wet rainy road between the hedges step after step step after step the monotony produced a deep cold sense of nausea in her how profound was her cold nausea how profound that too plumbed the bottom she seemed destined to find the bottom of all things today the bottom of all things well at any rate she was walking along the bottommost bedshe was quite safe quite safe if she had to go on and on for ever seeing this was the very bottom and there was nothing deeper there was nothing deeper you see so one could not but feel certain passive  she arrived home at last the climb up the hill to beldover had been very trying why must one climb the hill why must one climb why not stay below why force ones way up the slope why force ones way up and up when one is at the bottom oh it was very trying very wearying very burdensome always burdens always always burdens still she must get to the top and go home to bed she must go to bed  she got in and went upstairs in the dusk without its being noticed she was in such a sodden condition she was too tired to go downstairs again she got into bed and lay shuddering with cold yet too apathetic to get up or call for relief then gradually she became more ill  she was very ill for a fortnight delirious shaken and racked but always amid the ache of delirium she had a dull firmness of being a sense of permanency she was in some way like the stone at the bottom of the river inviolable and unalterable no matter what storm raged in her body her soul lay still and permanent full of pain but itself for ever under all her illness persisted a deep inalterable knowledge  she knew and she cared no more throughout her illness distorted into vague forms persisted the question of herself and skrebensky like a gnawing ache that was still superficial and did not touch her isolated impregnable core of reality but the corrosion of him burned in her till it burned itself out  must she belong to him must she adhere to him something compelled her and yet it was not real always the ache the ache of unreality of her belonging to skrebensky what bound her to him when she was not bound to him why did the falsity persist why did the falsity gnaw gnaw gnaw at her why could she not wake up to clarity to reality if she could but wake up if she could but wake up the falsity of the dream of her connection with skrebensky would be gone but the sleep the delirium pinned her down even when she was calm and sober she was in its spell  yet she was never in its spell what extraneous thing bound her to him there was some bond put upon her why could she not break it through what was it what was it  in her delirium she beat and beat at the question and at last her weariness gave her the answerit was the child the child bound her to him the child was like a bond round her brain tightened on her brain it bound her to skrebensky  but why why did it bind her to skrebensky could she not have a child of herself was not the child her own affair all her own affair what had it to do with him why must she be bound aching and cramped with the bondage to skrebensky and skrebenskys world antons world it became in her feverish brain a compression which enclosed her if she could not get out of the compression she would go mad the compression was anton and antons world not the anton she possessed but the anton she did not possess that which was owned by some other influence by the world  she fought and fought and fought all through her illness to be free of him and his world to put it aside to put it aside into its place yet ever anew it gained ascendency over her it laid new hold on her oh the unutterable weariness of her flesh which she could not cast off nor yet extricate if she could but extricate herself if she could but disengage herself from feeling from her body from all the vast encumbrances of the world that was in contact with her from her father and her mother and her lover and all her acquaintance  repeatedly in an ache of utter weariness she repeated i have no father nor mother nor lover i have no allocated place in the world of things i do not belong to beldover nor to nottingham nor to england nor to this world they none of them exist i am trammelled and entangled in them but they are all unreal i must break out of it like a nut from its shell which is an unreality  and again to her feverish brain came the vivid reality of acorns in february lying on the floor of a wood with their shells burst and discarded and the kernel issued naked to put itself forth she was the naked clear kernel thrusting forth the clear powerful shoot and the world was a bygone winter discarded her mother and father and anton and college and all her friends all cast off like a year that has gone by whilst the kernel was free and naked and striving to take new root to create a new knowledge of eternity in the flux of time and the kernel was the only reality the rest was cast off into oblivion  this grew and grew upon her when she opened her eyes in the afternoon and saw the window of her room and the faint smoky landscape beyond this was all husk and shell lying by all husk and shell she could see nothing else she was enclosed still but loosely enclosed there was a space between her and the shell it was burst there was a rift in it soon she would have her root fixed in a new day her nakedness would take itself the bed of a new sky and a new air this old decaying fibrous husk would be gone  gradually she began really to sleep she slept in the confidence of her new reality she slept breathing with her soul the new air of a new world the peace was very deep and enrichening she had her root in new ground she was gradually absorbed into growth  when she woke at last it seemed as if a new day had come on the earth how long how long had she fought through the dust and obscurity for this new dawn how frail and fine and clear she felt like the most fragile flower that opens in the end of winter but the pole of night was turned and the dawn was coming in  very far off was her old experienceskrebensky her parting with himvery far off some things were real those first glamorous weeks before these had seemed like hallucination now they seemed like common reality the rest was unreal she knew that skrebensky had never become finally real in the weeks of passionate ecstasy he had been with her in her desire she had created him for the time being but in the end he had failed and broken down  strange what a void separated him and her she liked him now as she liked a memory some bygone self he was something of the past finite he was that which is known she felt a poignant affection for him as for that which is past but when she looked with her face forward he was not nay when she looked ahead into the undiscovered land before her what was there she could recognize but a fresh glow of light and inscrutable trees going up from the earth like smoke it was the unknown the unexplored the undiscovered upon whose shore she had landed alone after crossing the void the darkness which washed the new world and the old  there would be no child she was glad if there had been a child it would have made little difference however she would have kept the child and herself she would not have gone to skrebensky anton belonged to the past  there came the cablegram from skrebensky i am married an old pain and anger and contempt stirred in her did he belong so utterly to the castoff past she repudiated him he was as he was it was good that he was as he was who was she to have a man according to her own desire it was not for her to create but to recognize a man created by god the man should come from the infinite and she should hail him she was glad she could not create her man she was glad she had nothing to do with his creation she was glad that this lay within the scope of that vaster power in which she rested at last the man would come out of eternity to which she herself belonged  as she grew better she sat to watch a new creation as she sat at her window she saw the people go by in the street below colliers women children walking each in the husk of an old fruition but visible through the husk the swelling and the heaving contour of the new germination in the still silenced forms of the colliers she saw a sort of suspense a waiting in pain for the new liberation she saw the same in the false hard confidence of the women the confidence of the women was brittle it would break quickly to reveal the strength and patient effort of the new germination  in everything she saw she grasped and groped to find the creation of the living god instead of the old hard barren form of bygone living sometimes great terror possessed her sometimes she lost touch she lost her feeling she could only know the old horror of the husk which bound in her and all mankind they were all in prison they were all going mad  she saw the stiffened bodies of the colliers which seemed already enclosed in a coffin she saw their unchanging eyes the eyes of those who are buried alive she saw the hard cutting edges of the new houses which seemed to spread over the hillside in their insentient triumph the triumph of horrible amorphous angles and straight lines the expression of corruption triumphant and unopposed corruption so pure that it is hard and brittle she saw the dun atmosphere over the blackened hills opposite the dark blotches of houses slate roofed and amorphous the old churchtower standing up in hideous obsoleteness above raw new houses on the crest of the hill the amorphous brittle hard edged

earth she knew that the sordid people who crept hardscaled and separate on the face of the worlds corruption were living still that the rainbow was arched in their blood and would quiver to life in their spirit that they would cast off their horny covering of disintegration that new clean naked bodies would issue to a new germination to a new growth rising to the light and the wind and the clean rain of heaven she saw in the rainbow the earths new architecture the old brittle corruption of houses and factories swept away the world built up in a living fabric of truth fitting to the overarching heaven     the end
