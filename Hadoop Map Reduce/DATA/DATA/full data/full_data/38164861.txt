forester     valley of wild horses   chapter one  the panhandle was a lonely purple range land unfenced and wind swept bill smith cattleman threw up a cabin and looked at the future with hopeful eyes  one day while plowing almost out of sight of his little homewhich that morning he had left apprehensively owing to an impending eventhe espied his wife margaret coming along the edge of the plowed field  she had brought his lunch this day despite his order to the contrary  bill dropped the loop of his driving reins over the plow handle and strode toward her  presently she halted wearily and sat down where the dark rich overturned earth met the line of bleached grass  bill meant to scold margaret for bringing his lunch but it developed she had brought him something more  a son  this boy was born on the fragrant fresh soil out on the open prairie under the steely sun and the cool wind from off the llano estacado  he came into the world protesting against this primitive manner of his birth  bill often related that the youngster arrived squalling and showed that his lung capacity fitted his unusual size  despite the mothers protestations bill insisted on calling the lad panhandle  panhandles first memory was of climbing into the big cupboard in the cabin falling out upon his head and getting blood all over his white dress  his next adventurous experience was that of chewing tobacco he found in his fathers coat  this made him very sick  his mother thought he was poisoned and as bill was away she ran to the nearest neighbors for help  by the time she returned with the experienced neighbor woman panhandle had gotten rid of the tobacco and was bent upon further conquest  another day panhandle manifested a growing tendency toward selfassertion  he ran away from home  owing to his short legs and scant breath he did not get very far down over the slope  his will and intention were tremendous  did the dim desert call to the child  his parents had often seen him stand gazing into the purple distance  but panhandle on this runaway occasion fell asleep on the dry grassy bottom of an irrigation ditch  bye and bye he was missed and father and mother and the farm hands ran hither and thither in wild search for him  no one however found him  in the haste of the search some one left his work at the irrigation dam and the water running down rudely awoke the child out of his dreams  wet and bedraggled squalling at the top of his lungs panhandle trudged back home to the relief of a distracted mother  doggone it ejaculated bill to his neighbors  that kids goin to be just like me  i never could stay home  a year later bill smith sold his farm and moved farther west in texas where he took up a homestead and divided his time between that and work on a big irrigating canal which was being constructed  panhandle now lived on a ranch and it was far lonelier than his first home because his father was away so much of the time  at first the nearest neighbor was panhandles uncle who lived two long prairie miles away  his house was a black dot on the horizon not unattainable it seemed to panhandle but very far away  he would have risked the distance save for his mother who was very timid in this country so new to her  panhandle would never forget how she was frightened at a crazy wanderer who happened to come along and another time by some drunken mexican laborers  panhandle undoubtedly had an adventuring soul  one day he discovered that a skunk had dug a hole under the front porch and had given birth to her kittens there  panhandle was not afraid of them and neither hurt nor frightened them  after a time he made playmates of them and was one day hugely enjoying himself with them when his mother found him  she was frightened enraged and horrified all at once  she entreated panhandle to let the dirty little skunks alone  panhandle would promise and then forget  his mother punished him all to no avail  then she adopted harsher measures  homesteaders had located near by and mrs smith called on them in the hope that she could hire a cowboy or ranch hand to come over and destroy the skunks  it chanced there was no one but a mrs hardman and her only boy  his name was dick  he was seven years old large for his age a bold handsome lad with red hair  mrs smith made a bargain with dick and led him back with her  here panhandle took violent exception to having his pets killed or routed out by this boy he had never before seen  he did not like his looks anyway  but dick paid little heed to panhandle except once when mrs smith went into the house and then he knocked panhandle down for once panhandle did not squall  he got up round eyed pale with his hands clenched  he never said a word  something was born in the depths of his gentle soul then  dick tore a hole in the little wall of rocks that supported the porch and with a lighted torch on a stick he wormed his way in to rout out the skunks  panhandle suddenly was thrilled and frightened by a bellowing from dick  the boy came hurriedly backing out of the hole  he fetched an odor with him that nearly suffocated panhandle so strange and raw and terrible was it  dicks eyes were shut  for the time being he had been blinded  he bounced around like a chicken with its head cut off bawling wildly  what had happened panhandle did not know but it certainly suited him goody  goody he shouted holding his nose and edging away from the lad  then panhandle saw smoke issuing from the hole under the porch  the mother skunk and her kittens scampered out into the weeds  he heard the crackle of flames  that boy had dropped his torch under the porch screaming panhandle ran to alarm his mother  but it was too late there were no men near at hand so nothing could be done  panhandle stood crying beside his mother watching their little home burn to the ground  somehow in his mind the boy dick had been to blame panhandle peered round to find him but he was gone  never would panhandle forget that boy  they walked to the uncles house and spent the night there  soon another home was under construction on the same site  it was more of a shack than a house for building materials were scarce and the near approach of winter made hasty construction imperative  winter came soon and panhandle and his mother were alone  it was cold and they huddled over the little wood fire  they had plenty to eat but were very uncomfortable in the oneroom shack  bill smith came home but seldom  that fall the valley had been overrun with homesteaders nesters they were called and these newcomers passed by often from the town drunk and rough  panhandle used to lie awake a good deal  during these lonely hours the moan of the prairie wind the mourn of wolves and yelp of coyotes became part of his existence  he understood why his mother barred and blocked the one door placed the ax by the bed and the gun under her pillow  even then he longed for the time when he would be old and big enough to protect her  the lonely winter with its innumerable hours of solitude for mrs smith and the boy had incalculable influence upon his character  she taught him much ways and things words and feelings that became an integral part of his life  at last the long winter ended  with spring came the gales of wind which though no longer cold were terrible in their violence  many a night panhandle lay awake shrinking beside his mother fearing the shack would blow away over their heads  many a day the sun was obscured and nothing could be cooked no work done while the dust storm raged  as spring advanced with a lessening of the tornadoes a new and fascinating game came into panhandles life  it was to sit at the one little window and watch the cowboys ride by  how he came to worship them  they were on their way to the spring roundups  his father had told him all about them  panhandle would strain his eyes to get a first glimpse of them to count the shaggy prancing horses the lithe supple riders with their great sombreros their bright scarfs guns and chaps and boots and spurs  their lassos  how they fascinated panhandle  ropes to whirl and throw at a running steer  that was a game he resolved to play when he grew up  and his mother discovering his interest made him a little reata and taught him how to throw it how to make loops and knots  she told him how her people had owned horses thrown lassos run cattle  panhandle was always watching for the cowboys  when they passed by he would run to the other side of the shack where there was a knothole stuffed with a rag and through this he would peep until he was blinded by dust  these were full days for the lad rousing in him wonder and awe eagerness and fearstrange longings for he knew not what  then one day his father brought home a black pony with three white feet and a white spot on his face  panhandle was in rapture  for him  he could have burst for very joy but he could not speak  it developed that his mother would not let him ride the pony except when she led it this roused as great a grief as possession was joy  a beautiful little pony he could not ride  ideas formed in his mind scintillated and grew into dark purpose  one day he stole curly and led him out of sight behind the barn and mounting him rode down to the spring  panhandle found himself alone he was free  he was on the back of a horse  mighty and incalculable fact  curly felt the spirit of that occasion  after drinking at the spring he broke into a lope  panhandle stuck on somehow and turned the pony toward the house  curly loped faster  panhandle felt the wind in his hair  he bounced up and down  squealing with delight he twisted his hands in the flowing mane and held on  at the top of the hill his joy became divided by fear  curly kept on loping down the hill toward the house  faster and faster  panhandle bounced higher and higher up on his neck back on his haunches until suddenly his hold broke and he was thrown  down he went with a thud  it jarred him so he could hardly get up and he reeled dizzily  there stood his mother white of face reproachful of eye  oh mamai aint hurt he cried  bill smith was approached about this and listened stroking his lean chin while the mother eloquently enlarged upon the lads guilt  wal wife let the boy ride he replied  hes a nervy kid  i named him well  hell make a great cowboy  panhandle smith  pan for short  pan heard that and his heart beat high  how he loved his dad then cowboy meant one of the great riders of the range  he would be one thereafter he lived on the back of curly  he learned to ride to stick on like a burr to keep his seat on the bare back of the pony to move with him as he moved  one day pan was riding home from his uncles and coming to a level stretch of ground he urged curly to his topmost speed  the wind stung him the motion exhilarated him controlling the pony awoke and fixed some strange feeling in him  he was a cowboy suddenly curly put a speeding foot into a prairiedog hole  something happened  pan felt himself jerked loose and shot through the air  he struck the ground and all went black  when he came to he found he had plowed the soft earth with his face skinned nose and chin but was not badly hurt  that was his first great spill  it sobered him  curly waited for him a little way farther on and he was lame  pan knew he could not hide the evidences of his rashness so he decided to tell the truth  pan encountered his father at the barn  say you bloody cowpuncher demanded his parent did he pitch with you  no dad replied pan with effort  i runned him fast  ahhuh so i see went on the father and after a searching look over the boy he fell to examining the pony  pan emboldened by what his father had called him went straight to his mother  she screamed at sight of him and that struck pan to the heart  aw mama it aint nuthin  im just a bloody cowpuncher  pan was not quite six years old when he rode to his first roundup which occurred that summer early in june  his glory in the experience was marred by shame because he had to appear before all these cowboys without a saddle on his horse  he had feared just exactly what happened  wal heah comes the ridin kid from loco range said one edging near to pan with a smile on his shining red face  sonny yore forkin a grand hoss but you forgot to saddle him remarked another with a twinkle of gray eyes  fellars this heah is panhandle smith kid of the homesteader over by the river  i heerd pans a trick bareback rider  these genial fiery young men lithe and tall and round limbed breathing the life and spirit of the range crowded round pan proving that there never was a cowboy who did not like youngsters  say kid ill swap saddles with you spoke up the one who had first addressed him  pans heart was palpitating  how could they know how beautiful and wonderful they looked to him  if it had not been that he was riding curly bareback  they were making fun of him  tears were not far from his eyes  young fellar ill bet this nag of yourn cant run fast enough to ketch cold spoke up another  ill bet he kin added a third  pan do this to them put in the cowboy who appeared to know him and suiting act to word he placed his thumb to his nose and twiddled his finger  do that pan  thatll shore shut them up  pan found himself impelled to do as he was bidden which action raised a howl of mirth from the cowboys  and so at that early age panhandle smith was initiated into the hilarity and trickery and spirit common to these carefree riders of the ranges  when the roundup began he found that he was far from forgotten  come on pan shouted one  ride in heah an help me  turn em back kid  pan rode like the wind breathless and radiant beside himself with bliss  then another rider would yell to him charge him cowboy  fetch him back  and pan scarcely knowing what he was doing saw with wild eyes how the yearling or calf would seem to be driven by him  there was always a cowboy near him riding fast yet close yelling to him making him a part of the roundup  at the noon hour an older man no doubt the rancher who owned the cattle called off the work  a lusty voice from somewhere yelled come an git it  the rancher espying pan rode over to him and said stranger did you fetch your chuck with you  nosir faltered pan  my mamasaid for me to hurry back  wal you stay an eat with me replied the man kindly  shore them varmints might stampede an wed need you powerful bad  pan sat next this big blackeyed man in the circle of hungry cowboys they made no more fun of pan  he was one of them  hard indeed was it for him to sit crosslegged after the fashion of cowboys with a steady plate upon his knees  but he had no trouble disposing of the juicy beefsteak and boiled potatoes and beans and hot biscuits that tex the boss piled upon his plate  after dinner the cowboys resumed work  stand heah by the fire kid said tex  then pan saw a calf being dragged across the ground  a mounted cowboy held the rope  the brand he yelled  pan stood there trembling while one of the flankers went down the tight rope to catch the bawling leaping calf  its eyes stood out it foamed at the mouth  the flanker threw it over his leg on its back with feet sticking up  a brander with white iron leaped close  the calf bellowed  there was a sizzling of hair a white smoke the odor of burned hide all of which sickened pan  then one of the cowboys came to him reckon thets yore mammy come for you  he lifted pan up on curly and led the pony away from the roundup out in the open where pan espied his mother eager and anxious with her big dark eyes strained  beg pardon lady spoke up the cowboy touching his sombrero  its our fault yore boy stayed so long  were sorry if you worried  please dont blame him  hes shore a game kid an will make a grand cowboy some day     chapter two  so this was how panhandle smith at the mature age of five received the stimulus that set the current of his life in one strong channel he called himself tex  if his mother forgot to use this thrilling name he was offended  he adopted texs way of walking riding talking  and all the hours of daylight outdoors or indoors he played roundup  stones chips nailsanything served for cattleand he had a special wooden image of himself and horse  much of this time he spent on the back of curly in the corral or the field rounding up an imaginary herd  at night his dreams were full of cowboys chuck wagons pitching horses and bawling steers  every new sight of a snaky slim cowpuncher on a racy horse intensified this impression in pans mind stamped the future more vividly on his heart  it was what he had been born to  one by one pioneers came in their covered wagons to this promising range and took up homesteads of one hundred and sixty acres each  some of these men like pans father had to work part of the time away from home to earn muchneeded money  jim blake the latest of these incoming settlers had chosen a site down in a deep swale that pan always crossed when he went to visit his uncle  it was a pretty place with grass and cottonwoods and a thin stream of water a lonesome and hidden spot which other homesteaders had passed by  pan met jim one day and rode with him  he was a young man pleasant and jolly a farmer and wouldbe rancher without any of the signs of cowboy about him  pan thought this a great detriment but he managed to like jim and loftily acquainted him with his achievements on curly  one day pan saw jims wife a pretty blonde girl strong and healthy and rosy cheeked  her sleeves were rolled up showing round bare arms her smile won pan yet he was too shy to go in and take the cookies she offered  autumn days came dull and gray with cold wind sweeping the plain and threatening clouds lodging against the mountain peaks  another winter was coming  pan hated the thought  snow ice piercing winds would prevent him from riding curly  with this fact pressing closer he rode as much as his mother would let him and some more besides  his father and mother wanted him to go with them to the settlement one saturday  they were taking the wagon in for winter supplies  pans yearning for adventure almost persuaded him but he preferred to stay with curly  his mother demurred but his father said he might remain at home  pan you can ride over to uncle georges with some things  but be careful not to get caught in a storm  thus it came about that pan found himself alone for the first time in his life master of himself free to act as he chose  and he did not choose to go at once to uncle georges  his uncle was nice but did not accord pan the freedom that he craved  so what with one and another of his important cowboy tasks the hours flew and it was late before he got started across the prairie toward his uncles homestead  pan never needed an excuse to ride fast but now he had one that justified him  the two miles would not take long  he would have to hurry back for indeed it looked as if a storm were sweeping down from the black peaks  pan realized that he should have gotten his errand done earlier in the day  the cold wind stung his face and made his eyes water  curly loped at his easy swift stride over the welltrodden trail  the bleached grass waved the tumbleweeds rolled along the brown ground  there was no sun  all the west was draped in drab clouds  soon pan was riding down into the swale where blake lived  the cottonwoods were almost bare only a few yellow leaves clung to the branches and every moment a leaf fluttered down  here in this swale pan caught the autumn smells dank and woody  once across the swale he put his pony to a gallop and soon reached uncle georges homestead  no one at home  the horse and wagon were gone  pan left his package and turned back  as he trotted past the blake gate pan heard a faint call  it startled him  reining in curly he listened and looked  blakes cabin stood back out of sight among the cottonwoods  the barn however with its low opensided shed stood just inside the gate  the cows had been brought in for milking a lusty calf was trying to steal milk from its mother  chickens were going to roost  pan did not believe that any of these had made the call  he was about to ride on by when suddenly he again caught a strange cry that appeared to come from the barn or shed  it excited rather than frightened him  sliding off curly he pushed open the big board gate and ran in  under the open shed he found mrs blake lying on some hay which evidently she had just pulled down from the loft  when she saw pan her pale convulsed face changed somehow  ohthank god she cried  are you hurted asked pan in hurried sympathy  did you fall out of the haymow  no but im in terrible pain  awyoure sick  yes  and im alone  will you pleasego for your mother  mama an daddy went to town replied pan in distress  an nobodys home at uncle georges  then you must be a brave little man and help me  bill smith hurrying homeward with his wife and jim blake were belated by the storm  it was midnight when they arrived at bills house  they found curly with bridle hanging standing in the snow beside the barn mrs smith was distracted  bill and jim though worried did not fear the worst  but with lanterns they set out upon the tracks curly had left in the snow  bills wife would not remain behind  soon they arrived at blakes homestead though the pony tracks became difficult to follow and found pan wide awake huddled beside the cow true to the trust that had been given him  mrs blake was not in bad condition considering the circumstances nor was the baby  it was a girl whom jim named lucy right then and there after his wife  the men carried the mother and her babe up to the house while mrs smith followed with the now sleepy pan  they built fires in the open grate and in the kitchen stove and left mrs smith to attend to the mother  both women heard the men talking  but pan never heard for he had been put to bed in a corner rolled in blankets  doggone my hide exclaimed bill  never seen the beat of that kid of mine  mebbe pan saved both their lives god bless him replied blake with emotion  quien sabe  it might be  wal strange things happen  jim that kid of mine was born right out on the plowed field  an here comes your kidborn in the cowshed on the hay  it is strange mused blake though we ought to look for such happenins out in this great west  wal pan an lucy couldnt have a better birthright  it ought to settle them two kids for life  you mean grow up an marry some day  now that would be fine  shake on it bill  pan asleep in the corner of the other room and lucy wailing at her mothers breast were pledged to each other by their fathers  the winter passed for pan much as had the preceding one except that he had more comfort to play his everlasting game of roundup  when will lucy be big enough to play with me he often asked  the strange little baby girl had never passed from his mind though he had never seen her  she seemed to form the third link in his memory of the forging of his life  curlythe cowboysand lucy  he did not know how to reconcile her with the other two  but those three events stood out above the blur of the past  at last the snow melted the prairie took on a sheen of green the tree burst into bud and birds returned to sing once more  all of this was beautiful but insignificant beside curly  he was fatter and friskier than ever  pans father came home once or twice a month that spring always arriving late and leaving at an early hour  how pan longed for his fathers coming  then there came the fourth epoch in pans life  his father brought him a saddle  it was far from new of mexican make covered with rawhide and had an enormous shiny horn  pan loved it almost as much as he loved curly and when it was not on the pony it adorned the fence or a chair always with pan astride it acting like tex  the fifth and surely the greatest event in pans rapidly developing career though he did not know it then was when his mother took him over to see his baby lucy blake  it appeared that the parents in both homesteads playfully called her pans baby  that did not displease pan but it made him singularly shy  so it was long before his mother could get him to make the acquaintance of his protégée  pans first sight of lucy was when she crawled over the floor to get to him  how vastly different she really was from the picture he recalled of a moving bundle wrapped in a towel  she was quite big and very wonderful  she was dressed in a little white dress  her feet and legs were chubby  she had tiny pink hands  her face was like a wild rose dotted with two violets for eyes  and her hair was spun gold marvelous as were all these things they were as nothing to the light of her smile  pans shyness vanished and he sat on the floor to play with her  he produced little chips and pebbles and stones with which he played roundup  lucy grew most gratifyingly interested in pans game but she made it hard for him to play it and also embarrassing by clinging with most tenacious and unshakable grip to his finger  every sunday that summer the smiths visited at the homestead of the blakes  they became fast friends  bill and jim discussed the cattle business  the mothers sewed and talked hopefully of the future  pan never missed one of these sunday visits and the time came when he rode over on his own account  lucy was the most satisfactory cowgirl in all the world  she did not object to his being tex  she tried her best to call him tex  and she crawled after him and toddled after him with unfailing worship  the grown folks looked on and smiled  meanwhile the weeks and months passed the number of homesteaders increased more and more cattle dotted the range  when winter came some of the homesteaders including pan and his mother moved into littleton to send their children to school  pans first teacher was emma jones  he liked her immediately which was when she called to take him to school  pan was not used to strangers the men in the streets the grown boys all bothered him  cowboys were scarce and that was a great disappointment to pan  it lowered littleton in his estimation  it developed that pan was left handed  now miss jones considered it wrong for anyone to write with his left hand so she tied pans fast to the desk and made him practice letters with his right  what a dreary unprofitable time pan had of it  so many little boys and girls confused him though he was not backward in making acquaintance  but he wanted curly and the prairie  he would rather be with lucy  most of all he wanted the cowboys  dick hardman came again into pans life fatefully inevitably as if the future had settled something inscrutable and sinister and childhood days school days days of youth and manhood had been inextricably planned before they were born  dick was in a higher grade and made the fact known to pan  he had grown into a large boy handsomer bolder with a mop of red hair that shone like a flame  he called pan the little skunk tamer and incited other boys to ridicule  so the buried resentment in pans depths smoldered and burst into blaze again and found fuel to burn it into hate  he told his mother what dick had got the boys to call him  then he was indeed surprised to see his sweet softeyed mother give way to quickflashing passion  somehow this leap of her temper strengthened pan in his resentment  he had her blood her fire her pride though he was only a child  then the endless school days were over for a while  summer had come pan moved back to the beloved homestead to the open ranges to curly and lucy  only she had changed  she could stand at his knee and call him tex  he resumed his old games with her and in time graduated her to a seat on the back of curly  if she had not already unconsciously filled his heart that picture of her laughing and unafraid would have done so  another uncle had moved into the country to take up a homestead  pan now had a second place to ride to farther away over a wilder bit of range and much to his liking  he saw cowboys every time he rode there  one day while pan was at this new uncles a dreadful thing happenedhis first real tragedy  some cowboy left the slide door of the granary open  curly got in there at the wheat  before it became known he ate enormously and then drank copiously  it foundered him it killed him  when pan came out of his stupefaction to realize his actual loss he was heartbroken  he could not be consoled  hours he spent crying over his saddle  not for a long time did he go to see little lucy  his father could not afford to buy him another horse then and indeed it was a long time before he did get one  days and weeks passed and fall came then winter with more school tedious and wearing and again spring and summer  cowboys were plentiful now in the growing range but pan avoided them ashamed and sick because he could not approach them without curly  he never got over grieving for his pony though he reached a stage where any horse would have freed him from his melancholy  he played alone or with lucy  she was the one bright spot in all that gray prairie  lucy was growing fast now her golden curly head seemed to spring up at him  that autumn the homesteaders erected a schoolhouse of their own  it was scarcely three miles from pans home  pan can you walk it asked bill smith with his keen eye on the lad yes daddybutbut replied pan unable to finish with the thought so dear to his heart  ahhuh  an before long lucy will be old enough to go too added his father  reckon youll take her  yes daddy  and for pan there was real gladness in that promise  wal youre a good boy declared the father  an you wont have to walk to school  ive traded for two horses for you  two screamed pan wild with joy  oh  oh  oh  in due time the new horses arrived at the smith homestead  their names were pelter and pilldarlick  pelter was a pinto snappy and pretty though he had a wicked eye  pilldarlick was not showy but he was small and strong easy gaited and gentle  pan thought he was going to like pelter best although pilldarlick was surely a cowboy name and therefore all satisfying  it turned out however that pan could not ride pelter  he was locoed  he bucked pan off every time pilldarlick was really much better than he looked and soon filled the void in pans heart  the first time he rode pilldarlick to the new school marked another redletter day in the life of panhandle smith cowboy  there were many boys and a few girls who had come to attend the school only a few of whom had horses to ride  pan was the proud cynosure of all eyes as he rode pilldarlick round the yard for the edification of his schoolmates it was the happiest day of pans lifeup until dick hardman arrived on a spirited little black mustang  hey whered you git that nag yelled dick when he sighted pan an say your saddle aint nothin but rawhide on a stump  youre a liar shouted pan fiercely tumbling off pilldarlick  the redheaded lad pitched out of his saddle and made for pan  they began to fight  instinct was pans guide  he hit and scratched and kicked  but dick being the larger began to get the better of the battle and soon was beating pan badly when the new teacher came out to his rescue  stop it she ordered separating the belligerents  only cats and dogs fight  sodocowboys panted pan  not nice ones  only bad cowboys she replied leading pan away  ill lick you next time yelled dick evilly  you stuckup little snot     chapter three  miss amanda hill the teacher rang the bell calling all her scholars in and school began once more  dick hardman sat across the room from pan and behind the teachers back he made ugly faces at pan and more than that put his nose to his thumb  pan understood that and quick as a flash he returned the compliment  recess came  before half the scholars were out of the room dick and pan had run to the barn out of the teachers sight and here they fell upon each other like wildcats  it did not take dick long to give pan the first real beating of his life  cut lip bloody nose black eye dirty face torn blousethese things betrayed pan at least to miss hill  she kept him in after school and instead of scolding she talked sweetly and kindly  pan came out of his sullenness and felt love for her rouse in him  but somehow he could not promise not to fight again  spose dick hardman does that all over again expostulated pan in despair  he did not realize what he felt  he wanted to please and obey this sweet little woman but there was a revolt in him  whatll mymy daddysay when he hears i got licked he sobbed  she compromised finally by accepting pans willing promise not to pick a fight with dick  despite the unpleasant proximity of dick hardman that winter at school promised to be happy and helpful to pan  there were three large boys already cowboys who attended miss hills school  pan gravitated at once to them and to his great satisfaction they accepted him  later his old cowboy friend of the roundup arrived on the range with a trail herd of cattle from texas  their brand was an o x a new one to pan  he kept a record of all the brands he had seen and practiced drawing them on paper  moore and three of his cowboys came to board at pans home and kept their string of horses there  pans cup was full the days flew by  snow and cold were nothing to him  not even study and the evermalicious dick hardman could daunt his spirit  moore meant to winter his herd there and wait for spring before he drove it farther north  the cowboys nickname for moore was pug and another fellow whose real name pan never heard was called slats  they taught pan all the cowboy songs from ti yi oop oop ya ya to bury me on the lone prairie every night pan listened to them sing by the fire in their bunkhouse and many times he had to be called to do his chores  another of the cowboys was called hookey  his nose resembled that of a parrot and he had the disposition of a locoed coyote according to pug and slats  hookey took a dislike to pan and always sought to arouse the boys temper  these cowboys were always gone in the morning before pan got up but by the time he arrived home from school on pilldarlick they were usually there  slats who wanted to be a lady killer would say wal button what did your school marm say about me today  and hookey would make fun of pilldarlick which ridicule had more power to hurt pan than anything else  one day pan gave way to fury and with flying rocks he chased hookey into the cellar and every time hookey poked up his head pan would fling a stone with menacing accuracy  that time his mother came to the rescue of the cowboy  after that hookey bought a new saddle and gave pan his old one  that settled hostilities  pan had a change of heart  no matter how hookey teased or tormented him he could never again make him angry  pan saw hookey with different eyes  he was unutterably happy now with a horse and saddle too and went about singing my trade is cinchin saddles an pullin bridle reins  one day two strange men arrived at the smith homestead  they had still hard faces intent gray eyes they packed guns and one of them wore a bright star on his vest  these men took hookey away with them  and after they were gone the cowboys told pan that hookey was wanted for horse stealing  young as pan was he understood the enormity of that crime in the eyes of cowboys  he felt terribly hurt and betrayed long indeed was it before he forgot hookey  swiftly that winter passed  pan had a happy growing time of it  study had not seemed so irksome perhaps owing to the fact that he had a horse and saddle he could ride to and fro he often stopped to see lucy who was now big enough to want to go to school herself and the teacher had won his love  pan kept out of fights with dick hardman until one recess when dick called him teachers pet  that inflamed pan as much because of the truth of it as the shame  so this time though he had hardly picked a fight he was the first to strike  with surprising suddenness he hit the big dick square on the nose  when dick got up howling and swearing his face was hideous with dirt and blood  then began a battle that dwarfed the one in the barn  pan had grown considerably  he was quick and strong and when once his mothers fighting blood burned in him he was as fierce as a young savage  but again dick whipped him  miss hill grieved and sorrowful sent pan home with a note  it chanced that both his father and mother were at home when he arrived they stood aghast at his appearance  you dirty ragged bloody boy cried his mother horrified  huh  you oughta see dick hardman ejaculated pan  the lad thought he had ruined himself forever with miss amanda hill but to his amaze and joy he had not  next day she kept him in after school cried over him kissed him talked long and earnestly  all that pan remembered was something terrible will come of your hate for dick hardman if you dont root it out of your heart  teacherwhy dont youtalk to dick this way faltered pan always won by her tenderness  because dick is a different kind of a boy she replied but never explained what she meant  at christmas time the parents of the school children gave a party at the schoolhouse  every one on the range for miles around was there pan for once had his fill of seeing cowboys  miss amanda was an attraction no cowboys could resist  that night pan spoke his first piece entitled sugartooth dick for sweeties was sick  to pan it seemed a silly piece but he spoke it to please miss amanda and because it was a hit at dick hardman  to his surprise he received a roar of applause  after the supper dancing began  some of the cowboys got drunk  there were fights two of which pan saw to his thrilling fear and awe  it was long past midnight when he yielded to the intense drowsiness that overcame him  when he awoke at dawn they were still dancing  winter passed  spring came with roundups too numerous for pan to keep track of  and a swift happy summer sped by  that fall a third uncle settled in the valley  he was an older brother of pans father whom they called old uncle ike  he was a queer old bachelor lived alone and did not invite friendliness  pan was told to stay away from him  old uncle ike was crabby and hard when a boy his heart had been broken by an unfaithful sweetheart he had shot her lover and run away to war  after serving through the civil war he fought indians and had lived an otherwise wild life  but pan was only the keener to see and know old uncle ike  he went boldly to make his acquaintance  he found a sadfaced gray old man sitting alone  pan said bravely uncle im pan smith your brother bills boy an ive come to see you because im sure ill like you  he did not find the old man unfriendly  pan was welcome and soon they became fast friends  every saturday pan rode over to uncle ikes place stealing some of the time he was supposed to be spending with lucy  the little girl pouted and cried and railed at pan for such base desertion but he only laughed at her  any time he wanted he could have lucy  she grew sweeter and more lovable as she grew older facts pan took to his heart but he chose the old mans stories of war and indians in preference to lucys society  months passed and pan grew tall and supple with promise of developing the true horsemans build  then the spring when he was twelve years old arrived and his father consented to let him ride for wages at the roundup  he joined a big outfit  there were over fifty cowboys two bed wagons two chuck wagons and strings of horses too numerous to count  a new horse to ride twice a day  this work was as near paradise as pan felt he had ever been  but for one circumstance it would have been absolutely perfect and that was that he had no boots  a fastriding cowboy without boots  in the heat of action amid the whirling loop of bawling calves and cows when the dry dust rose to stop up pans nostrils and cake on his hot sweaty face when the ropes were whistling the cowboys yelling the brand iron sizzling all he felt was the wild delight of it the thrill of the risk the excitement the constant stirring life and motion  during leisure hours however he was always confronted with his lack of riders equipment  say kid who built them top boots of yourn asked one cowboy  shore ill trade spurs with you drawled another  whars yore fur chaps there cowboy queried a third  and so it went always and forever  the cowboys could not help that it was born in them born of the atmosphere and spirit of the singular life they lived  nevertheless pan loved them and they were good to him  his best friends in this outfit were si and slick both horse wranglers whose real names pan never learned  that roundup was prolific of wonderful experiences  one night when a storm threatened the foreman called to the cowboys not on duty talk to em low boys fer theyre gettin ready  he meant that the herd of cattle was likely to stampede  and when the thunder and rain burst the herd broke away with a trampling roar  pan got soaked to the skin and lost in the rain  when he returned to camp only the cook and wagons were there  next morning the cowboys straggled in in bunches each driving part of the stampeded herd  at breakfast one morning pan heard a yell  ride him cowboy  whoopee  look at that outlaw comin high wide an handsome  pan just had time to see a terribly pitching red horse come tearing into the circle of cowboys  his rider went shooting over his head to alight among them  then what a scattering  that red fiend spoiled the breakfast and cleaned out the camp  how the cowboys reviled the poor fellow who had been thrown  huh  broke yore collar bone yelled one  why you dodblasted son of a sea cook he oughta hev broke yore neck  and si the horse wrangler said charlie i reckon its onconsiderate of you to exercise yore pet hoss on our stummicks  one of the amazing things that happened during the winter was the elopement of miss amanda hill with a cowboy  pan did not like this fellow very well but the incident heightened his already magnificent opinion of cowboys  pan never forgot lucys first day of school when he rode over with her sitting astride behind him ringin his neck as a cowboy remarked pan had not particularly been aware of that part of the performance for he was used to having lucy cling to him  that embarrassed him  he dropped her off rather unceremoniously at the door and went to put his horse in the corral  she was little and he was big which fact further bore upon his consciousness through the giggles of the girls and gibes of the boys  but they did not make any change in his attitude toward lucy  all winter he took her to and from school on his horse  the summer following he worked for his uncle ike  as pan grew older time seemed so much shorter than when he was little there was so much to do  and all at once he was fifteen years old his mother gave him a party on that birthday which was marked on his memory by the attention his boy friends paid to lucy  she was by far the prettiest girl in the valley  he did not know exactly what to make of his resentment nor of the queer attitude of proprietorship he had assumed over her  he was destined to learn more about his state of mind  it happened the next day at school during the noon hour  that late november a spell of indian summer weather had lingered and the pupils ate their lunches out under the trees  suddenly lucy came running up to pan who as usual was having a care for his horse  her golden hair was flying disheveled  she was weeping  her big violet eyes streamed with tears  she was wiping her face with most expressive disgust  panyou go right offand thrash dick hardman she cried passionately  lucywhats he done queried pan after a sudden sense of inward shock  hes always worrying mewhen youre not around  i never told cause i knew youd fight  but now hes done it  he grabbed me and kissed me  before all the boys  pan looked steadily at her tearwet face seeing lucy differently  she was not a baby any more  for some strange reason beyond his understanding he was furious with her  pushing her aside he strode toward the group of boys leering close by  dick hardman a strapping big lad now edged back into the crowd  pan violently burst into it forcing the boys back until he confronted his adversary  on dicks sallow face the brown freckles stood out prominently  something in the look and advance of pan had intimidated him  but he blustered he snarled  youre a skunk said pan fiercely and struck out with all his might  one hour from that moment they were still fighting  they had fought from the grove to the schoolyard from there down the road and back again  bloody ragged black they beat tore hit bit and clawed each other  the teacher wringing her hands called upon the other boys to separate the belligerents  they had tried but in vain and only got kicked for their pains  the girls most of them screamed and cried  but not lucy  white faced and with dilated eyes she watched that struggle  all the spectators even the youngest seemed to recognize it as a different kind of a fight from any that had ever occurred before  at last the teacher sent some of the children for help from the nearest farmhouse  dick would lower his head and lunge at pan trying to butt him in the abdomen  twice he had bowled pan over to his distinct advantage  but the crafty pan timing another and last attack of this kind swung up his knee with terrific force square into dicks face  down dick plumped rolled over on his back yelling loudly  suddenly he ceased he raised up on one elbow he spat blood and something that rattled on the gravel  a tooth  his grimy hand went trembling to his bloodstained mouth  he felt of his front teeth  one was gone others were loose  vanity dicks distinguishing characteristic suffered a terrible blow  staggering to his feet fetching a stone with him he glared at pan illkillyou  he flung the stone with deadly intent  but pan dodged it and leaped at him  dick ran hard toward the schoolhouse stooping to snatch up stones and turning to fling them at pan  the yelling boys scattered the frightened girls fled  pan was not to be outdone at any kind of fight  he returned stone for stone the last of which struck dick low down in the leg  like a crippled beast dick shrieked and plunged into the schoolhouse slamming shut the door  but pan rushing after grabbed up a rock and flung it so powerfully that it split the door and knocked it off the hinges  pan rushed in to receive full in the face a long thick teachers ruler thrown by dick  it knocked him flat  picking it up pan brandished it and charged his enemy  dick ran along the blackboard and jerking up one eraser after another he threw them  his aim was poor  his strength waning  his courage had gone  as for pan it was as if the long fight had only inspired him to renewed ferocity and might  the truth was that a hot dancing fire in pans blood had burned to white intensity unquenchable and devastating  suddenly dick made for the teachers table  an idea an inspiration showed in his renewed speed  pan divined its purpose  leaping upon the desks he endeavored to head dick off  too late  when pan sprang off the last desk to the platform dick had turnedwith the teachers long paper knife in his hand and baleful hate in his prominent eyes  later when the children outside dared to peep into the schoolroom they neither saw nor heard anything of the fighters  but fearing they were just hiding behind the benches ready for a renewed fusillade not one of the pupils dared go in  the teacher had hurried down the road to meet the men some of the boys had fetched  and these men were jim blake and bill smith who had been riding home from the range  when they entered the schoolroom with the teacher fearfully following and only lucy of all the scholars daring to come too they found the fight was over  dick lay unconscious on the floor with a bloody forehead  pan sat crouched on the platform haggard and sullen with face shirt hands all bloody  ahuh  reckon youve been fightin like a cowboy for shore this time said pans father in his matter of fact way  stand up  lets look at you  jim take a look at that lad on the floor  while pan painfully endeavored to get up blake knelt beside dick  bill this heah rooster has had a wallop said blake  you little cowpunchin ruffian exploded smith angrily reaching a large arm for pan  now then  what the hell   boy youve been stabbed  yesdadhe stuck mewith teachers knife replied pan faintly  he tottered on his feet and his right hand was pressed tight to his left shoulder high up where the broken haft of the paper knife showed between his redstained fingers  bill smiths anger vanished in alarm and something stern and grim took its place  just then lucy broke away from the teacher and confronted him  ohplease dont punish him mr smith she burst out poignantly it was all my fault  ii stuck up my nose at dick  he said things thatthat werent nice  i slapped him  then he grabbed me kissed me  i ran to panandand told him  oh that made pan fight  smith looked gravely down into the white little face with the distended violet eyes slowly losing their passion  he seemed to be struck with something that he had never seen before  wal lucy ill not punish pan he said slowly  i think more of him for fightin for you     chapter four  they did not meet again during the winter  it was a hard winter  pan left school and stayed close to home working for his mother and playing less than any time before  i heard dick say hed kill you someday said one cowboy seriously an take it from me kid hes a bad hombre  ahuh was all the reply pan vouchsafed as he walked away  he did not like to be reminded of dick  it sent an electric spark to the deepseated smoldering mine in his breast  when springtime came pan joined the roundup in earnest for part of the cattle and outfit now belonged to his father  out on the range the forty riders waited for the wagons  there were five cowboys from big sandy in pans bunch and several more arrived from the crow roost country  old dutch john a famous range character was driving the chuck wagon  at one time he had been a crony of pans father and that attracted pan to the profane old grizzled cook  he could not talk without swearing and if he replied to a question that needed only yes or no he would supplement it with a string of oaths  next day the outfit rode the west side of dobe creek rounding up perhaps a thousand cattle  pete blaine and hookey roped calves while pan helped hold up  on the following day the riders circled blue lakes where cattle swarmed  old john had yelled to the boys hey punchers heave at them today  you gotta throw an awful mess of em heah  these two lakes were always dry except during the spring and now they were full with green grass blanketing the range as far as eye could see  by monday long lines of cattle moved with flying dust down to the spot chosen for the roundup  as the herds closed in the green range itself seemed to be moving  when thrown together all these cattle formed a sea of red and white from which roared an incessant bawling it looked impossible to separate cows and calves from the others  but dozens of fearless cowboys riding in here and in there soon began to cut out the cows and calves  it was a spectacle that inspired pan as never before  the wagons were lined up near the lake their big white canvas tops shining in the afternoon sun and higher on a bench stood the hoodelum or bed wagon so stocked with bedrolls that it resembled a haystack  beyond the margin of the lake four hundred fine saddle horses grazed and kicked and bit at one another  beyond the saddle horses grazed the day herd of cattle  and over on the other side dinned the melee over the main herd the incessant riding yelling of the cowboys and the bawling of the cows  when all the cows and calves were cut out a rider of each outfit owning cattle on that range would go through to claim those belonging to his brand  next the herd of bulls and steers old cows and yearlings would be driven back out upon the range  fires were started and as there was no wood on that range buffalo chips were used instead  it took many cowboys to collect sufficient for their needs  at sunset when the branding of calves was finished each cowboy caught a horse for night duty  pan got one he called old paint  say kid called one of the crow nest cowboys aint you tyin up a pretty fancy hoss fer night work  oh i guess not laughed pan  come heah blowy called the cowboy to another  see what i found  a long lanky redfaced rider detached himself from the others and strode with jingling spurs over to look at pans horse  wal ill go to hell ben bolt if it aint ol calico he ejaculated in amaze and pleasure  kid whard you ever git him  dad made a trade replied pan  kid look a heah  dont ever tie that hoss to a stake pin  hes the best cow hoss i ever slung a leg over  the puncher who broke him an reached him all he knows was my pard long ago  an hes daid  kid hed roll over in his grave if he knowed ol cal was tied to a picket pin  aw is that so replied pan  fact is i dont know much about him we called him old paint  havent forked him yet  dad got him from a lady last winter  she was trying to work him to a cart  but he balked  she said she poured some hot water on  lady hell shouted the cowboy growing redder of face  she wasnt no lady if she treated that grand hoss that way  see heah kid ill stake you to a good night hoss  turn ol cal loose an whenever you need to do some real fancy separatin jest set your frusky on ol cal  better tie to your stirrups if youre perticler aboot keepin your seat cause at ol pony can sure git from under a cowhand  all right ill turn old calico loose replied pan  and ill remember what you said about him  blowy pointed out one of his horses  kid screw your wood to thet jasper an youll never be walkin  thanks but i got lots of horses said pan  aw go onlots of horses  why bunkie i got more mean horses than i can start to keep gentle  i just fetched thet one to stake my friends  pan saddled up the horse indicated and found him the best he had ever mounted  that experience led to his acquaintance with blowy  he was a ceaseless talker hence his name but beloved by all the outfit  pan learned something from every cowboy he met and it was not all for the best  that roundup was pans real introduction to the raw range  when the time came for the outfit to break up with each unit taking its own cattle the boss said to pan come ride fer me  pan flushed and pleased mumbled his thanks but he had to work for his father  then he and the boy with him joe crawley bade their comrades goodby especially loath to part with old dutch and started home with their cows and calves  they crossed the old indian battlefield where colonel shivington gave the famous order to his soldiers kill em all  nits make lice  pan and joe set out from there for limestone creek with their small herd and extra horses  pan wanted to bring old calico but he had drifted off to the range  heel flies are workin kid said joe who was older and more experienced  were shore goin to be on the mud fer the next month  there was something in the air storm perhaps or such conditions that have strange effect upon beasts  pan and joe fought their cattle and horses all that day and most of the night  they could not make them travel  halting where they were they kept guard till dawn then tried to drive their outfit on  but not for several hours could they move them  at length however the stock began to get dry and string out and travel  late in the afternoon the boys reached limestone  they found three old cows stuck in the mud up to their eyes with only their horns and faces showing  it took long hard work to get them out  they made camp there turning the cows and calves loose as this was their range  the following morning pan and joe rode up to the next boghole  they found seventeen mired cattle  nice an deep said joe  damn these heah cows allus pickin out quicksand  it took until noon to pull them out  another boghole showed twentyfour more in deep  how many more bogholes on limestone asked pan  only four an the wust ones replied joe groaning  if theyre boggin as good up there in them big holes your dad will sure have to ship more cattle in soon  there were six thousand cattle watering along that stream  when the water was low as it was then the cattle mired by the hundreds  looks bad pan remarked the older cowboy  were goin to need help  they returned to camp got their supper took fresh horses and worked half the night pulling cows out of the mud  by sunrise the next morning the boys were at work again  some of the mired cattle had died others had kinks in their necks and had to be killed  farther up the creek conditions grew worse and the biggest pool on the range looked from a distance like a small lake dotted with ducks  im cussin the world by sections growled joe  wal kid you gon up the crick and get as near a count as you can  im ridin in after men an wagons  well move the camp up heah  its the wust i ever seen an well lose a heap of stock  theres a loblolly of blue gumbo mud an no bottom  an by thunder were stuck heah for lord knows how long  that fall jim blake sold his farm and took his family to new mexico he had not been prospering in the valley and things had gone from bad to worse  pan did not get home in time to say goodby to lucysomething that hurt in an indefinable way  he had not forgotten lucy for in his mind she had become a steadfast factor in his home life  she left a little note of farewell simple and loyal hopeful yet somehow stultified  not so childish as former notes  time flew by and lucy might be growing up  the hardmans had also moved away from the valley where none of the neighbors appeared to know  but pan was assured of two facts concerning them firstly that dick had gotten into a serious shooting scrape in which he had wounded a ranchers son and secondly that from some unexpected and unknown source the hardmans had acquired or been left some money  pan promptly forgot his boyhood enemy  this winter was the last that he spent at home  he rode the limestone range that summer and according to cowboys gossip was fast developing all the qualities that pertained to the best riders of the day  upon returning home he found that his father had made unwise deals and was not getting along very well  grasping settlers had closed in on the range  rustlers had ridden down from the north raiding the valley  during pans absence a little sister was born which was indeed joyful news for him  and as he played with the baby he was reminded of lucy  what had become of her  it occurred to pan that sooner or later he must hunt her up  pan decided that he could not remain idle during the winter  he could have had plenty to do at home working without wages but that was no longer to be thought of  so he decided to join two other adventurous cowboys who had planned to go south and in the spring come back with some of the great herds being driven north  but pan liked the vast ranges of the lone star state and he rode there for two years inevitably drifting into the wild free life of the cowboys  sometimes he sent money home to his mother but that was seldom because he was always in debt  she wrote him regularly which fact was the only link between him and the old home memories  thought of lucy returned now and then on the lonely rides on night watches and it seemed like a sweet melancholy dream  never a word did he hear of her  spring had come again when he rode into the panhandle and as luck would have it he fell in with an outfit who were driving cattle to montana a job that would take until late fall  to his chagrin stories of his wildness had preceded him  ill rumor travels swiftly  pan was the more liked and respected by these riders  but he feared that gossip of the southern ranges would reach his mother  he would go home that fall to reassure her of his wellbeing and that he was not one of those bad gunthrowing cowboys  but late fall found him cheated of his long summers wages without money and job  he would not ride a grub line home so he found a place with a rancher in montana  he learned to hate the bleak ranges of that northern state the piercing blasts of wind the ice and snow spring saw him riding south toward his old stamping grounds  but always he was drifting with the swift months flying by as fleet as the mustangs he rode and he did not reach home  the cimarron the platte the arkansas ranges came to know the tracks of his horses and after he had drifted on to remember him as few cowboys were remembered  at twenty years of age panhandle smith looked olderlooked the hard life the hard fare the hard companionship that had been his lot as an american cowboy  he had absorbed all the virtues of that remarkable character and most of the vices  but he had always kept aloof from women  his comrades gave many forceful and humorous reasons for his apparent fear of the sex but they never understood him  pan never lost the reverence for women his mother had instilled in him nor his first and only love for lucy blake  one summer night pan was standing nightguard duty for his cowboy comrade who was enamored of the daughter of the rancher for whom they worked  jim was terribly in love and closely pressed by a rival from another outfit  this night was to be the crucial one  pan had to laugh at his friend  he was funny he was pathetic so prone to be cast down one moment and the next raised aloft to the skies according to the whim of the capricious young lady  many times pan had ridden and worked with a boy afflicted with a similar malady  this night however pan had been conscious of encroaching melancholy perhaps it was a yearning for something he did not know how to define  the night was strange a sultry oppressive one silent except for the uneasy lowing of the herd a rumble of thunder from the dark rolling clouds  a weird yellow moon hung just above the horizon  the range spread away dark lonely and wild  no wind stirred  the wolves and coyotes were quiet  all at once to pan the whole world seemed empty it was an unaccountable feeling  the open range the solitude the herd of cattle in his charge the comrades asleep the horses grazing round their picketsthese always sufficient things suddenly lost their magic potency  he divined at length that he was homesick  and by the time the lay watch was ended he had determined to quit his job and ride home     chapter five  on his way home panhandle smith rode across the old limestone range that had been the scene of his first cowboy activities  it had not changed although the cattle were not so numerous  familiar as yesterday were the bogholes where he and his partnerwhat was that cowpunchers namehad spent so many toilsome days and nights  pan made camp on the rocky ford where a brook joined the limestone  it was thirty miles to littleton farther to las animas and his pack horse was tired  he cooked his meager meal and unrolled his bed and as on many a hundred other nights he lay down under the open sky  but his wakefulness was new  he could not get to sleep for long  the nearer he got home the stranger and deeper his thoughts  moving on next day he kept sharp lookout among the cattle for his fathers brand  but he saw no sign of it  at length toward sunset after passing thousands of cattle he concluded in surprise that his fathers stock no longer ran this range  too many homesteads and fences  he reached littleton at dark  it had grown to be a sizable settlement  pan treated himself to a room at the new hotel and after supper went out to find somebody he knew  it was saturday night and the town was full of riders and ranchers  he expected to meet an old acquaintance any moment but to his further surprise he did not finally he went to campbells store long a fixture in the settlement of that country  john campbell huge of build with his long beard and ruddy face appeared exactly the same as when he used to give pan a stick of candy  it did seem a long time now  campbell did not recognize him  howdy stranger reckon youve got the best of me he replied to pans question and he sized up the tall lithe rider with curious and appreciating eyes  now john you used to give me a stick of candy every time i came to town said pan with a laugh  wal i done that for every tom dick an harry of a kid in this heah country returned the old man stroking his beard  but durn if i recollect you  panhandle smith announced pan with just a little diffidence perhaps if he was not remembered personally he might have the good luck to be unknown in reputation  walpan if t aint you by gosh ejaculated campbell cordially and there was unmistakable welcome in his grip  but no one here will ever recognize you  say youve sprung up  weve heerd a lot about younothin of late years though now i tax myself  cowboy youve seen some range life if talk is true  you mustnt believe all you hear mr campbell replied pan with a smile  id like to know about my dad and mother  wal havent you heerd queried campbell hesitatingly  what flashed pan noting the others sudden change to gravity its two years and more since i got a letter from mother  i wrote a couple of times but she never answered  you ought to have come home long ago said campbell  your father lost his cattle  old deal with hardman that stood for years  mebbe you never knowed about it  there are ranchers around here who swear hardman drove sharp deals  wal your father sold the homestead an left  reckon its been over a year  whered they go  your pa never told me where but i heerd afterward that he hit hardmans trail an went to western new mexico  marco is the name of the place  new country up there  gold an silver minin some cattle outfits goin in an lately i heerd of some big wildhoss deals on  well exclaimed pan in profound amaze and sorrow at this news  its a wideopen frontier place all right declared campbell  some cowpuncher rode through here an talked about marco  he said they stepped high wide an handsome up there  why did dad go asked pan in wonder  reckon i couldnt say fer sure  but he was sore at hardman an the funny thing is he wasnt sore till some time after hardman left these parts  mebbe he learned somethin  an you can learn whatever it was if you hunt up them ranchers who once got stung by hardman  ahuh muttered pan thoughtfully  dont know as i care to learn dad will tell me  jim blake now what become of him  jim a while back i reckon some years though after you left home was foreman for hardmans outfit  an he went to marco first  reckon hardman sent him up there to scout around  did jim take his family along inquired pan pondering  no  but they left soon after  in fact now i tax myself several homesteaders from hereabouts went  theres a boom over west pan an this here country is gettin crowded  marco  how do you get there  wal its on the old road to californy  pan went to the seclusion of his room and there in the dark sleepless he knew the pangs of remorse  without realizing the flight of years always meaning to return home to help father mother little sister to take up again with his neverforgotten lucyhe had allowed the wild life of the range to hold him too long  excuses were futile suppose he had failed to save moneysuppose he had become numbered among those whom his old schoolteacher had called bad cowboys pride neglect love of the range and new country new adventure had kept him from doing his duty by his parents  that hour was indeed dark and shameful for panhandle smith  instead of drowning his grief in drink as would have been natural for a cowboy he let it work its will upon him  he deserved the pangs of selfreproach the futile wondering the revived memories that roused longings stronger than that which had turned him on the homeward trail  next day pan sold his outfit except the few belongings he cherished and boarded a westbound stage  once on the way he recovered from his brooding mood and gradually awakened to the fact that he was riding to a new country a new adventurethe biggest of his lifein which he must make amends to his mother and to lucy  quite naturally he included lucy in the little circle of beloved oneslucy whom he had deserted for the open range for pitching horses and running steers for the dust and turmoil of the roundup for the long day ride and the lonely night watch for the gaming table the bottle the gunfor all that made life so thrilling to the american cowboy  riding by stage was not new to pan though he had never before taken more than a days journey  the stage driver jim wells was an oldtimer  he had been a ponyexpress rider miner teamster and freighter and now grizzled and scarred he liked to perch upon the drivers seat of the stage chew tobacco and talk  his keen eyes took pans measure in one glance  pitch your bag up cowboy an climb aboard he said  an what might your handle be  panhandle smith replied pan nonchalantly late of sycamore bend  wal now whard i hear thet name  i got a plumb good memory fer names an faces  pears i heerd thet name in cheyenne last summer i got it  cowpuncher named panhandle rode down street draggin a bolt of red calico thet unwound an stampeded all

like  an theres a gambler too if i ever seen one  reckon im agoin to enjoy this ride  after the next stop where the travelers got dinner pan returned to the stage to find a young lady perched upon the drivers seat  she had serious gray eyes and pale cheeks  i took your seat she said shyly but theres enough room  thanks ill ride inside replied pan  but if you dont sit heresomeone else mightand ihe she faltered flushing a little  oh in that case ill be glad to interrupted pan and climbed to the seat beside her  he had become aware of the appearance of a flashily dressed hawkeyed individual about to enter the stage  are you traveling alone  no thank you  father is with me but he never sees anything  i have been annoyed she replied  the stage driver arrived and surveyed the couple on the seat with a wink and a grin and a knowing look that quite embarrassed the young lady  wal now this here stage drivin is gettin to be mighty fine he said as he clambered up to the seat and unwound the reins from the brake handle  lady i reckon i seen you didnt like ridin inside wal youll shore be all right ridin between me an my young friend panhandle smith  i think i will replied the girl dimpling prettily  my name is emily newman  im on my way with my father to visit relatives in california  pan soon found it needful to make conversation in order to keep the loquacious old stage driver from talking too much  he had told miss newman about pans escapade with the red calico and had launched upon another story about him not funny at all to pan but one calculated to make conquest of a romancing young girl  pan managed to shut wells up but too late  miss newman turned bright eyes upon pan  oh of course i saw you were a cowboy she said dimpling again those enormous spurs you wear  i wondered how you could walk  these spurs  theyre nothing  i sleep in them replied pan  indeed  youre not serious  was that true about your riding round cheyenne dragging yards and yards of red calico behind your horse  yes  it was silly of me  i fear i had been looking upon something beside calico that was red  oh you mean red liquor    you wereunder its influence  a little replied pan laughing yet not liking the turn of the conversation  i wouldnt have guessed that you she added without concluding what she meant to say  but her tone her look and the intimation conveyed a subtle flattery to pan  it seemed that whenever he approached young women he always received similar impressions  that was seldom for his encounters with girls were few and far between  he could not help feeling pleased somehow embarrassed and rather vaguely elated  he divined danger for him in these potent impressions  without ever understanding why he had avoided friendships with girls  miss newman cowboys as a rule arent worth much rejoined pan submerging his annoyance in good humor  but at that they are not terrible liars like most of the stage drivers you meet  haw  haw roared jim wells cracking his long whip as the stage bowled over the road  hes a modest young fellar miss a most extraordinary kind of a cowboy  and so they bandied words and laughs from one to another while the long white road stretched ahead and rolled behind under the wheels the girl was plainly curious interested fascinated  old jim after the manner of westerners was bent on making a conquest for pan  and pan trying hard to make himself appear only an ordinary and quite worthless cowboy succeeded only in giving an opposite impression  the little lady rode three whole days on the drivers seat between pan and wells  she made the hours flee  when the stage reached las vegas she got off with her father and turned in the crowd to wave goodby her eyes were wistful with what might have been  they haunted pan for days over the mountain uplands and on and on  pan cherished the experience  to him it had been just a chance meeting with a nice girl but somehow it opened his eyes to what he had missed  the way of cowboys with girls was the one way in which he had been totally unfamiliar  what he had missed was not the dancing and flirting and courting that cowboys loved so well but something he could not quite grasp  it belonged to the neverfading influence of his mother and likewise it had some inscrutable association with little lucy blake little  surely she could not be little now  she was a grown girl a young woman like this emily newman beautiful perhaps with all the nameless charms women had for men  pan grew conscious of a mounting eagerness to see lucy and each day during the ride across the desert the feeling augmented and with it a bewilderment equally incomprehensible to him  new mexico was strange and new  he saw the desert through eyes intensified by emotion  he knew the plains from montana to texas  but this was different country with its stretches of valley its walls of red and yellow its strange shafts of rock its amber ranges and far away on every horizon the dim purple and white of great peaks were magnificent  the mormon ranches were scattered along the few green valleys  cattle were scarce only a few herds dotting the endless sweeps of green sage and bleached grass  as he traveled farther westward however the numbers of wild horses increased until they ran into the thousands  horses had meant more to pan than anything  in his wanderings up and down the western slope of the prairie land east of the rockies he had often encountered wild horses and had enjoyed many a chase after them every cowboy was a wild horse hunter on occasions  if he had ridden these desert ranges he would inevitably have become permanently a hunter and lover of wild horses  moreover pan did not see why there would not be vastly more money in it than in punching cows  he grew charmed with the idea  western new mexico at last  it appeared a continuation and a magnifying of all the color and wildness and vastness  sand dunes and wastes of black lava dry lake beds and coneshaped extinct volcanoes with the ragged crater mouths gaping low ranges of yellow cedardotted hills valleys of purple and green forests on the mountain slopesall these in endless variety were new to the cowboy of the plains  water was conspicuous for its absence though at long intervals of travel he crossed a stream  the homesteader that hopeful and lonely pioneer was as scarce as the streams  one night hours after dark the stage rolled into marco with pan one of five passengers  sunset had overtaken them miles from their destination  at that time pan thought the country wild and beautiful in the extreme  darkness had soon blotted out the strange formations of colored rocks the endless sweep of valley the cold white peaks in the far distance  marco  how unusual the swelling of his heart  the long threeweek ride had ended  the stage had rolled down a main street the like of which pan had never even imagined  it was crude rough garish with lights and stark board fronts of buildings and a motley jostling crowd of men women too were not wanting in the throngs streaming up and down  again it was saturday night  always it appeared pan hit town on this of all nights  noise and dust filled the air  pan pulled down his bag and mounted the board steps of the hotel the stage driver had announced  if pan had not been keenly strung after long weeks with the thought of soon seeing his mother father his little sister and lucy he would yet have been excited over this adventure beyond the rockies  contrary to his usual habit of throwing his money to the winds like most cowboys he had exercised rigid economy on this trip  indeed it was the first time he had ever done such a thing  he had between four and five hundred dollars consisting of wages he had saved and the proceeds from the sale of his horses and outfit  there was no telling in what difficulties he might find his father and what need there might be for his money  so pan took cheap lodgings and patronized a restaurant kept by a chinaman  he chose a table at which sat a young man whose face and hands and clothes told of rough life in the open in contact with elemental things  pan could catch such significance as quickly as he could the points of a horse  he belonged to that fraternity himself  mind if i sit here he asked indicating the vacant chair  help yourself stranger was the reply accompanied by an appraising glance from level quiet eyes  im sure hungry  hows the chuck here went on pan seating himself  the chink is a first rate cook an clean  just come to town  yes replied pan and after giving his order to a boy waiter he turned to his companion across the table and continued  and it took a darn long ride to get here  from texas  that so  well i come from western kansas just across the texas line  been here long  reckon a matter of six months  whats your work if youll excuse curiosity  im green you see and want to know  ive been workin a minin claim  gold  ahhuh replied pan with quickened interest  sounds awful good to me  i never saw any gold but a few gold eagles and theyve sure been scarce enough  pans frankness and that something simple and careless about him combined with his appearance always created the best of impressions upon men  his companion grinned across the table as if he had shared pans experience  reckon you neednt tell me youre a cowpuncher  i heard you comin before i saw you  my names brown  howdy glad to meet you replied pan and then with evident hesitation  mine is smith  panhandle smith queried the other quickly  why sure returned pan with a laugh  shake was all the reply brown made except to extend a lean strong hand  im most as lucky as i am unlucky said pan warmly  its a small world  now tell me brown have you seen or heard anything of my dad bill smith  no sorry to say  but i havent mingled much  been layin pretty low because the fact is i think ive struck a rich claim  an its made me cautious  ahuh  pretty wide open town ill bet  i appreciate your confidence in me  to tell you the truth im darn glad to run into some one from near home  lord i wish you could have brought word from my wife an baby  married and got a kid  thats fine  boy or girl  its a girl  i never saw her as she was born after i left home  my wife wasnt very well when she wrote last  she wants to come out here but i cant see that yet a while  well wish i could have brought you news  it must be tough to be separated from your family  im not married but i know what a little girl means  say brown did you ever run into a man out here named jim blake  no  or a man named hardman  jard hardman  hardman  now youre talkin panhandle  i should smile i have replied brown with a flash of quiet eyes that pan had learned to recognize as dangerous in men  his own pulse heightened  it was like coming suddenly on a track for which he had long been searching  the one word hardman had struck fire from this young miner  whats hardman doing asked pan quietly  everythin an between you an me hes doin everybody  jard hardman is in everythin  minin ranchin an ive heard hes gone in for this wild horse chasin  thats the newest boom around marco  but hardman has big interests here in town  its rumored hes back of the yellow mine the biggest saloon an gamblin hell in town  well ill be doggoned ejaculated pan thoughtfully  things turn out funny  you can show me that place presently  does hardman hang out here in marco  part of the time  he travels to frisco salt lake an st  louis where he sells cattle an horses  he has a big ranch out here in the valley an stays there some  his son runs the outfit  his son queried pan suddenly hot with a flash of memory  yes his son declared brown eyeing pan earnestly  reckon you must know dick hardman  i used tolong ago replied pan pondering  how far in the past that seemed  how vivid now in memory  old hardman makes the money an dick blows it in went on brown with something of contempt in his voice  dick plays an they say hes a rotten gambler  he drinks like a fish too  i dont run around much in this burg believe me but i see dick often  i heard hed fetched a girl here from frisco  ahuh  well thats enough about my old schoolmate thank you rejoined pan  tell me brown whats this marco town anyway  well its both old an new replied the other  thats about all i reckon  findin gold an silver out in the hills has made a boom this last year or so  thats what fetched me  the town is twice the size it was when i saw it first an many times more people  theres a lot of these people riffraff that work these minin towns  gamblers sharks claim jumpers outlaws adventurers tramps an of course the kind of women that go along with them  a good many cow outfits make this their headquarters now  an last this horse tradin an wild horse catchin  sellin an shippin has attracted lots of men  every day or so a new fellar like you drops in from east of the rockies there are some big mining men investigatin the claims  an if good mineral is found marco will be solid an not just a mushroom town  any law inquired pan thoughtfully  not so youd notice it much especially when you need it asserted brown grimly  matthews is the town marshal  selfelected so far as i could see  an hes hand an glove with hardman  hes mayor magistrate sheriff an the whole caboodle includin the court  but there are substantial men here who sooner or later will organize an do things  theyre too darned busy now workin gettin on their feet  ahuh  i savvy  i reckon youre giving me a hunch that in your private opinion matthews isnt exactly straight where some interests are concerned  hardmans for instance  ive run across that sort of deal in half a dozen towns  you got me replied brown soberly  but please regard that as my confidential opinion  i couldnt prove it  this town hasnt grown up to political corruption an graft  but its headed that way  well i was lucky to run into you said pan with satisfaction  ill tell you why some other time  im pretty sure to stick here  now lets go out and see the town especially the yellow mine  pan had not strolled the length of the main street before he realized that there was an atmosphere here strangely unfamiliar to him  yet he had visited some fairly wild and wideopen towns  but they had owed their wildness and excitement and atmosphere to the range and the omnipresent cowboy  oldtimers had told him stories of abilene and dodge when they were in their heyday  he had gambled in the hells of juárez across the texas border where there was no law  some of the montana cattle towns were far from slow in cowboy vernacular  but here he sensed a new element  and soon he grasped it as the fever of the rush for gold  the excitement of it took hold of him so that he had to reason with himself to shake it off  the town appeared about a mile long spread out on two sides of the main street graduating from the big buildings of stone and wood in the center to flimsy frame structures and tents along the outskirts  pan estimated that he must have passed three thousand people during his stroll up one side of the street and down the other  even if these made up the whole population it was enough to insure a goodsized town there were no street lamps  and the many yellow lights from open doors and windows fell upon the throngs moving to and fro in the street as well as on the sidewalks  pans guide eventually led him into the yellow mine  he saw a long wide room full of moving figures thin wreaths of blue smoke that floated in the glaring yellow lights  a bar ran the whole length of this room and drinkers were crowded in front of it  the clink of glass the clink of gold the incessant murmur of hoarse voices almost drowned faint strains of music from another room that opened from this one  the thousand and one saloons and gambling dives that pan had seen could not in any sense compare with this one  this was on a big scale without restraint of law or order  piles of gold and greenbacks littered the tables where roulette faro poker were in progress black garbed pale hardfaced gamblers sat with long mobile hands on the tables  bearded men leanfaced youths bent with intent gaze over their cards  sloeeyed mexicans in their highpeaked sombreros and gaudy trappings lounged here and there watching waitingfor what did not seem clear to pan  drunken miners in their shirt sleeves stamped through the open door to or from the bar  an odor of whisky mingled with that of tobacco smoke  young women with bare arms and necks and painted faces were in evidence some alone most of them attended by men  the gambling games attracted pan  like all cowboys he had felt the fascination of games of chance  he watched the roulette wheel then the faro games  in one corner of the big room almost an alcove pan espied a large round table at which were seated six players engrossed in a game of poker  he saw thousands of dollars in gold and notes on that table  a pretty flashy girl with bold eyes and a lazy sleepy smile hung over the shoulder of one of the gamblers  pans comrade nudged him in the side  what  where whispered pan answering quickly to the suggestion and his glance swept everywhere  brown was gazing with gleaming eyes at the young card player over whose shoulder the whitearmed girl hung  then pan saw a face that was strangely familiara handsome face of a complexion between red and white with large sensual mouth bold eyes and a broad low brow  the young gambler was dick hardman  pan knew him  the recognition meant nothing yet it gave pan a start a twinge and then sent a slow heat along his veins  he laughed to find the boyishness of old still alive in him  after eight years of hard life on the ranges  by that sudden resurging of long forgotten emotion pan judged the nature of what the years had made him  it would be interesting to see how dick hardman met him  but it was the girl who first seemed drawn by pans piercing gaze  she caught itthen looked a second time  sliding off the arms of hardmans chair she moved with undulating motion of her slender form and with bright eyes round the table toward pan  and at that moment dick hardman looked up from his cards and watched her     chapter six  hello cowboy  howd i ever miss you she queried roguishly running her bright eyes from his face down to his spurs and back again  good evening lady replied pan removing his sombrero and bowing with his genial smile  i just come to town  she hesitated as if struck by a deference she was not accustomed to then she took his hands in hers and dragged him out a little away from brown whom she gave a curt nod  again she looked pan up and down  did you take off that big hat because you know youre mighty good to look at she asked archly  well no hardly answered pan  what for then  its a habit i have when i meet a pretty girl  thank you  does she have to be pretty  reckon not  any girl miss  you are a stranger in marco  look out somebody doesnt shoot a hole in that hat when you doff it  while she smiled up at him losing something of the hawklike possessiontaking manner that had at first characterized her pan could see dick hardman staring hard across the table  before pan could find a reply for the girl one of the gamesters an unshaven scowling fellow addressed hardman  say air you playin cairds or watchin your dame make up to that big hat an high boots  pan grasped the opportunity though he never would have let that remark pass under any circumstances  he disengaged his right hand from the girls and stepping up to the table drawing her with him he bent a glance upon the disgruntled gambler  excuse me mister he began in the slow easy cool speech of a cowboy but did you mean me  his tone his presence drew the attention of all at the table especially the one he addressed and hardman  the former laid down his cards  shrewd eyes took pans measure surely not missing the gun at his hip  suppose i did mean you demanded the gambler curiously  well if you did id have to break up your game replied pan apologetically  you see mister it hurts my feelings to have anyone make fun of my clothes  all right cowboy no offense meant returned the other at which everyone except hardman let out a laugh  but youll break up our game anyhow if you dont trot off with louise there  his further remark dryly sarcastic mostly directed at hardman did not help the situation so far as pan was concerned  it was however exactly what pan wanted  dick stared insolently and fixedly at pan he appeared as much puzzled as annoyed  manifestly he was trying to place pan and did not succeed  pan had hardly expected to be recognized though he stood there a moment head uncovered under the light giving his old enemy eye for eye  in fact his steady gaze disconcerted dick who turned his glance on the amused girl  then his face darkened and he spat out his cigar to utter harshly go on you cat  and dont purr round me any more  insolently she laughed in his face  you forget i can scratch  then she drew pan away from the table beckoning for brown to come also halting presently near the wide opening into the dance hall she said  im always starting fights  what might your name be cowboy  well it might be tinkerdam but it isnt replied pan nonchalantly  arent you funny she queried halfinclined to be affronted  but she thought better of it and turned to brown  i know your face  sure you do miss louise said brown easily  im a miner  was here when you came to town an i often drop in to see the fun  whats your name she asked  charley brown an thats straight  thanks charley  now tell me whos this big goodlooking pard of yours  i just want to know  you cant fool me about men  he doffs his hat to me  he talks nice and low and smiles as no men smile at me  then he bluffs the toughest nut in this town  who is he  all right ill introduce you drawled brown  meet panhandle smith from texas  well she mused fastening her hands in the lapels of his coat  i thought youd have a highsounding handle  will you dance with me  sure but im afraid i step pretty high and wide  they entered another garish room around which a throng of couples spun and wagged and tramped and romped  pan danced with the girl and despite the jostling of the heavyfooted miners acquitted himself in a manner he thought was creditable for him  he had not been one of the dancing cowboys  that was a treat after those clodhoppers she said when the dance ended  youre a modest boy panhandle  youve got me guessing  im not used to your kindout here  lets go have a drink  ive got to have whisky  that jarred somewhat upon pan and as she led him back to brown and then both of them to an empty table he began to grasp the significance of these barearmed whitefaced girls with their darkhollowed eyes and scarlet lips  she drank straight whisky and it was liquor that burned pan like fire brown too made a wry face  panhandle are you going to stay here in marco she inquired leaning on her white round arms  yes if i find my folks he replied simply  they lost all they hadranch cattle horsesand moved out here  i never knew until i went back home  makes me feel pretty mean  but dad was doing well when i left home  mothersister too  yes  and my sister alice must be quite a girl now mused pan  and youre going to help them she asked softly  i should smile said pan feelingly  then you mustnt buy drinks for meor run after meas i was going to make you do  pan was at a loss for a reply to that frank statement  and as he gazed at her conscious of a subtle change someone pounded him on the back and then fell on his neck  my gawdif heah aint panhandle burst out a husky voice  pan got up as best he could and pulled free from the fellow  the voice had prepared pan for an old acquaintance and when he saw that lean red face and blue eyes he knew them  well ill be darned  blinky moran  you son of a gun  drunkthe same as when i saw you last  aw pan i aint jes drunk he replied  mebbe i wasbut shein youole pardmy gawd  its like cold sweet water on my hot face  blink im sure glad to see you drunk or sober replied pan warmly whatre you doing out here  moran braced himself not without the help of his hold upon pan and it was evident that this meeting had roused him  pan meet my pard heah he began indicating a stalwart young man in overalls and high boots  gus hans puncher of montana  pan shook hands with the grinning cowboy  pard yore shakin the paw of panhandle smith announced moran in solemn emotion  this heahs the boy frens  youve heerd me rave manys the time  he was my pard my bunkmate my brother  we rode the cimarron together an the arkansaw an we was the only straight punchers in the long bar c outfit that was drove out of wyomin his beat never forked a hoss or coiled a rope  an shorern hell pard id been a rustler but fer panhandle  moren onct he throwed his gun fer me an  say blink ill have to choke you interrupted pan laughing  now you meet my friends here miss louiseand charley brown  pan did not miss the effect the brighteyed redlipped girl made upon the cowboys especially moran who he remembered had always succumbed easily to feminine charms  blinky youve been drinking too much to dance with a lady presently remarked louise  wal now miss im as sober as panhandle there replied moran ardently  she shook her curly head smilingly and rising from the table went round to pan and leaned up to him with both wistfulness and recklessness in her face  panhandle smith ill leave you to your friends she said  but dont you drift in here againfor if you doill forget my sacrifice for little alice  there  she kissed him square on the lips and ran off without a backward glance  blinky fell into a chair overcome with some unusual kind of emotion he stared comically at pan  say ole pard you used to be shy of skirts he expostulated  reckon i am yet for all the evidence retorted pan half amused and half angry at the unexpected move of the girl  charley brown joined in the mirth at pans expense  guess the drinks are on me he said  and theyll be the last  pan thet there girl is louie melliss ejaculated moran  is it  well who in the deuce is she  say cowboy quit your foolin  honest i never saw or heard of the young lady till a few minutes ago ask brown  thats a fact corroborated brown thus appealed to  shes the belle of this hell  sure smith you savvy that  no rejoined pan bluntly  he began to fear he had been rather thickheaded  ive holed up in a few gambling hells where drinks and scraps went pretty lively  but this is the first one for me where there were a lot of halfnaked girls  youre west of the rockies now replied brown grimly  an youll soon find that out in more ways than one  louie melliss is straight from frisco an chainlightnin to her fingertips so they say  been some bad messes over her  but they say too shes as white an square as any good woman  aw   reckon im pretty much of a tenderfoot returned pan  his regret was for the pretty audacious girl whose boldness of approach he had not understood  for gawds sake pard began moran recovering from his shock dont you come ridin around heah fer thet little devil to get stuck on you  shes shore agoin to give young hardman a bootiful trimmin an let her do it  oh  so you dont care much about young hardman inquired pan with interest  he certainly felt that he was falling into news  id like to throw a gun on him an onct i damn near done it declared moran  what for  he an another fellar jumped the only claim i ever struck thet showed any color went on the cowboy with an earnestness that showed excitement had sobered him  i went back one mawnin an there was hardman an a miner

an raised a holler  but i couldnt prove nothin an by gawd pan thet claim is a mine now payin well  tough luck blink  you always did have the darndest luck  say brown is that sort of deal worked often  common as dirt in the early days of a find replied brown  i havent heard of any claim jumpin just lately though  its somethin like rustlin cattle  you know most every cowman now and then picks up some unbranded stock that he knows isnt his  but he takes it along now claim jumpin is somethin like that  if a fellar leaves his claim for a day or a week hes liable to come back an find some one has

no bedroll  ill buy an outfit in the morning and throw in with you  hello theres shooting  gun play  lets get out of this place where theres more room and air  with that they and many others left the hall and joined the moving crowd in the street  the night was delightfully cool  stars shone white in a velvet sky  the dry wind from mountain and desert blew in their faces  pan halted at the steps of the hotel  blink im going to turn in  call for me in the morning  i cant tell you how glad i am that i ran into you boys  and you too brown id like to see more of you  they shook hands and parted  pan entered the hotel and sat a while in the bare smoky lobby where sharpeyed men and women passed him by with one look at his cowboy attire  they were seeking bigger game  pan experienced a strange excitation in the hour in the place  when he went to his room he was not sleepy  lucky to meet those boys he soliloquized as he undressed  now to find dadmotheralice  lord i hope alls well with them  but ive a feeling it isnt  and lucy  i wonder will she be here too  will she recognize me  ill bet a million she does  funny about dick hardman  never knew me  didnt he look though   and that girl louise  she had to laugh and talk all the time to hide the sadness of her face  at that shes too good for dick hardman  ill bet another million he and i clash again   pan was up bright and early enjoying the keen desert air and the vast difference between marco at night and at dawn  the little spell of morbid doubt and worry that had settled upon him did not abide in the clear rosy light of day  hope and thrill resurged in him  blinky and his partner soon appeared and quarreled over which should carry pans baggage out to their quarters  pan decidedly preferred the locality to that he had just left  the boys had a big tent set up on a framework of wood an open shed which they used as a kitchen and a big corral  the site was up on a gradual slope somewhat above the town and rendered attractive by a small brook and straggling cedars  they had a mexican cook who was known everywhere as lying juan  pan grasped at once that he would have a lot of fun with juan  the boys talked so fast they almost neglected to eat their breakfast they were full of enthusiasm which fact pan could not but see was owing to his arrival  it amused him  moran like many other cowboys had always attributed to pan a prowess and character he felt sure were undeserved  yet it touched him  wal oletimer well rustle now finally said moran  weve got aboot fifty broomies out heah in a canyon  well drive em in today an also some saddle hosses for you  ill buy a horse interposed pan  youll do nothin of the sort declared blinky stoutly  aint we got a string of hosses an there shore might be one of them good enough even for panhandle smith  but you want a saddle  theres one in blacks store  its mexican an a blamed good one  cheap too  gus came trotting up on a spirited sorrel leading two other wellpointed horses saddled champing their bits  sight of them was good for pans eyes  he would never long have been happy away from horses  moran leaped astride one of them and then said hesitatingly  pard shore hope you hev good luck findin your dad  pan watched them ride away down the slope to the road and around a bend out of sight  it was wonderful country that faced him cedar piñon and sage colored hills and flats walls of yellow rock stretch away and dim purple mountains all around  if his keen eyes did not deceive him there was a bunch of wild horses grazing on top of the first hill  juan are there lots of wild horses he asked the mexican cook  and presently he came into knowledge of the justice of the name lying juan  pan had met some great liars in his life on the range but if juan could do any better than this he would be the champion of them all  pan shaved put on a clean flannel shirt and new scarf and leaving his coat behind he strode off toward the town  the business of the day had begun and there was considerable bustle  certainly marco showed no similarity to a cattle town  somebody directed him to the stage and express office a plain board building off the main street  three men lounged before it one on the steps and the others against the hitchingrail  pan took them in before they paid any particular attention to him  morning gents he said easily  is the agent smith around  howdy stranger replied one of them looking pan over  smith just stepped over to the bank  hell be back pronto  another of the group straightened up to run a hard gray eye from pans spurs to his sombrero and back for a second glance at his low hanging gun  he was a tall man in loose tan garments trousers stuffed in his boots  he had a big sandy mustache  he moved to face pan and either by accident or design the flap of his coat fell back to expose a bright silver shield on his vest  reckon youre new in these parts he queried  yep  just rode in replied pan cheerfully  see youre packin hardware went on the other with significant glance at pans gun  pan at once took this man to be matthews the town marshal mentioned by charley brown  he had not needed browns hint he had encountered many sheriffs of like stripe  pan usually the kindliest and most genial of cowboys returned the sheriffs curious scrutiny with a cool stare  am i packing a gun rejoined pan with pretended surprise as he looked down at his hip  sure so i am  clean forgot it mister habit of mine  whats a habit snapped the other  pan now shot a straight level gaze into the hard gray eyes of the sheriff  he knew he was going to have dealings with this man and the sooner they began the better  why my packing a gunwhen im in bad company said pan  pretty strong talk cowboy west of the rockies  im matthews the town marshal  i knew that and im right glad to meet you rejoined pan pertly  he made no move to meet the halfproffered hand and his steady gaze disconcerted the marshal  another man came briskly up carrying papers in his hand  are you the agent mr smith asked pan  i am thet air young fellar  can i see you a moment on business  come right in  he ushered pan into his office and shut the door  my names smith began pan hurriedly  im hunting for my dad bill smith  do you know himif hes in marco  bill smiths cowboy  wal put her thar burst out the other heartily shoving out a big hand  his surprise and pleasure were marked  know bill  wal i should smile  were neighbors an good friends  pan was so overcome by relief and sudden joy that he could not speak for a moment but he wrung the agents hand  wal now sort of hit you in the gizzard hey he queried with humor and sympathy  he released his hand and put it on pans shoulder ive heard all about you cowboy  bill always talked a lotuntil lately  reckon hes deep hurt thet you never wrote  ive been pretty lowdown replied pan with agitation  but i never meant to be  i just drifted along  always i was going back home soon  but i didnt  and i havent written home for two years  wal forget thet now son said the agent kindly  boys will be boys especially cowboys  youve been a wild one if reports comin to bill was true  but youve come home to make up to him  lord knows he needs you boy  yesill make itup replied pan trying to swallow his emotion tell me  wal i wish i had better news to tell replied smith gravely shaking his head  your dads had tough luck  he lost his ranch in texas as i reckon you know an he folleredthe man whod done him out here to try to make him square up  bill only got a worse deal  then he got started again pretty good an lost out because of a dry year  now hes workin in carters wagon shop  hes a firstrate carpenter  but his wages are small an he cant never get no where  hes talked some of wildhoss wranglin  but thet takes an outfit which he aint got ill give you a hunch son  if you can stake your dad to an outfit an throw in with him you might give him another start  pan had on his tongue an enthusiastic reply to that but the entrance of the curious matthews halted him  thank you mr smith he said eagerly  wherell i find carters wagon shop  other end of town  right down main street  you cant miss it  pan hurried out and through the door he heard matthews loud voice  carters wagon shop   by thunder ive got the hunch  that cowboy is panhandle smith  pan smiled grimly to himself as he passed on out of hearing  the name and fame that had meant so little to him back on the prairie ranges might stand him in good stead out here west of the rockies  he strode swiftly his thought reverting to his father  he wanted to run remorse knocked at his heart  desertion  he had gone off like so many cowboys forgetting home father mother duty  they had suffered  never a word of it had come to him  the way appeared long and the line of stone houses and board shacks never ending  at last he reached the outskirts of marco and espied the building and sign he was so eagerly seeking  resounding hammer strokes came from the shop  outward coolness an achievement habitual with him when excitement mounted to a certain stage came with effort and he paused a moment to gaze at the sweeping country green and purple dotted by gray rocks rising to hills gold with autumn colors  his long journey was at an end  in a moment more anxiety would be a thing of the past  let him only see his father actually in the flesh  pan entered the shop  it was open like any other wagon shop with wood scattered about shavings everywhere a long bench laden with tools a forge  then he espied a man wielding a hammer on a wheel  his back was turned  but pan knew him  knew that back that shaggy head beginning to turn gray knew even the swing of arm  he approached leisurely  the moment seemed big splendid  howdy dad he called at the end of one of the hammer strokes  his fathers lax figure stiffened  he dropped the wheel then the hammer  but not on the instant did he turn  his posture was strained doubtful  then he sprang erect and whirled  pan saw his father greatly changed but how it was impossible to grasp because his seamed face was suddenly transformed  for the goodlords sakeif it aint pan he gasped  it sure is dad  are you glad to see me  glad   reckon thisll save your mothers life and to pans amaze he felt himself crushed in his fathers arms  that sort of thing had never been bill smiths way  he thrilled to it and tried again to beat back the remorse mounting higher  his father released him and drew back as if suddenly ashamed of his emotion  his face which he had been trying to control smoothed out  wal pan you come back nowafter long ago i gave up hopin he queried haltingly  yes dad began pan with swift rush of words  im sorry  i always meant to come home  but one thing and another prevented  then i never heard of your troubles  i never knew you needed me  you didnt write why didnt you tell me   but forget that  i rode the rangesdrifted with the cowboystill i got homesick  now ive found youand well i want to make up to you and mother  ahhuh  sounds like music to me replied smith growing slow and cool  he eyed pan up and down walked round him twice  then he suddenly burst out wal you longlegged strappin son of a gun  if sight of you aint good for sore eyes   ahhuh  look where he packs that gun  with slow strange action he reached down to draw pans gun from its holster  it was long and heavy blue with a deadly look  the fathers intent gaze moved from it up to the face of the son  pan realized what his father knew what he thought  the moment was sickening for pan  a cold shadow forgotten for long seemed to pass through his mind  pan ive kept tab on you for years spoke his father slowly but id have heard even if i hadnt took pains to learn  panhandle smith  you damned hardridin gunthrowin son of mine   once my heart broke because you drifted with the wild cowpunchersbut nowby god i believe im glad  dad never mind range talk  you know how cowboys brag and blow im not ashamed to face you and mother  ive come clean dad  but son youveyouve used that gun whispered smith hoarsely  sure i have  on some twolegged coyotes an skunks  and maybe greasers  i forget  panhandle smith ejaculated his father refusing to take the matter in pans light vein  they know here in marco  youre known pan here west of the rockies  well what of it flashed pan suddenly gripped again by that strange cold emotion in the depths of him  i should think youd be glad reckon it was all good practice for what ill have to do out here  dont talk that way  youve read my mind replied smith huskily im afraid  im almost sorry you came  yet right now i feel more of a man than for years  dad you can tell me everything some other time rejoined pan throwing off the sinister spell  now i only want to know about mother and alice  theyre well an fine son though your mother grieves for you  she never got over that  an alice shes a big girl goin to school an helpin with work  an pan youve got a baby brother nearly two years old  jumping cowbells shouted pan in delight  where are they  tell me quick  we live on a farm a mile or so out  i rent it for most nothin hall who owns it has a big ranch  ive got an option on this farm an it shore is a bargain  hundred an ten acres most of it cultivated  good water pasture barn an nice little cabin  i work here mornins an out there afternoons  youll  stop talking about it  ill buy the farm interrupted pan  but where is it  keep right out this road  second farmhouse said his father pointing to the west  id go with you but i promised some work  but ill be home at noon  hey hold on  theres more to tell  youll get aa jolt  wait  but pan rushed on out of the shop and took to the road with the stride of a giant  to be compelled to walk when if he had had his horse he could ride that mile in two minutes  his heart was beating high mother  grieving for me  alice a big girl  and a baby boy  this is too good for a prodigal like me  all else he had forgotten for the moment  shadows of memories overhung his consciousness striving for entrance but he denied them  how shaken his father had been at sight of him  poor old dad  and then what was the significance of all that talk about his range name panhandle smith and his fathers strange fascinated handling of pans gun  would his mother know him at first glance  oh no doubt of that but alice would not she had been a child and he had grown changed  while his thoughts raced he kept gazing near and far  the farm land showed a fair degree of cultivation  grassy hills shone in the bright morning sun high up flares of gold spoke eloquently of aspen thickets tinged by the frost purple belts crossing the mountains told of forests  the wall of rock that he had observed from morans camp wound away over the eastern horizon  a new country it was a fair and wild country rugged and hard on the uplands suitable for pasture and cultivation in the lowlands  pan passed the first farmhouse  beyond that he could make out only a green patch where he judged lay the home he was hunting  his buoyant step swallowed up the rods  cattle and horses grazed in a pasture the road turned to the right round the slope of a low hill  pans quick eye caught a column of curling blue smoke that rose from a grove of trees  the house would be in there  pasture orchard cornfield ragged and uncut a grove of low trees with thick foliage barns and corrals he noted with appreciative enthusiasm  the place did not have the bareness characteristic of a ranch  at last pan reached the wagon gate that led into the farm  it bordered an orchard of fairsized trees the leaves of which were colored  he cut across the orchard so as to reach the house more quickly  it was still mostly hidden among the trees  smell of hay of fruit of the barnyard assailed his nostrils  and then the fragrance of wood smoke and burning leaves  his heart swelled full high in his breast  he could never meet his mother with his usual cool easy nonchalance  suddenly he espied a woman through the trees  she was quite close  he almost ran  no it could not be his mother  this was a girl lithe tall swift stepping  his mother had been rather short and stout could this girl be his sister alice  the swift supposition was absurd because alice was only about ten and this girl was grown  she had a grace of motion that struck pan  he hurried around some trees to intercept her losing sight of her for a moment  suddenly he came out of the shade to confront her face to face in the open sunlight  she uttered a cry and dropped something she had been carrying  dont be scared miss he said happily  im no tramp though i did rant in like a trespasser  i want to find mrs bill smith  im  but pan got no farther  the girl had reason to be scared but should her hands fly to her bosom like that and press there as if she had been hurt  he must have frightened her  and he was about to stammer his apologies and make himself known when the expression on her face struck him mute  her healthy golden skin turned white  her lips quivered opened  then her eyestheir color was violet and something about them seemed to stab pan  his mind went into a deadlockseemed to whirland to flash again into magnified thoughts  pan  pan she cried and moved toward him her eyes widening shining with a light he had never seen in another womans  pan  dont youknow me  surebut i dont know who you are pan muttered in bewilderment  im lucy   oh panyouve come back she burst out huskily with a deep break in her voice  she seemed to leap toward himinto the arms he flung wide as with tremendous shock he recognized her name her voice her eyes  it was a moment beyond reason  he was crushing her to his breast kissing her in a frenzy of sudden realization of love  lucy  lucy  little lucy blake his baby his child sweetheart his schoolmate  and the hunger of the long lonely years never realized leaped to his lips now  she flung her arms round his neck and for a few moments gave him kiss for kiss  then suddenly she shivered and her head fell forward on his breast  pan held her closely striving for selfcontrol  and he gazed out into the trees with blurred eyes  what a homecoming  lucy grown into a tall beautiful girl who had never forgotten him  he was shaken to his depths by the revelation that now came to him  he had always loved lucy  never anyone else never knowing until this precious moment what a glorious trick for life to play him  he held her wrapped her closer bent his face to her fragrant hair  it was dull gold now once it had been bright shiny light as the color of grass on the hill  he kissed it conscious of unutterable gratitude and exaltation  she stirred put her hands to his breast and broke away from him tragic eyed strange  pan ii was beside myself she whispered  forgive me oh the joy of seeing you  it was too much  go to your mother shewill  yes presently but lucy dont feel badly about thisabout my not recognizing you at once he interrupted in glad swift eagerness how you have grown  changed   lucy your hair is gold now  my little whiteheaded kid  oh i remember  i never forgot you that way but youre so changedsosolucy youre beautiful  ive come back to you  i always loved you  i didnt know it as i do now but ive been true to you  lucy i swear  im panhandle smith and as wild as any of that prairie outfit  but darling ive been true to youtrue  and ive come back to love you to make up for absence to take care of youmarry you  oh darling i know youve been true to meyouve waited for me  rapture and agony both seemed to be struggling for the mastery over lucy  pan suddenly divined that this was the meaning of her emotion  my god she whispered finally warding him off  dont you knowhavent you heard  nothing  dad didnt mention you replied pan hoarsely fighting an icy sickening fear  whats wrong  go to your mother  dont let her wait  ill see you later  but lucy  go  give me a little while toto get hold of myself  areare you married he faltered  nonobut  dont you love me  she made no reply except to cover her face with shaking hands  they could not hide the betraying scarlet  lucy you must love me he rushed on almost incoherently  you gave yourself away  it lifted mechanged me  all my life ive loved you though i never realized it  your kissesthey made me know myself  but my god say that you love me  yes pan i do love you she replied quietly lifting her eyes to his  again the rich color fled  then nothing else matters cried pan  whatevers wrong ill make right  dont forget that  ive much to make up for  forgive me for thisthiswhatever has hurt you so  ill go now to mother and see you later  youll stay  i live here with your people replied lucy and walked away through the trees  something wrong muttered pan as he watched her go  but the black fear of he knew not what could not stand before his consciousness of finding lucy of seeing her betray her love  doubt lingered but his glad heart downed that too  he was home  what surprise and joy to learn that it was also lucys home  he stifled his intense curiosity and longing  he composed himself  he walked a little under the trees he thought of the happiness he would bring his mother and alice  in a few moments he would make the acquaintance of his baby brother   flowers that he recognized as the favorites of his mother bordered the sandy path around the cabin  the house had been constructed of logs and later improved with a frame addition unpainted weather stained covered with vines  a cozy little porch with wide eaves and a windbreak of vines faced the south  a rude homemade rocking chair sat on the porch a childs wooden toys also attested to a carpenters skill pan well remembered  he heard a child singing then a womans mellow voice  pan drew a long breath and took off his sombrero  it had comethe moment he had long dreamed of  he stepped loudly upon the porch so that his spurs jangled musically and he knocked upon the door frame  whos there called the voice again  it made pans heart beat fast in deep husky tones he replied  just a poor starved cowboy maam beggin a little grub  gracious me she exclaimed and her footsteps thudded on the floor inside  pan knew his words would fetch her  then he saw her come to the door years trouble pain had wrought their havoc but he would have known her at first sight among a thousand women  mother he called poignantly and stepped toward her with his arms out  she seemed stricken  the kindly eyes changed rolled  her mouth opened wide  she gasped and fainted in his arms   a little while later when she had recovered from the shock and the rapture of pans return they sat in the neat little room  bobby dont you know your big brother pan was repeating to the bigeyed boy who regarded him so solemnly  bobby was fascinated by this stranger and at last was induced to approach his knee  mother i reckon youll never let bobby be a cowboy teased pan with a smile  never she murmured fervently  well he might do worse went on pan thoughtfully  but well make a plain rancher of him with a leaning to horses  hows that  id like it but not in a wild country like this she replied  reckon wed do well to figure on a permanent home in arizona where both summers and winters are pleasant  ive heard a lot about arizona its a land of wonderful grass and sage ranges fine forests canyons well go there some day  then pan youve come home to stay she asked with agitation  yes mother he assured her squeezing the worn hand that kept reaching to touch him as if to see if he were real  then bobby engaged his attention  hey you rascal let go  thats my gun bad sign mother  bobbys as keen about a gun as i was over a horse  there bobby now its safe to play with  mother theres a million things to talk about  but well let most of them go for the present  you say alice is in school  when will she be home  late this afternoon  pan she went on hesitatingly lucy blake lives with us now  yes i met lucy outside replied pan drawing a deep breath  but first about dad  i didnt take time to talk much with him  i wanted to see you  is dad well in health  hes well enough  really he does two mens work  worry drags him down  well cheer him up  at littleton i heard a little about dads bad luck  now you tell me everything  theres little to tell she replied sadly  your father made foolish deals back in texas the last and biggest of which was with jard hardman  there came a bad yearanno seco the mexicans call it  failure of crops left your father ruined  he lost the farm  he found later that hardman had cheated him out of his cattle  we followed hardman out here  our neighbors the blakes had come ahead of us  hardman not only wouldnt be square about the cattle deal but he knocked your father out again just as he had another start  in my mind it was worse than the cattle deal  we bought a homestead from a man named sprague  his wife wanted to go home to missouri  this homestead had water good soil some timber and an undeveloped mining claim that turned out well  then along comes jard hardman with claims papers witnesses and law back of him  he claimed to have gotten possession of the homestead from the original owner  it was all a lie but they put us off  then your father tried several things that did not pan out  now were hereand he has to work in the wagon shop to pay the rent  ahhuh replied pan relieving his oppressed breast with an effort and now about lucy  how does it come shes living with you  she had no home poor girl replied his mother hastily  she came out here with her father and uncle  her mother died soon after you left us  jim blake had interests with hardman back in texas  he talked bigand drank a good deal  he and hardman quarreled  it was the same big deal that ruined your father  but jim came to new mexico with hardman  they were getting along all right when we arrived  but trouble soon aroseand that over lucy  young dick hardmanyou certainly ought to remember him panfell madly in love with lucy dick always was a wild boy  here in marco he went the pace  well bad as jard hardman is he loves that boy and would move heaven and earth for him  lucy despised dick  the more he ran after her the more she despised him  also the more she flouted dick the wilder he drank and gambled  now here comes the pitiful part of it  jim blake went utterly to the bad so your father says though lucy hopes and believes she can save him  i do too  jim was only weak  jard hardman ruined him  finally dick enlisted his father in his cause and they forced jim to try to make lucy marry dick  she refused  she left her fathers place and went to live with her uncle bill who was an honest fine man but he was shot in the yellow mine  by accident they gave out but your father scouts that idea  oh those dreadful gambling hells life is cheap here  lucy came to live with us  she taught the school  but she had to give that up  dick hardman and other wild young fellows made her life wretched  besides she was never safe  we persuaded her to give it up  and then thethe worst happened  mrs smith paused wiping her wet eyes and appeared to dread further disclosure  she lifted an appealing hand to pan  whatwhat was it mother he asked fearfully  didntshelucy tell you anything faltered his mother  yesthe greatest thing in the worldthat she loved me burst out pan with exultant passion  oh how terrible  no mother not that but beautiful wonderful glorious  go on  thenthen they put jim blake in jail began mrs smith  what for flashed pan  to hold him there pending action back in texas  jim blake was a cattle thief  theres little doubt of that your father says  you know theres law back east at least now in some districts  well jard hardman is holding jim in jail  it seems hardman will waive trial providedprovided  oh how can i tell you  my god  i see cried pan leaping in fierce passion  they will try to force lucy to marry dick to save her father  yes  thats it  and pan my son  she has consented  so that was what made her act so strange   poor lucy  dick hardman was a skunk when he was a kid  now hes a skunkbitten coyote oh but this is a mess  pan what can you do implored his mother  lucy hasnt married him yet  tell me quick cried pan suddenly  oh no  she has only promised  she doesnt trust those men  she wants papers signed to clear her father  they laugh at her  but lucy is no fool  when she sacrifices herself itll not be for nothing  pan slowly sank down into the chair and his brooding gaze fastened on the big blue gun with which bobby was playing  it fascinated pan sight of it brought the strange cold sensation that seemed like a wind through his being  mother how old is lucy he asked forcing himself to be calm  shes nearly seventeen but looks older  not of age yet  yes she looks twenty  shes a woman mother  what did lucy do and say when she saw you asked his mother with a womans intense curiosity  ha  she did and said enough replied pan radiantly  i didnt recognize her  think of that mother  tell me son implored mrs smith  mother she ran right into my arms  we just met mother and the old love leaped  mercy what a terrible situation for you both especially for lucy pan what can you do  mother i dont know i cant think  its too sudden  but ill never let her marry dick hardman  why only last night i saw a painted little hussy hanging over him  bad as that poor girl must be shes too good for him  he doesnt worry me nor his schemes to get lucy  but how to save jim blake  pan you think it can be done  my dear mother i know it  only i cant think now  im new here and handicapped by concern for you for lucy for dad  lord if i was back in the cimarronitd be easy  my boy dont be too concerned about lucy or me or your dad replied his mother with surprising coolness  i mean dont let concern for us balk you  thank god you have come home to us  i feel a different woman  i am frightened yes  forfor ive heard of you  what a name for my boy  well youre game mother said pan with a laugh as he embraced her  thatll help a lot  if only lucy will be like you  she has a heart of fire  only save her father pan and you will be blessed with such womans love as you never dreamed of  it may be hard though for you to change her mind  i wont try mother  go to her then and fill her with the hope youve given me     chapter seven  from a thick clump of trees pan had watched lucy spied upon her with only love tenderness pity in his heart  but he did not know her  it seemed incredible that he could confess to himself he loved her  had the love he had cherished for a child suddenly as if by magic leaped into love for a woman  what then was this storm within him this outward bodily trembling from the tumult within  lucy stood like a statue gazing into nothingness  then she paced to and fro her hands clenched on her breast  this was a secluded nook where a bench had been built between two lowbranching trees on the bank of the stream  pan stealthily slipped closer so he could get clearer sight of her face  was her love for him the cause of her emotion  presently he halted at a point close to one end of her walk and crouched down  it did not occur to him that he was trespassing upon her privacy  she was a stranger whom he loved because she was lucy blake grown from child to woman  he was concerned with finding himself so that when he faced her again he would know what to do to say  pan had not encountered a great many girls in the years he had ridden the ranges  but he had seen enough to recognize beauty when it was thrust upon him  and lucy had that  as she paced away from him the small gold head the heavy braid of hair the fine build of her not robust yet strong and full answered then and there the wondering query of his admiration  then she turned to pace back  this would be an ordeal for him  she was in trouble and he could not hide there much longer  yet he wanted to watch her to grasp from this agitation fuel for his kindling passion  she had been weeping yet her face was white  indeed she did look older than her seventeen years  closer she came  then pans gaze got as far as her eyes and fixed there unmasked now true to the strife of her soul they betrayed to pan the thing he yearned so to know  not only her love but her revolt  that was enough for him  in a few seconds his feelings underwent a tremendous gamut of change at last to set with the certainty of a mans love for his one woman  this conviction seemed consciously backed by the stern fact of his cool reckless spirit  he was what the cowboys range of that period had made him  perhaps only such a man could cope with the lawless circumstances in which lucy had become enmeshed  by the time she had paced her beat again and was once more approaching his covert he knew what the situation would demand and how he would meet it  but he would listen to lucy to his mother to his father in the hope that they might extricate her from her dilemma  he believed however that only extreme measures would ever free her and her father  pan knew men of the hardman and matthews stripe  he stepped out to confront lucy smiling and cool  howdy lucy he drawled with the cowboy sangfroid she must know well  oh she cried startled and drawing back  then she recovered  but there was a single instant when pan saw her unguarded self expressed in her face  i was hiding behind there he said indicating the trees and bushes  what for  i wanted to see you really without you knowing  well she queried gravely  as i remember little lucy blake she never had any promise of growing soso lovely as you are now  pan dont teasedont flatter me now she implored  reckon i was just stating a fact  lets sit down on the seat there and get acquainted  he put her in the corner of the bench so she would have to face him and he began to talk as if there were no black trouble between them he wanted her to know the story of his life from the time she had seen him last and he had two reasons for this first to bridge that gap in their acquaintance and secondly to let her know what the range had made him  it took him two hours in the telling surely the sweetest hours he had ever spent for he watched her warm to intense interest forget herself live over with him the lonely days and nights on the range and glow radiant at his adventures and pale and trembling over those bloody encounters that were as much a part of his experience as any others  thats my story lucy he said in conclusion  id have come back to you and home long ago if id known  but i was always broke  then there was the talk about me  panhandle smith  so the years sped by its over now and ive found you and my people all well thank god nothing else mattered to me  and your trouble and dads bad luck do not scare me  now tell me your story  he had reached her  it had been wise for him to go back to the school days and spare nothing of his experience  she began at the time she saw him lastshe remembered the day the date the clothes he wore the horse he rodeand she told the story of those lonely years when his few letters were epochs and the effect it had when they ceased so with simple directness she went on to relate the downfall of her father and how the disgrace and heartbreak had killed her mother  when she finished her story she was crying  lucy dont cry  just thinkhere we are he exclaimed as she ended  thats whatmakes me cry she replied brokenly  very well  here  cry on my shoulder he said forcefully and despite her resistance he drew her into his arms and her head to his breast  there he held her feeling the strain of her muscles slowly relax  she did not weep violently but in a heartbroken way that yet seemed relief  pan this isis foolish she said presently stirring  i mean my crying here in your arms as if it were a refuge  but oh  ii have needed someonesomething so terribly  i dont see where its foolish  reckon its very sweet and wonderful for me  lucy lets not rush right into arguments  were bound to disagree  but lets put that off  im so darned glad to see you know you that im the foolish one  youre a boy for all your size  how can we help but talk of my troubles   of this horrible fix im in   how can i lay my head on your shoulder   i didnt  you forced me to  well if you want to deny me such happiness you can replied pan  is it happiness for youknowing its wrongand can never be again she whispered  pure heaven he said  lucy dont say this is wrong  you belong to me  my mother told me once youd never have lived but for me  yes my mother told me the same thing  oh how sad it is  sad nothing  it was beautiful  and i tell you that you do belong to me  my soul does yes she returned dreamily  and then as if reminded of her bodily weakness she moved away from him to the corner of the bench  all right lucy  have it your way now  but youll only have all the more to make up to me later said pan with resigned good nature  pan you dont seem to recognize anything but your own will she returned pondering  ive got to save my father  theres only one way  dont talk such rot to me he flashed sharply  id hoped you would let us get acquainted first  but if you wont all right  youve been frightened into a deal that is terrible for you  no wonder  but youre only a kid yet  what do you know of men  these hardmans are crooked  they pulled out of texas because they were crooked matthews magistrate or marshal whatever he calls himself hes crooked too  i know such men  ive met a hundred of them  slowly theyve been forced farther west beyond the rockies  and here they work their will  but it cant last  why lucy im amazed that some miner or cowboy or gunfighter hasnt stopped them long ago  pan you must be wrong she declared earnestly  hardman cheated dad yes  but that was only dads fault  his blindness in business hardman is a power here  and matthews too  you talk like aa wild cowboy  sure replied pan with a grim laugh  and itll take just a wild cowboy to clean up this mess  now lucy dont go white and sick  i promise you ill listen to dad and you before i make a move  ill go to see your father  and ill call on hardman  ill talk sense and reason and business to these men  i know itll not amount to beans but ill do it just to show you i can be deliberate and sane  thank youyou frightened me so she murmured  pan there was something terrible about youthen  listen lucy he began more seriously  ive been here in marco only a few hours  but this country is no place for us to settle down to live  its mostly a mining country  ive heard a lot about arizona  im going to take you all down there  dad and mother will love the idea  ill get your father out of jail  pan are you dreaming she interrupted in distress  dad is a rustler  he admits it  back in texas he can be jailed for years  all hardman has to do is to send for officers to come take dad  and ive got to marry dick hardman to save him  you poor little girl   now lucy let me tell you something funny this will stagger you  because its gospel truth i swear  rustler you call your dad  whats that  it means a cowman who has appropriated cattle not his own  he has driven off unbranded stock and branded it  theres no difference  lucy my dad rustled cattle  so have all the ranchers i ever rode for  pan she gasped with dilating eyes  what are you saying  im trying to tell you one of the queer facts about the ranges replied pan  ive known cowmen to shoot rustlers  cowmen who had themselves branded cattle not their own  this was a practice  they didnt think it crooked  they all did it  but it was crooked when you come down to truth  and though that may not be legally as criminal as the stealing of branded cattle to my mind it is just as bad  your father began that way hardman caught him and perhaps forced him into worse practice  pan are you trying to give me some hope  reckon i am  things are not so bad  my lord suppose id been a month later  lucy shook her head despondently  its worse now for me than if you had come  why interrupted pan  she would say the things that hurt  because to see yoube with you like thisbefore imif i have to be marriedis perfectly terrible  afterward when it would be too late and i had lost somethingselfrespect or morethen i might not care  that not only made pan lose patience but it also angered him  the hot blood rushed to his face  he bit his tongue and struggled to control himself  lucy  havent i told you that youre not going to marry dick hardman he burst out  oh but ill have to she replied stubbornly with a sad little shake of her head  no  i must save dad  you might indeed get him out of jail some way  but that would not save him  certainly it would rejoined pan curtly  in another state he would be perfectly safe  theyll trail him anywhere  no that wont do  we havent time dick is pressing me hard to marry him at once or his father will prosecute dad  i promised  and todaythis morningdick is coming here to get me to set the day  what cried pan passionately  his word swift as a bullet made her jump but she repeated what she had said almost word for word  and your answer queried pan in hot scorn  sooner thebetter she replied mournfully  i cant standthisyouoh anything would beeasier than your hope  yourlove making  lucy blake have you gone down hill like your father asked pan hoarsely  what kind of a woman are you  if you love me its a crime to marry him  women do these things i knowsell themselves  but they kill their souls  if you could save your father from being hanged it would still be wrong  suppose he did go to jail for a few years  whats that compared to hell for you all your life  youre out of your head  youve lost your sense of proportion  you must care for this damned skunk dick hardman  care for him she cried shamefaced and furious  i hate him  then if you marry him youll be crooked  to yourself  to me why in my eyes youd be worse than that little hussy down at the yellow mine  pan she whispered  how can you  how dare you  hard facts deserve hard names  you make me say such things  why youd drive me mad if i listenedif i believed you  dont you dare say again youll marry dick  i willi must  lucy he thundered  it was no use to reason with this girl  she had been trapped like a wild thing and could not see any way out  he shot out a strong hand and clutched her shoulder and with one heave he drew her to him so her face was under his  it went pale  the telltale eyes dilated in sudden fear  she beat at him with weak fluttering hands  say you love me  he shook her roughly then held her tight  i dont maul any other mans woman he went on fiercely  but if you love methats different  you said it a little while ago  was it true  are you a liar  nonopan she whispered in distress  ii do  do what  ii love you she said the scarlet blood mounting to her pale face she was weakeningsinking toward him  her eyes held a sort of dark spell  how do you love me he queried relentlessly with his heart mounting high  always ive loved yousince i was a baby  as a brother  yes  but were man and woman now  this is my one chance for happiness  i dont want youi wouldnt have you unless you love me as i do you  be honest with me  be square  do you love me now as i do you  god help meyes she replied almost inaudibly with eyes of remorse and love and agony on his  pan could not withstand this  he crushed her to him and lifted her arms round his neck and fell to kissing her with all the starved hunger of his lonely loveless years on the ranges  she was not proof against this  it lifted her out of her weakness of her abasement to a response that swept away all fears doubts troubles  for the moment at least love conquered her  pan was wrenched out of the ecstasy of that moment by the pound of hoofs and the crashing of brush  he could not disengage himself before a horse and rider were upon them  nevertheless pan recognized the intruder and leaped away from the bench with the instinctive swiftness for defense that had been ingrained in him  dick hardman showed the most abject astonishment  his eyes stuck out his jaw dropped  no other emotion seemed yet to have dawned in him he stared from lucy to pan and back again  a slow dull red began to creep into his cheeks  he ejaculated something incoherent  his amaze swiftly grew into horror  he had caught his fiancée in the arms of another man  black fury suddenly possessed him  youyou he yelled stridently moving to dismount  stay on your horse commanded pan  who the hell are you bellowed hardman sliding back in the saddle  howdy skunk hardman rejoined pan with cool impudence  reckon you ought to know me  pan smith gasped the other hoarsely and he turned lividly white by god i knew you last night  but i couldnt place you  well mr dick hardman i knew you the instant i set eyes on yousitting there gamblingwith the pretty barearmed girl on your chair returned pan with slow deliberate sarcasm  yes and you got that little  over to you about as quick shouted hardman  be careful of your language  theres a lady present replied pan menacingly  of all the nerve  youyou damned cowpuncher raved hardman in a fury  it didnt take you long to get to her either did it  now you make tracks out of here or illillitll be the worse for you pan smith  lucy blake is as good as married to me  nope youre wrong dick snapped pan insolently  i got here just in time to save her from that doubtful honor  youd break her engagement to me rasped hardman huskily and he actually shook in his saddle  i have broken it  lucy tell me he lies begged hardman turning to her in poignant distress  if he had any good in him it showed then  lucy came out from the shade of the tree into the sunlight  she was pale but composed  dick its true she said steadily  ive broken my word  i cant marry you  i love pan  ive loved him always  it would be a sin to marry you now  hellsfire shrieked hardman  his face grew frightful to seebeastly with rage  youre as bad as that hussy who threw me down for him  ill fix you lucy blake  and ill put your cowthief father behind the bars for life  pan leaped at hardman and struck him a body blow that sent him tumbling out of his saddle to thud on the ground  the frightened horse ran down the path toward the gate  you dirtymouthed cur said pan  get up and if youve got a gunthrow it  hardman laboriously got to his feet  the breath had been partly knocked out of him  baleful eyes rolled at pan  instinctive wrath however had been given a setback  hardman had been forced to think of something beside the frustration of his imperious will  imnotpackingmy gun he panted heavily  you sawthatpan smith  well youd better pack it after this replied pan with contempt because im liable to throw on you at sight  ill haveyourunout of this country replied dick huskily  bah dont waste your breath  run me out of this country  me reckon you never heard of panhandle smith  youre so thickheaded you couldnt take a hunch  well ill give you one anyway  you and your crooked father and your two bit of a sheriff pardner would do well to leave this country  savvy that  now get out of here pronto  hardman gave pan a ghastly stare and wheeled away to stride down the path  once he turned to flash his convulsed face at lucy  then he passed out of sight among the trees in search of his horse  pan stood gazing down the green aisle  he had acted true to himself how impossible to meet this situation in any other way  it meant the spilling of blood  he knew itaccepted itand made no attempt to change the cold passion deep within him  lucyhis mother and father would suffer  but wouldnt they suffer more if he did not confront this conflict as his hard training dictated  he was almost afraid to turn and look at lucy  just a little while before he had promised her forbearance  so his amaze was great when she faced him violet eyes ablaze to clasp him and creep close to him with lingering traces of fear giving way to womans admiration and love  panhandle smith she whispered gazing up into his face  i heard your story  it thrilled me  but i never understoodtill you faced dick hardman  oh what have you done for me   oh pan you have saved me from ruin     chapter eight  pan and lucy did not realize the passing of time until they were called to dinner  as they stepped upon the little porch lucy tried to withdraw her hand from pans but did not succeed  see here said he very seriously yielding to an urge he could not resist  wouldnt it be wise for us toto get married at once  lucy blushed furiously  pan smith  are you crazy  reckon i am he replied ruefully  but i got to thinking how ill be out after wild horses  and im afraid something might happen please marry me this afternoon  pan  youreyoure terrible cried lucy and snatching away her hand scarlet of face she rushed into the house ahead of him  he followed to find lucy gone  his father was smiling and his mother had wideopen hopeful eyes  a slim young girl with freckles grave sweet eyes and curly hair was standing by a window  she turned and devoured him with those shy eyes  from that look he knew who she was  alice  little sister he exclaimed meeting her  well by golly this is great  it did not take long for pan to grasp that a subtle change had come over his mother and father  not the excitement of his presence nor the wonder about lucy accounted for it but a difference a lessening of strain a relief  pan sensed a reliance upon him that they were not yet conscious of  son what was the matter with lucy inquired his father shrewdly  why nothing to speak of replied pan nonchalantly  reckon she was a little flustered because i wanted her to marry me this afternoon  good gracious cried his mother  you are a cowboy  lucy marry you when shes engaged to another man  mother dear thats broken off  dont remind me of it  i want to look pleasant so youll all be glad im home  glad his mother laughed with a catch in her voice  my prayers have been answered  come now to dinner  remember pan when you used to yell come an get it before i throw it out  bobby left pans knee and made a beeline for the kitchen  alice raced after him  pan i met dick hardman on the road  he looked like hell and was sure punishin his horse  i said when i seen him id bet hes run into pan  how about it  reckon he did laughed pan  it was pretty tough on him im bound to admit  he rode down the path and caught mewell the truth is dad i was kissing the young lady he imagined belonged to him  you range ridin sonofagun ejaculated his father in unmitigated admiration and gladness  what come off  ill tell you after dinner  gee i smell applesauce   dad i never forgot mothers cooking  they went into the little whitewashed kitchen where pan had to stoop to avoid the ceiling and took seats at the table  pan feasted his eyes  his mother had not been idle during the hours that he was out in the orchard with lucy nor had she forgotten the things that he had always liked  alice acted as waitress and bobby sat in a high chair beaming upon pan  at that juncture lucy came in  she had changed her gray blouse to one of white with wide collar that was cut a little low and showed the golden contour of her superb neck  she had put her hair up  pan could not take his eyes off her  in hers he saw a dancing subdued light and a beautiful rose color in her cheeks  well ive got to eat said pan as if by way of explanation and excuse for removing his gaze from this radiant picture  thus his home coming proved to be a happier event than he had ever dared to hope for  lucy was quiet and ate but little  at times pan caught her stealing a glimpse at him and each time she blushed  she could not meet his eyes again  alice too stole shy glances at him wondering loving  bobby was hungry but he did not forget that pan sat across from him  mrs smith watched pan with an expression that would have pained him had he allowed remorse to come back then  and his father was funny  he tried to be natural to meet pan on a plane of the old western insouciance but it was impossible  no doubt such happiness had not reigned in that household for years   dad lets go out and have a talk proposed pan after dinner  as they walked down toward the corrals pans father was silent yet it was clear he labored with suppressed feeling  all right fire away he burst out at last but first tell me for gawds sake howd you do it  what queried pan looking round from his survey of the farm land  mother  shes well  she wasnt well at all exclaimed the older man breathing hard  an that girl  did you ever see such eyes  reckon i never did replied pan with joyous bluntness  this mornin i left lucy crushed  her eyes were like lead  an now  pan im thankin god for them  but tell me howd you do it  dad i dont know women very well but i reckon they live by their hearts  you can bet that happiness for them means a lot to me  i felt pretty low down  thats gone  i could crow like bobby  but dad ive a big job on my hands and i think im equal to it  are you going to oppose me  hell no spat out his father losing his pipe in his vehemence son i lost my cattle my ranch  an then my nerve  im not makin excuses  i just fell down  but im not too old to make another start with you to steer me  good replied pan with strong feeling and he laid a hand on his fathers shoulder  they halted by the open corral  then lets get right down to straight poker  play your game pan  im sure curious  first off thenwe dont want to settle in this country  pan youve called me right on the first hand declared his father cracking his fist on the corral gate  i know thiss no country for the smiths  but i followed jard hardman here i hoped to  never mind explanations dad interrupted pan  were looking to the future  we wont settle here  well go to arizona  i had a pard who came from arizona  all day long and half the night that broncho buster would rave about arizona  well he won me over  arizona must be wonderful  but pan isnt it desert country  arizona is every kind of country replied pan earnestly  its a big territory dad  pretty wild yet too but not like these mining claim countries with their yellow mines  arizona is getting settlers in the valleys where theres water and grass  lots of fine pine timber that will be valuable some day  i know just where well strike for  but we neednt waste time talking about that now  if it suits you the thing is settled  we go to arizona  fine pan said his father rubbing his hands  pan had struck fire from him  when will we go  thats to decide answered pan thoughtfully  ive got some money not much  but we could get there and start on it  i believe though that wed do better to stay herethis fall anywayand round up a bunch of these wild horses  five hundred horses a thousand at twelve dollars a headwhy dad it would start us in a big way  son i should smile it would returned smith with fiery enthusiasm but can you do it  dad if these broomies are as thick as i hear they are i sure can make a stake  last night i fell in with two cowboysblinky moran and gus hans  theyre chasing wild horses and want me to throw in with them now with you and maybe a couple of more riders we can make a big drive youve got to know the tricks  i learned a heap from a mormon wildhorse wrangler  if these broomtails are thick herewell i dont want to set your hopes too high  but wait till i show you  pan theres ten thousand wild horses in that one valley across the mountain there  hot springs valley they call it  then by george weve got to take the risk declared pan decisively  risk of what  trouble with that hardman outfit  it cant be avoided  id have to bluff them out or fight them down right off  dick is a yellow skunk jard hardman is a bad man in any pinch  but not on an even break  i dont mean that  if that were all  but hes treacherous  and his henchman this two bit of a sheriff hes no man to face you on the square  ill swear he can be bluffed  has he any reputation as a gun thrower  matthews  i never heard of it if he had  but he brags a lot  hes been in several fracases here with drunken miners an mexicans  hes killed a couple of men since ive been here  ahhuh just what i thought declared pan in cool contempt  ill bet a hundred he elected himself town marshal as he calls it  ill bet he hasnt any law papers from the territory or government either  jard hardman will be the hard nut to crack  now dad back in littleton i learned what he did to you  and lucys story gave me another angle on that  its pretty hard to overlook  im not swearing i can do so  but id like to know how you feel about it  son id be scared to tell you replied smith in husky voice dropping his head  you neednt dad  well stay here till we catch and sell a bunch of horses said pan curtly  can you quit your job at the wagon shop  any timean lord wont i be glad to do it returned smith fervently  well you quit just then remarked pan dryly  so much is settled  dad ive got to get jim blake out of that jail  i reckon so  it might be a job an then again it mightnt  depends on jim  an between you an me pan ive no confidence in jim  that doesnt make any difference  ive got to get him out and send him away  head him for arizona where were going  is it a real jail  dobe mud an stones replied his father  an indian or a real man could break out of there any night  there are three guards who change off every eight hours  one of them is a tough customer  names hill he used to be an outlaw  the other two are lazy loafers round town  anybody but jim in just now  i dont know  matthews jailed a woman not long ago  he arrests somebody every day or so  where is this calaboose belonging to mr matthews  you passed it on the way out pan  off the road  gray flat buildin lets see  its the third place from the wagon shop same side  all right dad said pan with cheerful finality  lets go back to the house and talk arizona to lucy and mother for a little  then ill rustle along toward town  tomorrow you come over to the boys camp its on the other side of town in a cedar flat up that slope  weve got horses to try out and saddles to buy     chapter nine  as pan strode back along the road toward marco the whole world seemed to have changed  for a few moments he indulged his old joy in range and mountain stretching rising on his right away into the purple distance something had heightened its beauty  how softly gray the rolling range landhow black the timbered slopes  the town before him sat like a hideous blotch on a fair landscape  it forced his gaze over and beyond toward the west where the late afternoon sun had begun to mellow and redden edging the clouds with exquisite light  to the southward lay arizona land of painted mesas and storied canyon walls of thundering streams and wild pine forests of purplesaged valleys and grassy parks set like mosaics between the stark desert mountains  but his mind soon reverted to the business at hand  it was much to his liking  many a time he had gone to extremes reckless and fun loving in the interest of some cowboy who had gotten into durance vile  it was the way of his class  a few were strong and many were weak but all of them held a constancy of purpose as to their calling  as they hated wire fences so they hated notorietyseeking sheriffs and unlicensed jails  no doubt jard hardman who backed the yellow mine was also behind the jail  at least matthews pocketed the illgotten gains from offenders of the peace as constituted by himself  pan felt that now for the first time in his life he had a mighty incentive something tremendous and calling to bring out that spirit of fire common to the daredevils of the range  he had touched only the last fringe of the cowboy regime  dodge and abilene the old chisholm trail the harddrinking hardshooting days of an earlier cimarron had gone  life then had been but the chance of a card the wink of an eye the flip of a quirt  but pan had ridden and slept with men who had seen those days  he had absorbed from them and to him had come a later period not comparable in any sense yet rough free untamed and still bloody  he knew how to play his cards against such men as these the more boldly he faced them the more menacingly he went out of his way to meet them the greater would be his advantage  if matthews were another hickok the situation would have been vastly different  if there were any real fighting men on hardmans side pan would recognize them in a single glance  he was an unknown quantity to them that most irritating of newcomers to a wild place the man with a name preceding him  pan came abreast of the building that he was seeking  it was part stone and part adobe heavily and crudely built with no windows on the side facing him  approaching it and turning the corner he saw a widearched door leading into a small stonefloored room  he heard voices  in a couple of long strides pan crossed the flat threshold two men were playing cards with a greasy deck a bottle of liquor and small glasses on the table between them  the one whose back was turned to pan did not see him but the other man jerked up from his bench then sagged back with strangely altering expression  he was young dark coarse and he had a bullet hole in his chin  pans recognition did not lag behind the others  this was handy mac new late of montana a cowboy who had drifted beyond the pale  he was one of that innumerable band whom pan had helped in some way or other handy had become a horse thief and a suspected murderer in the year following pans acquaintance with him  howdy men pan greeted them giving no sign that he had recognized mac new  which one of you is on guard here  me replied mac new choking over the word  slowly he got to his feet  youve got a prisoner in there named blake went on pan  i once lived near him  he used to play horse with me and ride me on his back will you let me talk to him  why shore stranger replied mac new with nervous haste and producing a key he inserted it in the lock of a heavy whitewashed door  pan found himself ushered into a large room with small ironbarred windows on the west side  his experience of frontier jails had been limited but those he had seen had been bare empty squalid cells this however was evidently a luxurious kind of a prison house  there were indian blankets and rugs on the floor an open fireplace with cheerful blaze a table littered with books and papers a washstand a comfortable bed upon which reclined a man smoking and reading  somebody to see you blake called the guard and he went out shutting the door behind him  blake sat up  as he did so moving his bootless feet pans keen eye espied a bottle on the floor  pan approached leisurely his swift thoughts revolving around a situation that looked peculiar to him  blake was very much better cared for there than could have been expected  why  howdy blake  do you remember me asked pan halting beside the table  he did not in the least remember lucys father in this heavy blond man lax of body and sodden of face  somethin familiar aboot you replied blake studying pan intently but i reckon youve got the best of me  pan smith said pan shortly  wal he ejaculated as if shocked into memory and slowly he rose to hold out a shaking hand  bills kidthe little boy who stuck by my wifewhen lucy was born  same boy and hes damn sorry to find you in this fix responded pan forcefully  and hes here to get you out  blake sagged back as slowly as he had arisen  his face changed like that of a man suddenly stabbed  and he dropped his head  in that moment pan saw enough to make him glad  manifestly the good in him had not been wholly killed by evil  jim blake might yet be reclaimed or at least led away from evil life  mr blake ive been to see lucy went on pan and swiftly he talked of the girl her unhappiness and the faith she still held in her father  ive come to get you out of here for lucys sake  were all going to arizona  you and dad can make a new start in life  my god if i only could groaned the man  pan reached out with quick hand and shook him  listen he said low and eagerly  how long is this guard mac new on duty  mac new  the fellow outside is called hurd  hes on till midnight  all right my mistake went on pan swiftly  ill be here tonight about eleven  ill have a horse for you blanket grub gun and money  ill hold up this guard hurdget you out some way or other youre to ride away  take the road south  there are other mining camps  youll not be followed  make for siccane arizona  siccane arizona echoed blake as a man in a dream of freedom  yes siccane  dont forget it  stay there till we all come  pan straightened up with deep expulsion of breath and tingling nerves  he had reached blake  whatever his doubts of the man and they had been many pan divined that he could stir him rouse him out of the lethargy of sordid indifference and forgetfulness  he would free him from this jail and the shackles of hardman in any case but to find that it was possible to influence him gladdened pans heart what would this not mean to lucy  the door opened behind pan  wal stranger reckon yore times up called the jailer  pan gave the stunned blake a meaning look and then without a word he left the room  the guard closed and locked the door  then he looked up with cunning yet not wholly without pleasure  his companion at the card game had gone  panhandle smith whispered the guard half stretching out his hand then withdrawing it  shake mac said pan in a low voice  its a small world  by gord it shore is replied mac new wringing pans hand  im known here as hurd  ahhuh  well hurd im not a talking man  but i want to remind you that you owe me a good turn  you shore dont have to remind me of thet returned the other  it pays to do good turns  im lucky old timer  i savvy panhandle smith said hurd with gleaming eyes and he crooked a stubby thumb toward the door of blakes jail  all right cowboy returned pan with a meaning smile  ill drop around tonight about eleven   pan slowed up in his stride when he reached the business section of the town and strolled along as if he were looking for someone  he was he meant to have eyes in the back of his head henceforth  but he did not meet anyone he knew or see anyone who glanced twice at him  he went into blacks general merchandise store to look at the saddle moran had recommended  it was a bargain and pan purchased it on sight proof indeed was this that there were not many cowboys in and around marco  while he was there pan bought a winchester carbine and a saddle sheath for it  thus burdened he walked out to the camp  lying juan had supper about ready and the boys were noisy up at the corral  some of their language was indicative of trouble and mean horses  pan found a seat by the fire very welcome  emotion had power to exhaust him far beyond physical exertion  darkness had just about merged from dusk when the boys dragged themselves in smelling of dust and horses  they went into the water basins like ducks  pan lighted the lantern and put it on the table  then the boys came straddling the bench like cowboys mounting horses  their faces were red and shiny their wet hair was pasted down  wal if heah aint ole pan smith announced blinky vociferously gus take a peep at him  ill bet hes got hold of a grand hoss nothing else could make him look like thet  no  i just got back my girl replied pan gaily  gurl  say cowboy began blinky in consternation  you didnt run foul of thet little yellow mine kid  eat your supper you hungrylooking galoot replied pan  and you too gus  because if i begin to shoot off my chin now youll forget the grub  thus admonished and with curious glances at pan the cowboys took his advice and attacked the generous meal juan had set before them  their appetites further attested to a strenuous day  pan did not seem to be hungry which fact caused juan much concern  ahuh  its the way a fellar gets when hes in love with a gurl observed the keen blinky  i been there  after supper they got together before the stove and rolled their cigarettes  the cold night wind with its tang of mountain heights made the fire most agreeable  pan spread his palms to the heat  wal pard throw it off your chest before you bust advised blinky shrewdly  what kind of a day did you boys have countered pan with a laugh  good an bad replied gus while blinky shook his head  some hoss thieves have been runnin off our stock  we had some fine hosses not broke yet  some we wanted to keep  whats the good news queried pan as hans hesitated   pan ill be doggoned if we didnt see a million broomies today burst out blinky  no  now blink talk sense remonstrated pan  you mean you saw a thousand  wal shore a million is stretchin it some acknowledged the cowboy but ten thousand wouldnt be nothin  we tracked some of our hosses twenty miles an more over heah farthern wed been yet  an climbed a high ridge we looked down into the purtiest valley i ever seen twice as big as hot springs valley  gee it lay there gray an green with hosses as thick as greasewood bushes on the desert  thet valley hasnt been drove yet  its purty rough gettin up to where you can see  an theres lots of hosses closer to town  thet accounts  blinky is this talk of yours a leaf out of lying juans book asked pan incredulously  its too good to be true  pan ill swear it on a stack of bibles protested blinky  ask gus he seen them  for onct blinky aint out of his haid corroborated hans  never saw so many wild hosses  an if we can find a way to ketch some of them well be rich  boys you told me youd been trapping horses at the water holes said pan  shore weve been moonshinin them replied blinky  we build a corral round a water hole  make a wide gate we can shut quick  then we lay out on moonlight nights waitin for em to come in to drink weve done purty darn good at it too  thats fun but its a twobit way to catch wild horses rejoined pan  wal theyre all doin it thet way  hardmans outfit an a couple more besides us  i figgered myself it was purty slow but no better way come to me  do you know one  do i  well i should smile  i know more than one thatll beat your moonshining  back on the prairie where its all wide and bare theres no chance for a small outfit  but this is high country valleys canyons cedars  boys we can make one big stake before the other outfits get on to us  by gosh ones enough for us declared blinky  then we can shake this goldclaim country where they steal your empty tin cans an broken shovels  one haul will do me too agreed pan  then arizona for me  ahuh  pan how aboot this gurl  briefly then pan told his story and the situation as it looked to him at the moment  the response of these cowboys was what he had expected he knew them  warmhearted simple elemental they responded in different ways but with the same fire  gus hans looked his championship while blinky raved and swore  then youre both with me asked pan tersely  mind its no fair deal my getting your support here for helping you with a wild horse drive  fair hell returned blinky forcibly  it aint like you to insult cowboys  im begging your pardon replied pan hastily  but wed never been pardners and i hesitated to draw you into a scrap thatll almost sure go to gun throwing  wal were your pardners now an damn proud of it panhandle smith  silently and grimly they all shook hands on it  not half a dozen times in his range life had pan been party to a compact like that  this blake fellar now began blinky as he lighted another cigarette  whats your idea of gettin him out  i want a horse a blanket some grub and a gun  im to take them down to the jail at eleven oclock  huh  goin to hold up the guard queried blinky  that was my intention replied pan but i know that fellow hurd wholl be on guard then  ill not have to hold him up  hurd  i know him  hard nut but i think hes square  reckon hurd will lose his job said pan reflectively  if he does lets take him with us on the wild horse deal  suits me  an hell shore love thet job  hurd hasnt any use for matthews  blinky do you know another man we can hire or get to throw in with us  weve got five now counting my dad and well need at least six  why so many  itll cut out profits  no itll increase them  one good rider means a great deal to us  then lets get thet miner charley brown  but hes working a gold claim  wal if i know anythin hell not be workin it any longer than findin blue dirt  gus an me seen jard hardman with two men ridin out thet way this mawnin  ah  so hardman is here nowwell hunt up brown and see what he says  suppose we walk downtown now  all right but let me get a hoss up for blake replied blinky  gus you find thet old saddle of mine an a blanket  theres an old canvas saddlebag an water bottle heah somewheres  ask juan  an get him to pack the grub   the night of the sabbath was no barrier to the habitués of the yellow mine  but early in the evening it was not yet in full swing  the dance was on with a few heavyfooted miners and their gaudy partners and several of the gambling tables were surrounded  pan stalked about alone  his newfound cowboy friends had been instructed to follow him unobtrusively  pan did not wish to give an impression that he had taken up with allies  he was looking for charley brown but he had a keen roving eye for every man in sight  it was doubtful if hardman or matthews could have espied pan first unless they were hidden somewhere  he took up a position presently behind one of the poker games with his back to the wall so that he had command of the room  a stiff game was in progress which pan watched casually  blinky and gus lounged around with apparently no more aim than other idle drinking visitors of the place  gradually more men came in the gaming tables filled up and the whitearmed girls appeared to mingle with the guests  pan espied the girl louise before she had become aware of his presence she appeared to be more decently clad a circumstance that greatly added to her charm in his opinion  curiously he studied her  women represented more to pan than to most men he had had opportunity to meet or observe  he never forgot that they belonged to the same sex as his mother  so it was natural he had compassion for this unsexed dancehall gamblinglure girl  she was pretty in a wild sort of way dissolute abandoned yet not in any sense weak  a terrible havoc showed in her face for anyone with eyes to see beneath the surface pan noted a strange restlessness in her that at first he imagined was the seeking instinct of women of her class  but it was only that she could not sit or stand still  her hawklike eyes did not miss anyone there and finally they located him  she came around the tables up to pan and took hold of his arm  howdy handsome she said smiling up at him  pan doffed his sombrero and bade her good evening  dont do that she said  it irritates me  but louise i cant break a habit just to please you he replied smiling  you could stay out of here  didnt i warn you not to come back  yes but i thought you were only fooling  besides i had to come  why  you dont fit here  youve got too clean a look  pan gazed down at her feeling in her words and presence something that prompted him to more than kindliness and good nature  louise i can return the compliment  you dont fit here  damn you she flashed  ill fall in love with you  well if you did id sure drag you out of this hell replied pan bluntly  come away from these gamblers she demanded and drew him from behind the circle to seats at an empty table  i wont ask you to drink or dance  but im curious  ive been hearing about you  that so  who told you  i overheard dick hardman tonight just before supper  he has a room next to mine in the hotel here when he stays in town  he was telling his father about you  such cussing i never heard  im giving you a hunch  theyll do away with you  thanks  reckon its pretty fine of you to put me on my guard  i only meant behind your backwhat has dick against you  we were kids together back in texas  just natural rivals and enemies but i hadnt seen him for years till last night  then he didnt know me  he knows you now all right  he ran into you today  i reckon he did replied pan with a grim laugh  panhandle this is getting sort of warm she said leaning across the table to him  im not prying into your affairs  but i could be your friend  god knows i like a man  thats the second compliment youve paid me tonight  whatre you up to louise  see here cowboy when i pay any twolegged hombre compliments you can gamble they are sincere  all right no offense meant  do you resent my curiosity  no  ive got you figured right when i say youre in trouble  youre looking for someone  yes  i knew it she retorted snapping her fingers  and thats hardman and his outfit   i didnt hear all dick said  when he talked loud he cussed  but i heard enough to tie up panhandle smith with this girl lucy and the hardman outfit  pan eyed her steadily  she was encroaching upon sacred ground  but her feeling was genuine and undoubtedly she had some connection with a situation which began to look complex  the same instinct that operated so often with pan in his relation to men of the open now subtly prompted him  regardless of circumstances he knew when to grasp an opportunity  louise you show that youd risk taking a chance on mea stranger he replied with quick decision  i return that compliment  the smile she gave him was really a reward  it gave him a glimpse of the depths of her  whos this girl lucy she queried  shes my sweetheart ever since we were kids returned pan with emotion  i went to riding the ranges and well like so many cowboys i didnt go back home  when i did go lucy was gone my family was gone  i trailed them hereto find that dick hardman was about to force lucy to marry him  the    she burst out  then after her excitement cooled howd he aim to force her  quickly pan explained the situation as related to jim blake  aha  easy to savvy  thats where jard hardman and matthews come in  panhandle theyre a dirty outfitand the dirtiest of them is dick hardman  whats he to you louise inquired pan gravely  youll excuse me if i say i cant see you in love with him  in love with dick hardman she whispered hotly  my god  i wouldnt soil even my hands on himif i didnt have to  he met me in frisco  he brought me to this damned stinking rough hole  he made me promises he never kept  not to marry me  dont get the wrong hunch  he has doublecrossed me  and i had to sink to this drunk  yes sure i was drunk  dont you understand i have to be drunk to stand this life  im not drunk now because you got here early something deep must be behind my meeting you panhandle smith  i hope to heaven it will be to your goodas i know meeting you will be to mine replied pan fervently  were off the track she broke in and pan imagined he saw a deeper red under her artificial color  i despise dick hardman  hes stingy conceited selfish  hes low down and hes sinking to worse  his father ruined mine pan told her  thats what brought dad out hereto try to get something back from jard hardman  no use  he only got another hard deal  that cowboy who was in here with you last nightblinky moran  his claim was jumped by hardman  louise howd you know that asked pan in surprise  dont give me away  blinky told me  hes one of my friends and hes a white man if i ever saw one  he has been in love with me  wanted me to marry him  poor crazy boy  i sure had to fightand get drunkerto keep from more than liking him  he spent all his money on me and i had to make him quit  well that little bowlegged cowboy liar  hes as deep as the sea  keep it secret panhandle she responded seriously  i dont want to hurt his feelings  to get back to the hardmans  theyve taken strong hold here  the old man owns half of marco  hes in everything but its my hunch im giving youthat hes in the straight deals only to cover the crooked ones  thats where the money is  yet jard hardman will not square up with dad exclaimed pan  now tell me why you come into the yellow mine  is it to court trouble  youre taking an awful chance  every night or so some tipsy miner gets robbed or knifed or shot  louise in dealing with men of really dangerous quality your only chance is to face them with precisely the same thing  as for the fourflushers like matthews and men of the hardman stamp the one thing they cant stand is nerve  they havent got it  they dont understand it  they fear it  it works on their consciousness  they begin to figure on what the nervy man means to do before they do anything if i did not show myself in the street and here the hardman outfit would soon run true to their deals  so by appearing to invite and seek a fight i really avoid one  so thats why they call you panhandle smith queried the girl meditatively  i mean with the tone old man hardman used  they call me angel  but that doesnt mean what it sounds does it  i cant figure you louise replied pan dubiously  im glad you cant  hello theres blinky and his pard gus whatre they up to  they are looking pretty hard but it cant be for you and me  they saw us long ago  there  hardman and matthews coming from behind the bar  theres a private office in behind  you can see the door  panhandle let me tell you hardman seldom shows up here  pan leisurely got to his feet  his eye quickly caught matthews black sombrero then the big ham of a face with its drooping mustache  pan could not see anyone with him until they got out from behind the crowded bar  then pan perceived that matthews companion was a stout man bearded dressed like a prosperous rancher  louise is that man with matthews the gentleman we have been discussing asked pan  thats the rich fat bloated    replied the girl with eyes like a hawk  you dont talk straight panhandle  im not quite so free as you are with bad language replied pan smiling down on her  then with deft movement he hitched his belt round farther forward on his hip  it was careless it might have been accidental but it was neither  and the girl grasped its meaning  she turned white under her paint and the eyes that searched pan were just then like any other womans  cowboy whatre you going to do she whispered reaching for him  i dont know exactly  you can never tell how actions are going to be taken  but i mean well  stop she called low after him  you smiling devil  pan moved leisurely in among the tables toward the bar and the two men standing rather apart from the crowd  he maneuvered so that matthews roving glance fell upon him  then pan advanced straight  he saw the sheriff start then speak hurriedly to hardman  pan halted within six feet of both men  he might never have seen jard hardman so far as any recognition was concerned  he faced a man of about fifty years of age rather florid of complexion well fed and used to strong drink  excuse me spoke pan with most consummate coolness addressing the shorter man  apparently he did not see matthews  are you jard hardman  reckon i am if thats any of your business came a gruff reply light hard speculative eyes took pan in from head to feet  do you recognize me asked pan in the same tone  no sir i never saw you in my life retorted hardman his bearded chin working up and down with the vehemence of his speech  and he turned away  pan made a step  his long arm shot out and his hand striking hard ml hardmans shoulder whirled him round  my names smith called pan in vibrant loud voice that stilled the room  panhandle smith  i dont know you sir replied hardman aghast and amazed  he began to redden  he turned to matthews as if in wonder that this individual permitted him to be thus affronted  well you knew my dadto his loss declared pan  and thats my business with you  youve no business with me fumed hardman  reckon youre mistaken went on pan slowly and easily  im bill smiths boy  and i mean to have an accounting with you on that texas cattle deal  these deliberate words heard by all within earshot caused little less than a deadlock throughout the room  the bartenders quit the drinkers poised glasses in the air the voices suddenly hushed  pan had an open space behind him a fact he was responsible for  he faced matthews hardman and then the length of the bar  he left the gamblers behind to blinky and gus who stood to one side  pan had invited an argument with the owner of the yellow mine and his sheriff ally  every westerner in the room understood its meaning  you upstart cowpuncher presently shouted hardman  get out of here or ill have you arrested  arrest me  what for  im only asking you for an honest deal  i can prove you cheated my father out of cattle  you cant arrest me for that  hardman guffawed boisterously  get out of here with your insolent talk about cattle deals  i wont get out  you cant put me out even if you do own the place  illill choked hardman his body leaping with rage his face growing purple under his beard  then he turned to matthews  throw this drunken cowboy out  that focused attention upon the sheriff  pan read in matthews eyes the very things he had suspected  and as he relaxed the mental and muscular strain under which he had waited he laughed in matthews face  bah  hardman youre backed by the wrong man  and at last youve run into the wrong man  havent you sense enough to see that  you cheated my father  now youre going to make it good  hardman furious and imperious never grasped the significance that had frozen matthews  he was thick arrogant  he had long been a power wherever he went  yielding to rage he yelled at pan  bill smith sicked his cowpuncher on me hey  like father like son youre a rustler breed  ill drive you  pan leaped like a tiger and struck hardman a terrible blow in the face like something thrown from a catapult he went into the crowd next the bar and despite this barrier and the hands grasping at his flying arms he crashed to the floor  but before he fell pan had leaped back in the same position he had held in front of matthews  he lied cried pan  my dad bill smith was as honest a cattleman as ever lived  mr sheriff do you share that slur cast on him  i dont know bill smith replied matthews hastily  reckon im not talkin agin men i dont know  an as im not armed i cant argue with a gunpackin cowboy  thus he saved his face with the majority of those present  but he did have a gun  pan knew that as well as if he had seen it  matthews was not the even break stripe of sheriff  ahhuh ejaculated pan sardonically  all right  then ill be looking for you to arrest me next time we meet  ill arrest you panhandle smith you can gamble on thet declared matthews harshly  arrest nothing replied pan with ringing scorn  youre a fourflush sheriff  ill gamble you elected yourself  i know your kind matthews  and ill gamble some more that you dont last long in marco  this was as pan deliberately intended raw talk that any man not a coward could not swallow  but matthews was a coward  that appeared patent to all onlookers in their whispers and nodding heads  whatever prestige he had held there in that rough mining community was gone until he came out to face this fiery cowboy with a gun  white and shaking he turned to the group of men who had gotten hardman to his feet  they led him out the open door and matthews followed  pan strode back to the table where louise sat tense and wide eyed  the hum of voices began again the clatter of glasses the clink of coin the incident had passed  well little girl i had them figured didnt i asked pan calling a smile to break his tight cold face  i dontknow whatails me she said breathlessly  i see fights every night  and ive seen men killeddragged out  but this got my nerve  it wasnt much to be excited about  i didnt expect any fight  your idea was to show up hardman and matthews before the crowd  you sure did  the crowd was with you  and so am i panhandle smith  she held out a slim hand  ive got to dance  good night     chapter ten  pans exit from the yellow mine was remarkable for the generous space accorded him by its occupants  outside he laughed a little as he stood under the flare of yellow light and rolled a cigarette  knots of men stood on the corners of the street  but the area in front of the saloon was significantly vacant  now if dad had only been there soliloquized pan  that might have put some life in him  he sauntered down into the street and as he went he heard the jangle of spurs behind him  blinky and gus covering his rear  presently beyond the circle of yellow light they joined him one on each side  wal pan i was shore in on thet said blink gripping pans arm  say you called em flat  made em swaller a hell of a lot added gus with a hard note in his voice  when it come down to hard pan they wasnt there  pan you remember me tellin you aboot purcell who jumped my claim with young hardman queried blinky  wal purcell was there settin some tables back of where you made your stand  i seen him when we first went in  course everybody quit playin cards when you called old hardman  an i made it my particular biz to get close to purcell  he was pullin his gun under the table when i kicked him  an when he looked up he seen somethin you can bet on thet  wal purcell is one man in hardmans outfit well have to kill  gus will back me up on thet  i shore will  purcells a nevada claim jumper accordin to talk somebody hinted he belonged to thet plummer gang thet was cleaned out at bannock years ago  hes no spring chicken thets shore  point purcell out to me the first chance you get replied pan dont figure i expect to bluff everybody  it cant be done  somebody will try me outif only to see what i can do  thats the game you know  hell yes  an all you got to do pan is to be there first  reckon tomorrow will be shore interestin remarked gus  that girl louise gave me a hunch said pan thoughtfully  struck me she was squareblink youve talked to her of course  me   awcouple of times  i reckon  bought her drinks  she wont look at me unless shes drunk replied blink both confused and gloomy  youve got louise figured wrong cowboy returned pan  ill prove it to you sometime  now lets get down to business and plan blakes release from jail  i want to lead the horse round about so i wont be seen by anybody  shore thetll be easy replied blinky  ill go with you  we can keep to the slope a ways an then go down an come up on the other side of town  no roads an no houses  they returned to camp and replenishing the fire sat around it talking of the wildhorse drive  about ten oclock blinky went to the corral saddled a horse and led him back to the tent  there they put on the blanket and saddlebags blinky produced a gun he could spare and then thoughtfully added a small bag of grain for the horse  its darkern the milltail of hades announced blinky an thets good fer this kind of work  ill go ahaid pickin out the way an you lead the hoss  so they set out into the black night working along the base of the slope  no stars showed and the raw wind hinted of rain or snow  the lights of the town shone dimly  keen on the breeze floated the discordant music and revelry from the yellow mine and other like dives in full blast  descending the slope required careful slow work  the incline was steep of soft earth and loose shale  but blinky knew where to feel his way and eventually they reached the flat to find easier progress blinky made a detour and finally as they gradually approached several lamplights far apart he whispered you wait heah  i aint so darn shore which one of them lights comes from the jail  pan waited what seemed a long while  at last he heard steps then made out an object blacker than the black background  found the jail easy but got off comin back  pronto now  must be near eleven  pan kept the dark silent moving form in sight  the dim light grew larger  then the low flat building loomed up faintly in the dense gloom  go ahead whispered blinky  ill hold the hoss  pan went swiftly up to the wall and thence along it to the corner the light came from an open door  he listened  there was no sound luckily hurd was alone  pan slipped round the corner and entered hurd sat at the table in the flare of a lamp turned down low  ha  was waitin fer you an beginnin to worry he said in hoarse whisper  plenty of time if blakes all ready replied pan  im givin you a hunch  hes damn queer fer a fellar who expects to break jail  no matter  lets get at it pronto  hurd got up and laid his gun on the table  then he turned over the bench threw papers on the floor  thars the key an heahs a rope hawgtie me  with that he turned his back  swiftly pan bound him securely and let him down upon the floor  then he unlocked the door opened it  pitch darkness inside and no sound  he called in low voice  blake did not reply  muttering in surprise pan took the lamp and went into the room  he found blake asleep though fully dressed  pan jerked him roughly out of that indifferent slumber  its smith he said bluntly  you sure must want to get out damn you blake this whole deal looks fishy to me  come on  leaving the lamp there pan dragged the man out through the dark entrance room into the night  in another moment they had reached the horse and blinky  heres money and a gun whispered pan swiftly  youll find grub blanket grain on your saddle  get on  pan had to half lift blake upon the horse  he felt of the stirrups  theyre all right  the road is that way about fifty yards  turn to the left and ride remember siccane  blake rode away into the darkness without a word  pan watched and listened  presently he heard the hard clipclop of hoofs on the road making to the left  good  hell ride past where lucys sleeping  i wish she could know muttered pan  was he drunk queried blinky in a hoarse whisper  shore funny fer a sober man  he didnt breathe like he was drunk replied pan  but he flabbergasted me  found him asleep  and he never said a darned word  blink it sticks in my craw  reckon he didnt want to leave that nice warm bed  ahuh  wal lets rustle back to our warm beds said the cowboy gruffly   pan awakened during the latter part of the night  rain was pattering on the tent  the wind moaned  he thought of blake not clad for bad weather and in unfit condition for a long ride facing the storm  even then a vague doubt penetrated his drowsy mind  morning dawned bright and sparkling after the rain  the air was keen and crisp  the cedars glistened as if decked with diamonds  pan felt the sweet scent of the damp dust and it gave him a thrill and a longing for the saddle and the open country  wal reckon this heahll be our busy day drawled blinky after making a hearty breakfast of bacon and flapjacks  pan whats first on the ticket  show me a horse you bowlegged grub destroyer replied pan eagerly  come out to the corral  we got a sorrel as is a real shore enough hoss if you can ride him  there were a dozen or more horses in the corral  pan glancing over them with appraising eye decided the cowboys had not spoken of them with the degree of satisfaction that they really merited  fine string blinky said pan with glistening eyes  is that sorrel the one i cant ride  yep thets him  aint he a real hoss  best of the bunch at first sight  blinky are you sure youre not giving me your own horse  me  i dont care nothin aboot him declared blinky lying glibly shore hes the orfullest pitchin sonofagun i ever forked  but mebbe you can ride him  it developed presently that pan could ride the sorrel and that blinky had done the horse a great injustice  how good to be back in the saddle  pan wanted to ride down at once to show lucy his first mount west of the rockies  indeed he was possessed of a strong yearning desire to hurry to see lucy a feeling that he had to dispel  if all went well he could go to his mothers for dinner  meanwhile he must meet the exigencies here in marco  wal whats next on the ticket queried blinky who appeared to be rather jerky this morning  im going downtown replied pan  ahuh  i want to trail along with you  no ill go alone  ill make my bluff strong blinky or draw matthews out  honest i dont think hell show  thet yellow dawg  he wont face you pan  but hes in thet hardman outfit an one of themmebbe purcellmight take a shot at you from a winder  its been done heah  let me go with you  well if theyre that low down your being with me wouldnt help much replied pan pondering the matter  ill tell you blink  heres how i figure  marco is a pretty big place  its full of men  and western men are much alike anywhere  matthews is no fool  he couldnt risk murdering me in broad daylight from ambush  im not trustin him said blinky somberly  but i admit the chances are he wont do thet  you and gus pack up for the wildhorse drive went on pan briskly we ought to get off in the morning  one of you ride out to see if charley brown will throw in with us  ill see dad at dinner  hell need horse and outfit  it may turn out we can get our jailer friend hurd  wonder if he lost his job  ha  ha  well boys ill know more when i see you again   pan strolled down toward the town  a familiar unpleasant mental strain dominated his consciousness  his slow cool easy nonchalance was all outward  he had done this thing before but that seemed long ago  his father lucy his mother somehow made an immense difference between the cowboy reactions of long ago and this stern duty he had set himself today  he hated what his actions meant what might well ensue from them yet he was glad it was in him to meet the issue in this way of the west  by the time he had reached a point opposite the stage office all reflections had passed out of his mind to give place to something sinister  his alert faculties of observation belied the leisurely manner of his approach to the main street  he was a keenstrung watching listening machine  the lighting and smoking of a cigarette was mechanical pretensehe did not want to smoke  two men stood in front of the stage office  one was smith the agent pan approached them leaned on the hitching rail  but he favored his right side and he faced the street  mornin cowboy smith greeted him not without nervousness  see youre down early to git arrested  howdy smith  can you give me a drink returned pan  sorry but i havent a drop  the other man was an old fellow though evidently he was still active for his boots and clothes showed the stain and wear of mining  tell you cowboy he spoke up dryly you might buy a bottle at the yellow mine  pan made no reply and presently the old man shambled away while smith entered his office  pan kept his vigil there watching waiting  he was seen by dozens of passing men but none of them crossed toward the stage office  down the street straggling pedestrians halted to form little groups  in an hour the business of marco had apparently halted  its citizens the miners who had started to work the teamsters mexicans cowboys who happened upon the street suddenly struck attitudes of curious attention with faces turned toward pan  they too were waiting watching  the porch of the yellow mine was in plain sight standing out on a corner scarcely more than a hundred yards down the street  pan saw hardman and matthews come out of the hotel  they could not fail to observe the quiet the absence of movement the waiting knots of men  this was the climax of strain for pan  leisurely he strolled away from the hitching rail out into the middle of the street and down  the closer groups of watchers vanished  hardman could be seen gesticulating stamping as if in rage and then he went into the hotel leaving matthews standing alone  other men in the background disappeared  the sheriff stood a moment irresolute sagging with his pale hamlike face gleaming  then he wheeled to enter the hotel  he had damned himself  he had refused the even break the mantoman the unwritten edict of westerners  pan saw this evasion with grim relief  the next move was one easier to perform though fraught with great peril  every man in marco now knew that pan had come out to meet the men he had denounced  they had been aware of his intention  they had seen him sauntering down the middle of the street  and they had showed what the west called yellow  but they had not showed their claws if they had any  pan could well have ended his quest then and there  but to follow it up to beard the jackals in their denthat was the last word  as pan proceeded slowly down the middle of the street the little groups of spectators disintegrated and slipped out of sight into the stores and saloons  those farthest from him moved on to halt again  and when any neared the yellow mine they scurried completely out of sight  pan had the main street to himself  for a few moments not a single man showed himself  then they began to reappear behind him out of range slowly following him  at the entrance to the yellow mine pan threw away his cigarette and mounted the steps  he was gambling his life on the code of the westerners  the big halllike saloon was vacant except for the two bartenders behind the bar and a mexican sweeping out the sawdust  pan had heard subdued voices the shuffle of feet the closing of doors every muscle in his body was cramped with tension ready to leap like lightning into action  advancing to the bar he called for a drink  on the house this mawnin replied the nearest bartender smiling he showed a little nervousness with his hands otherwise he was composed and his offer to treat expressed his sentiment  pan took the bottle with his left hand poured out some liquor set the bottle down and lifted the glass  he had his drink  his tension relaxed  sort of quiet this morning he said  reckon it is just now replied the bartender significantly  is this sunday went on pan casually  no  yestiddy was sunday so this must be monday  reckon i might as well move along remarked pan but he did not stir the bartender went on cleaning glasses  sounds of footsteps came from outside  presently pan walked back through the open door then halted a moment to light another cigarette  his back was turned to the bar and the doors  that seemed the climax of his effrontery  it was deliberate the utter recklessness of the cowboy who had been trained in a hard school  but all that happened was the silence breaking to a gay wild sweet voice call again cowboy when theres somebody home  louise had been watching him through some secret peephole  that had been her tribute to him and her scorn of his opponents  it about closed the incident pan concluded  men were now coming along the street in both directions though not yet close  some wag yelled from a distance thar aint no sheriff panhandle  pan retraced his steps up the street finding as before a clear passage  men hailed him from doorways from windows from behind obstructions  he did not need to be told that they were with him marco had been treated to precisely what it wanted  pan was quick to grasp the mood of these residents who had been so keen about his endeavor to draw out hardman and matthews  that hour saw the beginning of the end for these dominant factors in the evil doings of marco what deep gratification it afforded pan  they might thrive for a time but their heyday had passed  matthews would be the laughing stock of the town  he could never retrieve  he had been proclaimed only another in the long list of selfappointed officers of the law  by the time pan got back to camp his mood actually harmonized with his leisurely free and careless movements  still he was hiding something for he wanted to yell  blinky saw him coming and yelled for him  the cowboy was beside himself with a frenzy of delight  it had been hard for him to stay there in camp  he cursed radiantly  hows the pack job  all done queried pan when he could get a word in  pack hell  we plumb forgot replied blinky  what you thinkyouyou  blinky failed to find adequate words to express his sentiments  gus was quiet as usual but he too showed relaxation from a severe ordeal  well lets get at it now suggested pan  ill start you boys on it then ride down to mothers  in the succeeding hour leading to noon what with sundry trips down to the store the trio learned some news that afforded much satisfaction jim blake had assaulted a guard and broken jail  no doubt he must have had outside assistance  according to rumor matthews accused hurd the guard of being party to the escape and had discharged him  sentiment in town was not equally divided  most everybody according to the informers was glad blake had escaped  it developed that the jail was not a civic institution  already there had been talk of the permanent citizens getting together  all this was exceedingly welcome to pan  he could hardly wait till noon to saddle the sorrel to ride over to his mothers  aw cowboy hug thet gurl fer me sang blinky with ecstatic upward gaze  shore shes put the devil in you  an this heah outfit is steppin high  on the way out to the farm halfway beyond the outskirts of town pan met his father rushing up the road  at sight of pan he almost collapsed  justheardthe news he panted as pan reined in the sorrel  what news dad queried pan gazing down with both thrill and anxiety at that haggard face slowly warming out of its havoc  bill dolan an hisboysstopped at the ranch totell me smith wiping his clammy face  they just left town  bill saw you take that walk down main street  well whats that to be all set up about  reckon i was scared wild  bill says to me bill you oughtnt show yellow like thet  you shore dont savvy thet boy of yours   i thought i did son but when it come to a showdown i was chickenhearted  your comin home was a godsend to mother an lucy an more to me  then to think you might get shot right off  wal it was too much for my stomach  dad i bluffed themthats all  i braced them quick and hard before they could figure  it worked and i believe i got most of the town with me  pan is it true that you accused jard hardman of robbin mean you knocked him flat  sure its true  lord but id like to have seen that declared smith vehemently an son you got jim blake out of jail  bill didnt hint you had anythin to do with that  but i knew  it was sure great  if only jim does his part  you doubt that dad  shore do  but ill tell you pan  if we could be with jim all the time we could pull him up  lets hope hes far on the way to siccane by now  does lucy know i hope you didnt tell her about my meeting with hardman and matthews  i didnt  but bill shore did replied his father  reckon i would have squealed though  mother an lucy have a lot more nerve than me fact is though bill didnt give em time to go to pieces  he just busted out with news of blakes escape  say boy you should have seen lucy  i will see her pronto replied pan eagerly  come on  whatre you holding me up for anyhow  pan walked the horse while his father kept pace alongside  some more news i most forgot smith went on  bill told about a shootin scrape out in cedar gulch  them claim jumpers drove a miner named brown off his claim  they had to fight for it  brown said he wounded one of em  they chased him clean to satlees ranch  shore wanted to kill him or scare him off for good  i know brown replied pan  and from what he told me ive a hunch i know the claim jumpers  wal thatd be hard to prove  in the early days of a minin boom theres a lot of trouble  a miner is a crazy fellar often  hell dig a hole then move on to dig another  then if some other prospector comes along to find gold on his last diggins he yells claim jumpin as a matter of fact most of them havent a real claim till they find gold  an all that makes the trouble  ill hunt brown up and persuade him to make the wildhorse drive with us  hes  by george i forgot some more interrupted smith slapping his leg bill said wiggate broke with jard hardman  wiggate started this wildhoss buyin an shippin east  hardman had to get his finger in the pie  now wiggate is a big man an he has plenty of money  i always heard him well spoken of  now ill gamble your callin jard hardman the way you did had a lot to do with wiggates break with him  shouldnt wonder rejoined pan  and its darned good luck for us the boys ran across a valley full of wild horses over here about twenty miles  dad i believe i can trap several thousand wild horses  no ejaculated his father incredulously  if the boys arent loco i sure can declared pan positively  i can vouch for numbers myself replied smith  an ive not a doubt in the world but that there valleys not yet hunted  but to ketch the darned scooters thats the hell of it  pan even a thousand head would give me a new start somewhere  its as good as done  before the snow flies we will be on the way south to siccane  lord  im a younger man than i was a few days ago  before the snow flies  thats hardly another month  pan howll we travel  wagons and horseback  we can buy wagon outfits for next to nothing theres a corral full of them at blacks  second hand but good enough  mother an lucy will be glad  they hate this country  i dont mind wind if its not too cold  there  isnt that lucy at the gate now suddenly queried pan with piercing gaze ahead  reckon it is replied his father  ride ahead son  ill take my time  pan urged the sorrel into a lope then a gallop and from that to a run  in just a few rods pan took the measure of this splendid horse swift strong sure footed and easy gaited and betraying no sign of a mean spirit the sorrel won pan  what a liar blinky was  he had lied to be generous  lucy waved to pan as he came clattering down the road  then she disappeared in the green foliage  arriving at the gate he dismounted and went in  he expected to see her  but she had disappeared leading his horse he hurried in toward the house looking everywhere the girl however was not to be seen  bobby was occupied with little wooden playthings on the porch  pans gay shout to him brought forth his mother but no lucy  he dropped his bridle and mounted the porch to embrace his mother who met him with suppressed emotions  her hands were more expressive than her words  oh im all here mother he laughed  wheres lucy  she was at the gate  waved to me  lucy ran through the house like a whirlwind replied his mother with a smile  the truth is my son she has been quite beside herself since she heard of her fathers release from jail  she knew you got him out  she stared at me with her eyes black and wide  mother he laughed at meat my fears  he said itd be easy to free dad   so she knows pan and i rather think she didnt want us to see her when she meets you  youll find her in the orchard or down by the brook  all right mother ill find her replied pan happily  well be in to dinner pronto  theres a lot to talk about  dad will tell you  pan did not seek lucy in the orchard  leaping upon the sorrel he loped down the sandy hardpacked path toward the brook and the shady tree with its bench  pan knew she would be there  dodging the overhanging branches he kept peering through the aisles of green for a glimpse of white or a golden head  suddenly he was rewarded  lucy stood in the middle of the sunny glade  pan rode to her side and leaped from the saddle  her face was pale and wet with tears  but her eyes were now dry wide and purple radiant with unutterable gladness  she rushed into his arms   dinner that day appeared to be something only bobby and pan had thought or need of  mrs smith and lucy learning they might have to leave in two weeks surely in four became so deeply involved in discussion of practical details of preparation of food supplies for a long wagon trip of sewing and packing that they did not indulge in the expression of their joy  dad is hopeless said pan with a grin  hes worse than a kid ill have to pack his outfit if he has anything  what he hasnt got well buy  so mother you trot out his clothes boots some bedding a gun chaps spurs everything there is and let me pick whats worth taking  it was indeed a scant and sad array of articles that pan had to choose from  no saddle no tarp no chaps no spurs no gun ejaculated pan scratching his head  poor dad  i begin to have a hunch how he felt  it developed that all his father possessed made a small bundle that pan could easily carry into town on his saddle  well buy dads outfit said pan briskly  mother heres some money  use it for what you need  work now you and lucy  you see we want to get out of marco pronto  the very day dad and i get back with the horses  maybe we can sell the horses out there  id take less money  itll be a big job driving a bunch of wild horses in to marco anyway well leave here pronto  to lucy he bade a fond but not anxious goodby  we wont be away long  and youll be busy  dont go into town  not on any account send alice  or mother can go when necessary  but you stay home  very well boss i promise replied lucy roguishly     chapter eleven  before dark that night pan had most of his preparations made so that next morning there would be nothing to do but eat pack the horses saddle up and ride  at suppertime charley brown and mac new alias hurd called at the camp  the latter was a little the worse for the bottle  charley was sober hard gloomy  howdy boys  help yourself to chuck  then well talk said pan  the outcome of that visit was the hiring of both men to go on the wildhorse drive  browns claim had been jumped by strangers  it could not be gotten back without a fight  brown had two horses and a complete outfit mac new had only the clothes on his back  fired me thout payin my wages he said sullenly  who fired you mac inquired pan  hardman the    replied mac new  well  thats strange  does he own the jail  huh  hardman owns this heah whole damn burg  nix spoke up blinky  dont fool yourself there pardner  jard hardman has a long string on marco ill admit but somebodys goin to cut it  brown had an interesting account to give of his meeting with dick hardman down at yellow mine  the young scion of the wouldbe dictator of marco fortunes had been drunk enough to rave about what he would do to panhandle smith  some of his maudlin threats as related by brown caused a good deal of merriment in camp except to blinky who grew perfectly furious  hey cowboy are you goin to stand fer thet he queried belligerently  pan tried to laugh it off but blinky manifestly had seen red at the mention of dick hardmans name  he was going over to the yellow mine and pick a fight  pan finding blinky stubborn and strange adopted other tactics  drawing the irate cowboy aside he inquired kindly and firmly its because of louise  whats because returned blinky blusteringly  that you want to pick a fight with dick  naw replied blinky averting his face  dont you lie to me blinky went on pan earnestly shaking the cowboy  ive guessed your trouble and im your friend  wal pan im darn glad an lucky if youre my friend said blinky won out of his sullenness  but what trouble are you hintin aboot  pan whispered youre in love with louise  what if i am hissed blinky in fierce shame  are you holdin thet agin me  no im damned if i dont like you better for it  that was too much for blinky  he gazed mutely up at pan as a dog at his master  pan never saw such eyes of misery  blinky that girl is wicked went on pan  shes full of hellfire but thats only the drink  she couldnt carry on that life without being drunk  she told me so  theres something great about that little girl  i felt it blink  i liked her  i told her she didnt belong there  i believe she could be made a good woman  why dont you try it  ill help you  she likes you  she told me that too  but louise wont ever see me unless shes drunk protested blinky sorrowfully  thats proof  she doesnt want you wasting your time and money at the yellow mine  she thinks youre too good for thatwhen shes sober talk straight now blink  you do love her bad as she is  so help me i do burst out the cowboy abjectly  its purty near killed me  the more i see of her the more i care  im so sorry fer her i caint stand it  dick hardman fetched her out heah from frisco  aw  she must have been bad before thet i know  but she wasnt low down  thet dive has done it  wal he never cared nothin fer her an she hates him  she swears shell cut his heart out  an im afraid shell do it  thets why id like to stick a gun into his belly  marry louise  take her away  come south with us to arizona replied pan persuasively  my gawd pardner youre too swift fer me whispered blinky huskily and he clutched pan  would you let us go with you  sure  why not  lucy and my mother know nothing about louise  even if they did they wouldnt despise a poor girl you and i believe is good at heart and has been unfortunate  id rather not tell them but i wouldnt be afraid to  but louise wont marry me  if we cant talk her into it when shes sober by heaven well get her drunk  now blink its settled  lets stay away from there tonight  forget it  well go out and do the hard riding stunt of our lives  well sell horses  with some money we can figure on homes far from this bitter countryhomes cowboy do you savvy that  with cattle and horsessome fine open grassy rolling countrywhere nobody ever heard of blinky moran and panhandle smith  pard it aintmyright name either mumbled blinky leaning against pan  he was crying  no difference replied pan holding the boy tight a moment  brace up now blink  its all settled  go to bed now ill help gus with the horses  pan left the cowboy there in the darkness and returned to camp  his conscience questioned him but he had only satisfaction even gladness in reply  blinky had been one of the wild cowboys and had been going from bad to worse  if an overpowering love gripped him a yielding to it in a right way might make a better man of him  pan could not see anything else  he had known more than one goodfornothing cowboy drinking and gambling himself straight to hell who had fooled his detractors and had taken the narrow trail for a woman others deemed worthless  there was something about this kind of fight that appealed to pan  as for the girl louise melliss and her reaction to such a desperate climax pan had only his strange faith that it might create a revolution in her soul  at least he was absolutely sure she would never return to such a life and she was young  pan sought his blankets very late and it seemed he scarcely had closed his eyes when juan called him  it was pitch dark outside  the boys were stirring the horses pounding the campfire crackling  he pulled on his boots with a will  glad he was to return to the life of camps horses cold dawns hard fare and hard riding  he smelled the frying ham the steaming coffee  mawnin pardner drawled blinky  shore thought you was daid  grab a pan of grub heah  an say cowboy from now on you can call me somersfrank somers  im proud of the name but i reckon it was ashamed of me  ahhuh  all right blink somers replied pan cheerfully  youll always be blink to me  they ate standing and sitting before the campfire in the chill blackness just beginning to turn gray  then swift hands and lean strong arms went at beds and packs horses and saddles  when dawn broke the hunters were on their way far up the cedar slope  pan gazed back and down upon marco a ragged onestreet town of motley appearance its white tents its adobe huts its stone buildings and high board fronts mute and still in the morning grayness  what greed what raw wild life slept there  far beyond the town he saw the greenpatched farm the little gray cabin where his mother and lucy slept no doubt dreaming of the hopes he had fostered in them  some doubt some fear intangible and inexplicable passed over him as he looked  would all be well with lucy  there was indeed much to be feared and he could never give happiness full rein until he had her safe away from marco  once out of sight of the town pan forced himself to the job ahead  and as always to ride a goodgaited horse with open country ahead lulled his mind into content  blinky was first leading a pack horse  pan followed next and the other four men strung out behind with bobbing pack horses between this ridge was the high ground between marco valley and hot springs valley  soon the trail led down and it was dusty  the rising sun killed the chill in the air and by the time the hunters had reached level ground again it was hot  there was alkali dust to breathe always an abomination  from above pan had espied a green spot fifteen miles or more down the valley  a number of dust devils were whirling around it  whats that blink pan had asked pointing  thets hot springs an the dust comes from wild hosses comin to drink  they rode across the valley which appeared to be five or six miles wide to begin ascending another slope  the pack horses lagged and had to be driven  up and up the hunters climbed once more into the cedars  pan had another view of hot springs and the droves of wild horses  he was surprised at their numbers  blink there must be lots of horses water there  yep  three thousand or more at this time of year  many more later when the droves get run out of the high country by man  an you see hardmans outfit has been chasin them hosses fer two months  theyve shore purty well boggered  are many of them branded  darn few replied blinky  not moren five or six in a hundred  the mexicans call them arenajos  these wild hosses havent been worth ketchin until lately  most all broomtails  but now an then you shore see a bunch of dandy mustangs with a highsteppin stallion  ah now cowboy youre talking declared pan  youre singing to me  itll be darn hard for me to sell horses like that  pard i reckon we wont sell em replied blinky  caint we use a few strings of real hosses down there in arizonie  i should smile replied pan  they climbed and crossed that ridge which could have been called a foothill if there had been any mountains near  another valley narrow and rough not so low as the last lay between this ridge and the next one a cedared rise of rock and yellow earth that promised hard going beyond it rose the range of mountains black and purple and higher still white peaked into the blue  they called to pan  this was wild country and even to see it in the distance was all satisfying  this narrow valley also showed some wildhorse bands but not many for there appeared to be scant grass and water  these horses were going or coming all on a trot but when they sighted the hunters they would halt stockstill  soon a stallion trotted out a hundred paces or more snorted and whistled then taking to his heels he led his band away in a cloud of dust  some of these bands would run a long way others would halt soon to look back  the water which they had come to drink was not very good according to pans taste  his sorrel did not like it  this was pans first experience with hot alkali water  it came out almost boiling too hot to drink but a few rods from the spring it cooled off  the spring was surrounded by low trees still green though many of the leaves had turned yellow  while the hunters watered there pan espied another herd of wild horses that trooped in below and drank from the stream  he counted ten horses mostly blacks and bays  the leader was a buckskin and pan would not have minded owning him  the others were not bad looking of fair size weighing around a thousand pounds but they showed inbreeding  after they had drunk their fill they pawed the mud and rolled in the water to come up most unsightly beasts  pan let out a loud yell  swift as antelopes the horses swept away  shore they left there drawled blinky  then talking to his own horse which he slapped with his sombrero he said now you smelled them broomies didnt you  want to run right off an turn wild huh wal ill shore keep a durn sharp eye on you an hobble you too  all the saddle horses and even some of the pack animals were affected by the scent of the wild herd  freedom still lived deep down in their hearts  that was why a broken horse no matter how gentle became the wildest of the wild when he got free  pan had been right in his judgment of the lay of the land on the next ridge  climbing it was difficult  when we ketch the wild hosses we can drive them down the valley an round to the road said blinky evidently by way of excuse  itll be longer but easy travelin  shore we couldnt drive any broomtails heah  the summit of this ridge was covered with piñons and cedars growing in heavy clumps around outcropping of ledges  pan espied the blue flash of deer through the gray and green  deer sign was plentiful a fact he observed with pleasure for he liked venison better than beef  it was rather a widetopped ridge and not until pan had reached an open break on the far side could he see what kind of country lay beyond  wal there she is my wild hoss valley said blinky who sat his horse alongside of pan  an by golly thets the name for herwild hoss valley  hey pard  pan nodded his acquiescence  in truth he had been rendered quite speechless by the wildness and beauty of the scene below and beyond him  a valley that had some of the characteristics of a canyon yawned beneath so deep and wide that it appeared like a blue lake so long that he could only see the north end which notched under a rugged mountain slope green and black and golden and white according to the successive steps toward the heights  the height upon which he stood was the last of the ridges for the elevation that lay directly across was a noble range of foothills timbered canyoned apparently insurmountable for horses  gray cliffs stood out of the green crags of yellow rock mounted like castles  but it was the blue floor of the valley that longest held pans enraptured gaze  it looked level though to an experienced eye that was deceitful  grass and sage  what were the innumerable colored rocks or bushes or dots that covered the whole floor of the valley pan wondered  then he did not need to ask  they were wild horses  aw blink  thisll be hard to leave he expostulated as if his friend were to blame for this unexpected and bewildering spectacle  you bet your sweet life it will agreed blinky  but we caint hang up heah moon eyed an ravin  were holdin up the outfit an its a long way down to water  have you picked out a place where well be awayout of sight queried pan quickly  wal pard im no wild hoss wrangler like you say you are but ive got hoss sense drawled blinky as he urged his animal back into the yellow trail  pan dismounted to walk a habit he had always conformed to on steep trails when his horse needed freeing of a burden and his own legs were the better for action  at times he got a glimpse of the valley through a hole in the trees but for the most part he could not see downward at all  then he gazed across the open gulf to the mountains these were not like the rockies he knew so well by sight the great whitecrowned skypiercing peaks of montana  these belonged more to the desert were wilder with more color not so lofty and as ragged as jagged rock and fringed timber could make them  gradually as he descended the trail this range dropped back out of his sight  at near the sunset hour when the journey was ended pan had to compliment blinky on the beautiful place to which he had guided them it was isolated and singularly fitted to their requirements  the slope they had descended ran out into an immense buttress jutting far into the valley  a low brushy arm of the incline extended out a half mile to turn toward the main slope and to break off short leaving a narrow opening out into the valley  the place was not only ideal for a hidden camp site with plenty of water grass wood but also for such a wildhorse trap as pan had in mind  what astonished pan was that manifestly blinky had not seen the possibilities of this peculiar formation of slope as a trap into which wild horses could be chased  how wide is that gap asked pan  reckon it caint be moren the length of two lassoes replied blinky  rope it off high boys and turn the stock loose  this corral was made for us said pan enthusiastically  they set to work each with selfassumed tasks that soon accomplished the whole business of pitching camp  suppertime found them a cheerful hungry hopeful little band  pans optimism dominated them  he believed in his luck and they believed in him  dusk settled down into this neck of the great valley  coyotes barked out in the open  from the heights pealed down the mournful bloodcurdling yet beautiful bay of a wolf  the rosy afterglow of sunset lingered a long time  the place was shut in closed about by brushy steeps redolent of sage  a tiny stream of swift water sang faintly down over rocks  and before darkness had time to enfold hollow and slope and horizon the moon slid up to defeat the encroaching night and blanch the hills with silvery light  interrogation by pan brought out the fact that blinky had never been down this trail at all  it was only a wild horse trail anyway  blinky had viewed the country from the heights above and this marvelously secluded arm of the valley had been as unknown to him as to pan  luck burst out pan when the circumstance became clear  say blink if your horse would jump you off a cliff youd come up with queen victoria on your arm  lying juan sometimes broke into the conversation very often by reason of his defective hearing and his appalling habit of falsehood bringing his companions to the verge of hysterics  yes yes i was over to her place two tree times began juan brightening with each word  i drive en to many horse to her ranch you bet i sell some damn good horse to queen victorie  i can tell you myself queen victorie is a fine little woman i ever seen on my life she make big a dance for me when i never seen so much supper on my life  i dance with her myself an she ata me an say juanie i never dance lika this en my life till i dance with you yes thats sure what she tell me to my own face an eyes  pan was the only one of juans listeners who had power of speech left and he asked juan did you play any monte or poker with the queen  you bet  she playa best game of poker i ever seen on my life an she won tree hunred dollars from me  whereupon pan succumbed to the riotous mirth  this laughter tickled lying juans supreme vanity  he was a veritable child in mentality though he spoke english better than most mexican laborers  blinky was the only one who ever tried to match wits with lying juan  juan thet shore reminds me of somethin began blinky impressively yea hit shore does  onct i almost got hitched up with victorie  i was sort of figgerin on marryin her but she got leary o my little desert farm back in missourie  she got sorter skeered o coyotes an injins  now i aint got no use fer a woman like her an thets why me an queen victorie aint no longer friends  most of the talk however invariably switched back to the burning question of the hourwild horses  pan had to attempt to answer a hundred queries many of which were not explicit to his companions or satisfactory to himself  finally he lost patience  say you longeared jackasses he exploded  i tell you it all depends on the lay of the land  i mean the success of a big drive  if round the corner here theres good running groundwell itll be great for us  well look the ground over and size up the valley for horses find where they water and graze  if we decide to use this place as a trap to drive into well throw up two blind corrals just inside that gateway out there  then well throw a fence of cedars as far across the valley as we can drag cedars  the farther the better  itll have to be a fence too thick and high for horses to break through or jump over  that means work my buckaroos work  when thats done well go up the valley get behind the wild horses and drive them down  loud indeed were the commendations showered upon pans plan  blinky who alone had not voiced his approval cast an admiring eye upon pan  shore ive got dobe mud in my haid fer brains he said with disgust simple as apple pie an i never onct thought of ketchin wild hosses thet a way  blink thats because you never figured on a wholesale catch replied pan  moonshining wild horses as you called it and roping and creasing with a rifle bullet never answered for numbers  it wouldnt pay us to try those methods  we want at least a thousand head in one drive  aw  aw  pan dont work my hopes to believin thet implored blinky throwing up his hands  son im cryin for mercy too added pans father  an im goin to turn in on that one  lying juan either from design or accident found this an admirable opening  my father was big don in mexico  he hada tree tousand vacqueros on our rancho  we chase wild horse many days more horse than i ever see on my life  i helpa lass more horse than i ever see on my life  i make tree tousand peso by my fathers rancho  juan i pass declared pan  youve got my hand beat  boys lets unroll the tarps  it has been a sure enough riding day     chapter twelve  pans father was an early riser and next morning he routed everybody out before the clear white morning star had gone down in the velvet blue sky  before breakfast while the others were wrangling horses packing wood and water he climbed the steep end of the bluff between camp and the valley  upon his return he was so excited over the number of wild horses which he claimed to have seen that pan feared he had fallen victim to lying juans malady  i hope dads not loco said pan  but our luck is running heavy lets play it for all were worth  ill climb that bluff too and see for myself  then well ride out into the valley get the lay of the land and find the best place for our trap  blinky accompanied pan to the ridge which they climbed at a point opposite camp  probably it was four or five hundred feet high and provided a splendid prospect of the valley  pan could scarcely believe his eyes  he saw wild horsesso many that for the time being he forgot the other important details  he counted thirty bands in a section of the valley no more than fifteen miles long and less than half as wide  these were individual bands keeping to themselves each undoubtedly having a leader  blinky swore lustily in his enthusiasm evidently thinking of the money thus represented     whod ever think of these heah broomies turnin into a gold mine he ended his tribute to the scene  but to pan it meant much more than fortune indeed at first he had no mercenary thought whatsoever  horses had been the passion of his life cattle had been only beef hoofs horns to him  horses he loved naturally then wild horses would appeal to him with more thrill and transport than those that acknowledged the mastery of man  cowboys were of an infinite variety of types yet they all fell under two classes those who were brutal with horses and those who were gentle  the bronco the outlaw the wild horse had to be broken to be ridden  many of them hated the saddle the bit the rider and would not tolerate them except when mastered  these horses had to be hurt to be subdued  then there were cowboys great horsemen who never wanted any kind of a horse save one that would kick bite pitch  it was a kind of cowboy vanity  panhandle smith did not have it  he had broken bad horses and he had ridden outlaws but because of his humanity he was not so great a horseman as he might have been  in almost every outfit where pan had worked there had always been one cowboy sometimes more who could beat him riding  because of this genuine love for horses the beautiful wildhorse panorama beneath pan swelled his heart  he gazed and gazed  from near to far the bands dotted the greengray valley  far away this valley floor shaded into blue  near at hand the colors were easily distinguishable  blacks and bays whites and chestnuts pintos that resembled zebras dotted this wild pasture land  the closest band to where pan and blinky stood could not have been more than a mile distant in a straight line  a shiny black stallion was the leader of this herd  he was acting strangely too trotting forward and halting tossing his head and long black mane  stallion exclaimed pan pointing  what a jimdandy horse  blink he has spotted us sure as youre born  talk about eyesight  wal the broomtailed sonofabronc drawled blinky tapping a cigarette against his palm  reckon by gosh youre correct  blink thats a wild stalliona wonderful horse  ill bet hes game and fast protested pan  wal youre safe to gamble on his bein fast anyways  didnt you ever really care for a horse queried pan  me  hell no  ive been kicked in the stummickbit on the earpiled onto the muddrug in the dust too darn often  youll admit though that there are some fine horses among these asked pan earnestly  wal pan to stop kiddin you now an then a fellar sees a real hoss among them broomies  but shore them boys are the hard ones to ketch  the last of blinkys remark forced pans observation upon the cardinally important pointthe lay of the land  a million wild horses in sight would be of no marketable value if they could not be trapped so he bent his keen gaze here and there up and down the valley across to the far side and upon the steep wall near by  blink see that deep wash running down the valley  it looks a good deal closer to the far side  thats a break in the valley floor all right  it may be a wonderful help to us and it may ruin our chances  reckon we caint tell much from heah  thets where the water runs when there is any  bet its plumb dry now  well ride out presently and see  but im almost sure its a deep wide wash with steep walls  impassable  and by golly if thats soyoure a rich cowboy  haw  haw  gosh the way you sling words around  now lets work along this ridge down to the point where dad went wasnt he funny  hes shore full of ginger  wal i reckon hes perked up since you come  brush and cactus jumbles of sharp rocks thickets of scrub oak and dumps of dwarf cedars all matted along the narrow hogback as blinky called it made progress slow and tedious  no cowboy ever climbed and walked so well as he rode  at length however pan and blinky arrived at the extreme end of the capelike bluff  it stood higher than their first lookout  pan who arrived at a vantage point ahead of blinky let out a stentorian yell  whereupon his companion came running  hey whats eatin you he panted  rattlesnakes or wild hosses  look exclaimed pan waving his hand impressively  the steep yellow slope opposite them very close at the point where the bluff curved in stretched away almost to the other side of the valley indeed it constituted the southern wall of the valley and was broken only by the narrow pass below where the cowboys stood and another wider break at the far end  from this point the wash that had puzzled pan proved to be almost a canyon in dimensions  it kept to the lowest part of the valley floor and turned to run parallel with the slope  blink suppose we run a fence of cedars from the slope straight out to the wash  reckon thats two miles and more  then close up any gaps along this side of the valley  what would happen suggested pan with bright eyes on his comrade  blinky spat out his cigarette a sign of unusual emotion for him  you doggone wildhoss wrangler he ejaculated with starting eyes and healthy grin  shore i begin to get your hunch  honest i never till this heah minnit thought so damn much of your idee  you shore gotta excuse me  a blind man could figger this deal heah  big corrals hid behind the gate under uslong fence out there to the washclose up any holes on this side of valleythen make a humdinger of a drive  cowboy shores youre born im seein my arizona ranch right this minnit  reckon im seeing things too agreed pan in suppressed excitement i said once before its too good to be true  dad wasnt loco  no wonder he raved  blink is there any mistake  what about  the market for wild horses  absolutely no declared blinky vehemently  its new  only started last summer  wiggate made money  he said so  thets what fetched the hardmans nosin into the game  mebbe this summer will kill the bizness but right now were safe  we can sell all the hosses we can ketch right heah on the hoof without breakin or drivin  its only a days ride from marco less than thet over the hills the way we come we can sell at marco or we can drive to the railroad  id say sell at ten dollars a haid right heah an whoop  i should smile replied pan  itll take us ten days or more working like beavers to cut and drag the cedars to build that fence more time if there are gaps to close along this side  then all weve got to do is drive the valley  one day will do it  why i never saw or heard of such a trap  you can bet it will be driven only once  the wild horses we dont catch will steer clear of this valley  but breaking a big drove or driving them to marcothatd be a job id rather dodge  itd take a month even with a small herd  hardman an wiggate have several outfits working mebbe fifty riders all told  theyve been handlin hosses  reckon wiggate would jump at buyin up a thousand haid all he could get  hes from st louis an what he knows aboot wild hosses aint a hell of a lot  ive talked with him  blinky oldtimer weve got the broomies sold  now lets figure on catching them replied pan joyfully  and well cut out a few of the best for ourselves  an a couple fer our lady friends hey pard added blinky with violence of gesture and speech  down the steep slope through brush and thickets they slid like a couple of youngsters on a lark  pan found the gateway between bluff and slope even more adaptable to his purposes than it had appeared from a distance  the whole lay of the land was miraculously advantageous to the drive and the proposed trap  oh its too darn good cried pan incredulously  itll be too easy  it makes me afraid  thet somethin unforeseen will happen huh queried blink shrewdly i had the same idee  but what could happen asked pan darkly speculative  wal to figger the way things run fer me an gus out heah id say this replied blinky with profound seriousness  well do all the cuttin an draggin an buildin  we close up any gaps  well work our selves till were daid in our boots  then well drivedrive them wild hosses as hosses was never drove before  well what then queried pan sharply  drive em right in heah where hardmans outfit will be waitin  my god man flashed pan hotly  such a thing couldnt happen  wal it just could drawled blinky an we couldnt do a damn thing but fight  fight repeated pan passionately  the very thought of a contingency such as blinky had suggested made the hot red blood film his eyes  thets what i said pard replied his comrade coolly  an it would be one hell of a fight with all the best of numbers an guns on hardmans side  weve got only three rifles besides our guns an not much ammunition  i fetched all we had an sent gus for more  but black didnt send thet over an i forgot to go after it  we can send somebody back to marco said pan broodingly  say youve given me a shock  i never thought of such a possibility  i see now it could happen but the chances are a thousand to one against it  shore  its hardly worth guessin aboot  but theres thet one chance  an were both afeared of somethin strange  all we can do pan is gamble  on the way back to camp pan pondering very gravely over the question at last decided that such a bold raid was a remote possibility and that his and blinkys subtle reaction to the thought came from their highly excited imaginations  the days of rustling cattle and stealing horses on a grand scale were gone into the past  hardmans machinations back there in marco were those of a crooked man who played safe  there was nothing big or bold about him none of the earmarks of the old frontier rustler  matthews was still less of a character to fear  dick hardman was a dissolute and depraved youth scarcely to be considered  purcell perhaps or others of like ilk might have to be drawn upon sooner or later but that being a personal encounter caused pan no anxiety  thus he allayed the doubts and misgivings that had been roused over blinkys supposition  lets see he asked when he reached camp  how many horses have we all told  thirtyone countin the pack hosses an thet outlaw sorrel of yours replied blinky  reckon well have to ride them all  dragging cedars pulls a horse down  some of em we caint ride leastways i caint  grab some ropes and nose bags everybody and well fetch the string into camp ordered pan  in due time all the horses were ridden and driven back to camp where a temporary corral had been roped off in a niche of the slope  wal fellars its find a hoss you havent rid before sang out blinky an everyone fer himself  there was a stout roundbarreled buckskin that pans father had his eye on  dont like his looks dad warned pan  say blink how about this wormylooking buck  wal hes hell to get on but there never was a better hoss wrapped up in thet much hide  pan caught him and led him out of the corral  just as the horse stepped over the rope fence which pan held down he plunged and made a break to get loose dragging pan at the end of a thirtyfoot lasso there was a lively tussle which pan finally won  whoa you beanheaded jasper he yelled  ill ride you myself  his father caught a brown baldfaced horse nothing much to look at that acted gentle enough until he was mounted  thenhe arched his back jumped up stiff legged and began to pitch  evidently smith had been a horseman in his day  he stayed on  hang on dad yelled pan in delight  ride him cowboy shrieked blinky  fortunately for smith the horse was not one of the fiery devilish species that would not be ridden  he straightened out presently and calmed down  he was goin to pile meshore declared smith  charley brown caught a bluegray finelooking horse whose appearance no doubt had attracted the miner but he turned out to be a counterfeit and charley bit the dust as blinky called it whereupon charley had recourse to the animal he had ridden from marco hurd showed he was a judge of horses and could ride  blinky evidently was laboring under the urge that caused so much disaster among ridershe wanted to try a new horse  so he caught a jugheaded bay that did not look as if he could move out of his own way  blink you must be figuring on sleeping some inquired pan  humph hell walk back snorted gus  i tried thet pack animal hes hell fer breakfast  gus if i was goin to walk id leave my saddle heah in camp drawled blinky  blink ill let you ride in behind me added pan  as a matter of fact pan was not having much luck propitiating the horse he had selected  every time pan would reach under for the cinch the horse would kick at him and throw off the saddle  hey blink come here called pan impatiently  hold this nice kind horse  whatd you call him  dunny replied blink  an hes a right shore enough good hoss ill hold him  blinky grasped the cars of the horse but that did not work so pan roped his front feet  blinky held the beast while pan put the saddle on but when he gave the cinch a pull dunny stood up with a wild shriek and fell over backwards  he would have struck square on the saddle if blinky had not pulled him sideways  fortunately for pan the horse rolled over to the right  pan turn that thing loose an catch a horse you can get on called his father  dont worry dad  im ararin to ride this bird  pard dunny will be nice after you buckle down thet saddle an get forked on him good drawled blinky with his deceitful grin  hes shore a broomiechasin devil  pan said blink ill fool you in a minute  hold him down now step on his nose  pulling the right stirrup out from under the horse pan drew the cinch a couple of holes tighter and then straddled him  let him up blink  all right pard  tell us where you want to be buried replied blinky loosing the lasso and jumping free  with a blast of rage dunny got up  but he cunningly got up with his back first head down between his legs and stiff as a poker  he scattered the horses and whooping men bucked over the campfire and the beds then with long high leaps he tore for the open  high wide an handsome yelled blinky in a spasm of glee  ride him you texas cowpunchin galoot  youll shore be the first one who ever forked him fer keeps  blinkif hepiles meill lick you yelled back pan  lick nothin bawled blinky youll need a doctor  but pan stayed on that horse which turned out to be the meanest and most violent bucker he had ever bestrode  less powerful horses had thrown him  eventually the plunging animal stopped and pan turned him back to camp  wal you sonofagun ejaculated blinky in genuine admiration howd you ever keep company with him  grin you idiot panted pan good humoredly  now menwere ready to look the valley over  ill take dad with me  blink you and gus turn the corner here and keep close under the slope all the way up the valley  look out for places where the wild horses might climb out charley you and mac new cross to the other side of the valley if you can  look the ground over along that western wall  and everybody keep eyes peeled for wild horses so we can get a line on numbers  they rode out through the gateway into the valley where they separated into pairs  pan with his father headed south along the slope  he found distances somewhat greater than he had estimated from the bluff and obstacles that he had not noted at all  but by traveling farther down he discovered a low ledge of rock quite a wall in places that zigzagged out from the slope for a goodly distance  it had breaks here and there which could easily be closed up with brush  this wall would serve very well for part of the fence and from the end of it out to the wash there was comparatively level ground  half a mile up the slope the cedars grew thickly so that the material for the fence was easily accessible  the wash proved to be a perpendicularly walled gorge fifty or more feet deep with a sandy dry floor  it wound somewhat west by north up the valley and as far as he could see did not greatly differ in proportion from the point where the fence was to touch  dad there are likely to be side washes or cuts up toward the head where horses could get down said pan  well fence right across here  so if we do chase any horses into the wash well stop them here sure this long hole would make a great trap  from that point they rode up the wash and gradually out into the middle of the valley  bands of wild horses trooped away in the distance clouds of moving dust beyond the rolling ridges of the valley told of others in motion  they were pretty wild considering that they had never been chased  at length pan decided that many of these herds had come into this valley from other points nearer to marco  some bands stood on ridge tops with heads erect manes flying wild and ragged watching the two riders move along the wash  pan did not observe any evidence of water but he hardly expected to find any in that wash  a very perceptible ascent in that direction explained the greater number of horses  the sage was stubby and rather scant near at hand yet it lent the beautiful color that was so appreciable from a distance  intersecting washes were few and so deep and steepwalled that there need be no fear of horses going down them into the main wash outcroppings of rock were rare the zone of cactus failed as the valley floor lost its desert properties jack rabbits bounded away before the approach of the horses a few lean gray coyotes trotted up to rises of ground there to watch the intruders  pan had been deceived in his estimate of the size of the valley  they rode ten miles west before they began to get into rougher ground scaly with broken rock and gradually failing in vegetation  the notch of the west end loomed up ragged and brushy evidently a wild jumble of cliffs ledges timber and brush  the green patch at the foot meant water and willows  pan left his father to watch from a high point while he rode on five miles farther  the ascent of the valley was like a bowl  the time came when he gazed back and down over the whole valley  before him lines and dots of green widely scattered told of more places where water ran  strings of horses moved to and fro so far away that they were scarcely distinguishable  beyond these points no horses could be seen  the wash wound like a black ribbon out of sight  the vast sloping lines of valley swept majestically down from the wooded blufflike sides  it was an austere gray hollow of the earth with all depressions and ridges blending beautifully into the soft graygreen dotted surface  pan rode back to join his father  its a big place and weve got a big job on our hands he remarked  while you was gone a band of two hundred or more run right under me comin from this side replied smith with beaming face  broomtails an willowtails they may be as those boys call them but ill tell you son some of them are mighty fine stock  the leader of this bunch had a brand on his flank  he was white an i saw it plain  id shore like to own him  dad ill bet we catch some good ones to take with us to arizona  if we only had more time  pan itd pay us to work here all winter  you bet  but dad ii want to take lucy away from marco replied pan hesitatingly  when i let myself think im worried  shes only a kid and she might be scared or driven  right son said smith soberly  those hardmans would try anythin  well stick to the original plan and thats to make a quick hard drivethen rustle out of new mexico   when they rode into the gateway the day was far spent and the west was darkly ablaze with subdued fire  pans father showed his unfamiliarity with long horseback rides and he made sundry remarks mirth provoking to his son  ill make a cowboy and horse wrangler of you again threatened pan  by the time lying juan had supper ready blinky and gus rode in camp  hungriern a wolf said blinky  well whats the verdict asked pan with a smile  wuss an more of it drawled blinky  we seen most five thousand hosses an ill be doggoned if i dont believe well ketch them all  you found this side of the valley a regular holeproof wing for our trap ill bet asserted pan  wal theres places where hosses could climb out easy but they wont try it replied blinky  the valley slopes up long an easy to the wall  but when we drive them hosses theyll keep down in the center between the risin ground an thet wash  theyll run far past them places where they could climb out  i shore lose my breath whenever i think of whats comin off  i reckon the valley is a madetoorder corral  blink you have some intelligence after all replied pan chaffingly did you see any sign of brown and mac new  not after we separated this mawnin returned blinky  an thet reminds me pard ive got somethin to tell you  this fellar hurdor mac new as you call himhas a pocketful of gold coin  how do you know queried pan bluntly  gus kicked his coat this mawnin over there where mac new had his bed an a pile of gold eagles rolled out  just by accident  gus wanted somethin or other  he was plumb surprised an he said mac new was plumb flustered  now what you make of thet  by golly blink i dont know  theres no reason why he shouldnt have some money yet it strikes me queer  how much gold  aw two or three hundred easy rejoined blinky  it struck me sort of queer too  i recollected thet he told us hed only been doin guard duty at the jail fer a couple of months  an gus recollected how not long before mac new went to work hed been a regular grubline runner  we fed him heah or juan did  now pard it may be all right an then again it maynt  are you shore aboot him  blink you make me see how i answer to some feeling thats not practical returned pan much perturbed  mac was an outlaw in montana  maybe worse  anyway i saved him one day from being strung up  that was on the powder river when i was riding for hurleys x y z outfit  they were a hard lot  and macs guilt wasnt clear to me anyway i got him out of a bad mess on condition hed leave the country  ahuh  wal i see  but its a shore gamble hes one of hardmans outfit now same as purcell  reckon he was  but he got fired  thets what he says  blink you advise me not to trust mac new queried pan dubiously  i aint advisin nobody  if you want my opinion id say now i know what you done fer mac new thet he wouldnt doublecross you  when it comes down under the skin there aint much difference between outlaws an other range men in a deal like thet  well ill trust him just because of that feeling i cant explain returned pan  he did not however forget the possible implication and it hovered in his mind  it was after dark when mac new and brown rode into camp pan and the others were eating their supper  we had to ride clean to the end of the valley to cross that wash said brown  its rough country  horses all down low  didnt see so many at that until we rimmed around way up on this side  fine  you couldnt have pleased me more declared pan  now mac what do you say  about this heah hoss huntin queried mac new  yes  our prospects i mean  youve chased wild horses  itll be most as bad as stealin hosses replied the outlaw laconically  easy work an easy money  say you wont think its easy work when you get to dragging cedars down that hill in the hot sun all day  i dont know anything harder  early next morning the labor began and proceeded with the utmost dispatch  the slope resounded with the ring of axes  pans father was a capital hand at chopping down trees and he kept two horsemen dragging cedars at a lively rate  the work progressed rapidly but the fence did not seem to grow in proportion  as pan dragged trees out to the sloping valley floor raising a cloud of dust he espied a stallion standing on the nearest ridge half a mile away  how wild and curious  you better look sharp you rawboned sage eater called pan  twice more this same horse evinced intelligent curiosity  pan could not see any signs of a band with him  but other wild horses showed at different points none however so close as this gray blackspotted stallion  blinky was sure this horse had not always been wild manifestly he knew the ways of his archenemy man  with three cutters and three riders dragging cedars allowing for a rest of an hour at noon the fence grew to a length of a quarter of a mile from the slope  not so good declared pan when they left off work for the day  but that fence is high and thick  it will take an old stallion like that gray to break through it  wal my idee is thet we did grand replied blinky wiping his sweaty face  besides all the choppin and haulin gus found time to kill a deer  it was a tired sweaty and dustbegrimed party of hunters that descended upon lying juan for supper  after their hearty meal they gathered round the campfire to smoke and talk  this night mac new joined the group and though he had nothing to say he listened attentively and appeared to fit in more  pan was aware of how the former outlaw watched him  the conversation of course centered round the plan and execution of work and especially the wonderful drive they expected to make  if they could have at once started the drive it would have been over and done with before their interest had time to grow intense  but the tremendous task of preparation ahead augmented the anticipation and thrill of that one day when they must ride like the wind  next day they did not go back to the fence but worked at the gateway on the blind corrals  pan constructed the opening to resemble a narrow aisle of scrub oak  material for this they cut from the bluff and slid it down to the level  by sunset one corral had been almost completed it was large enough to hold a thousand horses  one third of it was fenced by the bluff  two more days were required to build the second blind corral which was larger and though it opened from the first it did not run along the bluff  as this one was intended for chasing and roping horses as well as simply holding them the fence was made an almost impenetrable mass of thick foliaged cedars reinforced where necessary with stuffings of scruboak brush  pan was so particular that he tried to construct a barrier which did not have sharp projecting spikes of dead branches sticking out to cut a horse  by gum i shore dont believe you ever was a regular cowpuncher declared blinky testily after having been ordered to do additional labor on a portion of the fence  blink were dealing with horses not cows answered pan  but good lord man a cow is as feelin as a hoss any day protested blinky  youll be swearing you love cows next laughed pan  nope  well do our work well  then the chances are we wont spike any of those thoroughbreds we want to break for arizona  say ill bet two bits you wont let us sell a single goshdarned broomie added blinky  go to bed blink rejoined pan in pretended compassion  youre all in  this isnt moonshining wild horses   in the succeeding days pan paced up the work from dawn until dark  a week more saw the long fence completed  it was an obstacle few horses could leap  pan thought he would love to see the stallion that could do it  following the completion of the fence they built a barrier across the wash  and then to make doubly sure pan divided his party into three couples each with instructions to close all possible exits along the branches of the wash and the sides of the slope  during the latter part of this work the bands of wild horses moved farther westward  but as far as pan could tell none left the valley they had appeared curious and wary then had moved out of sight over the ridges in the center of the great oval  the night that they finished with two weeks of unremitting toil in dust and heat behind them was one for explosive satisfaction  fellars my pard panhandle is one to tie to declared blinky but excoose me from ridin any range where he was foreman  blink youll soon be cowboy foreman bossthe whole outfit on your own arizona ranch  pard ill shore drink to thet if anybodys got any licker  if there were any other bottles in the camp mac news was the only one that came to light  it was passed around  now men listen began pan when they had found comfortable seats around the campfire  its all over but the shoutingand the riding you listen too juan for youve got to fork a horse and drive with us as soon as its light enough to see well take the fresh horses weve been saving and ride across the valley  its pretty long around but i want to come up behind all these bands of wild horses  pack your guns and all the shells youve got  well take stands at the best place which well decide from the location of the horses  reckon thatll be about ten miles west  youll all see when we get there how the neck of the valley narrows down till its not very wide  maybe a matter of two miles of level ground with breaks running toward each slope  well string across this equal distances apart and begin our drive  if we start well and dont let any horses break our line well soon get them going and then each band will drive with us  ride like hell shoot and yell your head off to turn back any horses that charge to get between us  soon as we get a few hundred moving whistling trampling and raising the dust thatll frighten the bands ahead  theyll begin to move before they see us  naturally as the valley widens weve got to spread  but if we once get a wide scattering string of horses running ahead of us we neednt worry about being separated  when we get them going strong therell be a stampede  sure a lot of horses will fool us one way or another but we ought to chase half the number on this side of the valley clear to our fence  thatll turn them toward the gate to the blind corrals  well close in there and thatll take riding my buckaroos  blinky was the most obstreperously responsive to pans long harangue pan thought he understood the secret of the cowboys strange elation after all what did blinky care for horses or money  he had been a homeless wandering range rider a harddrinking reckless fellow with few friends and those only for the hour of the length of a job  the success of this venture if it turned out so meant that blinky would do the one big act of his life  he would take the girl louise from her surroundings give her a name that was honest and a love that was great and rise or fall with her  pan had belief in human nature  in endless ways his little acts of faith had borne fruit  the hunters stayed up later than usual and had to be reminded twice by pan of the strenuous morrow  when pan made for his own bed mac new followed him in the darkness  smith id like a word with you said the outlaw under his breath his eyes gleamed out of his dark face  sure mac glad to hear you replied pan not without a little shock  ive stuck on heah havent i queried mac new  you sure have  i wouldnt ask a better worker  and if the drive is all i hope for ill double your money  wal i didnt come with you on my own hook rejoined the other hurriedly  leastways it wasnt my idee  hardman got wind of your hosstrappin scheme  thet was after hed fired me without my wages then he sent fer me an he offered me gold to get a job with you an keep him posted if you ketched any big bunch of hosses  here the outlaw clinked the gold coin in his coat pocket  i took the gold an said id do it went on mac new deliberately but i never meant to doublecross you an i havent  reckon i might have told you before  it jest didnt come though till tonight  thanks mac returned pan extending his hand to the outlaw  i wasnt afraid to trust you  hardmans playing a high hand then  reckon he is an thets a hunch  all right mac  im thinking youre square with me replied pan  after the outlaw left pan sat on his bed pondering this latest aspect of the situation  mac news revelation was what pan would have expected of such a character  bad as he was he seemed a white man compared with this underhanded greedy hardman  even granting hardmans gradual degeneration pan could not bring himself to believe the man would attempt any open crooked deal  still this attempt to bribe mac new had a dubious look  pan did not like it  if his wild horse expedition had not reached the last day he would have sent blinky back to marco or have gone himself to see if hardmans riders could be located  but it was too late  pan would not postpone the drive come what might     chapter thirteen  at last the cold night wind reminded pan that he had not yet rolled in his blankets which he had intended to do until mac news significant statement had roused somber misgiving  he went to bed yet despite the exertions of the long day slumber was a contrary thing that he could not woo  he lay under the transparent roof of a makeshift shelter of boughs through which the stars showed white and brilliant  for ten years and more he had lain out on most nights under the open sky with wind and rain and snow working their will on him and the bright stars like strange eyes watching him  during the early years of his range life he used to watch the stars in return and wonder what was their message and now since his return home he seemed so much closer to his beloved boyhood  tonight the stars haunted him  over the ridge tops a few miles they were shining in the window of lucys tiny room perhaps lighting her fair face  it seemed that these stars were telling him all was not well in lucys mind and heart  he could not shake the insidious vague haunting thought and longed for dawn so that in the sunlight he could dispel all morbid doubts and the shadows that came in the night  so for hours he lay there absorbed in mind  it was not so silent a night as usual  the horses were restless as if some animal were prowling about  he could hear the sudden trampling of hoofs as a number of horses swiftly changed their location  the coyotes were in full chorus out in the valley  a cold wind fitfully stirred the branches whipped across his face  one of his comrades blinky he thought was snoring heavily  pan grew unaccountably full of dread of unknown things  his sensitive mind had magnified the menace hinted at by mac new  it was a matter of feeling which no intelligent reasoning could dispel  midnight came before he finally dropped into restless slumber  at four oclock lying juan called the men to get up  he had breakfast almost ready  with groans and grunts and curses the hunters rolled out heavy with sleep stiff of joints vacant of mind  blinky required two calls  they ate in the cold gray dawn silent and glum  a hot breakfast acted favorably upon their mental and physical makeups and some brisk action in catching and saddling horses brought them back to normal still there was not much time for talk  the morning star was going down in an intense dark blue sky when the seven men rode out upon their longplanned drive  the valley was a great obscure void gray silent betraying nothing of its treasure to the hunters  they crossed the wash below the fence where they had dug entrance and exit and turned west at a brisk trot  daylight came lingeringly  the valley cleared of opaque light  like a gentle rolling sea it swept away to west and north divided by its thin dark line and faintly dotted by bands of wild horses  in the eastern sky over the far low gap where the valley failed the pink light deepened to rose and then to red  a disk of golden fire tipped the bleak horizon  the whole country became transformed as if with life  the sun had risen on this memorable day for pan smith and his father and for blinky somers  nothing of the black shadows and doubts and fears of night  pan could have laughed at himself in scorn here was the sunrise  how beautiful the valley  there were the wild horses grazing near and far innumerable hundreds and thousands of them  the thought of the wonderful drive gripped pan in thrilling fascination  horses  horses  horses  the time the scene the impending ride called to him as nothing ever had  the thrilling capture of wild horses would alone have raised him to the heights  how much more tremendous then an issue that meant a chance of happiness for all his loved ones  it was seven oclock when pan and his men reached the western elevation of the valley something over a dozen miles from their fence and trap from this vantage point pan could sweep the whole country with farsighted eyes  what he saw made them glisten  wild horses everywhere like dots of brush on a bare green rolling prairie  boys well ride down the valley now and pick a place where we split to begin the drive said pan  hosses way down there look to me like they was movin this way observed blinky who had eyes like a hawk  pan had keen eyes too but he did not believe his could compare with blinkys  that worthy had the finest of all instruments of human visionclear lightgray eyes like that of an eagle  dark eyes were not as farseeing on range and desert as the gray or blue  and it was a fact that pan had to ride down the valley a mile or more before he could detect a movement of wild horses toward him  wal reckon mebbe thet dont mean nothin said blinky  an then agin mebbe it does  hosses run around a lot of their own accord  an agin they get scared of somethin  if we run into some bunches haidin this way well turn them back an thets work for us  pan called a halt there and after sweeping his gaze over all the valley ahead he said we split here  mac you and brown ride straight toward the slope  mac take a stand a half mile or so out brown you go clear to the slope and build a fire so we can see your smoke  give us five minutes say to see your smoke and then start the drive  reckon well hold our line all right till they get to charging us  and when we close in down there by the gate itll be every man for himself  ill bet itll be a stampede  pan sent lying juan to take up a stand a mile or more outside of mac new  gus and blinky were instructed to place equal distances between themselves and juan  pans father left with them and rode to a ridge top in plain sight a mile away  pan remained where he had reined his horse  sort of work for them even to dad soliloquized pan half amused at his own tremendous boyish eagerness  all his life he had dreamed of some such great experience with horses  he could see about half of the valley floor which was to be driven the other half lay over the rolling ridges and obscured by the haze and yellow clouds of dust rising here and there  those dust clouds had not appeared until the last quarter of an hour or so and they caused pan curiosity that almost amounted to anxiety  surely bands of horses were running  suddenly a shot rang out over to pans left  his father was waving hat and gun  far over against the green background of slope curled up a thin column of blue smoke  browns signal  in a few moments the drive would be on  pan got off to tighten cinches  well sorrel old boy you look fit for the drive said pan patting the glossy neck  but ill bet youll not be so slick and fat tonight  when he got astride again he saw his father and the next driver heading their horses south  so he started sorrel and the drive had begun  he waved his sombrero at his father  and he waved it in the direction of home with a message to lucy  pan rode at a trot  it was not easy to hold in sorrel  he wanted to go  he scented the wild horses  he knew there was something afoot and he had been given a long rest  soon pan was riding down into one of the shallow depressions the hollows that gave the valley its resemblance to a ridged sea  thus he lost sight of the foreground when half a mile below he reached a wave crest of ground he saw bands of wild horses enough to make a broken line half across the valley traveling toward him  they had their heads north and were moving prettily probably a couple of miles distant  beyond them other bands scattered and indistinct but all in motion convinced pan that something had startled the horses or they had sensed the drive  no difference now shouted pan aloud  were going to run your legs off and catch a lot of you  the long black line of horses did not keep intact  it broke into sections and then into bands most of which sheered to the left  but one herd of about twenty kept on toward pan  he halted sorrel  they came within a hundred yards before they stopped as if frozen  how plump and shiny they were  the lean wild heads and ears all stood up  a mousecolored mare was leading this bunch  she whistled shrilly and then a big roan stallion trotted out from behind  he jumped as if he had been struck and taking the lead swung to pans left manifestly to get by him  but they had to run up hill while pan had only to keep to a level  he turned them before they got halfway to a point even with the next driver  away they swept running wild a beautiful sight the roan and mare leading with the others massed behind manes and tails flying dust rolling from under their clattering hoofs  then pan turned ahead again working back toward his place in the driving line  he had a better view here  he saw his father and gus and blinky ride toward each other to head off a scattered string of horses  the leaders were too swift for the drivers and got through the line but most of the several herds were headed and turned  gun shots helped to send them scurrying down the valley  two small bands of horses appeared coming west along the wash  pan loped sorrel across to intercept them  they were ragged and motley altogether a score or more of the broomtails that had earned that unflattering epithet  they had no leader and showed it in their indecision  they were as wild as jack rabbits and upon sighting pan they wheeled in their tracks and fled like the wind down the valley pan saw them turn a larger darkercolored herd  this feature was what he had mainly relied upon  wonderful luck of this kind might attend the drive even a broken line running the right way would sweep the valley from wash to slope  but that was too much for even pans most extravagant hopes  again he lost sight of the horses and his comrades as he rode down a long swell of the valley sea  the slope ahead was long and gradual and it mounted fairly high  pan was keen to see the field from that vantage point  still he did not hurry  any moment a band of horses might appear and he wanted always to have plenty of spare room to ride across to left or right  once they got the lead of him or even with him it would be almost impossible to turn them  not however until he had surmounted the next ridge did he catch sight of any more wild horses  then he faced several miles of almost level valley with the only perceptible slope toward the left  for the first time he saw all the drivers  they were holding a fairly straight line as pan had anticipated the drive was slowly leading away from the wash diagonally toward the great basin that constituted the bottom of the valley floor  bands of horses were running south bobbing under the dust clouds  there were none within a mile of pan  the other men beyond the position of pans father would soon be called upon to do some riding  as pan kept on at a fast trot he watched in all directions expecting to see horses come up out of a hollow or over a ridge also he took a quick glance every now and then in the direction of his comrades  they were working ahead of him more and more to the left  therefore a wide gap soon separated pan from his father  this occasioned him uneasiness because they would soon be down on a level where palls of dust threatened to close over the whole valley and it would be impossible to see any considerable distance  if the wild horses then took a notion to wheel and run back up the valley the drive would yield great results  suddenly way over close to the wash pan espied a string of horses emerging from the thin haze of dust  he galloped down and across to intercept them  as he drew closer he was surprised to see they were in a dead run  these horses were unusually wild as if they had been frightened  they appeared bent on running pan down and he had to resort to firing his gun to turn them  it was a heavy fortyfive caliber the report of which was loud  then after they had veered he had to race back across a good deal more than his territory to keep them from going round him  at last they headed back into the dustycurtained blackstreaked zone which constituted the bowl of the valley  this little race had warmed sorrel  he had entered into the spirit of the drive  pan found that the horse sighted wild horses more quickly than he and wanted to chase them all  pan rode a mile to the left somewhat up hill and also forward  he caught sight of his father and two other riders rather far ahead riding shooting either behind or in front of a waving pall of dust the ground down there was dry and though covered with grass and sage it had equally as much bare surface from which the plunging hoofs kicked up the yellow smoke  pan had a front of two miles and more to guard and the distance was increasing every moment  the drive swept down to the left massing toward the apex where the fence and slope met  this was still miles away  pan could see landmarks he recognized high up on the horizon many bands of horses were now in motion  they streaked to and fro across lighter places in the dust cloud  pan wanted to stay out in the clear so that he could see distinctly but he was already behind his comrades  no horses were running up the wash  so he worked over toward where he had last observed his father and gave up any attempt at further orderly driving  it was plain that his comrades had soon broken the line  probably in such a case where so many horses were running it was not possible to keep a uniform front  but pan thought they could have done better  he saw strings of horses passing him to the left  they had broken through  this was to be expected  no doubt the main solid mass was now on a stampede toward the south  pan let stragglers and small bunches go by him  there were however no large bands of horses running back at least that he could see  he rode to and fro at a fast clip across this dustclouded basin heading what horses happened to come near him  the melee of dust and animals thickened  he now heard the clipclop of hoofs here there everywhere with the mass of sound to the fore  presently he appeared surrounded by circles of dust and stringing horses  it was like a huge corral full of frightened animals running wild through dust so thick that they could not be seen a hundred feet distant  pan turned horses back but he could not tell how quickly they would wheel again and elude him  once he thought he saw a rider on a white mount yet could not be sure then he decided he was mistaken for none of blinkys horses were white  this melee down in the dusty basin was bad  driving was hampered by the obscurity  pan could only hope the main line of wild horses was sweeping on as it had started  after a long patrol in the dust and heat of that valley flat pan emerged it seemed into clearer atmosphere  he was working up horses were everywhere and it was ridiculous to try to drive all those he encountered  at length there were none running back  all were heading across to and fro or down the valley  and when pan reached the long ascent of that bowl he saw a magnificent spectacle  a long black mass of horses was sweeping onward toward the gateway to the corrals and to the fence  dust columns like smoke curled up from behind them and swung low on the breeze  pan saw riders behind them and to the left  he had perhaps been the only one to go through that valley bowl  the many bands of horses now converged into one great herd had no doubt crossed it  they were fully four miles distant  pan saw his opportunity to cut across and down to the right toward where the fence met the wash  if the horses swerved as surely some or all of them would do he could head them off  to that end he gave sorrel free rein and had a splendid run of several miles to the point halfway between the fence and the wash  here from a high point of ground he observed the moving pace of dust and saw the black wheelshaped mass of horses sweep down the valley like a storm  the spectacle was worth all the toil and time he had given even if not one beast was captured  but pan with swelling heart and beaming eye felt assured of greater success than he had hoped for  there were five thousand horses in that band more by ten times than he had ever before seen driven  they could not all get through that narrow gateway to the corrals  pan wondered how his few riders could have done so well  luck  the topography of the valley the wild horses took the lanes of least resistance and the level or downhill ground favored a broad direct line toward the fence trap pan and his men had contrived  looks like dad and all the rest of them have swung round on this side soliloquized pan straining his eyes  that was good but pan could not understand how they had ever accomplished it  perhaps they had been keen enough to see that the wild horses would now have to go through the gateway or turn south along the fence  pan watched eagerly  whatever was going to happen must come very soon as swiftly as those fast wild horses could run another mile  he saw them sweep down on the bluff and round it and then begin to spread to disintegrate  again dust clouds settled over one place  it was in the apex  what a vortex of furious horses must be there  pan lost sight of them for some moments  then out of the yellow curtain streaked black strings traveling down the fence toward pan across the valley back up the way they had come  pan let out a stentorian yell of victory  he knew the action indicated that the horses had poured in a mass into the apex between bluff and fence  whoopee yelled pan to relieve his surcharged emotions  its a sure bet weve got a bunch  then he spurred sorrel to meet the horses fleeing down along the fence they came in bunches in lines stringing for a mile or more along the barrier of cedars  pan met them with yells and shouts  frantic now the animals wheeled back  but few of them ran up out of the winding shallow ground along which the fence had been cunningly built  he drove them back up over the slow ascent toward the great dusty swarm of horses that ran helterskelter under the dust haze  suddenly pan espied a black stallion racing toward him  he remembered the horse  and the desire to capture this individual took strong hold upon him  the advantage lay all with pan  so he held back to stop this stallion  at the most favorable moment pan spurred sorrel to intercept the stallion  but the black maddened with terror and instinct to rage would not swerve out of pans way  on he came swift as the wind lean black head out mane flying a wild creature at once beautiful and fearful  pan had to jerk sorrel out of his way  then pan having the black between himself and the fence turned sorrel loose  the race beganwith pan still holding the advantage  it did not however last long that way  the black ran away from pan  he wanted to shoot but thought it best not to use his last shells  what a stride  he was a big horse too ragged rangy with action and power that delighted pan  knowing he could not catch the black pan cut across toward the wash  then the stallion seeing the yawning gulf ahead turned toward the fence and quickening that marvelous stride he made a magnificent leap right at the top of the obstruction  he cleared the heavy wood and crashed through the branches to freedom  you black sonofagun yelled pan in sheer admiration and halting the sorrel he watched the stallion disappear  dust begrimed and wet pan once more headed toward the goal  his horse was tired and so was he  far as he could view in a fanshaped spread wild horses were running back up the valley  pan estimated he saw thousands but there were no heavy black masses no sweeping stormlike clouds of horses such as had borne down on that corner of the valley  he was weary but he could have sung for very joy  happily his thoughts reverted to lucy and the future  he would pick out a couple of beautiful ponies for her and break them gently  he would find some swift sturdy horses for himself  then as many thousands of times he thought of his first horse curly  none could ever take his place  but how he would have loved to own the black stallion  im just as glad though he got away mused pan  the afternoon was half gone and hazy owing to the drifting clouds of dust that had risen from the valley  as pan neared the end of the fence which was still a goodly distance from the gateway he was surprised that he did not see any horses or men  the wide brush gates had been closed  beyond them and over the bluff he saw clouds of dust like smoke rising lazily as if just stirred  horses in the corrals he exclaimed  ill bet theyre full gee now comes the problem  but we could hold a thousand head there for a weekmaybe ten days  theres water and grass  reckon though ill sell tomorrow  he would have hurried on but for the fact that sorrel had begun to limp  pan remembered going over a steep soft bank where the horse had stumbled  dismounting pan walked the rest of the way to the bluff beginning to think it strange he did not see or hear any of his comrades  no doubt they were back revelling in the corrals full of wild horses  its been a great day  if only i could get word to lucy  pan opened the small gate and led sorrel into the lane  still he did not see anything of the men  he did hear however a snorting trampling of many horses over in the direction of the farther corral  at the end of the bluff where the line of slope curved in deep pan suddenly saw a number of saddled horses without riders  with a violent start he halted  there were men strange men standing in groups lounging on the rocks sitting down all as if waiting  a little to the left of these pans lightning swift gaze took in another group  his men  not lounging not conversing but aloof from each other lax and abject or strung motionless  bewildered shocked pan swept his eyes back upon the strangers  hardman  purcell he gasped starting back as if struck  then his mind leaped to conclusions  he did not need to see blinky approach him with hard sullen face  hardman and outfit had timed the wildhorse drive  no doubt they had participated in it and meant to profit by that or worse they meant to claim the drive and by superior numbers force that issue  such a terrible fury possessed pan that he burned and shook all over he dropped his bridle and made a dragging step to meet blinky  but so great was his emotion that he had no physical control  he waited after that bursting of his heart he slowly changed  this then was the strange untoward thing that had haunted him  all the time fate had held this horrible crisis in abeyance waiting to crush at the last moment his marvelous good fortune  that had been the doubt the misgiving the inscrutable something which had opposed all pans optimism his hope his love  an icy sickening misery convulsed him for a moment  but that could not exist in the white heat of his wrath  blinky did not stride up to pan  he hated this necessity  his will was forcing his steps and they were slow  blinkblink whispered pan hoarsely  its come  that damned hunch we feared but wouldnt believe  by gawd ii couldnt hev told you replied blinky just as hoarsely  an it couldnt be worse  blinkthen we made a good haul  cowboy nobody ever heerd of such a haul  we could moonshine wild hosses fer a hundred years an never ketch as many  howmany queried pan sharply his voice breaking clear  reckon we dont agree on figgerin thet  i say fifteen hundred haid your dad whos aboot crazy reckons two thousand  an the other fellars come in between  fifteen hundred horses ejaculated pan intensely  heavens but its great  pan i wish to gawd we hadnt ketched any declared blinky in hard fierce voice  that brought pan back to earth  whats their game he asked swiftly indicating the watching whispering group  i had only a few words with hardman  your dad went out of his haid reckon hed have done fer hardman with his bare hands if purcell hadnt knocked him down with the butt of a gun  again there was a violent leap of pans blood  it jerked his whole frame  blink did that big brute asked pan hoarsely suddenly breaking off  he shore did  your dads got a nasty knock over the eye  no i hadnt any chance to talk to hardman  but his games as plain as that big nose of his  well what is it snapped pan  shore hell grab our hosses or most of them returned blinky  you mean straight horse stealing  shore thets what itll be  but the hell of it is hardmans outfit helped make the drive  no  you bet they did  thets what galls me  either they was layin fer the day or just happened to ride up on us an figgered it out  mebbe thets where mac new comes in  blink i dont believe hes doublecrossed us declared pan stoutly  wal hes an outlaw  no difference  i just dont believe it  but well find out  so you think hardman will claim most of our horses or take them all  i shore do  blink if he gets one of our horses itll be over my dead body  you fellows sure showed yellow clear throughto let them ride in here without a fight  hellsfire cried blinky as if stung  what you think   there wasnt a one of us thet had a single lead left fer our guns  thets where the rub comes in  we played their game  wasted a lot of shells on them damn broomies  so how could we fight  ahhuh groaned pan appalled at the fatality of the whole incident  pan i reckon youd better swaller the dose bitter as it is an bluff hardman into leavin us a share of the hosses  say man are you drunk or loco flashed pan scornfully  with that he whirled on his heel and strode toward where hardman purcell and another man stood somewhat apart from the lounging riders  slowly blinky followed in pans footsteps and then mac new left the group in the shade of the wall and shuffled out into the sunlight his action was that of a forceful man dangerous to encounter  in the dozen rods or more that pan traversed to get to hardman he had reverted to the old wild spirit of the cimarron  that cold dark wind which had at times swept his soul returned with his realization of the only recourse here  when he had walked the streets of marco waiting for matthews to prove his mettle or show his cowardice he had gambled on the latter  he had an uncanny certainty that he had only to bluff the sheriff  here was a different proposition  it would take bloodshed to halt this gang  as pan approached purcell swung around square with his hands low a significant posture  hardman evinced signs of extreme nervous tension the third man walked apart from them  all the others suddenly abandoned their lounging attitude  hardman whats your game queried pan bluntly as he halted  the words the pause manifestly relieved hardman for he swallowed hard and braced himself  game he parried gruffly  theres no game about drivin a million wild hosses through the dust  it was work  dont try to twist words with me replied pan fiercely  whats your game  do you mean a straight out and out horsethief deal  or a share and share divvy on the strength of your riding in where you werent asked  young man im warnin you not to call me a hoss thief shouted hardman growing red under his beard  ill call you one damn quick if you dont tell your game  we made the drive smith returned hardman  youd never made it without us  an that gives us the biggest share  say twothirds ill buy your third at ten dollars a head  hardman thats a rotten deal burst out pan  havent you any sense  if you could make it youd be outlawed in this country  men wont stand for such things  you may be strong in marco but i tell you even there you cant go too far  we planned this trap  we worked like dogs  and we made the drive  you might account for more horses trapped but no difference  you had no business here  we can prove it  wal if ive got the hosses i dont care what you say retorted hardman finding bravado as the interview progressed  it was no use to try to appeal to any sense of fairness in this man pan saw that and his passionate eloquence died in his throat  coldly he eyed hardman and then the greasy dustcaked face of purcell  he could catch only the steely speculation in purcells evil eyes  he read there that if the man had possessed the nerve he would have drawn on him at the first  meanwhile blinky had come up beside pan and a moment later mac new neither had anything to say but their actions especially mac news were not to be misunderstood  the situation became intense  hardman suddenly showed the strain  pans demeanor however might have been deceiving except to the keenest of men long versed in such encounters  jard hardman youre a lowdown horse thief said pan deliberately  the taunt thrown in hardmans face added to the tension of the moment  he had lost the ruddy color under his beard  his eyes stood out  he recognized at last something beyond his power to change or stop  smith reckon youve cause for temper he said huskily  ill take half the hossesan buy your half  no  not one damn broomtail do you get returned pan in a voice that cut  look out hardman  i can prove you hatched up this deal to rob me  how id like to know blustered the rancher relaxing again  mac new can prove it  whos he  hurd here  his real name is mac new  you hired him to get in with meto keep you posted on my movements  again hardman showed his kind of fiber under extreme provocation  yes i hired himan hes doublecrossed you as well as me  did he  well now you prove that flashed pan who had read the furious falseness of the man  purcell here replied hardman hoarsely hes been camped below hurd met him at nightkept him posted on your work  then when all was ready for the drive purcell sent for me  ask him yourself  pan did not answer to the suggestion  mac what do you say to that he queried sharply but he never took his eyes off purcell  hardman youre a liar roared mac new sonorously  if ever pan heard menace in a voice it was then  take it back went on the outlaw now with a hiss  square me with panhandle smith  mac he doesnt have to square you  anyone could see hes a liar called pan derisively  hurd iill have you shotill shoot you myself burst out hardman wrestling his arm toward his hip  a thundering report close beside pan almost deafened him  hardman uttered a loud gasp  his eyes rolledfixed in awful stony stare then like a flung sack he fell heavily  thar jard hardman declared the outlaw i had one bullet left and he threw his empty gun with violence at the prostrate body  purcells long taut body jerked into swift action  his gun spurted red as it leaped out  pan quick as he drew and shot was too late to save mac new  both men fell without a cry their heads almost meeting  blink grab their guns yelled pan piercingly and leaping over the bodies he confronted the stricken group of men with leveled weapon  hands up  quick damn you he ordered fiercely  his swiftness his tremendous passion following instantly upon tragedy had shocked hardmans men  up went their hands  then blinky ran in with a gun in each hand and his wild aspect most powerfully supplemented pans furious energy and menace  fork them hosses you    yelled blinky  death for more of them quivered in the balance  as one man hardmans riders rushed with thudding boots and tinkling spurs to mount their horses  several did not wait for further orders but plunged away down the lane toward the outlet  rustle hoss thieves added blinky with something of the old drawl in his voice that yet seemed the more deadly for it  with quick strides he had gotten behind most of the riders  get out of heah  with shuffling creaking of leather and suddenly cracking hoofs the order was obeyed  the riders soon disappeared around the corner of the bluff     chapter fourteen  the two horses left belonging to hardman and purcell neighed loudly at being left behind and pulled on their halters  pans quick eye caught sight of a rifle in a sheath on one of the saddles  he ran to get it but had to halt and approach the horse warily  but he secured the riflea winchesterfully loaded  blinky observing pans act repeated it with the other horse  pard i aint figgerin theyll fight even from cover said blinky by gosh this hoss must have been purcells  shore  stirrups too long for hardman  an the saddle bag is full of shells  slip along the fence and see where they went replied pan  aw i can lick the whole outfit now declared blinky recklessly  you keep out of sight ordered pan  whereupon blinky growling something crashed a way through the cedar fence and disappeared  pan hurriedly sheathed his gun and with the rifle in hand ran back to the overhanging bluff where he began to climb through the brush fierce action was necessary to him then  he did not spare himself forever he halfexpected some kind of attack from the men who had been driven away  soon he had reached a point where he could work round to the side of the bluff  when he looked out upon the valley he espied hardmans outfit two miles down the slope beyond the cedar fence they had set fire to the cedars  a column of yellow smoke rolled way across the valley  ahhuh  theyre rustlingall right panted pan  wonder whatkind of a storytheyll tell  looks to melike theyd better keep clear of marco  then a reaction set in upon pan  he crawled into the shade of some brush and stretched out letting his tight muscles relax  the terrible something released its hold on mind and heart  he was sick  he fought with himself until the spasm passed  when he got back to his men blinky had just returned  did you see them shakin up the dust queried blinky  yes theyre gone  reckon weve no more to fear from them  huh  we never had nothin  shore was a yellow outfit  they set fire to our fence the     it took some effort for pan to approach his father  the feeling deep within him was inexplicable  but then he had never before been compelled to face his father after a fight  pans relation to him seemed of long ago  how are you dad he asked with constraint  little shakyi guessson came the husky reply  but smith got up and removed his hand from the bloody wound on his forehead  it was more of a bruise than a cut but the flesh was broken and swollen  nasty bump dad  ill bet youll have a headache  go to camp and bathe it in cold water  then get juan to bandage it  all right replied his father  he forced himself to look up at pan his eyes were warming out of deep strange shadows of pain of horror son ii was kind of dazed whenwhen youthe fight come off  i heard the shots but i didnt see  was it you whowho killed jard hardman  no dad replied pan placing a steady hand on his fathers shoulder indeed he seemed more than physically shaken  but i meant to  then howwho choked smith  mac new shot him replied pan hurriedly  hardman accused him of doublecrossing me  mac called him  i think hardman tried to draw but mac killed him  i got purcell too late to save mac  awful replied smith hoarsely  pan i seen purcells eyes spoke up blinky  shore he meant to drop mac an you in two shots  but he wasnt quite previous enough  i wastoo slow myself rejoined pan haltingly  mac new was an outlaw but he was white compared to hardman  wal its all over  lets kinda get set back in our saddles drawled blinky  whatll we do with them stiffs  by george thats a stumper replied pan sitting down in the shade  huh  reckon you figger we ought to pack them back to marco an give them church services said blinky in disgust  jest a couple of twobit rustlers  somebody will come out here after their bodies surely  dick hardman would want to  mebbe someone will but not thet hombre declared blinky  but im gamblin hardmans outfit wont break their necks tellin aboot this now you jest see  well lets wait then replied pan  wrap them up in tarps and lay them here in the shade  the trapped wild horses cracking their hoofs and whistling in the huge corrals did not at the moment attract pan or wean him away from the deep unsettled condition of mind  as he passed the corral on the way to the camp the horses moved with a trampling roar  the sound helped him toward gaining a hold on his normal self  the hour now was near sunset and the heat of day had passed  a cool light breeze made soft low sound in the trees  pan found his father sitting with bandaged head beside the campfire apparently recovering somewhat  did you take a peep at our hosses he asked  no not yet replied pan  i reckon i will though before it gets dark  weve got a big job ahead  that depends dad  if we can sell them here we havent any job to speak of  how about it blink  how aboot what inquired the cowboy who had just come up  dads worrying over what he thinks will be a big job  handling the horses weve caught  shore thet all depends  if we sell heah fine an dandy  the other fellar will have the hell  reckon though we want to cut out a string of the best hosses fer ourselves  thets work when youve got a big drove millin round  shore is lucky we built thet mileround corral theres water an feed enough to last them broomies a week or longer on a pinch  while they were talking gus and charley brown returned to camp  they were leading the horses that had been ridden by hardman and purcell  turn them loose boys directed pan to whom they looked for instructions  presently gus handed pan a heavy leather wallet and a huge roll of greenbacks  found the wallet on purcell an the roll on hardman said gus  wal they shore was well heeled drawled blinky  but whatll i do with all this queried pan blankly  pan as you seem to forget hardman owed your dad money reckon you might rustle an hunt up dick hardman an give it to him  say dickll own the yellow mine now  gee  he could spend all this in his own joint  dad you never told me how much hardman did you out of pan  ten thousand in cash an lord only knows how many cattle  so much  id imagined  say dad will you take this money  yes if its honest an regular for me to do so replied smith stoutly  regular  theres no law in marco  weve got to make our own laws let it be a matter of conscience  boys this man hardman ruined my father  i heard that from a reliable source at littleton before i ever got here  dont you think it honest for dad to take this money  shore its more than thet replied blinky  id call it justice if you turned thet money over to law in marco itd go to matthews  an you can bet your socks hed keep it  the consensus of opinion did not differ materially from blinkys  dad its a long trail that has no turning said pan tossing both wallet and roll to his father  heres to your new ranch in arizona  lying juan soon called them to supper  it was not the usual cheery meal though juan told an unusually atrocious lie and blinky made several attempts to be funny  the sudden terrible catastrophe of the day did not quickly release its somber grip  after supper however there seemed to be a lessening of restraint with the conversation turning to the corrals full of wild horses  wal lets go an look em over proposed blinky  pan was glad to see his father able and eager to accompany them but he did not go himself  come on you wildhoss trapper called blinky  we want to bet on how rich we are  ill come presently replied pan  he did not join them however but made his way along the north slope to a high point where he could look down into the second corral  it was indeed a sight to fill his heartthat wide mileround grassy pasture so colorful with its droves of wild horses  black predominated but there were countless whites reds bays grays pintos  he saw a blue roan that shone among the duller horses too far away to enable pan to judge of his other points  pan gazed with stern restraint trying to estimate the numbers without wild guess of enthusiasm  more than fifteen hundred he soliloquized at last breathing hard too good to be true  yet there they are  if only that  well no matter  i didnt force it  i wasnt to blame  maybe we can keep it from mother and lucy  pan did not start back to camp until after nightfall when he heard blinky call  say you make a fellar nervous declared blinky in relief as pan approached the bright campfire  wal did you take a peep at em  yes  its sure a roundup replied pan  id say between fifteen and sixteen hundred head  aw youre just as locoed as any of us  whereupon they fell into a great argument about the number of horses and though pan had little part in it he gradually conceived an idea that he had underestimated them  say fellows he said breaking up the discussion if hardmans gang raises a row in marco well know tomorrow  shore but i tell you they wont returned blinky doggedly  well look for trouble anyway  and meanwhile well go right on with our job  thatll be roping and hobbling the horses we want to keep well turn them loose here or build another corral  hey blinkhow about a string for your ranch in arizona  whoopee yelled the cowboy  pan had heard blinky yell that way before  he clapped his hands over his ears for no more mighty pealing human sound than blinkys famous yell ever rose to the skies  when pan took his hands away from his cars he caught the clapping echoes ringing prolonged back from bluff to slope winding away to mellow to soften to die in beautiful concatenation far up in the wild breaks of the hills  pan lay awake in his blankets  he had retired early leaving his companions continuing their arguments their conjectures and speculations  the campfire flared up and died down according to the addition of new fuel  the light flickered on the trees in fantastic and weird shadows  at length there was only a dull red glow left and quiet reigned  the men had sought their beds  then the solemn wilderness shut down on pan with the loneliness and solitude and silence that he loved  but this night there were burdens he could not sleep  he could not keep his eyes shut  what question shone down in the pitiless stars  something strange and inscrutable weighed upon him  was it a regurgitation of his early moods when first he became victim to the wildness of the ranges  was it newborn conscience stirred by his return to his mother by his love for lucy he seemed to be haunted  reason told him that it was well he had come to fight for his father  he could not be blamed for the machinations of evil men  he suffered no regret no remorse  yet there was something that he could not understand  it was a physical sensation that gave him a chill creeping of his flesh  it was also a spiritual shrinking a withdrawing from what he knew not  he had to succumb to a power of the unseen  other times he had felt the encroachment of this insidious thing but vague and raw  whisky had been a cure  temptation was now strong upon him to seek his companions and dull his faculties with strong drink but he could not yield to that  not now with lucys face like a wraith floating in the starlight  he was conscious of a larger growth he had accepted responsibilities that long ago he should have taken up he now dreamed of love home children  yet beautiful as was that dream it could not be realized in these days without the deadly spirit and violence to which he had just answered  that was the bitter anomaly  next morning in the sweet cedartanged air and the rosygold of the sunrise pan was himself again keen for the day  pard you get first pick of the wild hosses announced blinky  no well share even declared pan  say boy reckon wed not had any hosses this mawnin but fer you rejoined his comrade  an some of us might not hev been so lively an full of joy  look at your dad  shore youd never think thet yestiddy he had his haid broke an his heart too  now just would you  well blink now you call my attention to it dad does look quite chipper observed pan calmly  but he felt a deep gladness for this fact he so lightly mentioned  blinky bent to his ear pard it was the money thet perked him up whispered the cowboy  pan reflected that his fathers loss and continued poverty had certainly weakened him dragged him down  listen blink said pan earnestly  i dont want to be a killjoy things do look wonderful for us  but i havent dared yet to let myself go  youre a happygolucky devil and dad is past the age of fight it wont stay before his mind  but i feel fight  and i cant be gay because something tells me the fight isnt over  wal pard drawled blinky with his rare grin the way i feel aboot fight is thet i aint worryin none if youre around  all the same old pard ill take your hunch an you can bet your life ill be watchin like a hawk till we shake the dirty dust of marco  good blinky that will help me  well both keep our eyes open today so we cant be surprised by anybody  pans father approached briskly his face shining  he was indeed a different man  boys are we goin to loaf round camp all day  no dad were going to rope the best of the broomtails  ill get a chance to see you sling a lasso  say id tackle it at that laughed his father  blinky trapping these wild horses and handling them are two different things remarked pan thoughtfully  reckon ill have to pass the buck to you  wal pard im shore there  well chase all the hosses into the big corral  then well pick out one at a time an if we caint rope him without scarin the bunch too bad well chase him into the small corral  ahuh  all right  but ill miss my guess if we dont have a hot dusty old time replied pan  fellars called blinky come ararin now an dont any of you fergit your guns  how about hobbles inquired pan  ive got a lot of soft rope an some burlap strips  gus and brown brought in the saddle horses and soon the men were riding down to the corrals  this was a most satisfactory incident for all concerned and there were none not keen and excited to see the wild horses to pick and choose and begin the days work  upon their entrance to the first and smaller corral a string of lean ragged wildeyed mustangs trooped with a clattering roar back into the larger corral  wal boys the show begins drawled blinky  mr smith you an charley take your stands by the gate to open it when you see us comin with a broomie we want to rope  an pan you an me an gus will ride around easy like not pushin the herd at all  theyll scatter an mill around till theyre tired  then theyll bunch  when we see one we want well cut him out an shore rope him if we get close enough but i reckon itd be better to drive the one we want into the small corral rope an hobble him an turn him out into the pasture  the larger corral was not by any means round or level and it was so big that the mass of horses in a far corner did not appear to cover a hundredth part of the whole space  there were horses all over the corral along the fences especially but the main bunch were as far away as they could get from their captors and all faced forward wild and expectant  it was a magnificent sight  whether or not there was much fine stock among them or even any the fact remained that hundreds of wild horses together in one drove captive and knowing it were collected in this great trap  the intense vitality of them the vivid coloring the beautiful action of many and the statuesque immobility of the majority were thrilling and all satisfying to the hearts of the captors  pan and blinky and gus spread out to trot their mounts across the intervening space  the wild horses moved away along the fence and halted to face about again  they let the riders approach to a hundred yards then with a trampling roar they burst into action  wild pointed noses ears heads manes and flying hoofs and tails seemed to spread from a dark compact mass  they ran to the other side of the corral where the horsemen leisurely followed them  again they broke into mighty concerted action and into thunder of hoofs  they performed this maneuver several times before the riders succeeded in scattering them all over the pasture  then with wild horses running trotting walking standing everywhere it was easy to distinguish one from another  regular lot of broomtails yelled blinky to pan  aint seen any yet id give two bits fer  reckon as always the good hosses got away  but pan inclined to the opinion that among so many there were surely a few fine animals  and so it proved  pans first choice was a blue roan a rare combination of color build and speed  the horse was a mare and had a good head  she had a brand on her left flank  pan rode around after her here there all over the field but without help he could not turn her where he wished  he had to watch her closely to keep from losing sight of her among so many moving horses and he expected any moment that the boys would come to his assistance  but they did not  whereupon pan faced about just in time to see a wonderfullooking animal shoot through the open gate into the smaller corral  blinky and gus rode after him  the gate was closed and then began a chase round the corral  the wild horse was at a disadvantage  he could not break through the fence or leap over it and presently two lassoes caught him at once one round his neck the other his feet  as he went down pan heard the piercing shriek  the two cowboys were out of their saddles in a twinkling and while gus held the horse down blinky hobbled his front feet  then they let him get up  charley brown ran to open another gate that led out into the unfenced pasture  this animal was a big chestnut with tawny mane  he leaped prodigiously though fettered by the hobbles  then he plunged and fell and rolled over  he got up to try again  he was savage grotesque awkward  the boys drove him through the gate  whoopee pealed out blinkys yell  reckon those boys know their business soliloquized pan and then he yelled for them to come and help him  it took some time for pan to find his roan but when he espied her and pointed her out to blinky and gus the chase began  it was a leisurely performance  pan did not run sorrel once  they headed the roan off hedged her in a triangle cut her out from the other horses and toward the open gate  when the mare saw this avenue of escape she bolted through it  pan being the farthest from the gate was the last to follow  and when he rode in to head off the furiously running roan gus made a beautiful throw with his lasso a whirling wide loop that seemed to shoot perpendicularly across in front of her  she ran into it and the violent check brought her down  blinky was almost waiting to kneel on her head  and gus leaping off hobbled her front feet  snorting wildly she got up and tried to leap  but she only fell  the boys roped her again and dragged her out into the pasture  aw i dont know sang blinky happily  two horses in two minutes we aint so bad fer cowboys out of a job  warming to the work they went back among the circling animals  but it was an hour before they cut out the next choice a dark bay horse inconspicuous among so many but one that proved on close inspection to be the best yet  gus had the credit of first espying this one  after that the picked horses came faster until by noon they had ten hobbled in the open pasture  two of these were pans  he had been hard to please  wal well rest the hosses an go get some chuck suggested blinky  early afternoon found them again hard at their task  the wild horses had not only grown tired from trooping around the corral but also somewhat used to the riders  that made choosing and driving and cutting out considerably easier  pan helped the boys with their choices but he had bad luck with his own  he had espied several beautiful horses only to lose them in the throng of moving beasts sometimes among a large bunch of galloping horses the dust made vision difficult  but at length more by good luck than management pan found one of those he wanted badly  it was a black stallion medium size with white face and splendid proportions  then he had to chase him and do some hard riding to keep track of him  no doubt about his speed  without heading him off or tricking him not one of the riders could stay near him  aw im sick eatin his dust shouted blinky savagely  whereupon both pan and gus inspired by blinky cut loose in dead earnest  they drove him they relayed him they cornered him and then as he bolted to get between gus and pan blinky wheeled his horse and by a mighty effort headed him with a lasso  that time both wild stallion and lassoer bit the dust  gus was on the spot in a twinkling and as the animal heaved to his feet it was only to fall into another loop  then the relentless cowboys stretched him out and hobbled him  heah now you fireeyedairpawin hossgo an get gentle panted blinky  by the time the hunters had caught three others which achievement was more a matter of patience than violence the herd had become pretty well wearied and tamed  they crowded into a mass and moved in a mass it took some clever riding at considerable risk to spread them  fine horses were few and far between  lets call it off shouted pan  im satisfied if you are  aw just one more pard implored blinky  ive had my eye on a little bay mare with four white feet  shes got a v bar brand and shes not so wild  they had to break up the bunch a dozen times before they could locate the horse blinky desired  and when pan espied the bay he did not blame blinky and from that moment as the chase went on he grew more and more covetous  what a horse for lucy  pan had been satisfied with the blue roan for her but after he saw the little bay he changed his mind  the little animal was cunning  she relied more on crowding in among the other horses than in running free and therefore she was hard to get out into the open  blinkys mount went lame guss grew so weary that he could not keep up but pans sorrel showed wonderful powers of endurance  in fact he got better all the time  it began to dawn upon pan what a treasure he had in sorrel  aw let the darn little smart filly go exclaimed blinky giving up in disgust  i never wanted her nohow  cowboy shes been my horse ever since you showed her to me replied pan  but you didnt know it  wal you hossstealin sonofagun ejaculated blinky with pleasure if you want her we shore will run her legs off  in the end they got little bayas pan had already named herinto the roping corral along with two other horses that ran in with her  and there pan chased her into a corner and threw a noose round her neck she reared and snorted but did not bolt  hey pard called blinky who was close behind  shore as youre born she knows what a rope is  see  she aint fightin it  ill bet you my shirt shes not been loose long  thet bar v brand now  new outfit on me  get off an haul up to her  pan did not need a second suggestion  he was enraptured with the beauty of the little bay  she was glossy in spite of long hair and dust and sweat  her nostrils were distended her eyes wild but she did not impress pan as being ready to kill him  he took time  he talked to her  with infinite patience he closed up on her inch by inch  and at last he got a hand on her neck  she flinched she appeared about to plunge but pans gentle hand his soothing voice kept her still  the brand on her flank was old  pan had no way to guess how long she had been free but he concluded not a great while because she was not wild  he loosened the noose of his lasso on her neck  it required more patience and dexterity to hobble her  pard this little bay is fer your gurl huh queried blinky leaning in his saddle  you guessed right blink answered pan  little bay thats her name  wal now you got thet off your chest spose you climb on your hoss an look heah added blinky  the tone of his voice the way he pointed over the cedar fence to the slope caused pan to leap into his saddle  in a moment his sweeping gaze caught horsemen and pack animals zigzagging down the trail  if its hardmans outfit by gawd theyre comin back with nerve said blinky  but i never figgered theyd come  pan cursed under his breath  how maddening to have his happy thoughts so rudely broken  in a flash he was hard and stern  ride blink he replied briefly  they called the others and hurriedly got out of the corral into the open  reckon camps the best place to meet thet outfit if theyre goin to meet us declared blinky  pans father exploded in amazed fury  cool off dad advised pan  no good to cuss  were in for something  and whatever it is lets be ready  they made their way back to camp with eyes ever on the zigzag trail where in openings among the cedars the horsemen could occasionally be seen  looks like a long string muttered pan  shore but theyre stretched out added gus  pears to me if they meant bad for us they wouldnt come pilin right down thet way  depends on how many in the outfit and what they know said pan hardmans men sure knew we werent well heeled for a shooting scrape  pard are you goin to let them ride right into camp queried blinky hard faced and keen  i guess not replied pan bluntly  rifle shot is near enough  they might pretend to be friendly till they got to us  but well sure fool them  not much more was spoken until the approaching horsemen emerged from the cedars at the foot of the slope  they rode straight toward the camp  how many asked pan  i count six riders  seven fer me an aboot as many pack horses  wal ill be damned thets all of them  mebbe theres a bunch up on the slope suggested charley brown  after a long interval fraught with anxiety and suspense during which the horsemen approached steadily growing more distinct blinky suddenly burst out fellars shore as youre born its wiggate  the horse dealer from st louis ejaculated pan in tremendous relief blink i believe youre right  i never saw one of those men before or the horses either  its wiggate son corroborated pans father  i met him once  hes a broad heavy man with a thin gray chin beard  thats him  aw hell exclaimed blinky regretfully  there wont be any fight after all  the approaching horsemen halted within earshot  hi there camp called the leader whose appearance tallied with smiths description  hello replied pan striding out  whos boss here  reckon i am  my names wiggate replied the other loudly  all right mr wiggate returned pan just as loud voiced  whats your business  friendly  give my word  i want to talk horses  come on up then  whereupon the group of horsemen advanced and presently rode in under the trees into camp  the foremost was a large man rather florid with deepset eyes and scant gray beard  his skin sunburned red instead of brown did not suggest the westerner  are you the younger smith he asked rather nervously eyeing pan  yes sir  and youre in charge here  pan nodded shortly  he sensed antagonism at least in this mans bluff front but it might not have been animosity  word come to me this morning that youd trapped a large number of horses went on wiggate  i see thats a fact  its a wonderful sight  of course you expect to make a deal for them  yes  no trading  no percentage  i want cash  theyre a shade better stock than youve been buying around marco  better grass here and theyve not been chased lean  how many  i dont know  we disagree as to numbers  but i say close to fifteen hundred head  good lord boomed the big man  its a haul indeed  ill give you our regular price twelve fifty delivered in marco  no thanks replied pan  thirteen  pan shook his head  well young man thats the best offer made so far  what do you want  ill sell for ten dollars a head cash and count and deliver them here tomorrow  sold snapped out wiggate  i can pay you tomorrow but itll take another day to get my men out here  thank youmr wiggate replied pan suddenly rather halting in speech  thatll suit us  may we pitch camp here  sure  get down and come in  plenty of water and wood  turn your horses loose  they cant get out   pan had to get away then for a while from his father and the exuberant blinky  how could they forget the dead men over there still unburied pan had read in wiggates look and speech and in the faces of his men that they had been told of the killing and surely to the discredit of pan and his followers  pan vowed he would put wiggate in possession of the facts  he gave himself some tasks all the while trying to realize the truth  fortune had smiled upon him and blinky  rich in one driveat one fell swoop  it was unbelievable  the retrieving of his fathers losses the new ranches in sunny arizona comfort and happiness for his mother for bobby and aliceand for lucy all that any reasonable woman could desirethese beautiful and sweet dreams had become possibilities  all the loneliness and privation of his hard life on the ranges had been made up for in a few short days  pans eyes dimmed and for a moment he was not quite sure of himself  later he mingled again with the men round the campfire  some of the restraint had disappeared at least in regard to wiggate and his men toward everybody except pan  that nettled him and at an opportune moment he confronted the horse buyer  howd you learn about this drive of ours he asked briefly  hardmans men rode in to marco this morning replied wiggate coldly  ahuh  and they told a cockandbull story about what happened out here flashed pan hotly  it placed you in a bad light young man  i reckon  well if you or any of your outfit or anybody else calls me a horse thief he wants to go for his gun  do you understand that  its pretty plain english replied wiggate manifestly concerned  and heres some more  jard hardman was a horse thief went on pan in rising passion  he was a lowdown yellow horse thief  he hired men to steal for him  and by god he wasnt half as white as the outlaw who killed him  outlaw  i declareweido you mean youre an floundered wiggate  we understood you killed hardman  hell no shouted blinky aflame with fury bursting into the argument  we was all there  we saw  blink you keep out of this till i ask you to talk ordered pan  smith id like to hear what he has to say  wiggate you listen to me first rejoined pan with no lessening his intensity  there are three dead men across the field not yet buried hardman his man purcell and the outlaw mac new  he called himself hurd  he was one of hardmans jailers there in marco  but i knew hurd as mac new back in montana  i saved him from being hanged  pan moistened lips too dry and too hot for his swift utterance and then he told in stern brevity the true details of that triple killing after concluding with white face and sharp gesture he indicated to his men that they were to corroborate his statement  mr wiggate its gods truth spoke up pans father earnestly  it was just retribution  hardman robbed me years ago  wal mr wiggate my say is thet itll be damned onhealthy fer anybody who doesnt believe my pard added blinky in slow dark menace  gus stepped forward without any show of the excitement that characterized the others  if you need evidence other than our word its easy to find he said mac news gun was not the same caliber as pans  an as the bullet thet killed hardman is still in his body it can be found  gentlemen that isnt necessary replied wiggate hastily with a shudder  not for me  but my men can substantiate it  that might sound well in marco  for i believe that your young leaderpanhandle smith they call himis not so black as he has been painted     chapter fifteen  the following morning while pan was away for a few hours deer hunting wiggates men accompanied by blinky attended to the gruesome detail of burying the dead men  upon pans return he learned of this and experienced relief that wiggate had taken the responsibility  wiggate had addressed him several times civilly enough but there was a restraint that pan sensed often in his encounter with men  they were usually men who did not understand westerners like himself  wiggate had all his men except the one he had sent back to marco with several of pans engaged in counting the captured wild horses  it was a difficult task and could hardly be accurate in short time  anxious to get back to marco queried wiggate not unkindly as he saw pans restlessness  yes i am now the jobs done replied pan heartily  well i wouldnt be in any hurry if i were you said the horse dealer bluntly  what do you mean queried pan  young hardman is to be reckoned with  bah burst out pan in a scorn that was rude though he meant it for hardman  that popeyed skunk  what do i care for him  excuse me i would not presume to advise you returned wiggate stiffly  aw i beg your pardon mr wiggate apologized pan  i know you mean well  and i sure thank you  wiggate did not answer but he took something from his vest pocket it was a lead bullet slightly flattened  let me see your gun he asked  pan handed the weapon to him butt first  wiggate took it gingerly and tried to fit the bullet in a chamber of the cylinder and then in the barrel  it was too large to go in  this is the bullet that killed hardman said wiggate gravely  it was never fired from your gun  i shall take pains to make this evident in marco  i dont know that it matters but im sure much obliged returned pan with warmth  well ill do it anyhow  ive been fooled by hardman and if you want to know it cheated too  thats why i broke with him  hope you didnt have any other association with himbesides horse buying  no but im lucky i didnt  hardman had his finger in a lot of things in marco  i wonder wholl take them up  say for instance some of the gold claims he jumped  well  i knew hardman had mining interests but i thought they were legitimate  its such a queer mixedup business this locating working and selling claims  i want none of it  hardmans men either at his instigation or dicks deliberately ran two of my men out of their claims  theyll tell you so  im astonished  i certainly am astonished replied wiggate and he looked it  marco is the hardest town i ever rode into declared pan  and i thought some of the prairie towns were bad  but i see now that a few wild cowboys going on a spree and shooting up a saloon or shooting each other occasionally was tame beside marco  youre right  marco is a hard place and getting worse  theres considerable gold  the new eldorado idea you know  it draws lawless men and women from places that are beginning to wake up  and they prey upon honest men  did the yellow mine belong to hardman asked pan curiously  him and matthews  young hardman claims it  hes already clashed with matthews so i heard  hell do more than clash with matthews if he isnt careful  hell cash declared pan grimly  matthews is a fourflush sheriff  he wouldnt face a dangerous man  but hed make short work of dick hardman  if im not inquisitive in askingwould you mind telling me do you mean to meet matthews and young hardman inquired wiggate hesitatingly  ill avoid them if possible rejoined pan  dad and i will get out of marco pretty pronto  were going to arizona and homestead  thats sensible  youll have money enough to start ranching  i wish you luck  i shall make this my last horse deal out here  its profitable but marco is a little tootoo raw for my blood  according to figures that the counters agreed upon there were fourteen hundred and eightysix wild horses in the trap  wiggate paid cash upon the spot  he had some bills of large denomination but most of the money was in rather small bills  pan made haste to get rid of all except his share  he doubled the wages of those who had been hired  then he divided what was left with blinky  mygawd gasped that worthy gazing with distended eyes at the enormous roll of bills  my gawd   how much heah  count it you wildeyed cowpuncher replied pan happily  its your half  but pard its too much appealed blinky  shore im robbin you this was your drive  yes and it was your outfit returned pan  you furnished the packs horses location and i furnished the execution  looks like a square deal share and share alike  all right pard replied blinky swallowing hard  if you reckon thet way  but will you keep this heah roll fer me  keep it yourself you indian  but pard ill get drunk an go on a tear  an you know how bad i am when i get lickered up  blink youre not going to drink unless in that one deal i hinted about said pan meaningly  hope we can avoid it  aw were turnin over a new leaf huh queried the cowboy in strangest voice  you are blink replied pan with a frank serious smile  ive been a respectable sober cowboy for some time  youve been terrible bad  who said so retorted blinky aggressively  i heard it at the yellow mine  that name and the implication conveyed by pan made blinky drop his head  but his somber shame quickly fled  wal pard ill stay sober as long as you  shake on it  pan made his plans to leave next morning as early as the wild horses they had hobbled could be gotten into shape to travel  wiggate expected the riders he had sent for to arrive before noon the next day and it was his opinion that he would have all the horses he had purchased out of there in a week  pan and blinky did not share this opinion  wiggate and his men were invited to try one of lying juans suppers which was so good that juan had the offer of a new job  upon being urged by pan to accept it he did so  i can recommend lying juan as the best cook and most truthful man i ever knew remarked pan  blinky rolled on the ground  haw  haw  wait till lyin juan tells you one of his whoppers  lying juan  i see  i was wondering about such a queer name for a most honest man replied wiggate  i know hes a capital cook  and i guess i can risk the rest  after supper pan and blinky took great pains cutting and fixing the ropes which they intended to use on the wild horses that were to be taken along with them  wal now thets done an i reckon id write to my sweetheart only i dont know nothin to write aboot said blinky  go to bed ordered pan  weve got to be up and at those horses by daylight  you ought to know that tieing the feet of wild horses is sure enough work  next morning it was not yet daylight when blinky drawled wal cowboys weve rolled out wrangled the hosses swallered some chuck an now fer the hell  in the gray of dawn when the kindling east had begun to dwarf the glory of the morning star the cowboys drove all the hobbled horses into the smaller corral  there they roped off a corner and hung a white tarpaulin over the rope  this was an improvised second corral where they would put the horses one by one as they tied up their feet  blinky and gus made one unit to work together and pan his father and brown constituted another  blinky as usual got in the first throw and the hungry loop of his lasso circled the front feet of the plunging roan  he stood on his head fell on his side and struggled vainly to get up  but he was in the iron hands of masters of horses  every time the roan half rose blinky would jerk him down  presently gus flopped down on his head and while the horse gave up for a moment blinky slipped the noose off one foot and tied the other foot up with it  they let the roan rise on three feet he gave a wonderful exhibition of bucking  when he slowed down they drove him behind the rope corral  the nights gone the days come the works begun sang out blinky eat dust you buckaroos  pan chose the little bay to tie up first  but after he had roped her and got up to her there did not appear to be any urgent reason for such stringent measure  little bay was spirited frightened but not wild  ill risk it said pan and led her to the rope corral  the sun rose hot and likewise the dust  the cowboys did not slacken their pace  it took two hours of exceedingly strenuous labor to tie up all the wild horses  each horse had presented a new fight  then came the quick job of packing their outfits which juan had gotten together everyone of the men had been kicked pulled knocked down and so coated with sweat and dust that they now resembled negroes  their hands were fairly cooked from the hot ropes sizzling when the horses plunged  and at nine oclock they were ready for the momentous twentyfive mile drive to marco  all ready for the parade yelled blinky  go ahaid you fellars open the gate an leave it fer me to close  pan and the others were to ride in front while blinky drove the horses  the need for men was in front not behind  as they started down the wing of the trap to open the gate the roped wild horses began a terrific plunging kicking bucking and falling down  some of them bit the rope on their feet  but little by little blinky drove them out into the open  pan and his father dropped back to each side keeping the horses in a close bunch  that left gus and brown in front to run down those that tried to escape  the whitefooted stallion was the first to make a break  he ran almost as well on three feet as on four and it took hard riding to catch him turn him and get him back in the bunch  the next was pans roan  he gave a great deal of trouble  haw  haw  thets pans hoss  kill him  i guess mebbe pan caint pick out the runners  when the wild horses got out of the narrow gateway between bluff and slope they tried to scatter  the riders had their hands full  riding shooting yelling swinging their ropes they moved the horses forward and kept them together  they were learning to run on three feet and tried hard to escape  just when the melee grew worst they reached the cedar fence only half of which had been burned by the resentful hardman outfit and this obstruction was of signal help to the riders once more in a compact bunch the wild horses grew less difficult to handle  as pan rode up the ridge leading out of the valley he turned to have a last look at this memorable place  to his amaze and delight he saw almost as many wild horses as before the drive  gee im greedy he muttered  lucky as ive been i want to stay and make another drive  wal pard im readin your mind drawled blinky  but dont feel bad  if we tried thet drive again we might ketch a few  but you caint fool them broomies twice the same way  another difficulty soon presented itself  several of the wild horses could not learn to travel well on three feet  reckon theyve had long enough trial  we gotta cut them loose said blinky  well lose them sure complained pan  mebbe so  but we caint do nothin else  its mighty strange the difference in hosses  same as people come to think aboot it  some hosses learn quick an now an then theres one like thet stallion he can run like hell  most wild hosses fight an worry themselves an quick as they learn to get along on three feet they make the best of it  some have to be cut loose  fact is pard weve got a mighty fine bunch an were comin along bettern i expected  loose your lasso now cowboy for youll shore need it  the need of that scarcely had to be dwelt on for the instant gus and blinky cut loose a poor traveler he made a wild dash for liberty  but he ran right into a hateful lasso  this one let out a piercing whistle  all the time the riders were moving the bunch forward down into flat country between gray brushy hills  evidently this wide pass opened into a larger valley  the travel was mostly over level ground which facilitated the progress  it took two men to lasso a horse hold his ears cut the rope round his legs release the noose on his neck and let him go  they could not afford to lose any precious second over this job  time was too badly needed  the parade as blinky had called it made only a few miles an hour and sometimes this advance was not wholly in the right direction nevertheless the hours seemed to fly  there was no rest for horses or men  the afternoon had begun to wane before the horses had all made up their minds that fighting and plunging was of no avail  weary exhausted suffering from the bound up legs they at last surrendered whereupon blinky and gus cut their feet loose  sometimes the whole bunch would have to be held up for one horse that upon release could not use his freed foot  pan had an idea the horses did not want that tried on them twice  they showed intelligence  this method was not breeding the horses for saddle and bridle which was of course the main consideration to come but it certainly tamed them  it was a little too cruel for pan to favor  wal well shore be lucky if we make snyders pasture tonight remarked blinky  no hope of makin marco  pan had never expected to do so and therefore was not disappointed his heart seemed so full and buoyant that he would not have minded more delay  indeed he rode in the clouds  the pass proved to be longer than it looked but at last the drove of horses was headed into the wide flat country toward the west  and soon trail grew into road  the sunset dusk mantled the sweeping prairielike valley and soon night fell cool and windy  the wild horses slowed to a walk and had to be driven to do that  pan felt that he shared their thirst  when at about ten oclock blinky espied through the gloom landmarks that indicated the pasture he was seeking it was none too soon for pan  water an grass heah but no firewood handy announced blinky as they turned the horses into the pasture  fellar named snyder used to ranch heah  it didnt pay  this little pasture is lucky fer us  i was heah not long ago  good fence an we can round up the bunch easy in the mawnin  the weary riders unpacked the outfit took a long deep drink of the cold water and unrolling their tarps went supperless to bed  pans eyes closed as if with glue and his thoughts wavered faded  pans father was the first to get up but already the sun was before him  pan saw him limp around and leave the pasture to return with an armful of fire wood  pile out he yelled  its siccane arizona or bust  one by one the boys rolled from their beds  pan was the only one who had to pull on his boots  somebody found soap and towel which they fought over  the towel had not been clean before this onslaught afterward it was unrecognizable  gus cooked breakfast which judged from the attack upon it was creditable to him  wal our hosses are heah said blinky cheerfully  reckon i was afeared theyd jump the fence  we may have a little hell on the start  blink you dont aim to tie up their feet again do you inquired pan anxiously  nope  they had all they wanted of thet  mebbe theyll try to bust away first off  but our hosses are fresh too  im gamblin in three hours well have them in your dads corral  then we dont have to drive through marco  shore not  were on the main road thet passes your dads  reckon its aboot eight miles or so  say blink do we take this road on our way south to siccane  yep  its the only road  you come in on it by stage  it runs north and south  not very good road this way out of marco  then by golly we can leave our new horses here exclaimed pan gladly  wal ill be goldarned  wheres my haid  shore we can  its a firstrate pasture plenty of water an fair grass  but ill have to go in town thets damn shore you know  an we caint leave these hosses heah unguarded  gus will you and brown stay here  well leave grub and outfit  brown had to refuse and explained that he was keen to get back to his mining claim which he believed now he would be able to work  ill stay said gus  its a good idee  workin with these hosses a day or two will get em fit to travel  an i reckon id like a job with you far as siccane anyway  youve got it and after we reach siccane too if you want one replied pan quickly  the deal was settled to the satisfaction of all concerned  how aboot our pack hosses asked blinky  course charley will have to take his but will we need ours  i mean will we have to pack them from heah  no all that stuff can go in the wagons replied pan  well need three wagons anyhow  maybe more  dad how much of an outfit have you at home  you saw it son said smith with a laugh  mine would go in a saddlebag  but i reckon the women folks will have a wagon load  rustle  im ararin to go yelled pan striding out into the pasture to catch his horse  in the exuberance of the moment pan would have liked to try conclusions with the whitefooted stallion or the blue roan but he could not spare the time  he led sorrel back to camp and saddled him  blinky and pans father were also saddling their mounts  ill take it easy explained charley brown who had made no move my claim is over here in the hills not very far  brown im sorry you wont go south with us said pan warmly as he shook hands with the miner  youve sure been a help  and im glad wevewell had something to do with removing the claim jumpers  as pan rode out that morning on the sorrel to face north on the road to marco he found it hard to contain himself  this hour was the very first in which he could let himself think of the glorious fulfillment of his dream  his father was too lame to ride fast and pan much as he longed to rush did not want to leave him behind  but it was utterly impossible for pan to enter into the animated conversation carried on by his father and blinky  they were talking wagons teams harness grain homesteads and what not  pan rode alone a little ahead of them  almost he loved this wild and rugged land  but that was the ecstasy of the moment  this iron country was too cut up by mountains with valleys too bare and waterless to suit pan  not to include the rough and violent element of men attracted by gold  nevertheless on this bright autumn morning there was a glamour over valley and ridge black slope and snowy peak and the dim distant ranges  the sky was as blue as the inside of a columbine a rich and beautiful light of gold gilded the wall of rock that boldly cropped out of the mountainside and the wide sweeping expanse of sage lost itself in a deep purple horizon  ravens and magpies crossed pans glad eyesight  jack rabbits bounded down the aisles between the sage bushes  far out on the plain he descried antelope moving away with their telltale white rumps  the air was sweet intoxicating full of cedar fragrance and the cool breath from off the heights  while he saw and felt all this his mind scintillated with thoughts of lucy blake  he would see her presently have the joy of surprising her into betrayal of love  he fancied her wide eyes of changing dark blue and the swift flame of scarlet that so readily stained her neck and cheek  he would tell her about the great good fortune that had befallen him and about the beautiful mare little bay he had captured for her and now they could talk and plan endlessly all the way down to siccane  when would lucy marry him  that was a staggering question  his heart swelled to bursting  had he the courage to ask her at once  he tried to see the matter from lucys point of view but without much success  dreaming thus pan rode along without being aware of the time or distance  hey pard called blinky in loud banter  are you goin to ride past where your gurl lives  with a violent start pan wheeled his horse  he saw that he had indeed ridden beyond the entrance to a farm which upon second look he recognized  it was however an angle with which he had not been familiar  the corrals and barn and house were hidden in trees  im loco all right he replied with a little laugh  through gate and lane they galloped on to the corral and round that to the barn  this was only a short distance to the house  pan leaped from his horse and ran  with an uplift of his heart that was almost pain he rushed round the corner of the house to the vinecovered porch  the door was shut  stealthily he tiptoed across the porch to knock no answer  he tried the door  locked  a quiver ran through him  strange he muttered not home this early  he peered through the window to see on floor and table ample evidence of recent packing  that gave check to a creeping blankness which was benumbing pan  he went on to look into his mothers bedroom  the bed looked as if it had been used during the night and had not been made up  perhaps his mother and lucy had gone into marco to purchase necessities  butdidnt i tell lucy not to go he queried in bewilderment  resolutely he cast out doubtful speculations  there could hardly be anything wrong  hurriedly he returned to the barn  wal ill tell you blinky was holding forth blandly this heah grubbin around without a home an a woman aint no good  im shore through  im agoin  nobody home interrupted pan  well thats nothin to make you pale round the gills returned his father  theyre gone to town  mother had a lot of buyin to do  but i particularly told lucy to stay here  spose you did interposed blinky  thets nothin  you dont expect this heah gurl to mind you  no time for joking blink said pan curtly  it just doesnt set right on my chest  ive got to find lucy pronto  but where to go  with a single step he reached his stirrup and swung into his saddle  pan lucy an the wife will be in one of the stores  dont worry about them  why they did all our buyin  i tell you i dont like it snapped pan  its not what i think but what i feel  all the same wherever they are it doesnt change our plans  ill sure find them and tell them were packing to leave pronto  now dad buy three wagons and teams grain grub and whatever else we need for two weeks or more on the road  soon as i find lucy and mother ill meet you and help you with the buying  i ought to talk it over with ma before i buy grub replied his father perplexedly scratching his head  i wish they was home  come on blink called pan as he rode out  blinky joined him out in the road  pard i dont get your hunch but i can see youre oneasy  im just loco thats all returned pan forcing himself itssuchsuch a disappointment not to seeher  made me nervous  makes me think how anything might happen  i never trusted jim blake  and lucy is only a kid in years  ahuh said blinky quietly  reckon i savvy  you wouldnt feel thet way fer nothin  blink im damn glad youre with me rejoined pan feelingly turning to face his comrade  no use to bluff with you  i wish to heaven i could say otherwise but im afraid theres something wrong  shore  wal well find out pronto replied blinky with his cool hard spirit an if there is well damn soon make it right  they rode rapidly until they reached the outskirts of town when blinky called pan to a halt  reckon youd better not ride through main street he said significantly  they tied their horses behind a clump of trees between two deserted shacks  pan removed his ragged chaps more however to be freer of movement than because they were disreputable  now blink well know pronto if the town is friendly to us he said seriously  huh  i aint carin a whoop but ill gamble we could own the town this fake minin ranchin hossdealin hardman was a hunk of bad cheese  pard are you goin to deny you killed him  fer shore theyve been told thet  no  wiggate can do the telling  all i want is to find lucy and send her back home then buy our outfit and rustle  sounds pretty  but i begin to feel hunchy myself  lets have a drink pan  were not drinking cowboy retorted pan  aint we  excuse me  shore i figgered a good stiff drink would help some  i tell you ive begun to get hunches  what kind  no kind at all  just feel that alls not goin the way we hope  but its your fault  its the look you got  id hate to see you hurt deep pard  they passed the wagon shop where pans father had been employed then a vacant lot on one side of the street and framed tents on the other presently they could see down the whole of main street  it presented the usual morning atmosphere and color though pan fancied there was more activity than usual  that might have been owing to the fact that both the incoming and outgoing stages were visible far up at the end of the street  pan strained his eyes at people near and far seeking first some sign of lucy and secondly someone he could interrogate  soon he would reach the first store  but before he got there he saw his mother emerge drag bobby who evidently wanted to stay  then alice followed both she and her mother were carrying bundles  pans heart made ready for a second and greater leapin anticipation of lucys appearance but she did not come  hello heahs your folks pard figgerin from looks said blinky what a cute kid   look there  pan striding ahead of blinky saw his mother turn white and reel as if about to faint  pan got to her in time  mother  why mother he cried in mingled gladness and distress its me  im all right  whatd you think   hello bobby old dirty face  alice dont stare at me  im here in the flesh  his mother clung to him with hands like steel  her face and eyes were both terrible and wonderful to see  pan  pan  youre alive  oh thank god  they told us youd been shot  me  well i guess not  im better than ever and full of good news went on pan hurriedly  brace up mother  people are looking there  dad is out home  weve got a lot to do  wheres lucy  oh godmy son my son cried mrs smith her eyes rolling  hush burst out pan with a shock as if a blade had pierced his heart  he shook her not gently  where is lucy  his mother seemed impelled by his spirit and she wheeled to point up the street  lucy  therein that stageleaving marco  for godssake gasped pan  whats this  lucy  wheres she going  ask her yourself she cried passionately  something terrible seemed to crash inside pan  catastrophe  it was here  his mothers dark eyes held love pity and passion which last was not for him  mother go home at once he said swiftly  tell dad to rush buying those wagons  you and alice pack  we shake the dust of this damned town  dont worry  lucy will leave with us  then pan broke into long springy strides almost a run  indeed blinky had to run to keep up with him  i told you pard said his comrade huskily  hell to pay   the luck  pan had only one conscious thoughtto see lucy  all else seemed damming behind flood gates  people rushed into the street to get out of the way of the cowboys others stared and made gestures  booted men on the porch of the yellow mine stamped noisily as they trooped to get inside  voices of alarm and mirth rang out  pan took only a fleeting glance into the wide doorway  he saw nothing thought nothing  his stride quickened as he passed blacks store where more men crowded to get inside  save yourwind pard warned blinky  you mightneed it  they reached the end of the street and across the wide square stood the outgoing stage before the express office  there was no driver on the front seat  smith the agent was emerging from the office with mailbags  slow up pard whispered blinky at pans elbow  pan did as he was advised though his stride still retained speed impossible to go slowly  there were passengers in the stagecoach when pan reached the middle of the street he saw the gleam of golden hair that he knew  lucy  her back was turned to him  and as he recognized her realized he had found her there burst forth in his mind a thundering clamor of questioning voices  a few more strides took him round the stage  men backed away from him the door was open  lucy he called and his voice seemed to come piercingly from a faroff place  she turned a strange face but he knew her eyes saw the swift transition the darkening widening  how white she turned  what was this  agony in recognition  a swift unuttered blaze of joy that changed terror  he saw her lips frame his name but no sound came  lucy he cried  what does this mean  where are you going  she could not speak  but under her pallor the red of shame began to burn  pan saw it and he recognized it  mutely he gazed at the girl as her head slowly sank  then he asked hoarsely whats it mean  pard take a peep round heah drawled blinky in slow cool speech that seemed somehow to carry menace  pan wheeled  he had the shock of his life  he received it before his whirling thoughts recorded the reason  it was as if he had to look twice  dick hardman  fashionably and wonderfully attired  pan got no farther than sight of the frock coat elaborate vest flowing tie and high hat  then for a second he went blind  when the red film cleared he saw hardman pass him saw the pallor of his cheek the quivering of muscle the strained protruding of his eye  he got one foot on the stage step when pan found release for his voice  hardman  that halted the youth as if it had been a rope but he never turned his head  the shuffling of feet inside the coach hinted of more than restlessness  there was a scattering of men from behind pan  he leaped at hardman and spun him round  where are you going  frisco if itsany of your business replied hardman incoherently  looks like ill make it my business returned pan menacingly  he could not be himself here  the shock had been too great  his mind seemed stultified  hardmando you meando you thinkyoure taking heraway queried pan as if strangling  ha returned hardman with an upfling of head arrogant vain for all his fear  i know it  shes my wife     chapter sixteen  destruction death itself seemed to overthrow panhandle smiths intensity of life  he reeled on his feet  for a moment all seemed opaque with blurred images  there was a crash crash crash of something beating at his ears  how long this terrible oblivion possessed pan he did not know  but at hardmans move to enter the stage he came back a million times more alive than ever he had beenpossessed of devils  with one powerful lunge he jerked hardman back and flung him sprawling into the dust  there  once more cried pan panting  rememberthe schoolhouse  that fight over lucy blake  damn your skunk soul get up if youve got a gun  hardman leaned on his hand  his high hat had rolled away  his broadcloth suit was covered with dust  but he did not note these details of his abasement  like a craven thing fascinated by a snake he had his starting eyes fixed upon pan and his face was something no man could bear to see  get upif youve got a gun ordered pan  ive nogun he replied in husky accents  talk then  maybe i can keep from killing you  for gods sakedont shoot me  ill tell you anything  hardman you say youyou married mythis girl rasped out pan choking over his words as if they were poison unable to speak of lucy as he had thought of her all his life  yesi married her  who married you  a parson from salt lake  matthews got him here  ahuhmatthews  how did you force her  i swear to god she was willing went on hardman  her father wanted her to  what  jim blake left here for arizona  i sent him away  but he never wentii mean he got caughtput in jail again matthews sent for the officers  they came  and they said theyd put blake away for ten years  but i got him off  then lucy was willing to marry meand she did  theres no help for it now too late  liar hissed pan  you frightened hertortured her  no ii didnt do anything  it was her father  he persuaded her  drove her you mean  and you paid him  admit it or ill  pans move was threatening  yesyes i did jerked out hardman in a hoarser lower voice something about his lifelong foe appalled him  he was abject  no confession of his guilt was needed  go get yourself a gun  youll have to kill me before you start out on your honeymoon  reckon i think youre going to hell  get up go get yourself a gun  hardman staggered to his feet brushing the dirt from his person while he gazed strickenly at pan  my god i cant fight you he said  you wont murder me in cold blood  smith im lucys husband  shes my wife  and what is louise melliss whipped out pan  what does she say about your marriage  you ruined her  you brought her here to marco you tired of her  you abandoned her to that hellhole owned by your father  he got his just deserts and youll get yours  hardman had no answer  like a dog under the lash he cringed at pans words  get out of my sight cried pan at the end of his endurance  and remember the next time i see you ill begin to shoot  pan struck him shoved him out into the street  hardman staggered on forgetting his high hat that lay in the dust  he got to going faster until he broke into an uneven halfrun  he kept to the middle of the street until he reached the yellow mine where he ran up the steps and disappeared  pan backed slowly step by step  he was coming out of his clamped obsession  his movement was now that of a man gripped by terror  in reality pan could have faced any peril any horror any physical rending of flesh far more easily than this girl who had ruined him  she had left the stage and she stood alone  she spoke his name  in the single low word he divined fear  how long had she been that dogs wife  when had she married him  yesterday or the day beforea week what did it matter  youyou he burst out helplessly in the grip of deadly hate and agony  he hated her thenhated her beautyand the betrayal of her fear for him  what was life to him now  oh the insupportable bitterness  go back to my mother he ordered harshly and averted his face  then he seemed to forget her  he saw blinky close to him deeply shaken yet composed and grim  he heard the movement of many feet the stamping of hoofs  all aboard for salt lake called the stage driver  smith the agent passed pan with more mailbags  the strain all about him had broken  pard pan said laying a hand on blinky  go with hertake her to my mother  and leave me alone  no by gawd replied blinky sullenly  you forget this heah is my deal too  theres louise  an lucy took her bag an hurried away there shes runnin past the yellow mine  blink did she hear what i said to hardman about louise asked pan bitterly  reckon not  shed keeled over aboot then  i shore kept my eye on her  an i tell you pard  never mind interrupted pan  whats the difference  hellsfire whisky  lets get a drink  its whisky i want  shore  i told you thet a while back  come on pard  its redeye fer us  they crossed to the corner saloon a low dive kept by a chinaman and frequented by mexicans and indians  these poured out pellmell as the cowboys jangled up to the bar  jard hardmans outfit coming to town had prepared the way for this  howdy was blinkys greeting to the black bottle that was thumped upon the counter  you look mighty natural  heahs to panhandle smith  pan drank  the fiery liquor burned down to meet and coalesce round that gnawing knot in his internals  it augmented while it soothed  it burned as it cooled  it inflamed but did not intoxicate  pard heahs to the old cimarron said blinky as they drank again  pan had no response  memory of the cimarron only guided his flying mind over the ranges to las animas  they drank and drank  blinkys tongue grew looser  hold your tongue damn you said pan  imposshiblity  lesh have another  one more then  youre drunk cowboy  me drunk  no shir pard  im just tonguetied  now by gawd heahs to louise melliss  i drink to that flashed pan as he drained his glass   the afternoon had waned  matthews lay dead in the street  he lay in front of the yellow mine from which he had been driven by men who would no longer stand the strain  the street was deserted except for that black figure lying face down with a gun in his right hand  his black sombrero lay flat  the wind had blown a high hat down the street until it had stopped near the sombrero  those who peeped out from behind doors or from windows espied these sinister objects  pan had patrolled the street  he had made a housetohouse canvass searching for jim blake  he had entered every place except the yellow mine  that he reserved for the last  but he did not find blake  he encountered however a slight pale man in clerical garb  are you the parson matthews brought to marco demanded pan harshly  yes sir came the reply  did you marry young hardman toto  pan could not end the query  the minister likewise found speech difficult but his affirmative was not necessary  man you may be innocent of evil intent  but youve ruined mygirl  and me  youve sent me to hell  i ought to kill you  pard shore we mushnt kill thish heah parson just yet drawled blinky thickly  hell come in handy  ahuh  right you are blinky returned pan with a ghastly pretense of gaiety  parson stay right here till we come for youmaybe you make up a little for the wrong you did one girl  the yellow mine stood with glass uplifted and card unplayed  pan had entered from the dance hall entrance  blinky unsteady on his feet came in from the street  after a tense moment the poker players went on with their game and the drinkers emptied their glasses  but voices were low glances were furtive  pan had seen every man there before he had been seen himself  only one interested himthat was jim blake  what to do to this man or with him pan found it hard to decide  blake had indeed fallen low  but pan gave him the benefit of one doubtthat he had been wholly dominated by hardman  yet there was the matter of accepting money for his part in forcing lucy to marry dick  the nearer end of the bar had almost imperceptibly been vacated by drinkers sliding down toward the other rear end  pan took the foremost end of the vacated position  he called for drink  as fast as he had drunk the fiery effects had as swiftly passed away  yet each drink for the moment kept up that unnatural stimulus  pan beckoned for blinky  that worthy caused a stir then a silence by going round about the tables so as not to come between pan and any men there  blink do you know where louises room is queried pan  shore  down thish hallthird door on left replied blinky  well you go over there to blake and tell him i want to talk to him then you go to louises room  ill follow directly  blake received the message but he did not act promptly  pan caught his suspicious eye baleful gleaming  possibly the man was worse than weak  presently he left the poker game which he had been watching and shuffled up to pan  he appeared to be enough under the influence of liquor to be leeringly bold  howdy he said  blake today i got from hardman the truth about the deal you gave me and lucy returned pan and then in cold deliberate tones he called the man every infamous name known to the ranges  under this onslaught blake sank into something akin to abasement  reckon you think concluded pan that because youre lucys father i cant take a shot at you  dont fool yourself  youve killed her souland mine  so why shouldnt i kill you   well there isnt any reason except that away from hardmans influence you might brace up  ill take the chance  youre done in marco  jard hardman is dead and dicks chances of seeing the sun rise are damn thin  now you rustle out that door and out of marco  when you make a man of yourself come to siccane arizona  blake lurched himself erect and met pans glance with astonished bewildered eyes then he wheeled to march out of the saloon  pan turned into the hallway leading into the hotel part of the building and soon encountered blinky leaning against the wall  blink isnt she in asked pan low voiced and eager  shore but she wont open the door replied blinky dejectedly  pan knocked and called low louise let us in  there was a long wait then came a low voice no  please its very important  who are you  its panhandle smith replied pan  that cowboys drunk and inoim sorry  louise im not drunk but i am in bad temper  i ask as a friend dont cross me here  i can easy shove in this door  he heard soft steps a breathless exclamation then a key turned in the lock and the door opened  the lamplight was not bright louise stood there half dressed her bare arms and bosom gleaming  pan entered dragging blinky with him and closed the door all but tight  louise it wasnt kind of you to do that said pan reproachfully have you any better friends than blinky or me  god knowsi havent faltered the girl  but ive been illin bedand am just getting out  iiheard about youtodayand blink being with youdrunk  pan stepped to the redshaded lamp on a small table beside the bed and turned up the light  the room had more comfort and color than any pan had seen for many a day  he bent searching eyes upon louise  she did look illwhite with great dark shadows under her eyes but she seemed really beautiful what a tragic face it was betrayed now by lack of paint  pan had never seen her like this  if he had needed it this would have warmed his heart to her  what do you want of me she asked with a nervous twisting of hands she tried to hide  pan took her hands and pulled her a little toward him  louise you like me dont you as a friend or brother he asked gently  yes when im sober she replied wanly  and you like blinky here dont youlike him a lot  i did  i couldnt help it the damn faithful little cowboy she returned  but i hate him when hes drunk and he hates me when im drunk  blink go out and fetch back a bottlepresently  well all get drunk  the cowboy stared like a solemn owl then very quietly went out  louise put something over your shoulders  youll catch cold  here said pan and he picked a robe off the bed and wrapped it round her  i didnt know you were so pretty  no wonder poor blink worships you  she drew away from him and sat upon the bed dark eyes questioning suspicious  yet she seemed fascinated  pan caught a slight quivering of her frame  where was the audacity the boldness of this girl  but he did not know her and he had her word that drink alone enabled her to carry on  he had surprised her  yet could that account for something different something quite beyond his power to grasp  surely this girl could not fear him  suddenly he remembered that hardman had fled to this housewas hidden there now  pans nerves tautened  louise he began taking her hand again and launching directly into the reason for this interview he had sought weve had a great drive blink and i have had luck  oh such luck  we sold over fifteen hundred horses  well were going to arizona to a sunny open country not like this  now blink and i want you to go with us  what  go away with you  how in gods name she gasped in utter amaze  why as blinks wife of course  and ill be your big brother replied pan not without agitation  it was a pregnant moment  she stared a second white and still with great solemn searching eyes on his  pan felt strangely embarrassed yet somehow happy that he had dared to approach her with such a proposition  suddenly she kissed him she clung to him she buried her face on his shoulder and he heard her murmur incoherently something about honesttogod men  what do you say little girl he went on  its a chance for you to be good again  itll save that wild cowboy who never had a decent ambition till he met you  he loves you  he worships you  he hates what you have to suffer here  he  so this is panhandle smith she interrupted looking up at him with eyes like dark stars  no  no  no  i wouldnt degrade even a worthless cowboy  youre wrong  hell not be worthless if you repay his faith louise dont turn your back on hope on love on a home  no she flashed passionately  why he returned in sharp appeal  because hes too good for me  because i dont deserve your friendship  but so help me god ill love you both all the rest of my miserable lifewhich wont be long  he took her in his arms as if to add force to argument  but you poor child this is no place for you  youll only go to hellcommit suicide or be killed in a drunken brawl  panhandle i may end even worse she replied in bitter mockery  i might marry dick hardman  he talks of itwhen hes drunk  pan released her and leaned back to see her face  marry you  dick hardman talks of that he burst out incredulously  yes he does  and i might let him when im drunk  id do anything then  at that moment the door opened noiselessly and blinky entered carrying a bottle and glasses  good blink old pard said pan breathing heavily  louise and i have just made up our minds to get drunk together  blink you stay sober  i caint stay what i aint retorted blinky  an i wont stay heah either to see her drink  i hate her then  she poured the dark red liquor out into the glasses  boy i want you to hate me  ill make you hate me  heres to panhandle smith  while she drank blinky moved backwards to the door eyes glinting brightly into pans and then he was gone  in the mood under which pan labored liquor had no effect upon him but to act as fire to body and mind  the girl however was transformed into another creature  bright red spots glowed in her cheeks her eyes danced and dilated her whole body answered to the stimulus  one drink led to another  she could not resist the insidious appetite thus created  she did not see whether pan drank or not  she grew funny then sentimental and finally lost herself in that stage of unnatural abandon for which when sober she frankly confessed she drank  pan decided that presently he would wrap a blanket around her pick her up and pack her out  blinky would shoot out the lights in the saloon and the rest would be easy  if she knew that hardman was in the house as pan had suspected she had now no memory of it  you big handsome devil she called pan  i told youto keep away from me  louise dont make love to me replied pan  why not  men are all alike  no youre wrong  you forget what you said a little while ago  ive lost my sweetheart and my heart is broken  she leered at him and offered him another drink  pan took the glass away from her  it was possible he might overdo his part  so youre liable to marry young hardman he asked deliberately  the question the name gave her pause as if they had startled her memory  sure i am  but louise how can you marry hardman when he already has a wife asked pan  she grasped that import only slowly by degrees  you lie you gunslinging cowboy she cried  no louise  he told me so himself  he did   when she whispered very low  today  he was at the stage office  he meant to leave today  he was all togged up frock coat high hat  oh godlouise i know i know because itwasmysweethearthe married  pan ended gaspingly  what agony to speak that aloudto make his own soul hear that aloud  your sweetheart   little lucyof your boyhoodyou told me about  pan was confronted now by something terrible  he had sought to make this girl betray herself if she had anything to betray  but this medusa face  those awful eyes  yes lucy i told you he said reaching for her  he forced her to marry him  they had lucys father in jail  dick got him out  oh it was all a scheme to work on the poor girl  she thought it was to save her father  why dick paid her father  i made him tell me yes dick hardman in his frock coat and high hat  but when i drove him out to get his gun he forgot that high hat  ah  his high hat  yes its out in the street now  the wind blew it over where i killed matthews  funny   and louise im going to kill dick hardman too  like hell you are she hissed and leaped swiftly to snatch something from under the pillow  pan started back thinking that she meant to attack him  how tigerishly she bounded  her white arm swept aside red curtains  they hid a shallow closet  it seemed her white shape flashed in and out  a hard choking gasp  could that have come from her  pan did not see her drawn lips move  something hard dropped to the floor with metallic sound  the hall door opened with a single sweep  blinky stood framed there wild eyed  and the next instant dick hardman staggered from that closet  he had both hands pressed to his abdomen  blood poured out in a stream  pan heard strange watery sounds  hardman reeled out into the hall groaning  he slipped along the wall  pan leaped to see him slide down into a widening pool of blood  it was a paralyzing moment  but pan recovered first  the girl swayed with naked arms outstretched against the wall  on her white wrist showed a crimson blot  pan looked no more  snatching a blanket off the bed he threw it round her wrapped it tight and lifted her in his arms  blink go ahead he whispered as he went into the hall  hurry shoot out the lights  go through the dance hall  the cowboy seemed galvanized into action  he leaped over hardmans body huddled and lax and down the hall pulling his guns  pan edged round the body on the floor  he saw a ghastly faceprotruding eyes  and on the instant like lightning came the thought that lucy was free  almost immediately thundering shots filled the saloon  crash  crash  crash  the lights faded darkened went out  yells and scraping chairs and overturned tables breaking glass pounding boots merged in a pandemonium of sound  pan hurried through the dance hall where the windows gave dim light found the doorway gained the side entrance to the street  blinky waited there smoking guns in his hands  heahthisway he directed in a panting whisper as he sheathed the guns and took the lead  pan followed in the shadow of the houses     chapter seventeen  the street down that way was dark with but few lights showing  blinky kept looking back in the direction of the slowly subsiding tumult  pan carried louise at rapid pace as if she made no burden at all  in the middle of the next block blinky slowed up carefully scrutinizing the entrances to the buildings  they came to an open hallway dimly lighted  pan read a sign he remembered  this was the lodging house  go in blink directed pan quickly  if you find our parson chase everybody but him and call me pronto  blinky ran into the place  pan let louise down on her feet  she could not stand alone  cowboysmozzer me she giggled pulling at the fold of blanket round her face  pan rearranged the blanket over her bare shoulders and folded it round more like a coat  he feared she might collapse before they could accomplish their design  the plight of this girl struck deeply into his heart  whazmazzer cowboy she asked  somebodys raid us  hush louie whispered pan shaking her  therell be a gang after us  hell with gang  shay pan whaz become of dick  she was so drunk she did not remember  pan thanked god for that  how white the tragic face  her big eyes resembled bottomless gulfs  her hair hung disheveled round her  a low whistle made pan jump  blinky stood inside in a flare of light from an open door  he beckoned  pan lifted the girl and carried her in   five minutes later they came out one on each side of louise trying to keep her quiet  she was gay maudlin  but once outside again the rush of cold mountain air aided them  they hurried down the dark street almost carrying the girl between them  a few people passed fortunately on the other side  these pedestrians were hurrying in the other direction  some excitement uptown pan thought grimly  soon they passed the outskirts of marco and gained the open country  pan cast off what seemed a weight of responsibility for blinky and louise once he got them out of town they were safe  suddenly blinky reached behind the girl and gave pan a punch  turning pan saw his comrade point back  a dull red flare lighted up the sky fire  pans heart gave a leap  the yellow mine was burning  the crowd of drinkers and gamblers had fled before blinkys guns  pan was hoping that only he and blinky would ever know who had killed dick hardman  from time to time pan glanced back over his shoulder  the flare of red light grew brighter and higher  one corner of marco would surely be wiped out  the road curved  soon a dark patch of trees and a flickering light told pan they had reached his fathers place  it gave him a shock  he had forgotten his parents  they entered the lane and cut off through the dewwet grass of the orchard to the barn  pan caught the round pale gleam of canvascovered wagons  good  dad sure rustled said pan with satisfaction  if he got the horses too we can leave tomorrow  shore we will anyhow replied blinky who was now sober and serious  they found three large wagons and one smaller with a square canvas top  blink hold her till i get some hay said pan  he hurried into the open side of the barn  it was fairly dark but he knew where to go  he heard horses munching grain  that meant his father had bought the teams  pan got an armful of hay and carrying it out to the wagon he threw it in and spread it out for a bed  reckon wed better put louise here said pan stepping down off the wheel  ill get some blankets from dad  blinky was standing there in the starlight holding the girl in his arms  his head was bowed over her wan face  they lifted louise into the wagon and laid her down upon the hay  whish yougennelmanz my hushband she asked thickly  pan had to laugh at that but blinky stood gazing intently down upon the pale gleam of face  pan left him there and strode toward the house  though the distance was short he ran the whole gamut of emotions before he stopped at a lighted window  he heard his fathers voice  dad he called tapping on the window  then he saw his mother and alice  they had started up from packing  one glance at the suffering expressed in his mothers face was enough to steady pan  the door opened with a jerk  that youpan called his father with agitation  nobody else dad replied pan trying to calm his voice  tell mother im here safe and sound  his mother heard and answered with a low cry of relief  dad come out  shut the door returned pan sharply  once outside his father saw the great flare of light above the town  look  whats that  must be fire he burst out  reckon it is fire returned pan shortly  blinky shot out the lamps in the yellow mine  fire must have caught from that  yellow mine echoed smith staring in momentary stupefaction  pan laid a heavy hand on him  it was involuntary an expression of a sudden passion rising in pan  he had a question to put that almost stifled him  lucy   did shecome home he forced out  sure  didnt you know  she was home when i got here at noon  son i bought all our outfit in no time  what did lucy tell you  nothin much replied his father in earnest wonder  she was in an awful state  said she couldnt go because you were not dead  poor girl  she had hysterics  but mother got her quieted down by suppertime  where is she now  in bed i reckon  leastways shes in her room  dad does she know  but of course she couldnt  nor could you  son i know aplenty replied his father solemnly  lucy told mother when she saw you come to the stagecoach that it nearly killed her they believed you deadmother an lucy  she told how you threw hardman out of the stage on to the street  said she almost fainted then  but she came to in time to see you kick himdrive him off  is that all she knows queried pan  reckon it is  i know more but i didnt tell her replied smith lowering his voice to a whisper  i heard about them drivin matthews out to meet you  mccormick told me you hadnt lost any friends  ahhuh ejaculated pan somberly  well better tell lucy at once reckon thats bestthe sooner the better  tell lucy what asked smith anxiously  that shes a widow  itis dick hardman deadtoo gasped out smith  yes  my god  sondiddid you  dad i didnt kill him interrupted pan  dick hardman waswas knocked outjust before blinky shot out the lights  reckon its a good bet no one will ever know  he sure was burned up in that fire  alive whispered smith  he might still have been alive but he was far goneunconscious when i passed him in the hall  you neednt tell lucy that  just tell her hardman is dead and that i didnt kill him  all right ill go right an do it replied his father huskily  before you do it fetch me a roll of blankets  we havent any beds and blinkys wife is with us  wife  i didnt know blinky had one  fetch her in  well make room somewhere  no weve already fixed a place for her in that wagon with the square top went on pan  shes been sick  rustle dad  fetch me the blankets  got them right inside  we bought new ones said smith opening the door to hurry in  mother called pan everythings all right  well be leaving early tomorrow  then his father reappeared with a roll of blankets  pan found blinky exactly as he had left him leaning over the wagon  blink put a couple of these blankets over her directed pan  she went right off asleep like she was daid whispered the cowboy and he took the blankets and stepped up on the wheel hub to lay the blankets softly over the quiet form pan saw dimly in the starlight  come here cowboy called pan  and when blinky got down and approached pan laid hold of him with powerful hand  listen pard he began in low voice  were playing a deep game and by god its an honest game even though we have to lie  louise will never remember she cut that traitors heart out  she was too crazy  if it half returns to her well lieyou understandlie nobody will ever know who did kill hardman ill gamble  i intended to and all marco must have known that  if he burned up they cant ever be sure  anyway that doesnt matter  its our women folks weve got to think of  i told dad youd brought your wifethat shed been sick  hell tell mother and lucy  they dont know and they never will know what kind of a girl louise has been  savvy pard  reckon i do replied blinky in hoarse trembling accents  but wont we have hell with louisewhen she wakes up sober  cowboy you bet we will returned pan grimly  but well be far on our way when she wakes up  you can drive this wagon  well keep watch on her  and wellleave it to me blink  pan we feel the same aboot louie  shore i dont mean thet you love her  reckon its hard fer me to find words  i understand blink replied pan earnestly hoping to dispel the groping and doubt of his comrades soul  for you and me louies past is dead  were gambling on life  and whatever way you put it whatever the future brings were better for what happened tonight   pan strode off in the starlight across the orchard down along the murmuring stream to the cottonwood tree with the bench  it was useless for him to try to sleep  to and fro he paced in the starlight  alone now with the urgent activities past for the time he reverted to the grim and hateful introspection that had haunted his mind  this once however the sinister strife in his soul that strange icy clutch on his sensesthe aftermath of instinctive horror following the death of a man by his handwore away before the mounting of a passion that had only waited  it did not leap upon him unawares like an enemy out of ambush  it grew as he walked as his whirling thoughts straightened in a single line tolucy  she had betrayed him  she had broken his heart  what if she had thought him deadsacrificed herself to save her fathershe had given herself to that dog hardman  the thought was insupportable  i hate her he whispered  shes made me hate her  the hours passed the stars moved across the heavens the night wind ceased the crickets grew silent and the murmuring stream flowed on at pans feet  spent and beaten he sat upon the bench  his love for lucy had not been killed  it lived it had grown it was tremendousand both pity and reason clamored that he be above jealousy and hate after all there was excuse for lucy  she was young she had been driven by grief over his supposed death and fear for her father  but oh  the pity of itof this hard truth against the sweetness and purity of his dream  life and love were not what he had dreamed them as he had ridden the lonely ranges  he must suffer because he had left lucy to fight her battles  ill try to forget he whispered huskily  ive got to  but not yet  i cant do it yet  well leave this country far behind  and some day we can go on withwith all we planned   pan went back to the barn and threw himself upon the hay where exhausted brain and body sank to sleep and rest  it seemed that a voice and a rude hand tore away the sweet oblivion  pard are you daid came blinkys voice keen and full with newer note  sunup an time to rustle  your dads heah an he says breakfast is waitin  pan rose and stretched  his muscles ached as though he had been beaten  how bright the sun  night was gone and with it something dreadful  pan shore youre a tough lookin cowboy this mawnin said blinky wash an shave yourself like i did  heahs my razor  theres a basin an water up under the kitchen porch  howdy bridegroom returned pan with appreciative eyes on blinkys shiny face and slick hair  hows your wife  daid to the world whispered blinky blushing red as a rose  i took a peep  gee  pard i hope she sleeps all day an all night  shore im scared fer her to wake  i dont blame you cowboy  itll be funny when she finds out shes got a boss  pard if we was away from this heah town id be happy i swear wouldnt you returned blinky shyly  why blink i believe i would said pan and strode off toward the house  he made himself presentable before anyone saw him  then he waited for his father and blinky whom he heard talking  when they came up he joined them  wild horses could not have dragged him into the house alone  as they entered the kitchen bobby let out a yell and made for him  that loosened a strain for pan and he picked up the lad  when he faced his mother it was with composure that belied the state of his feelings  she appeared to be in a blaze of excitement and at once he realized that all she had needed was his return safe and sound  then he heard alices voice and lucys in reply  as he set bobby down thrilling all over the girls entered the kitchen  alices reply to his greeting was at once bright and shy  lucy halted in the doorway with a hand on her breast  her smile slow and wistful seemed to blot out traces of havoc in her face  but her eyes were dark purple a sign of strong emotion  pans slight inclination unaccompanied by word of greeting was as black a pretense as he had ever been guilty of  sight of her had shot him through and through with pangs of bitter mocking joy  but he gave no sign  during the meal he did not look at her again  dad have you got everything well need queried pan presently  i guess so replied smith  you can start loadin the wagons  an by the time two of them are done well have everythin packed  blink can drive one wagon you another and ill take the third till we get out to snyders  then well need another driver for itll take two of us to handle the wild horses  no we wont replied his father  your mother an lucy can drive as well as i  son i reckon we dont want anybody except our own outfit  id like that myself admitted pan thoughtfully  if youve got good gentle teams maybe mother an lucy can take turns  well try it anyhow  ill help you hitch up said smith following pan out  son do you look for any trouble this mornin  lord no  im not looking for trouble replied pan  ive sure had enough  huh ejaculated blinky  your dad means any backfire from marco wal i say therell be nothin  all the same we want to move pronto  id like to hear what happened after we left said pan  somebody will tell us returned smith  they had reached the end of the arbor when lucys voice called after them panplease wait  he turned to see her coming twisting her apron in nervous hands pans father and blinky kept on toward the barn  lucy came hurriedly unevenly pale with parted lips and eyes that held him  mother said you knew buti must tell youmyself she said brokenly as she halted close to him  day before yesterdaythose men brought word youd beenkilled in a fight over wild horses  it broke my heart  id have taken my own life but for my father  i didnt care what happened  dick pressed me hard  father begged me to save him from prison  so ii married dick  yes i knowi figured it out that way returned pan in strange thick utterance  you didnt need to tell me  why pan youyou seem different she said as if bewildered your lookyour voice  oh dear  i know yesterday was awful  it must have driven you mad  by heaven it did muttered pan under his breath  but youyou forgive me she faltered reaching to touch him with a shaking hand  the gesture so supplicating so tender the dark soft hunger of her eyes the sweetness of her then roused a tumult in him how could she look at him like that  how dared she have such love light in her eyes  forgive you for he cried in fierce passion  but he could not put into words what she had done  i meant to kill that dog dick hardman but i didnt  forgive you he broke off unable to go on  she was slow to grasp his intimation though not his fury  suddenly her eyes dilated in horror  then a great wave of scarlet blood swept over her white neck and face  pan saw in it the emblem of her shame with a rending of his heart he swung away and left her  he plunged into the work at hand and during the next couple of hours recovered from the shock of resisting lucys appeal  he hated himself for the passion he could not subdue  when however it had slunk away for the time being he began to wonder at her innocence and simplicity he could not understand her  presently his father and blinky hunted him up with news of strong purport plain in their faces  son marco is with you to a man  pard i guess mebbe i didnt hev them hombres figgered  what happened  out with it replied pan sharply  evans drove out bringin stuff i bought yesterday returned his father  he was full as a tick of news  by some miracle only the yellow mine burned  it was gutted but the bucket brigade saved the houses on each side  hardmans body was found burned to a crisp it was identified by a ring  an his dancehall girl was found dead too burned most as bad as he  accordin to evans most everybody in marco wants to shake hands with panhandle smith   the covered wagons wound slowly down the hill toward snyders pasture pan leading blinks horse held to the rear  the day in some respects had been as torturing to him as yesterdaybut with marco far behind and the open road ahead calling beckoning the strain began to lessen  at the pasture gate the drivers halted the wagon teams waiting for pan to come up  gus had opened the widebarred gate and now stood there with a grin of relief and gladness  drive in shouted pan from behind  well camp here tonight  howdy thar you ole wildhoss night wrangler yelled blinky to gus  howdy yourself was the reply  you can bet your roll that i never expected to see you agin  whatd you do to marco  they drove in along the west fence where a row of trees shaded the still hot sun  gus i see our wild horses are still keeping you company remarked pan as he loosened the cinch of his saddle  shore  but they aint so wild no more  ive fooled around with them for two days now replied gus  pan smacked sorrel on the flank there  go take a look at your rival whitefoot  but the sorrel hung around camp  he had been spoiled by an occasional nose bag of grain  pan lent a hand all around and took note of the fact that blinky lingered long around his wagon  pan peeped over the wagon side  louise lay on her side with face exposed it was pale with eyelids tight  in sleep her features betrayed how life had wronged her  reckon youre wise blink to keep your wagon away from the others like this said pan  because when your wife wakes up theres liable to be hell  call me pronto  pard youre shore she aint in a stupor or somethin queried blinky apprehensively  blink you know she was ill for ten days  then she drank a lot reckon shes knocked out  but theres nothing to worry about except shell jump the traces when she comes to  you mean when she finds outishewere married  thats what pard blink  i wish you didnt have to tell her  me  my gawd i caint tell her replied blinky in consternation shore you gotta do that  all right blink  ill save what little hair you have left returned pan good humoredly  he walked out to take a look at the horses which were scattered on the far side of the pasture  they could not be closely approached yet were not nearly so wild as he had expected them to be  the saddle and wagon horses grazed among them  the blue roan looked vastly better for two days rest  whitefoot was a noble stallion  sight of little bay brought keen pain to pan  what boundless difference between his state of mind when he had caught that beautiful little horse and what it was now  pan went back to the campfire  supper was in progress with the capable mrs smith bustling about  lucy and alice were assisting  pan stole a glance at lucy  her face was flushed from the wind and sun she wore a white apron her sleeves were rolled up to show round strong arms  bobby and his two puppies were much in the way  pan how is mrs somers inquired his mother solicitously  who queried pan puzzled  why your partners wife  oh blinky   gee id clean forgot his right name laughed pan mentally kicking himself  shes still sound asleep  i told blinky not to wake her  she looked white and worn out  but shell starve interposed lucy with questioning eyes on pan indeed their meaning had no relation to her words  you men dont know anything  wont you let me wake her  thanks  better let her alone till tomorrow replied pan briefly  presently there came the call to supper which had been laid upon a new tarpaulin spread on the ground  the men flopped down and sat crosslegged each with silent or vociferous appreciation of that generous repast  shades of the grub line ejaculated blinky  am i ridin or dreamin  mother this is heaven for a cowboy  and think well be three weeks on the road added pan  but son our good things to eat wont last that long she replied much gratified by his compliment  aw the good lord shore remembered me when he throwed me in with this outfit declared the usually reticent gus  pan observed that both alice and his mother strictly avoided serving him with those things that had to be carried hot from the campfire they let lucy do it  pan did not look up at her and murmured his thanks in monosyllables  once her hand touched his and the contact was like a galvanizing current  for the moment he could not go on eating  during the sunset hour pan helped grease the wagon wheels something that had been neglected and had retarded their progress  other tasks used up the time until dark  bobby got himself spanked by falling out of the wagon after he had been put to bed  it was after nightfall when pan heard blinkys call  he hurried over to the wagon where he found his comrade tremendously excited  pard shes waked up he whispered  pan strode to the wagon  there was enough light for him to see the girl sitting up with hands pressed to her head  hello louie he said gently  where the hell am i she replied huskily dropping her hands to stare at him  on the way to arizona  well if it isnt handsome panhandle  and blinky  howdylouie said blinky fearfully  ive been drunk she queried  reckon you havea little replied pan  and you boys have kidnapped me she went on  im afraid thats so louie  get me a drink  not water  my heads bursting  and help me out of this haymow  she threw aside the blanket that partially covered her and got to her knees  pan lifted her out of the wagon  then he ran off toward camp to get a flask  upon returning he found blinky trying to put a blanket round louises shoulders  she threw it off  wait till i cool off she said  panhandle did you get itim shaky all right  thanks  some day ill take my last drink  louie i hope that will be soon rejoined pan  you know i hate whisky  oh my headand my legs are cramped let me walk a little  pan drew blinky aside in the gloom  she hasnt begun to think yet reckon youd better stay away from her  let her come back to the wagon  pard shore she took our kidnappin her all right whispered blinky hopefully  blink ill bet a million shell be gladafter it all comes out responded pan  presently louise interrupted their whispered colloquy  help me up im sickand weak  they lifted her back into the wagon and covered her  in the pale starlight her eyes looked unnaturally big and black  no useto lie she said drowsily her head rolling  im glad to leavemarco  take me anywhere  then her eyes closed  again pan drew blinky away into the gloom  its the way i figured whispered pan swiftly  shell never remember what happened  thank gawd fer thet breathed blinky  they found the campfire deserted except for gus and pans father evidently pans advent interrupted a story that had been most exciting to gus  son ii was just tellin gus all i know about what come off yesterday explained smith frankly though with some haste  but there are some points id sure like cleared up for myself  pan had expected this and had fortified himself against the inevitable  well get it over then once and for all he replied not too civilly  you come damn near buttin right into the weddin ejaculated smith with a sense of what dramatic possibility had just been missed  pan whose back had been turned to the campfire light suddenly whirled as if on a pivot  what he cried  then there seemed to be a cessation of all his faculties  why son you neednt jump out of your boots returned the father somewhat offended  lucy was married to hardman in the stage office just before you got there  fact was shed just walked out to get in the stage when you came  now i was only sayin how funny itd been if you had got there sooner  whotoldyouthat  lucy told me  an she said tonight she didnt believe you knew returned his father  there was a blank silence  pan slowly turned away from the light  no  i had an ideashed been marrieddays replied pan in queer strangled voice  you should have asked some questions said smith bluntly  it was a damn unfortunate affair but it mustnt be made worse for lucy than it actually was  she was dick hardmans wife for less than five minutes before you arrived  without another word pan stalked away into the darkness  he heard his father say bet thats what ailed himthe darned idiot  pan gained the pasture fence under the dark trees and he grasped it tightly as if his hold on life had been shaken  the shock of incredulous amaze passed away leaving him in the grip of joy and gratitude and remorse  how vastly different was this vigil under the stars     chapter eighteen  it was pan who routed out the campers next morning when the first rose of dawn flushed the clearcut horizon line  he had the firewood collected and the saddle horses in for their grain before blinky presented himself  wild eyed indeed was the cowboy  pard he whispered huskily dragging pan aside some paces the cyclones busted  yes queried pan in both mirth and concern  i was pullin on my boots when louise pokes her head above the wagon an says hey you bowlegged gurl snatcher wheres my clothes  what clothes i answers  an she snaps out mine  didnt you fetch my clothes  louie i says we shore forgot them an they burned up with all the rest of the yellow mine  an if you want to know my dear im darn glad of it  then pan she began to cuss me an i jumps up mad but right dignified an says mrs somers ill require you to stop usin profanity  mrs somers she whispers her eyes poppin  are you crazy an i told her i shore wasnt crazy an i shore was sober  an thet my name wasnt moran but somers  she gave a gasp an fell back in the wagon  an you bet i run fer you  now pard for gawds sake whatll i do finished blinky with a groan  cowboy youve done noble replied pan in great satisfaction  whaatsay pan you look queer this mawnin  sort of shiny eyed an lightfooted  you dont look drunk or loco  so what ails you  blink im as crazy as you responded pan almost hugging his friend but dont worry another minute  i swear i can fix it up with louise i swear i can fix anything  with that pan strode across the dewwet grass to the trees under which stood blinkys wagon  there was no sign of the girl  pan breasted the wagon side to look down  she was there wideeyed with arms under her head staring at the colored leaves  morning louie how are you he began cheerfully smiling down upon her  i dont know she replied  well you look better thats sure  pan am i that cowboys wife she queried gravely  yes he replied just as gravely  did he force me to marry him when i was drunk  no  blink is innocent of all except loving you louie answered pan deliberately choosing his words  he had planned all he meant to say last night under the trees in the dark many truths had come to him it was i who forced you to marry him  she covered her eyes with her hands and pressed hard as if to make clear her bewildering thoughts  oh ii cant remember  louie dont distress yourself he said soothingly  you bet i can remember and ill tell you  wait  i want to get up  but you forgot my clothes  i cant go round in a blanket  by golly i never thought of that  but we didnt have much time see here louise i can fix it  youre about the same height as lucy ill borrow some of her clothes for you  lucy she echoed staring at him  yes lucy he replied easily  and while im at it ill fetch a basin of hot waterand everything  whereupon he hurried over to the campfire where he found mrs smith busy and cheerful  lucy up yet he asked briskly  yes pan she replied with hurried glad smile  shes brushing her hair there by the wagon  pan strode up to lucy where she stood before the wagon a mass of golden hair hanging down her back to which she was vigorously applying a brush  hello lucy he said coolly  ohhow you startledme she exclaimed turning with a blush  say wont you help us out he went on not so coolly  the other night in the excitement we forgot to fetch louises clothes  fact is we grabbed her up out of a sick bed with only a dressing gown and a blanket  wont you lend her some clothes shoes stockingsandeverything  indeed i will responded lucy and with alacrity she climbed into the covered wagon  pan waited and presently began to pace to and fro  he was restless eager buoyant  he could not stand still  his thoughts whirled away from the issue at hand back to lucy and the glory that had been restored to him  here pan called lucy reappearing with a large bundle  heres all shell need i think  lucky i bought some new things  alice and i can get along with one mirror brush and comb  thanks he said  it was lucky  sure our luck has changed  dont forget some warm water added lucy practically calling after him  thus burdened pan hurried back to louises wagon and deposited the basin on the seat and the bundle beside her  there you are pioneer girl he said cheerily and with swift hands he let down the canvas curtains of the wagon shutting her in  come on blink he called to the cowboy watching from behind the trees  lets wrangle the teams  gus an your dad are comin in with them now replied blinky joining him and presently when they got away from the wagon he whispered how aboot it  blink i swear itll go through fine declared pan earnestly  she knows shes your wifethat i got her drunk and forced her into it she doesnt remember  im hoping shell not remember anything but even if she does ill fix it  shoreyoure panhandle smithall right returned blinky unsteadily  at this juncture they were called to breakfast  pan needed only one glance at his father his mother and lucy to gather that bewilderment and worry had vanished  they knew that he knew  it seemed to pan that the bursting sun knew the dark world had been transformed to a shining one  yet he played with his happiness like a cat with a mouse  mrs smith begged blinky presently please fix me up some breakfast fer louise  shes better this mawnin an i reckon in a day or so will be helpin you an lucy  pan set himself some camp tasks for the moment and annoyed his mother and embarrassed lucy by plunging into duties they considered theirs  mother dont you and lucy realize we are going to a far country he queried  we must rustle  theres the open road  ho for siccanefor sunny arizonaland  when he presented himself before louise he scarcely recognized her in the prim comely change of apparel  the atmosphere of the yellow mine had vanished  she had managed to eat some breakfast  blinky discreetly found a task that took him away  weve a little time to talk now louie said pan  theyll be packing the wagons  he led her under the cottonwoods to the pasture fence where he found a seat for her  pan why did you do this thing she asked  that was the very question he had hoped she would put first  because my friend loves you and you told me you tried to keep him away from youthat if you didnt you would like him too well answered pan  blink had never been any good in the past  just a wild reckless harddrinking cowpuncher  but his heart was big  then you were going straight to hell  youd have been knifed or shot in some brawl or have killed yourself with drink  a few more months of the yellow mine would have been your end  well i thought heres an opportunity to make a man out of my friend and save the soul of a girl who hasnt had a chance  i never hesitated about taking advantage of you  that was only a means to an end  so i planned it and did it  but panhow impossible she replied brokenly  why id like to know  i amdegraded  no  ive a different notion  you were not when you were sober but even so that is past  blink might have been what you said but still iim no fit wife for him  you can be went on pan with strong feeling  just blot out the past  begin now  blink will make a good man a successful rancher he has money enough to start with  hell never drink again  no matter what you call yourself youre the only girl he ever loved  youre the only one who can make him earnest  blink saw as well as i the pity of ityour miserable existence there in that gambling hell  pan you talklikeoh you make me think of what might have been she cried  but ill not consent  ill not give men the right to point their fingers at blink  ill run awayoror kill myself  louie that is silly talk censured pan sharply  dont make me regret my interest in youmy affection  you are judging this thing with your mind on the past  youre not considering the rough wild raw life we cowboys have lived  we must make way for the pioneers and become pioneers ourselves  in fifty years when the west is settled who will ever recall such as you and blinky  these are hard days  you can do as much for the future of the west as any woman louise melliss  pan i understandii couldi know if i dared to bury it all  but i want to play square  could you come to love my friendin timei mean  thats the great thing  i believe i love him now she murmured  thats why i cant risk itsomeone who knew me would turn up  to disgrace my husbandandand children if i had any  not one chance in a million flashed pan feeling that she could not withstand him  were going farinto another country  besides everyone in marco believes you lost your life in the fire  whatfire  the yellow mine burned  it must have caughtwhen we shot out the lamps   dick hardman was burned and a girl they took for you  suddenly louise leaped up ghastly pale  i remember now  blink came to my room she said hoarsely  i wouldnt let him in  then you came  oh i remember now  i let you in when all the time dick hardman was hiding in my closet  i knew you had him hidden rejoined pan  you meant to kill him  the yellow dog  he came to me when i was sick in bed  he begged me to hide him  and i did  then you talked to me as youre talking now   blink came with the whisky  oh i see it all now  sure  and louiewhat did i tell you about hardman returned pan sure of his ground now and stern in his forcefulness  i dont remember  you told me hardman said hed marry you and that some day when you were drunk youd do it  yes he said that and i might have agreed but i dont remember telling you  well you did  and then i told you hardman had forced my sweetheart lucy to marry him  what  he did that  reckon he did  i got there too late  but i drove him off to get a gun  then he hid there with you  so that was why she pondered as if trying to penetrate the cloudiness of her mind  something comes like a horrible dream  sure he hurried on  let me get it over  i told you he couldnt marry you when he already had a wife  you went crazy then  you betrayed hardman  he came rushing out of the closet  pretty nasty he was louie   well i left him lying in the hall  i grabbed youwrapped you in a blanketand ran out  blink was waiting  he shot out the lights in the saloon  we got away  the place burned up with some girl they took for youand hardman  my god  burned alive  no replied pan hoarsely  panyouyou avenged meand your lucyyou she whispered clinging to him  hush  dont speak it  dont ever think it again he said sternly thats our secret  rumor has it he fled from me to hide with you and you were both burned up  but lucyyour mother she cried  they know nothing except that youre my friends wifethat youve been ill he replied  theyre all kindness and sympathy  dad never saw you and gus will keep his mouth shut  play your part now louise you and blink make up your past  just a few simple statements then bury the past forever  ohim slippingslipping she whispered bursting into tears help meback to the wagon  she walked a few rods with pans arm supporting her  then she collapsed  he had to carry her to the wagon where he deposited her sobbing and limp behind the canvas curtains  pan pitied her with all his heart yet he was glad indeed she had broken down  it had been easier than he had anticipated  then he espied blinky coming in manifest concern  pard said pan in his ear youve a pat hand  play it for all youre worth   the wagons rolled down the long winding open road  for the shortest fullest eight hours pan had ever experienced he matched his wits against the wild horses that he and gus had to drive it was a down grade and the wagons rolled thirty miles before pan picked a camp site in the mouth of a little grassy canyon where the wild horses could be corralled  jack rabbits deer coyotes ranged away from the noisy invasion of their solitude  it was wild country marco was distant forty miles up the sweeping ridgesfar behindgone into the past  as the wagons rolled one by one up to the camping place  pan observed that blinky the last to arrive had a companion on the drivers seat beside him  pan waved a glad hand  it was louise who waved in return wind and sun had warmed the pallor out of her face   four days on the way to siccane  the wild horses were no longer wild the travelers to the far country had become like one big family  they all had their tasks  even bobby sat on his fathers knee and drove the team down the open road toward the homestead where he was to grow into a pioneer lad  so far pan had carried on his pretense of aloofness from lucy apparently blind to the wondering appeal in her eyes  long ago he had forgiven her  yet he waited divining surely that some day or night when an opportune moment came she would voice the question in her eyes  he thought he could hold out longer than she could  that very evening when he went to fetch water she waylaid him surprised him  panhandle smith you are killing me she said with great eyes of accusation  how so he asked weakly  you know she retorted  and i wont stand it longer  what is it you wont stand teased pan  but suddenly lucy broke down  dont  dont keep it up she cried desperately  i know it was a terrible thing to do  but i told you why  i couldnt have gone away with himafter id seen you  well im glad to hear that  i was mad enough to think you mighteven care for him  pan i love only you  all my life its been only you  lucy  tomorrow we ride into green river  will you marry me there  yesif youlove me she whispered going close to him  pan dropped both of the buckets splashing water everywhere   arizonaland  it was not only a far country attained but another strange and beautiful  siccane lay a white and green dot far over the purple sage the goldenwalled mesas stood up black fringed against the blue  in the bold notches burned the red of autumn foliage  valleys spread between the tablelands  there was room for a hundred homesteads pans keen eye sighted only a few and they were farther on green squares in the gray  down toward siccane cattle made tiny specks on the vast expanse  square miles of bleached grass contended with the surrounding slopes of sage sweeping with slow graceful rise up to the bases of the walls and mesas  water  grass  no fences exclaimed pans father with a glad note of renewed youth  dad  lucy  look replied pan pointing across the valley  see that first big notch in the wall  thick with bright green  theres water  and see the open canyon with the cedars scattered  what a place for a ranch  it has been waiting for us all these years  thats where well homestead  wal pard an you louielook over heah aways drawled blinky with long arm outstretched  see the red circle wall with the brook shinin down like a ribbon  lookin to the south  warm in wintercool in summer  shores i was born in the west thets the homestead fer me  the wagons rolled on behind wild horses that needed little driving down the long winding open road across the valley  and so on into the rich grass where no wheel track showedon into the sage toward the lonely beckoning walls
