63882224	my man jeeves     by p g wodehouse  1919     contents   leave it to jeeves  jeeves and the unbidden guest  jeeves and the hardboiled egg  absent treatment  helping freddie  rallying round old george  doing clarence a bit of good  the aunt and the sluggard     leave it to jeeves   jeevesmy man you knowis really a most extraordinary chap so capable honestly i shouldnt know what to do without him on broader lines hes like those chappies who sit peering sadly over the marble battlements at the pennsylvania station in the place marked inquiries you know the johnnies i mean you go up to them and say whens the next train for melonsquashville tennessee and they reply without stopping to think twofortythree track ten change at san francisco and theyre right every time well jeeves gives you just the same impression of omniscience  as an instance of what i mean i remember meeting monty byng in bond street one morning looking the last word in a grey check suit and i felt i should never be happy till i had one like it i dug the address of the tailors out of him and had them working on the thing inside the hour  jeeves i said that evening im getting a check suit like that one of mr byngs  injudicious sir he said firmly it will not become you  what absolute rot its the soundest thing ive struck for years  unsuitable for you sir  well the long and the short of it was that the confounded thing came home and i put it on and when i caught sight of myself in the glass i nearly swooned jeeves was perfectly right i looked a cross between a musichall comedian and a cheap bookie yet monty had looked fine in absolutely the same stuff these things are just lifes mysteries and thats all there is to it  but it isnt only that jeevess judgment about clothes is infallible though of course thats really the main thing the man knows everything there was the matter of that tip on the lincolnshire i forget now how i got it but it had the aspect of being the real redhot tabasco  jeeves i said for im fond of the man and like to do him a good turn when i can if you want to make a bit of money have something on wonderchild for the lincolnshire  he shook his head  id rather not sir  but its the straight goods im going to put my shirt on him  i do not recommend it sir the animal is not intended to win second place is what the stable is after  perfect piffle i thought of course how the deuce could jeeves know anything about it still you know what happened wonderchild led till he was breathing on the wire and then banana fritter came along and nosed him out i went straight home and rang for jeeves  after this i said not another step for me without your advice from now on consider yourself the brains of the establishment  very good sir i shall endeavour to give satisfaction  and he has by jove im a bit short on brain myself the old bean would appear to have been constructed more for ornament than for use dont you know but give me five minutes to talk the thing over with jeeves and im game to advise any one about anything and thats why when bruce corcoran came to me with his troubles my first act was to ring the bell and put it up to the lad with the bulging forehead  leave it to jeeves i said  i first got to know corky when i came to new york he was a pal of my cousin gussie who was in with a lot of people down washington square way i dont know if i ever told you about it but the reason why i left england was because i was sent over by my aunt agatha to try to stop young gussie marrying a girl on the vaudeville stage and i got the whole thing so mixed up that i decided that it would be a sound scheme for me to stop on in america for a bit instead of going back and having long cosy chats about the thing with aunt so i sent jeeves out to find a decent apartment and settled down for a bit of exile im bound to say that new yorks a topping place to be exiled in everybody was awfully good to me and there seemed to be plenty of things going on and im a wealthy bird so everything was fine chappies introduced me to other chappies and so on and so forth and it wasnt long before i knew squads of the right sort some who rolled in dollars in houses up by the park and others who lived with the gas turned down mostly around washington squareartists and writers and so forth brainy coves  corky was one of the artists a portraitpainter he called himself but he hadnt painted any portraits he was sitting on the sidelines with a blanket over his shoulders waiting for a chance to get into the game you see the catch about portraitpaintingive looked into the thing a bitis that you cant start painting portraits till people come along and ask you to and they wont come and ask you to until youve painted a lot first this makes it kind of difficult for a chappie corky managed to get along by drawing an occasional picture for the comic papershe had rather a gift for funny stuff when he got a good ideaand doing bedsteads and chairs and things for the advertisements his principal source of income however was derived from biting the ear of a rich uncleone alexander worple who was in the jute business im a bit foggy as to what jute is but its apparently something the populace is pretty keen on for mr worple had made quite an indecently large stack out of it  now a great many fellows think that having a rich uncle is a pretty soft snap but according to corky such is not the case corkys uncle was a robust sort of cove who looked like living for ever he was fiftyone and it seemed as if he might go to par it was not this however that distressed poor old corky for he was not bigoted and had no objection to the man going on living what corky kicked at was the way the above worple used to harry him  corkys uncle you see didnt want him to be an artist he didnt think he had any talent in that direction he was always urging him to chuck art and go into the jute business and start at the bottom and work his way up jute had apparently become a sort of obsession with him he seemed to attach almost a spiritual importance to it and what corky said was that while he didnt know what they did at the bottom of the jute business instinct told him that it was something too beastly for words corky moreover believed in his future as an artist some day he said he was going to make a hit meanwhile by using the utmost tact and persuasiveness he was inducing his uncle to cough up very grudgingly a small quarterly allowance  he wouldnt have got this if his uncle hadnt had a hobby mr worple was peculiar in this respect as a rule from what ive observed the american captain of industry doesnt do anything out of business hours when he has put the cat out and locked up the office for the night he just relapses into a state of coma from which he emerges only to start being a captain of industry again but mr worple in his spare time was what is known as an ornithologist he had written a book called american birds and was writing another to be called more american birds when he had finished that the presumption was that he would begin a third and keep on till the supply of american birds gave out corky used to go to him about once every three months and let him talk about american birds apparently you could do what you liked with old worple if you gave him his head first on his pet subject so these little chats used to make corkys allowance all right for the time being but it was pretty rotten for the poor chap there was the frightful suspense you see and apart from that birds except when broiled and in the society of a cold bottle bored him stiff  to complete the characterstudy of mr worple he was a man of extremely uncertain temper and his general tendency was to think that corky was a poor chump and that whatever step he took in any direction on his own account was just another proof of his innate idiocy i should imagine jeeves feels very much the same about me  so when corky trickled into my apartment one afternoon shooing a girl in front of him and said bertie i want you to meet my fianc√©e miss singer the aspect of the matter which hit me first was precisely the one which he had come to consult me about the very first words i spoke were corky how about your uncle  the poor chap gave one of those mirthless laughs he was looking anxious and worried like a man who has done the murder all right but cant think what the deuce to do with the body  were so scared mr wooster said the girl we were hoping that you might suggest a way of breaking it to him  muriel singer was one of those very quiet appealing girls who have a way of looking at you with their big eyes as if they thought you were the greatest thing on earth and wondered that you hadnt got on to it yet yourself she sat there in a sort of shrinking way looking at me as if she were saying to herself oh i do hope this great strong man isnt going to hurt me she gave a fellow a protective kind of feeling made him want to stroke her hand and say there there little one or words to that effect she made me feel that there was nothing i wouldnt do for her she was rather like one of those innocenttasting american drinks which creep imperceptibly into your system so that before you know what youre doing youre starting out to reform the world by force if necessary and pausing on your way to tell the large man in the corner that if he looks at you like that you will knock his head off what i mean is she made me feel alert and dashing like a jolly old knighterrant or something of that kind i felt that i was with her in this thing to the limit  i dont see why your uncle shouldnt be most awfully bucked i said to corky he will think miss singer the ideal wife for you  corky declined to cheer up  you dont know him even if he did like muriel he wouldnt admit it thats the sort of pigheaded guy he is it would be a matter of principle with him to kick all he would consider would be that i had gone and taken an important step without asking his advice and he would raise cain automatically hes always done it  i strained the old bean to meet this emergency  you want to work it so that he makes miss singers acquaintance without knowing that you know her then you come along  but how can i work it that way  i saw his point that was the catch  theres only one thing to do i said  whats that  leave it to jeeves  and i rang the bell  sir said jeeves kind of manifesting himself one of the rummy things about jeeves is that unless you watch like a hawk you very seldom see him come into a room hes like one of those weird chappies in india who dissolve themselves into thin air and nip through space in a sort of disembodied way and assemble the parts again just where they want them ive got a cousin whos what they call a theosophist and he says hes often nearly worked the thing himself but couldnt quite bring it off probably owing to having fed in his boyhood on the flesh of animals slain in anger and pie  the moment i saw the man standing there registering respectful attention a weight seemed to roll off my mind i felt like a lost child who spots his father in the offing there was something about him that gave me confidence  jeeves is a tallish man with one of those dark shrewd faces his eye gleams with the light of pure intelligence  jeeves we want your advice  very good sir  i boiled down corkys painful case into a few wellchosen words  so you see what it amount to jeeves we want you to suggest some way by which mr worple can make miss singers acquaintance without getting on to the fact that mr corcoran already knows her understand  perfectly sir  well try to think of something  i have thought of something already sir  you have  the scheme i would suggest cannot fail of success but it has what may seem to you a drawback sir in that it requires a certain financial outlay  he means i translated to corky that he has got a pippin of an idea but its going to cost a bit  naturally the poor chaps face dropped for this seemed to dish the whole thing but i was still under the influence of the girls melting gaze and i saw that this was where i started in as a knighterrant  you can count on me for all that sort of thing corky i said only too glad carry on jeeves  i would suggest sir that mr corcoran take advantage of mr worples attachment to ornithology  how on earth did you know that he was fond of birds  it is the way these new york apartments are constructed sir quite unlike our london houses the partitions between the rooms are of the flimsiest nature with no wish to overhear i have sometimes heard mr corcoran expressing himself with a generous strength on the subject i have mentioned  oh well  why should not the young lady write a small volume to be entitledlet us saythe childrens book of american birds and dedicate it to mr worple a limited edition could be published at your expense sir and a great deal of the book would of course be given over to eulogistic remarks concerning mr worples own larger treatise on the same subject i should recommend the dispatching of a presentation copy to mr worple immediately on publication accompanied by a letter in which the young lady asks to be allowed to make the acquaintance of one to whom she owes so much this would i fancy produce the desired result but as i say the expense involved would be considerable  i felt like the proprietor of a performing dog on the vaudeville stage when the tyke has just pulled off his trick without a hitch i had betted on jeeves all along and i had known that he wouldnt let me down it beats me sometimes why a man with his genius is satisfied to hang around pressing my clothes and whatnot if i had half jeevess brain i should have a stab at being prime minister or something  jeeves i said that is absolutely ripping one of your very best efforts  thank you sir  the girl made an objection  but im sure i couldnt write a book about anything i cant even write good letters  muriels talents said corky with a little cough lie more in the direction of the drama bertie i didnt mention it before but one of our reasons for being a trifle nervous as to how uncle alexander will receive the news is that muriel is in the chorus of that show choose your exit at the manhattan its absurdly unreasonable but we both feel that that fact might increase uncle alexanders natural tendency to kick like a steer  i saw what he meant goodness knows there was fuss enough in our family when i tried to marry into musical comedy a few years ago and the recollection of my aunt agathas attitude in the matter of gussie and the vaudeville girl was still fresh in my mind i dont know why it isone of these psychology sharps could explain it i supposebut uncles and aunts as a class are always dead against the drama legitimate or otherwise they dont seem able to stick it at any price  but jeeves had a solution of course  i fancy it would be a simple matter sir to find some impecunious author who would be glad to do the actual composition of the volume for a small fee it is only necessary that the young ladys name should appear on the title page  thats true said corky sam patterson would do it for a hundred dollars he writes a novelette three short stories and ten thousand words of a serial for one of the allfiction magazines under different names every month a little thing like this would be nothing to him ill get after him right away  fine  will that be all sir said jeeves very good sir thank you sir  i always used to think that publishers had to be devilish intelligent fellows loaded down with the grey matter but ive got their number now all a publisher has to do is to write cheques at intervals while a lot of deserving and industrious chappies rally round and do the real work i know because ive been one myself i simply sat tight in the old apartment with a fountainpen and in due season a topping shiny book came along  i happened to be down at corkys place when the first copies of the childrens book of american birds bobbed up muriel singer was there and we were talking of things in general when there was a bang at the door and the parcel was delivered  it was certainly some book it had a red cover with a fowl of some species on it and underneath the girls name in gold letters i opened a copy at random  often of a spring morning it said at the top of page twentyone as you wander through the fields you will hear the sweettoned carelessly flowing warble of the purple finch linnet when you are older you must read all about him in mr alexander worples wonderful bookamerican birds  you see a boost for the uncle right away and only a few pages later there he was in the limelight again in connection with the yellowbilled cuckoo it was great stuff the more i read the more i admired the chap who had written it and jeevess genius in putting us on to the wheeze i didnt see how the uncle could fail to drop you cant call a chap the worlds greatest authority on the yellowbilled cuckoo without rousing a certain disposition towards chumminess in him  its a cert i said  an absolute cinch said corky  and a day or two later he meandered up the avenue to my apartment to tell me that all was well the uncle had written muriel a letter so dripping with the milk of human kindness that if he hadnt known mr worples handwriting corky would have refused to believe him the author of it any time it suited miss singer to call said the uncle he would be delighted to make her acquaintance  shortly after this i had to go out of town divers sound sportsmen had invited me to pay visits to their country places and it wasnt for several months that i settled down in the city again i had been wondering a lot of course about corky whether it all turned out right and so forth and my first evening in new york happening to pop into a quiet sort of little restaurant which i go to when i dont feel inclined for the bright lights i found muriel singer there sitting by herself at a table near the door corky i took it was out telephoning i went up and passed the time of day  well well well what i said  why mr wooster how do you do  corky around  i beg your pardon  youre waiting for corky arent you  oh i didnt understand no im not waiting for him  it seemed to me that there was a sort of something in her voice a kind of thingummy you know  i say you havent had a row with corky have you  a row  a spat dont you knowlittle misunderstandingfaults on both sideserand all that sort of thing  why whatever makes you think that  oh well as it were what what i mean isi thought you usually dined with him before you went to the theatre  ive left the stage now  suddenly the whole thing dawned on me i had forgotten what a long time i had been away  why of course i see now youre married  yes  how perfectly topping i wish you all kinds of happiness  thank you so much oh alexander she said looking past me this is a friend of minemr wooster  i spun round a chappie with a lot of stiff grey hair and a red sort of healthy face was standing there rather a formidable johnnie he looked though quite peaceful at the moment  i want you to meet my husband mr wooster mr wooster is a friend of bruces alexander  the old boy grasped my hand warmly and that was all that kept me from hitting the floor in a heap the place was rocking absolutely  so you know my nephew mr wooster i heard him say i wish you would try to knock a little sense into him and make him quit this playing at painting but i have an idea that he is steadying down i noticed it first that night he came to dinner with us my dear to be introduced to you he seemed altogether quieter and more serious something seemed to have sobered him perhaps you will give us the pleasure of your company at dinner tonight mr wooster or have you dined  i said i had what i needed then was air not dinner i felt that i wanted to get into the open and think this thing out  when i reached my apartment i heard jeeves moving about in his lair i called him  jeeves i said now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of the party a stiff bands first of all and then ive a bit of news for you  he came back with a tray and a long glass  better have one yourself jeeves youll need it  later on perhaps thank you sir  all right please yourself but youre going to get a shock you remember my friend mr corcoran  yes sir  and the girl who was to slide gracefully into his uncles esteem by writing the book on birds  perfectly sir  well shes slid shes married the uncle  he took it without blinking you cant rattle jeeves  that was always a development to be feared sir  you dont mean to tell me that you were expecting it  it crossed my mind as a possibility  did it by jove well i think you might have warned us  i hardly liked to take the liberty sir  of course as i saw after i had had a bite to eat and was in a calmer frame of mind what had happened wasnt my fault if you come down to it i couldnt be expected to foresee that the scheme in itself a crackerjack would skid into the ditch as it had done but all the same im bound to admit that i didnt relish the idea of meeting corky again until time the great healer had been able to get in a bit of soothing work i cut washington square out absolutely for the next few months i gave it the complete missinbaulk and then just when i was beginning to think i might safely pop down in that direction and gather up the dropped threads so to speak time instead of working the healing wheeze went and pulled the most awful bone and put the lid on it opening the paper one morning i read that mrs alexander worple had presented her husband with a son and heir  i was so darned sorry for poor old corky that i hadnt the heart to touch my breakfast i told jeeves to drink it himself i was bowled over absolutely it was the limit  i hardly knew what to do i wanted of course to rush down to washington square and grip the poor blighter silently by the hand and then thinking it over i hadnt the nerve absent treatment seemed the touch i gave it him in waves  but after a month or so i began to hesitate again it struck me that it was playing it a bit lowdown on the poor chap avoiding him like this just when he probably wanted his pals to surge round him most i pictured him sitting in his lonely studio with no company but his bitter thoughts and the pathos of it got me to such an extent that i bounded straight into a taxi and told the driver to go all out for the studio  i rushed in and there was corky hunched up at the easel painting away while on the model throne sat a severelooking female of middle age holding a baby  a fellow has to be ready for that sort of thing  oh ah i said and started to back out  corky looked over his shoulder  halloa bertie dont go were just finishing for the day that will be all this afternoon he said to the nurse who got up with the baby and decanted it into a perambulator which was standing in the fairway  at the same hour tomorrow mr corcoran  yes please  good afternoon  good afternoon  corky stood there looking at the door and then he turned to me and began to get it off his chest fortunately he seemed to take it for granted that i knew all about what had happened so it wasnt as awkward as it might have been  its my uncles idea he said muriel doesnt know about it yet the portraits to be a surprise for her on her birthday the nurse takes the kid out ostensibly to get a breather and they beat it down here if you want an instance of the irony of fate bertie get acquainted with this heres the first commission i have ever had to paint a portrait and the sitter is that human poached egg that has butted in and bounced me out of my inheritance can you beat it i call it rubbing the thing in to expect me to spend my afternoons gazing into the ugly face of a little brat who to all intents and purposes has hit me behind the ear with a blackjack and swiped all i possess i cant refuse to paint the portrait because if i did my uncle would stop my allowance yet every time i look up and catch that kids vacant eye i suffer agonies i tell you bertie sometimes when he gives me a patronizing glance and then turns away and is sick as if it revolted him to look at me i come within an ace of occupying the entire front page of the evening papers as the latest murder sensation there are moments when i can almost see the headlines promising young artist beans baby with axe  i patted his shoulder silently my sympathy for the poor old scout was too deep for words  i kept away from the studio for some time after that because it didnt seem right to me to intrude on the poor chappies sorrow besides im bound to say that nurse intimidated me she reminded me so infernally of aunt agatha she was the same gimleteyed type  but one afternoon corky called me on the phone  bertie  halloa  are you doing anything this afternoon  nothing special  you couldnt come down here could you  whats the trouble anything up  ive finished the portrait  good boy stout work  yes his voice sounded rather doubtful the fact is bertie it doesnt look quite right to me theres something about itmy uncles coming in half an hour to inspect it andi dont know why it is but i kind of feel id like your moral support  i began to see that i was letting myself in for something the sympathetic cooperation of jeeves seemed to me to be indicated  you think hell cut up rough  he may  i threw my mind back to the redfaced chappie i had met at the restaurant and tried to picture him cutting up rough it was only too easy i spoke to corky firmly on the telephone  ill come i said  good  but only if i may bring jeeves  why jeeves whats jeeves got to do with it who wants jeeves jeeves is the fool who suggested the scheme that has led  listen corky old top if you think i am going to face that uncle of yours without jeevess support youre mistaken id sooner go into a den of wild beasts and bite a lion on the back of the neck  oh all right said corky not cordially but he said it so i rang for jeeves and explained the situation  very good sir said jeeves  thats the sort of chap he is you cant rattle him  we found corky near the door looking at the picture with one hand up in a defensive sort of way as if he thought it might swing on him  stand right where you are bertie he said without moving now tell me honestly how does it strike you  the light from the big window fell right on the picture i took a good look at it then i shifted a bit nearer and took another look then i went back to where i had been at first because it hadnt seemed quite so bad from there  well said corky anxiously  i hesitated a bit  of course old man i only saw the kid once and then only for a moment butbut it was an ugly sort of kid wasnt it if i remember rightly  as ugly as that  i looked again and honesty compelled me to be frank  i dont see how it could have been old chap  poor old corky ran his fingers through his hair in a temperamental sort of way he groaned  youre right quite bertie somethings gone wrong with the darned thing my private impression is that without knowing it ive worked that stunt that sargent and those fellows pullpainting the soul of the sitter ive got through the mere outward appearance and have put the childs soul on canvas  but could a child of that age have a soul like that i dont see how he could have managed it in the time what do you think jeeves  i doubt it sir  itit sorts of leers at you doesnt it  youve noticed that too said corky  i dont see how one could help noticing  all i tried to do was to give the little brute a cheerful expression but as it worked out he looks positively dissipated  just what i was going to suggest old man he looks as if he were in the middle of a colossal spree and enjoying every minute of it dont you think so jeeves  he has a decidedly inebriated air sir  corky was starting to say something when the door opened and the uncle came in  for about three seconds all was joy jollity and goodwill the old boy shook hands with me slapped corky on the back said that he didnt think he had ever seen such a fine day and whacked his leg with his stick jeeves had projected himself into the background and he didnt notice him  well bruce my boy so the portrait is really finished is itreally finished well bring it out lets have a look at it this will be a wonderful surprise for your aunt where is it lets  and then he got itsuddenly when he wasnt set for the punch and he rocked back on his heels  oosh he exclaimed and for perhaps a minute there was one of the scaliest silences ive ever run up against  is this a practical joke he said at last in a way that set about sixteen draughts cutting through the room at once  i thought it was up to me to rally round old corky  you want to stand a bit farther away from it i said  youre perfectly right he snorted i do i want to stand so far away from it that i cant see the thing with a telescope he turned on corky like an untamed tiger of the jungle who has just located a chunk of meat and thisthisis what you have been wasting your time and my money for all these years a painter i wouldnt let you paint a house of mine i gave you this commission thinking that you were a competent worker and thisthisthis extract from a comic coloured supplement is the result he swung towards the door lashing his tail and growling to himself this ends it if you wish to continue this foolery of pretending to be an artist because you want an excuse for idleness please yourself but let me tell you this unless you report at my office on monday morning prepared to abandon all this idiocy and start in at the bottom of the business to work your way up as you should have done half a dozen years ago not another centnot another centnot anotherboosh  then the door closed and he was no longer with us and i crawled out of the bombproof shelter  corky old top i whispered faintly  corky was standing staring at the picture his face was set there was a hunted look in his eye  well that finishes it he muttered brokenly  what are you going to do  do what can i do i cant stick on here if he cuts off supplies you heard what he said i shall have to go to the office on monday  i couldnt think of a thing to say i knew exactly how he felt about the office i dont know when ive been so infernally uncomfortable it was like hanging round trying to make conversation to a pal whos just been sentenced to twenty years in quod  and then a soothing voice broke the silence  if i might make a suggestion sir  it was jeeves he had slid from the shadows and was gazing gravely at the picture upon my word i cant give you a better idea of the shattering effect of corkys uncle alexander when in action than by saying that he had absolutely made me forget for the moment that jeeves was there  i wonder if i have ever happened to mention to you sir a mr digby thistleton with whom i was once in service perhaps you have met him he was a financier he is now lord bridgnorth it was a favourite saying of his that there is always a way the first time i heard him use the expression was after the failure of a patent depilatory which he promoted  jeeves i said what on earth are you talking about  i mentioned mr thistleton sir because his was in some respects a parallel case to the present one his depilatory failed but he did not despair he put it on the market again under the name of hairo guaranteed to produce a full crop of hair in a few months it was advertised if you remember sir by a humorous picture of a billiardball before and after taking and made such a substantial fortune that mr thistleton was soon afterwards elevated to the peerage for services to his party it seems to me that if mr corcoran looks into the matter he will find like mr thistleton that there is always a way mr worple himself suggested the solution of the difficulty in the heat of the moment he compared the portrait to an extract from a coloured comic supplement i consider the suggestion a very valuable one sir mr corcorans portrait may not have pleased mr worple as a likeness of his only child but i have no doubt that editors would gladly consider it as a foundation for a series of humorous drawings if mr corcoran will allow me to make the suggestion his talent has always been for the humorous there is something about this picturesomething bold and vigorous which arrests the attention i feel sure it would be highly popular  corky was glaring at the picture and making a sort of dry sucking noise with his mouth he seemed completely overwrought  and then suddenly he began to laugh in a wild way  corky old man i said massaging him tenderly i feared the poor blighter was hysterical  he began to stagger about all over the floor  hes right the mans absolutely right jeeves youre a lifesaver youve hit on the greatest idea of the age report at the office on monday start at the bottom of the business ill buy the business if i feel like it i know the man who runs the comic section of the sunday star hell eat this thing he was telling me only the other day how hard it was to get a good new series hell give me anything i ask for a real winner like this ive got a goldmine wheres my hat ive got an income for life wheres that confounded hat lend me a fiver bertie i want to take a taxi down to park row  jeeves smiled paternally or rather he had a kind of paternal muscular spasm about the mouth which is the nearest he ever gets to smiling  if i might make the suggestion mr corcoranfor a title of the series which you have in mindthe adventures of baby blobbs  corky and i looked at the picture then at each other in an awed way jeeves was right there could be no other title  jeeves i said it was a few weeks later and i had just finished looking at the comic section of the sunday star im an optimist i always have been the older i get the more i agree with shakespeare and those poet johnnies about it always being darkest before the dawn and theres a silver lining and what you lose on the swings you make up on the roundabouts look at mr corcoran for instance there was a fellow one would have said clear up to the eyebrows in the soup to all appearances he had got it right in the neck yet look at him now have you seen these pictures  i took the liberty of glancing at them before bringing them to you sir extremely diverting  they have made a big hit you know  i anticipated it sir  i leaned back against the pillows  you know jeeves youre a genius you ought to be drawing a commission on these things  i have nothing to complain of in that respect sir mr corcoran has been most generous i am putting out the brown suit sir  no i think ill wear the blue with the faint red stripe  not the blue with the faint red stripe sir  but i rather fancy myself in it  not the blue with the faint red stripe sir  oh all right have it your own way  very good sir thank you sir  of course i know its as bad as being henpecked but then jeeves is always right youve got to consider that you know what     jeeves and the unbidden guest   im not absolutely certain of my facts but i rather fancy its shakespeareor if not its some equally brainy ladwho says that its always just when a chappie is feeling particularly tophole and more than usually braced with things in general that fate sneaks up behind him with a bit of lead piping theres no doubt the mans right its absolutely that way with me take for instance the fairly rummy matter of lady malvern and her son wilmot a moment before they turned up i was just thinking how thoroughly all right everything was  it was one of those topping mornings and i had just climbed out from under the cold shower feeling like a twoyearold as a matter of fact i was especially bucked just then because the day before i had asserted myself with jeevesabsolutely asserted myself dont you know you see the way things had been going on i was rapidly becoming a dashed serf the man had jolly well oppressed me i didnt so much mind when he made me give up one of my new suits because jeevess judgment about suits is sound but i as near as a toucher rebelled when he wouldnt let me wear a pair of clothtopped boots which i loved like a couple of brothers and when he tried to tread on me like a worm in the matter of a hat i jolly well put my foot down and showed him who was who its a long story and i havent time to tell you now but the point is that he wanted me to wear the longacreas worn by john drewwhen i had set my heart on the country gentlemanas worn by another famous actor chappieand the end of the matter was that after a rather painful scene i bought the country gentleman so thats how things stood on this particular morning and i was feeling kind of manly and independent  well i was in the bathroom wondering what there was going to be for breakfast while i massaged the good old spine with a rough towel and sang slightly when there was a tap at the door i stopped singing and opened the door an inch  what ho without there  lady malvern wishes to see you sir said jeeves  eh  lady malvern sir she is waiting in the sittingroom  pull yourself together jeeves my man i said rather severely for i bar practical jokes before breakfast you know perfectly well theres no one waiting for me in the sittingroom how could there be when its barely ten oclock yet  i gathered from her ladyship sir that she had landed from an ocean liner at an early hour this morning  this made the thing a bit more plausible i remembered that when i had arrived in america about a year before the proceedings had begun at some ghastly hour like six and that i had been shot out on to a foreign shore considerably before eight  who the deuce is lady malvern jeeves  her ladyship did not confide in me sir  is she alone  her ladyship is accompanied by a lord pershore sir i fancy that his lordship would be her ladyships son  oh well put out rich raiment of sorts and ill be dressing  our heathermixture lounge is in readiness sir  then lead me to it  while i was dressing i kept trying to think who on earth lady malvern could be it wasnt till i had climbed through the top of my shirt and was reaching out for the studs that i remembered  ive placed her jeeves shes a pal of my aunt agatha  indeed sir  yes i met her at lunch one sunday before i left london a very vicious specimen writes books she wrote a book on social conditions in india when she came back from the durbar  yes sir pardon me sir but not that tie  eh  not that tie with the heathermixture lounge sir  it was a shock to me i thought i had quelled the fellow it was rather a solemn moment what i mean is if i weakened now all my good work the night before would be thrown away i braced myself  whats wrong with this tie ive seen you give it a nasty look before speak out like a man whats the matter with it  too ornate sir  nonsense a cheerful pink nothing more  unsuitable sir  jeeves this is the tie i wear  very good sir  dashed unpleasant i could see that the man was wounded but i was firm i tied the tie got into the coat and waistcoat and went into the sittingroom  halloa halloa halloa i said what  ah how do you do mr wooster you have never met my son wilmot i think motty darling this is mr wooster  lady malvern was a hearty happy healthy overpowering sort of dashed female not so very tall but making up for it by measuring about six feet from the op to the prompt side she fitted into my biggest armchair as if it had been built round her by someone who knew they were wearing armchairs tight about the hips that season she had bright bulging eyes and a lot of yellow hair and when she spoke she showed about fiftyseven front teeth she was one of those women who kind of numb a fellows faculties she made me feel as if i were ten years old and had been brought into the drawingroom in my sunday clothes to say howdyoudo altogether by no means the sort of thing a chappie would wish to find in his sittingroom before breakfast  motty the son was about twentythree tall and thin and meeklooking he had the same yellow hair as his mother but he wore it plastered down and parted in the middle his eyes bulged too but they werent bright they were a dull grey with pink rims his chin gave up the struggle about halfway down and he didnt appear to have any eyelashes a mild furtive sheepish sort of blighter in short  awfully glad to see you i said so youve popped over eh making a long stay in america  about a month your aunt gave me your address and told me to be sure and call on you  i was glad to hear this as it showed that aunt agatha was beginning to come round a bit there had been some unpleasantness a year before when she had sent me over to new york to disentangle my cousin gussie from the clutches of a girl on the musichall stage when i tell you that by the time i had finished my operations gussie had not only married the girl but had gone on the stage himself and was doing well youll understand that aunt agatha was upset to no small extent i simply hadnt dared go back and face her and it was a relief to find that time had healed the wound and all that sort of thing enough to make her tell her pals to look me up what i mean is much as i liked america i didnt want to have england barred to me for the rest of my natural and believe me england is a jolly sight too small for anyone to live in with aunt agatha if shes really on the warpath so i braced on hearing these kind words and smiled genially on the assemblage  your aunt said that you would do anything that was in your power to be of assistance to us  rather oh rather absolutely  thank you so much i want you to put dear motty up for a little while  i didnt get this for a moment  put him up for my clubs  no no darling motty is essentially a home bird arent you motty darling  motty who was sucking the knob of his stick uncorked himself  yes mother he said and corked himself up again  i should not like him to belong to clubs i mean put him up here have him to live with you while i am away  these frightful words trickled out of her like honey the woman simply didnt seem to understand the ghastly nature of her proposal i gave motty the swift easttowest he was sitting with his mouth nuzzling the stick blinking at the wall the thought of having this planted on me for an indefinite period appalled me absolutely appalled me dont you know i was just starting to say that the shot wasnt on the board at any price and that the first sign motty gave of trying to nestle into my little home i would yell for the police when she went on rolling placidly over me as it were  there was something about this woman that sapped a chappies willpower  i am leaving new york by the midday train as i have to pay a visit to singsing prison i am extremely interested in prison conditions in america after that i work my way gradually across to the coast visiting the points of interest on the journey you see mr wooster i am in america principally on business no doubt you read my book india and the indians my publishers are anxious for me to write a companion volume on the united states i shall not be able to spend more than a month in the country as i have to get back for the season but a month should be ample i was less than a month in india and my dear friend sir roger cremorne wrote his america from within after a stay of only two weeks i should love to take dear motty with me but the poor boy gets so sick when he travels by train i shall have to pick him up on my return  from where i sat i could see jeeves in the diningroom laying the breakfasttable i wished i could have had a minute with him alone i felt certain that he would have been able to think of some way of putting a stop to this woman  it will be such a relief to know that motty is safe with you mr wooster i know what the temptations of a great city are hitherto dear motty has been sheltered from them he has lived quietly with me in the country i know that you will look after him carefully mr wooster he will give very little trouble she talked about the poor blighter as if he wasnt there not that motty seemed to mind he had stopped chewing his walkingstick and was sitting there with his mouth open he is a vegetarian and a teetotaller and is devoted to reading give him a nice book and he will be quite contented she got up thank you so much mr wooster i dont know what i should have done without your help come motty we have just time to see a few of the sights before my train goes but i shall have to rely on you for most of my information about new york darling be sure to keep your eyes open and take notes of your impressions it will be such a help goodbye mr wooster i will send motty back early in the afternoon  they went out and i howled for jeeves  jeeves what about it  sir  whats to be done you heard it all didnt you you were in the diningroom most of the time that pill is coming to stay here  pill sir  the excrescence  i beg your pardon sir  i looked at jeeves sharply this sort of thing wasnt like him it was as if he were deliberately trying to give me the pip then i understood the man was really upset about that tie he was trying to get his own back  lord pershore will be staying here from tonight jeeves i said coldly  very good sir breakfast is ready sir  i could have sobbed into the bacon and eggs that there wasnt any sympathy to be got out of jeeves was what put the lid on it for a moment i almost weakened and told him to destroy the hat and tie if he didnt like them but i pulled myself together again i was dashed if i was going to let jeeves treat me like a bally oneman chaingang  but what with brooding on jeeves and brooding on motty i was in a pretty reduced sort of state the more i examined the situation the more blighted it became there was nothing i could do if i slung motty out he would report to his mother and she would pass it on to aunt agatha and i didnt like to think what would happen then sooner or later i should be wanting to go back to england and i didnt want to get there and find aunt agatha waiting on the quay for me with a stuffed eelskin there was absolutely nothing for it but to put the fellow up and make the best of it  about midday mottys luggage arrived and soon afterward a large parcel of what i took to be nice books i brightened up a little when i saw it it was one of those massive parcels and looked as if it had enough in it to keep the chappie busy for a year i felt a trifle more cheerful and i got my country gentleman hat and stuck it on my head and gave the pink tie a twist and reeled out to take a bite of lunch with one or two of the lads at a neighbouring hostelry and what with excellent browsing and sluicing and cheery conversation and whatnot the afternoon passed quite happily by dinnertime i had almost forgotten blighted mottys existence  i dined at the club and looked in at a show afterward and it wasnt till fairly late that i got back to the flat there were no signs of motty and i took it that he had gone to bed  it seemed rummy to me though that the parcel of nice books was still there with the string and paper on it it looked as if motty after seeing mother off at the station had decided to call it a day  jeeves came in with the nightly whiskyandsoda i could tell by the chappies manner that he was still upset  lord pershore gone to bed jeeves i asked with reserved hauteur and whatnot  no sir his lordship has not yet returned  not returned what do you mean  his lordship came in shortly after sixthirty and having dressed went out again  at this moment there was a noise outside the front door a sort of scrabbling noise as if somebody were trying to paw his way through the woodwork then a sort of thud  better go and see what that is jeeves  very good sir  he went out and came back again  if you would not mind stepping this way sir i think we might be able to carry him in  carry him in  his lordship is lying on the mat sir  i went to the front door the man was right there was motty huddled up outside on the floor he was moaning a bit  hes had some sort of dashed fit i said i took another look jeeves someones been feeding him meat  sir  hes a vegetarian you know he must have been digging into a steak or something call up a doctor  i hardly think it will be necessary sir if you would take his lordships legs while i  great scot jeeves you dont thinkhe cant be  i am inclined to think so sir  and by jove he was right once on the right track you couldnt mistake it motty was under the surface  it was the deuce of a shock  you never can tell jeeves  very seldom sir  remove the eye of authority and where are you  precisely sir  where is my wandering boy tonight and all that sort of thing what  it would seem so sir  well we had better bring him in eh  yes sir  so we lugged him in and jeeves put him to bed and i lit a cigarette and sat down to think the thing over i had a kind of foreboding it seemed to me that i had let myself in for something pretty rocky  next morning after i had sucked down a thoughtful cup of tea i went into mottys room to investigate i expected to find the fellow a wreck but there he was sitting up in bed quite chirpy reading gingery stories  what ho i said  what ho said motty  what ho what ho  what ho what ho what ho  after that it seemed rather difficult to go on with the conversation  how are you feeling this morning i asked  topping replied motty blithely and with abandon i say you know that fellow of yoursjeeves you knowis a corker i had a most frightful headache when i woke up and he brought me a sort of rummy dark drink and it put me right again at once said it was his own invention i must see more of that lad he seems to me distinctly one of the ones  i couldnt believe that this was the same blighter who had sat and sucked his stick the day before  you ate something that disagreed with you last night didnt you i said by way of giving him a chance to slide out of it if he wanted to but he wouldnt have it at any price  no he replied firmly i didnt do anything of the kind i drank too much much too much lots and lots too much and whats more im going to do it again im going to do it every night if ever you see me sober old top he said with a kind of holy exaltation tap me on the shoulder and say tut tut and ill apologize and remedy the defect  but i say you know what about me  what about you  well im so to speak as it were kind of responsible for you what i mean to say is if you go doing this sort of thing im apt to get in the soup somewhat  i cant help your troubles said motty firmly listen to me old thing this is the first time in my life that ive had a real chance to yield to the temptations of a great city whats the use of a great city having temptations if fellows dont yield to them makes it so bally discouraging for a great city besides mother told me to keep my eyes open and collect impressions  i sat on the edge of the bed i felt dizzy  i know just how you feel old dear said motty consolingly and if my principles would permit it i would simmer down for your sake but duty first this is the first time ive been let out alone and i mean to make the most of it were only young once why interfere with lifes morning young man rejoice in thy youth trala what ho  put like that it did seem reasonable  all my bally life dear boy motty went on ive been cooped up in the ancestral home at much middlefold in shropshire and till youve been cooped up in much middlefold you dont know what cooping is the only time we get any excitement is when one of the choirboys is caught sucking chocolate during the sermon when that happens we talk about it for days ive got about a month of new york and i mean to store up a few happy memories for the long winter evenings this is my only chance to collect a past and im going to do it now tell me old sport as man to man how does one get in touch with that very decent chappie jeeves does one ring a bell or shout a bit i should like to discuss the subject of a good stiff bands with him                                       i had had a sort of vague idea dont you know that if i stuck close to motty and went about the place with him i might act as a bit of a damper on the gaiety what i mean is i thought that if when he was being the life and soul of the party he were to catch my reproving eye he might ease up a trifle on the revelry so the next night i took him along to supper with me it was the last time im a quiet peaceful sort of chappie who has lived all his life in london and i cant stand the pace these swift sportsmen from the rural districts set what i mean to say is this im all for rational enjoyment and so forth but i think a chappie makes himself conspicuous when he throws softboiled eggs at the electric fan and decent mirth and all that sort of thing are all right but i do bar dancing on tables and having to dash all over the place dodging waiters managers and chuckersout just when you want to sit still and digest  directly i managed to tear myself away that night and get home i made up my mind that this was jolly well the last time that i went about with motty the only time i met him late at night after that was once when i passed the door of a fairly lowdown sort of restaurant and had to step aside to dodge him as he sailed through the air en route for the opposite pavement with a muscular sort of looking chappie peering out after him with a kind of gloomy satisfaction  in a way i couldnt help sympathizing with the fellow he had about four weeks to have the good time that ought to have been spread over about ten years and i didnt wonder at his wanting to be pretty busy i should have been just the same in his place still there was no denying that it was a bit thick if it hadnt been for the thought of lady malvern and aunt agatha in the background i should have regarded mottys rapid work with an indulgent smile but i couldnt get rid of the feeling that sooner or later i was the lad who was scheduled to get it behind the ear and what with brooding on this prospect and sitting up in the old flat waiting for the familiar footstep and putting it to bed when it got there and stealing into the sickchamber next morning to contemplate the wreckage i was beginning to lose weight absolutely becoming the good old shadow i give you my honest word starting at sudden noises and whatnot  and no sympathy from jeeves that was what cut me to the quick the man was still thoroughly pipped about the hat and tie and simply wouldnt rally round one morning i wanted comforting so much that i sank the pride of the woosters and appealed to the fellow direct  jeeves i said this is getting a bit thick  sir business and cold respectfulness  you know what i mean this lad seems to have chucked all the principles of a wellspent boyhood he has got it up his nose  yes sir  well i shall get blamed dont you know you know what my aunt agatha is  yes sir  very well then  i waited a moment but he wouldnt unbend  jeeves i said havent you any scheme up your sleeve for coping with this blighter  no sir  and he shimmered off to his lair obstinate devil so dashed absurd dont you know it wasnt as if there was anything wrong with that country gentleman hat it was a remarkably priceless effort and much admired by the lads but just because he preferred the longacre he left me flat  it was shortly after this that young motty got the idea of bringing pals back in the small hours to continue the gay revels in the home this was where i began to crack under the strain you see the part of town where i was living wasnt the right place for that sort of thing i knew lots of chappies down washington square way who started the evening at about 2 amartists and writers and whatnot who frolicked considerably till checked by the arrival of the morning milk that was all right they like that sort of thing down there the neighbours cant get to sleep unless theres someone dancing hawaiian dances over their heads but on fiftyseventh street the atmosphere wasnt right and when motty turned up at three in the morning with a collection of hearty lads who only stopped singing their college song when they started singing the old oaken bucket there was a marked peevishness among the old settlers in the flats the management was extremely terse over the telephone at breakfasttime and took a lot of soothing  the next night i came home early after a lonely dinner at a place which id chosen because there didnt seem any chance of meeting motty there the sittingroom was quite dark and i was just moving to switch on the light when there was a sort of explosion and something collared hold of my trouserleg living with motty had reduced me to such an extent that i was simply unable to cope with this thing i jumped backward with a loud yell of anguish and tumbled out into the hall just as jeeves came out of his den to see what the matter was  did you call sir  jeeves theres something in there that grabs you by the leg  that would be rollo sir  eh  i would have warned you of his presence but i did not hear you come in his temper is a little uncertain at present as he has not yet settled down  who the deuce is rollo  his lordships bullterrier sir his lordship won him in a raffle and tied him to the leg of the table if you will allow me sir i will go in and switch on the light  there really is nobody like jeeves he walked straight into the sittingroom the biggest feat since daniel and the lions den without a quiver whats more his magnetism or whatever they call it was such that the dashed animal instead of pinning him by the leg calmed down as if he had had a bromide and rolled over on his back with all his paws in the air if jeeves had been his rich uncle he couldnt have been more chummy yet directly he caught sight of me again he got all worked up and seemed to have only one idea in lifeto start chewing me where he had left off  rollo is not used to you yet sir said jeeves regarding the bally quadruped in an admiring sort of way he is an excellent watchdog  i dont want a watchdog to keep me out of my rooms  no sir  well what am i to do  no doubt in time the animal will learn to discriminate sir he will learn to distinguish your peculiar scent  what do you meanmy peculiar scent correct the impression that i intend to hang about in the hall while life slips by in the hope that one of these days that dashed animal will decide that i smell all right i thought for a bit jeeves  sir  im going awaytomorrow morning by the first train i shall go and stop with mr todd in the country  do you wish me to accompany you sir  no  very good sir  i dont know when i shall be back forward my letters  yes sir                                       as a matter of fact i was back within the week rocky todd the pal i went to stay with is a rummy sort of a chap who lives all alone in the wilds of long island and likes it but a little of that sort of thing goes a long way with me dear old rocky is one of the best but after a few days in his cottage in the woods miles away from anywhere new york even with motty on the premises began to look pretty good to me the days down on long island have fortyeight hours in them you cant get to sleep at night because of the bellowing of the crickets and you have to walk two miles for a drink and six for an evening paper i thanked rocky for his kind hospitality and caught the only train they have down in those parts it landed me in new york about dinnertime i went straight to the old flat jeeves came out of his lair i looked round cautiously for rollo  wheres that dog jeeves have you got him tied up  the animal is no longer here sir his lordship gave him to the porter who sold him his lordship took a prejudice against the animal on account of being bitten by him in the calf of the leg  i dont think ive ever been so bucked by a bit of news i felt i had misjudged rollo evidently when you got to know him better he had a lot of intelligence in him  ripping i said is lord pershore in jeeves  no sir  do you expect him back to dinner  no sir  where is he  in prison sir  have you ever trodden on a rake and had the handle jump up and hit you thats how i felt then  in prison  yes sir  you dont meanin prison  yes sir  i lowered myself into a chair  why i said  he assaulted a constable sir  lord pershore assaulted a constable  yes sir  i digested this  but jeeves i say this is frightful  sir  what will lady malvern say when she finds out  i do not fancy that her ladyship will find out sir  but shell come back and want to know where he is  i rather fancy sir that his lordships bit of time will have run out by then  but supposing it hasnt  in that event sir it may be judicious to prevaricate a little  how  if i might make the suggestion sir i should inform her ladyship that his lordship has left for a short visit to boston  why boston  very interesting and respectable centre sir  jeeves i believe youve hit it  i fancy so sir  why this is really the best thing that could have happened if this hadnt turned up to prevent him young motty would have been in a sanatorium by the time lady malvern got back  exactly sir  the more i looked at it in that way the sounder this prison wheeze seemed to me there was no doubt in the world that prison was just what the doctor ordered for motty it was the only thing that could have pulled him up i was sorry for the poor blighter but after all i reflected a chappie who had lived all his life with lady malvern in a small village in the interior of shropshire wouldnt have much to kick at in a prison altogether i began to feel absolutely braced again life became like what the poet johnnie saysone grand sweet song things went on so comfortably and peacefully for a couple of weeks that i give you my word that id almost forgotten such a person as motty existed the only flaw in the scheme of things was that jeeves was still pained and distant it wasnt anything he said or did mind you but there was a rummy something about him all the time once when i was tying the pink tie i caught sight of him in the lookingglass there was a kind of grieved look in his eye  and then lady malvern came back a good bit ahead of schedule i hadnt been expecting her for days id forgotten how time had been slipping along she turned up one morning while i was still in bed sipping tea and thinking of this and that jeeves flowed in with the announcement that he had just loosed her into the sittingroom i draped a few garments round me and went in  there she was sitting in the same armchair looking as massive as ever the only difference was that she didnt uncover the teeth as she had done the first time  good morning i said so youve got back what  i have got back  there was something sort of bleak about her tone rather as if she had swallowed an east wind this i took to be due to the fact that she probably hadnt breakfasted its only after a bit of breakfast that im able to regard the world with that sunny cheeriness which makes a fellow the universal favourite im never much of a lad till ive engulfed an egg or two and a beaker of coffee  i suppose you havent breakfasted  i have not yet breakfasted  wont you have an egg or something or a sausage or something or something  no thank you  she spoke as if she belonged to an antisausage society or a league for the suppression of eggs there was a bit of a silence  i called on you last night she said but you were out  awfully sorry had a pleasant trip  extremely thank you  see everything niagra falls yellowstone park and the jolly old grand canyon and whatnot  i saw a great deal  there was another slightly frapp√© silence jeeves floated silently into the diningroom and began to lay the breakfasttable  i hope wilmot was not in your way mr wooster  i had been wondering when she was going to mention motty  rather not great pals hit it off splendidly  you were his constant companion then  absolutely we were always together saw all the sights dont you know wed take in the museum of art in the morning and have a bit of lunch at some good vegetarian place and then toddle along to a sacred concert in the afternoon and home to an early dinner we usually played dominoes after dinner and then the early bed and the refreshing sleep we had a great time i was awfully sorry when he went away to boston  oh wilmot is in boston  yes i ought to have let you know but of course we didnt know where you were you were dodging all over the place like a snipei mean dont you know dodging all over the place and we couldnt get at you yes motty went off to boston  youre sure he went to boston  oh absolutely i called out to jeeves who was now messing about in the next room with forks and so forth jeeves lord pershore didnt change his mind about going to boston did he  no sir  i thought i was right yes motty went to boston  then how do you account mr wooster for the fact that when i went yesterday afternoon to blackwells island prison to secure material for my book i saw poor dear wilmot there dressed in a striped suit seated beside a pile of stones with a hammer in his hands  i tried to think of something to say but nothing came a chappie has to be a lot broader about the forehead than i am to handle a jolt like this i strained the old bean till it creaked but between the collar and the hair parting nothing stirred i was dumb which was lucky because i wouldnt have had a chance to get any persiflage out of my system lady malvern collared the conversation she had been bottling it up and now it came out with a rush  so this is how you have looked after my poor dear boy mr wooster so this is how you have abused my trust i left him in your charge thinking that i could rely on you to shield him from evil he came to you innocent unversed in the ways of the world confiding unused to the temptations of a large city and you led him astray  i hadnt any remarks to make all i could think of was the picture of aunt agatha drinking all this in and reaching out to sharpen the hatchet against my return  you deliberately  far away in the misty distance a soft voice spoke  if i might explain your ladyship  jeeves had projected himself in from the diningroom and materialized on the rug lady malvern tried to freeze him with a look but you cant do that sort of thing to jeeves he is lookproof  i fancy your ladyship that you have misunderstood mr wooster and that he may have given you the impression that he was in new york when his lordshipwas removed when mr wooster informed your ladyship that his lordship had gone to boston he was relying on the version i had given him of his lordships movements mr wooster was away visiting a friend in the country at the time and knew nothing of the matter till your ladyship informed him  lady malvern gave a kind of grunt it didnt rattle jeeves  i feared mr wooster might be disturbed if he knew the truth as he is so attached to his lordship and has taken such pains to look after him so i took the liberty of telling him that his lordship had gone away for a visit it might have been hard for mr wooster to believe that his lordship had gone to prison voluntarily and from the best motives but your ladyship knowing him better will readily understand  what lady malvern goggled at him did you say that lord pershore went to prison voluntarily  if i might explain your ladyship i think that your ladyships parting words made a deep impression on his lordship i have frequently heard him speak to mr wooster of his desire to do something to follow your ladyships instructions and collect material for your ladyships book on america mr wooster will bear me out when i say that his lordship was frequently extremely depressed at the thought that he was doing so little to help  absolutely by jove quite pipped about it i said  the idea of making a personal examination into the prison system of the countryfrom withinoccurred to his lordship very suddenly one night he embraced it eagerly there was no restraining him  lady malvern looked at jeeves then at me then at jeeves again i could see her struggling with the thing  surely your ladyship said jeeves it is more reasonable to suppose that a gentleman of his lordships character went to prison of his own volition than that he committed some breach of the law which necessitated his arrest  lady malvern blinked then she got up  mr wooster she said i apologize i have done you an injustice i should have known wilmot better i should have had more faith in his pure fine spirit  absolutely i said  your breakfast is ready sir said jeeves  i sat down and dallied in a dazed sort of way with a poached egg  jeeves i said you are certainly a lifesaver  thank you sir  nothing would have convinced my aunt agatha that i hadnt lured that blighter into riotous living  i fancy you are right sir  i champed my egg for a bit i was most awfully moved dont you know by the way jeeves had rallied round something seemed to tell me that this was an occasion that called for rich rewards for a moment i hesitated then i made up my mind  jeeves  sir  that pink tie  yes sir  burn it  thank you sir  and jeeves  yes sir  take a taxi and get me that longacre hat as worn by john drew  thank you very much sir  i felt most awfully braced i felt as if the clouds had rolled away and all was as it used to be i felt like one of those chappies in the novels who calls off the fight with his wife in the last chapter and decides to forget and forgive i felt i wanted to do all sorts of other things to show jeeves that i appreciated him  jeeves i said it isnt enough is there anything else you would like  yes sir if i may make the suggestionfifty dollars  fifty dollars  it will enable me to pay a debt of honour sir i owe it to his lordship  you owe lord pershore fifty dollars  yes sir i happened to meet him in the street the night his lordship was arrested i had been thinking a good deal about the most suitable method of inducing him to abandon his mode of living sir his lordship was a little overexcited at the time and i fancy that he mistook me for a friend of his at any rate when i took the liberty of wagering him fifty dollars that he would not punch a passing policeman in the eye he accepted the bet very cordially and won it  i produced my pocketbook and counted out a hundred  take this jeeves i said fifty isnt enough do you know jeeves yourewell you absolutely stand alone  i endeavour to give satisfaction sir said jeeves     jeeves and the hardboiled egg   sometimes of a morning as ive sat in bed sucking down the early cup of tea and watched my man jeeves flitting about the room and putting out the raiment for the day ive wondered what the deuce i should do if the fellow ever took it into his head to leave me its not so bad now im in new york but in london the anxiety was frightful there used to be all sorts of attempts on the part of low blighters to sneak him away from me young reggie foljambe to my certain knowledge offered him double what i was giving him and alistair binghamreeves whos got a valet who had been known to press his trousers sideways used to look at him when he came to see me with a kind of glittering hungry eye which disturbed me deucedly bally pirates  the thing you see is that jeeves is so dashed competent you can spot it even in the way he shoves studs into a shirt  i rely on him absolutely in every crisis and he never lets me down and whats more he can always be counted on to extend himself on behalf of any pal of mine who happens to be to all appearances kneedeep in the bouillon take the rather rummy case for instance of dear old bicky and his uncle the hardboiled egg  it happened after i had been in america for a few months i got back to the flat latish one night and when jeeves brought me the final drink he said  mr bickersteth called to see you this evening sir while you were out  oh i said  twice sir he appeared a trifle agitated  what pipped  he gave that impression sir  i sipped the whisky i was sorry if bicky was in trouble but as a matter of fact i was rather glad to have something i could discuss freely with jeeves just then because things had been a bit strained between us for some time and it had been rather difficult to hit on anything to talk about that wasnt apt to take a personal turn you see i had decidedrightly or wronglyto grow a moustache and this had cut jeeves to the quick he couldnt stick the thing at any price and i had been living ever since in an atmosphere of bally disapproval till i was getting jolly well fed up with it what i mean is while theres no doubt that in certain matters of dress jeevess judgment is absolutely sound and should be followed it seemed to me that it was getting a bit too thick if he was going to edit my face as well as my costume no one can call me an unreasonable chappie and manys the time ive given in like a lamb when jeeves has voted against one of my pet suits or ties but when it comes to a valets staking out a claim on your upper lip youve simply got to have a bit of the good old bulldog pluck and defy the blighter  he said that he would call again later sir  something must be up jeeves  yes sir  i gave the moustache a thoughtful twirl it seemed to hurt jeeves a good deal so i chucked it  i see by the paper sir that mr bickersteths uncle is arriving on the carmantic  yes  his grace the duke of chiswick sir  this was news to me that bickys uncle was a duke rum how little one knows about ones pals i had met bicky for the first time at a species of beano or jamboree down in washington square not long after my arrival in new york i suppose i was a bit homesick at the time and i rather took to bicky when i found that he was an englishman and had in fact been up at oxford with me besides he was a frightful chump so we naturally drifted together and while we were taking a quiet snort in a corner that wasnt all cluttered up with artists and sculptors and whatnot he furthermore endeared himself to me by a most extraordinarily gifted imitation of a bullterrier chasing a cat up a tree but though we had subsequently become extremely pally all i really knew about him was that he was generally hard up and had an uncle who relieved the strain a bit from time to time by sending him monthly remittances  if the duke of chiswick is his uncle i said why hasnt he a title why isnt he lord whatnot  mr bickersteth is the son of his graces late sister sir who married captain rollo bickersteth of the coldstream guards  jeeves knows everything  is mr bickersteths father dead too  yes sir  leave any money  no sir  i began to understand why poor old bicky was always more or less on the rocks to the casual and irreflective observer if you know what i mean it may sound a pretty good wheeze having a duke for an uncle but the trouble about old chiswick was that though an extremely wealthy old buster owning half london and about five counties up north he was notoriously the most prudent spender in england he was what american chappies would call a hardboiled egg if bickys people hadnt left him anything and he depended on what he could prise out of the old duke he was in a pretty bad way not that that explained why he was hunting me like this because he was a chap who never borrowed money he said he wanted to keep his pals so never bit any ones ear on principle  at this juncture the door bell rang jeeves floated out to answer it  yes sir mr wooster has just returned i heard him say and bicky came trickling in looking pretty sorry for himself  halloa bicky i said jeeves told me you had been trying to get me jeeves bring another glass and let the revels commence whats the trouble bicky  im in a hole bertie i want your advice  say on old lad  my uncles turning up tomorrow bertie  so jeeves told me  the duke of chiswick you know  so jeeves told me  bicky seemed a bit surprised  jeeves seems to know everything  rather rummily thats exactly what i was thinking just now myself  well i wish said bicky gloomily that he knew a way to get me out of the hole im in  jeeves shimmered in with the glass and stuck it competently on the table  mr bickersteth is in a bit of a hole jeeves i said and wants you to rally round  very good sir  bicky looked a bit doubtful  well of course you know bertie this thing is by way of being a bit private and all that  i shouldnt worry about that old top i bet jeeves knows all about it already dont you jeeves  yes sir  eh said bicky rattled  i am open to correction sir but is not your dilemma due to the fact that you are at a loss to explain to his grace why you are in new york instead of in colorado  bicky rocked like a jelly in a high wind  how the deuce do you know anything about it  i chanced to meet his graces butler before we left england he informed me that he happened to overhear his grace speaking to you on the matter sir as he passed the library door  bicky gave a hollow sort of laugh  well as everybody seems to know all about it theres no need to try to keep it dark the old boy turfed me out bertie because he said i was a brainless nincompoop the idea was that he would give me a remittance on condition that i dashed out to some blighted locality of the name of colorado and learned farming or ranching or whatever they call it at some bally ranch or farm or whatever its called i didnt fancy the idea a bit i should have had to ride horses and pursue cows and so forth i hate horses they bite at you i was all against the scheme at the same time dont you know i had to have that remittance  i get you absolutely dear boy  well when i got to new york it looked a decent sort of place to me so i thought it would be a pretty sound notion to stop here so i cabled to my uncle telling him that i had dropped into a good business wheeze in the city and wanted to chuck the ranch idea he wrote back that it was all right and here ive been ever since he thinks im doing well at something or other over here i never dreamed dont you know that he would ever come out here what on earth am i to do  jeeves i said what on earth is mr bickersteth to do  you see said bicky i had a wireless from him to say that he was coming to stay with meto save hotel bills i suppose ive always given him the impression that i was living in pretty good style i cant have him to stay at my boardinghouse  thought of anything jeeves i said  to what extent sir if the question is not a delicate one are you prepared to assist mr bickersteth  ill do anything i can for you of course bicky old man  then if i might make the suggestion sir you might lend mr bickersteth  no by jove said bicky firmly i never have touched you bertie and im not going to start now i may be a chump but its my boast that i dont owe a penny to a single soulnot counting tradesmen of course  i was about to suggest sir that you might lend mr bickersteth this flat mr bickersteth could give his grace the impression that he was the owner of it with your permission i could convey the notion that i was in mr bickersteths employment and not in yours you would be residing here temporarily as mr bickersteths guest his grace would occupy the second spare bedroom i fancy that you would find this answer satisfactorily sir  bicky had stopped rocking himself and was staring at jeeves in an awed sort of way  i would advocate the dispatching of a wireless message to his grace on board the vessel notifying him of the change of address mr bickersteth could meet his grace at the dock and proceed directly here will that meet the situation sir  absolutely  thank you sir  bicky followed him with his eye till the door closed  how does he do it bertie he said ill tell you what i think it is i believe its something to do with the shape of his head have you ever noticed his head bertie old man it sort of sticks out at the back                                       i hopped out of bed early next morning so as to be among those present when the old boy should arrive i knew from experience that these ocean liners fetch up at the dock at a deucedly ungodly hour it wasnt much after nine by the time id dressed and had my morning tea and was leaning out of the window watching the street for bicky and his uncle it was one of those jolly peaceful mornings that make a chappie wish hed got a soul or something and i was just brooding on life in general when i became aware of the dickens of a spate in progress down below a taxi had driven up and an old boy in a top hat had got out and was kicking up a frightful row about the fare as far as i could make out he was trying to get the cab chappie to switch from new york to london prices and the cab chappie had apparently never heard of london before and didnt seem to think a lot of it now the old boy said that in london the trip would have set him back eightpence and the cabby said he should worry i called to jeeves  the duke has arrived jeeves  yes sir  thatll be him at the door now  jeeves made a long arm and opened the front door and the old boy crawled in looking licked to a splinter  how do you do sir i said bustling up and being the ray of sunshine your nephew went down to the dock to meet you but you must have missed him my names wooster dont you know great pal of bickys and all that sort of thing im staying with him you know would you like a cup of tea jeeves bring a cup of tea  old chiswick had sunk into an armchair and was looking about the room  does this luxurious flat belong to my nephew francis  absolutely  it must be terribly expensive  pretty well of course everything costs a lot over here you know  he moaned jeeves filtered in with the tea old chiswick took a stab at it to restore his tissues and nodded  a terrible country mr wooster a terrible country nearly eight shillings for a short cabdrive iniquitous he took another look round the room it seemed to fascinate him have you any idea how much my nephew pays for this flat mr wooster  about two hundred dollars a month i believe  what forty pounds a month  i began to see that unless i made the thing a bit more plausible the scheme might turn out a frost i could guess what the old boy was thinking he was trying to square all this prosperity with what he knew of poor old bicky and one had to admit that it took a lot of squaring for dear old bicky though a stout fellow and absolutely unrivalled as an imitator of bullterriers and cats was in many ways one of the most pronounced fatheads that ever pulled on a suit of gents underwear  i suppose it seems rummy to you i said but the fact is new york often bucks chappies up and makes them show a flash of speed that you wouldnt have imagined them capable of it sort of develops them something in the air dont you know i imagine that bicky in the past when you knew him may have been something of a chump but its quite different now devilish efficient sort of chappie and looked on in commercial circles as quite the nib  i am amazed what is the nature of my nephews business mr wooster  oh just business dont you know the same sort of thing carnegie and rockefeller and all these coves do you know i slid for the door awfully sorry to leave you but ive got to meet some of the lads elsewhere  coming out of the lift i met bicky bustling in from the street  halloa bertie i missed him has he turned up  hes upstairs now having some tea  what does he think of it all  hes absolutely rattled  ripping ill be toddling up then toodleoo bertie old man see you later  pippip bicky dear boy  he trotted off full of merriment and good cheer and i went off to the club to sit in the window and watch the traffic coming up one way and going down the other  it was latish in the evening when i looked in at the flat to dress for dinner  wheres everybody jeeves i said finding no little feet pattering about the place gone out  his grace desired to see some of the sights of the city sir mr bickersteth is acting as his escort i fancy their immediate objective was grants tomb  i suppose mr bickersteth is a bit braced at the way things are goingwhat  sir  i say i take it that mr bickersteth is tolerably full of beans  not altogether sir  whats his trouble now  the scheme which i took the liberty of suggesting to mr bickersteth and yourself has unfortunately not answered entirely satisfactorily sir  surely the duke believes that mr bickersteth is doing well in business and all that sort of thing  exactly sir with the result that he has decided to cancel mr bickersteths monthly allowance on the ground that as mr bickersteth is doing so well on his own account he no longer requires pecuniary assistance  great scot jeeves this is awful  somewhat disturbing sir  i never expected anything like this  i confess i scarcely anticipated the contingency myself sir  i suppose it bowled the poor blighter over absolutely  mr bickersteth appeared somewhat taken aback sir  my heart bled for bicky  we must do something jeeves  yes sir  can you think of anything  not at the moment sir  there must be something we can do  it was a maxim of one of my former employers siras i believe i mentioned to you once beforethe present lord bridgnorth that there is always a way i remember his lordship using the expression on the occasionhe was then a business gentleman and had not yet received his titlewhen a patent hairrestorer which he chanced to be promoting failed to attract the public he put it on the market under another name as a depilatory and amassed a substantial fortune i have generally found his lordships aphorism based on sound foundations no doubt we shall be able to discover some solution of mr bickersteths difficulty sir  well have a stab at it jeeves  i will spare no pains sir  i went and dressed sadly it will show you pretty well how pipped i was when i tell you that i near as a toucher put on a white tie with a dinnerjacket i sallied out for a bit of food more to pass the time than because i wanted it it seemed brutal to be wading into the bill of fare with poor old bicky headed for the breadline  when i got back old chiswick had gone to bed but bicky was there hunched up in an armchair brooding pretty tensely with a cigarette hanging out of the corner of his mouth and a more or less glassy stare in his eyes he had the aspect of one who had been soaked with what the newspaper chappies call some blunt instrument  this is a bit thick old thingwhat i said  he picked up his glass and drained it feverishly overlooking the fact that it hadnt anything in it  im done bertie he said  he had another go at the glass it didnt seem to do him any good  if only this had happened a week later bertie my next months money was due to roll in on saturday i could have worked a wheeze ive been reading about in the magazine advertisements it seems that you can make a dashed amount of money if you can only collect a few dollars and start a chickenfarm jolly sound scheme bertie say you buy a hencall it one hen for the sake of argument it lays an egg every day of the week you sell the eggs seven for twentyfive cents keep of hen costs nothing profit practically twentyfive cents on every seven eggs or look at it another way suppose you have a dozen eggs each of the hens has a dozen chickens the chickens grow up and have more chickens why in no time youd have the place covered kneedeep in hens all laying eggs at twentyfive cents for every seven youd make a fortune jolly life too keeping hens he had begun to get quite worked up at the thought of it but he slopped back in his chair at this juncture with a good deal of gloom but of course its no good he said because i havent the cash  youve only to say the word you know bicky old top  thanks awfully bertie but im not going to sponge on you  thats always the way in this world the chappies youd like to lend money to wont let you whereas the chappies you dont want to lend it to will do everything except actually stand you on your head and lift the specie out of your pockets as a lad who has always rolled tolerably free in the right stuff ive had lots of experience of the second class manys the time back in london ive hurried along piccadilly and felt the hot breath of the toucher on the back of my neck and heard his sharp excited yapping as he closed in on me ive simply spent my life scattering largesse to blighters i didnt care a hang for yet here was i now dripping doubloons and pieces of eight and longing to hand them over and bicky poor fish absolutely on his uppers not taking any at any price  well theres only one hope then  whats that  jeeves  sir  there was jeeves standing behind me full of zeal in this matter of shimmering into rooms the chappie is rummy to a degree youre sitting in the old armchair thinking of this and that and then suddenly you look up and there he is he moves from point to point with as little uproar as a jelly fish the thing startled poor old bicky considerably he rose from his seat like a rocketing pheasant im used to jeeves now but often in the days when he first came to me ive bitten my tongue freely on finding him unexpectedly in my midst  did you call sir  oh there you are jeeves  precisely sir  jeeves mr bickersteth is still up the pole any ideas  why yes sir since we had our recent conversation i fancy i have found what may prove a solution i do not wish to appear to be taking a liberty sir but i think that we have overlooked his graces potentialities as a source of revenue  bicky laughed what i have sometimes seen described as a hollow mocking laugh a sort of bitter cackle from the back of the throat rather like a gargle  i do not allude sir explained jeeves to the possibility of inducing his grace to part with money i am taking the liberty of regarding his grace in the light of an at presentif i may say souseless property which is capable of being developed  bicky looked at me in a helpless kind of way im bound to say i didnt get it myself  couldnt you make it a bit easier jeeves  in a nutshell sir what i mean is this his grace is in a sense a prominent personage the inhabitants of this country as no doubt you are aware sir are peculiarly addicted to shaking hands with prominent personages it occurred to me that mr bickersteth or yourself might know of persons who would be willing to pay a small feelet us say two dollars or threefor the privilege of an introduction including handshake to his grace  bicky didnt seem to think much of it  do you mean to say that anyone would be mug enough to part with solid cash just to shake hands with my uncle  i have an aunt sir who paid five shillings to a young fellow for bringing a movingpicture actor to tea at her house one sunday it gave her social standing among the neighbours  bicky wavered  if you think it could be done  i feel convinced of it sir  what do you think bertie  im for it old boy absolutely a very brainy wheeze  thank you sir will there be anything further good night sir  and he floated out leaving us to discuss details  until we started this business of floating old chiswick as a moneymaking proposition i had never realized what a perfectly foul time those stock exchange chappies must have when the public isnt biting freely nowadays i read that bit they put in the financial reports about the market opened quietly with a sympathetic eye for by jove it certainly opened quietly for us youd hardly believe how difficult it was to interest the public and make them take a flutter on the old boy by the end of the week the only name we had on our list was a delicatessenstore keeper down in bickys part of the town and as he wanted us to take it out in sliced ham instead of cash that didnt help much there was a gleam of light when the brother of bickys pawnbroker offered ten dollars money down for an introduction to old chiswick but the deal fell through owing to its turning out that the chap was an anarchist and intended to kick the old boy instead of shaking hands with him at that it took me the deuce of a time to persuade bicky not to grab the cash and let things take their course he seemed to regard the pawnbrokers brother rather as a sportsman and benefactor of his species than otherwise  the whole thing im inclined to think would have been off if it hadnt been for jeeves there is no doubt that jeeves is in a class of his own in the matter of brain and resource i dont think i have ever met a chappie so supremely like mother made he trickled into my room one morning with a good old cup of tea and intimated that there was something doing  might i speak to you with regard to that matter of his grace sir  its all off weve decided to chuck it  sir  it wont work we cant get anybody to come  i fancy i can arrange that aspect of the matter sir  do you mean to say youve managed to get anybody  yes sir eightyseven gentlemen from birdsburg sir  i sat up in bed and spilt the tea  birdsburg  birdsburg missouri sir  how did you get them  i happened last night sir as you had intimated that you would be absent from home to attend a theatrical performance and entered into conversation between the acts with the occupant of the adjoining seat i had observed that he was wearing a somewhat ornate decoration in his buttonhole sira large blue button with the words boost for birdsburg upon it in red letters scarcely a judicious addition to a gentlemans evening costume to my surprise i noticed that the auditorium was full of persons similarly decorated i ventured to inquire the explanation and was informed that these gentlemen forming a party of eightyseven are a convention from a town of the name if birdsburg in the state of missouri their visit i gathered was purely of a social and pleasurable nature and my informant spoke at some length of the entertainments arranged for their stay in the city it was when he related with a considerable amount of satisfaction and pride that a deputation of their number had been introduced to and had shaken hands with a wellknown prizefighter that it occurred to me to broach the subject of his grace to make a long story short sir i have arranged subject to your approval that the entire convention shall be presented to his grace tomorrow afternoon  i was amazed this chappie was a napoleon  eightyseven jeeves at how much a head  i was obliged to agree to a reduction for quantity sir the terms finally arrived at were one hundred and fifty dollars for the party  i thought a bit  payable in advance  no sir i endeavoured to obtain payment in advance but was not successful  well any way when we get it ill make it up to five hundred bickyll never know do you suspect mr bickersteth would suspect anything jeeves if i made it up to five hundred  i fancy not sir mr bickersteth is an agreeable gentleman but not bright  all right then after breakfast run down to the bank and get me some money  yes sir  you know youre a bit of a marvel jeeves  thank you sir  righto  very good sir  when i took dear old bicky aside in the course of the morning and told him what had happened he nearly broke down he tottered into the sittingroom and buttonholed old chiswick who was reading the comic section of the morning paper with a kind of grim resolution  uncle he said are you doing anything special tomorrow afternoon i mean to say ive asked a few of my pals in to meet you dont you know  the old boy cocked a speculative eye at him  there will be no reporters among them  reporters rather not why  i refuse to be badgered by reporters there were a number of adhesive young men who endeavoured to elicit from me my views on america while the boat was approaching the dock i will not be subjected to this persecution again  thatll be absolutely all right uncle there wont be a newspaperman in the place  in that case i shall be glad to make the acquaintance of your friends  youll shake hands with them and so forth  i shall naturally order my behaviour according to the accepted rules of civilized intercourse  bicky thanked him heartily and came off to lunch with me at the club where he babbled freely of hens incubators and other rotten things  after mature consideration we had decided to unleash the birdsburg contingent on the old boy ten at a time jeeves brought his theatre pal round to see us and we arranged the whole thing with him a very decent chappie but rather inclined to collar the conversation and turn it in the direction of his hometowns new watersupply system we settled that as an hour was about all he would be likely to stand each gang should consider itself entitled to seven minutes of the dukes society by jeevess stopwatch and that when their time was up jeeves should slide into the room and cough meaningly then we parted with what i believe are called mutual expressions of goodwill the birdsburg chappie extending a cordial invitation to us all to pop out some day and take a look at the new watersupply system for which we thanked him  next day the deputation rolled in the first shift consisted of the cove we had met and nine others almost exactly like him in every respect they all looked deuced keen and businesslike as if from youth up they had been working in the office and catching the bosss eye and whatnot they shook hands with the old boy with a good deal of apparent satisfactionall except one chappie who seemed to be brooding about somethingand then they stood off and became chatty  what message have you for birdsburg duke asked our pal  the old boy seemed a bit rattled  i have never been to birdsburg  the chappie seemed pained  you should pay it a visit he said the most rapidlygrowing city in the country boost for birdsburg  boost for birdsburg said the other chappies reverently  the chappie who had been brooding suddenly gave tongue  say  he was a stout sort of wellfed cove with one of those determined chins and a cold eye  the assemblage looked at him  as a matter of business said the chappiemind you im not questioning anybodys good faith but as a matter of strict businessi think this gentleman here ought to put himself on record before witnesses as stating that he really is a duke  what do you mean sir cried the old boy getting purple  no offence simply business im not saying anything mind you but theres one thing that seems kind of funny to me this gentleman here says his names mr bickersteth as i understand it well if youre the duke of chiswick why isnt he lord percy something ive read english novels and i know all about it  this is monstrous  now dont get hot under the collar im only asking ive a right to know youre going to take our money so its only fair that we should see that we get our moneys worth  the watersupply cove chipped in  youre quite right simms i overlooked that when making the agreement you see gentlemen as business men weve a right to reasonable guarantees of good faith we are paying mr bickersteth here a hundred and fifty dollars for this reception and we naturally want to know  old chiswick gave bicky a searching look then he turned to the watersupply chappie he was frightfully calm  i can assure you that i know nothing of this he said quite politely i should be grateful if you would explain  well we arranged with mr bickersteth that eightyseven citizens of birdsburg should have the privilege of meeting and shaking hands with you for a financial consideration mutually arranged and what my friend simms here meansand im with himis that we have only mr bickersteths word for itand he is a stranger to usthat you are the duke of chiswick at all  old chiswick gulped  allow me to assure you sir he said in a rummy kind of voice that i am the duke of chiswick  then thats all right said the chappie heartily that was all we wanted to know let the thing go on  i am sorry to say said old chiswick that it cannot go on i am feeling a little tired i fear i must ask to be excused  but there are seventyseven of the boys waiting round the corner at this moment duke to be introduced to you  i fear i must disappoint them  but in that case the deal would have to be off  that is a matter for you and my nephew to discuss  the chappie seemed troubled  you really wont meet the rest of them  no  well then i guess well be going  they went out and there was a pretty solid silence then old chiswick turned to bicky  well  bicky didnt seem to have anything to say  was it true what that man said  yes uncle  what do you mean by playing this trick  bicky seemed pretty well knocked out so i put in a word  i think youd better explain the whole thing bicky old top  bickys adamsapple jumped about a bit then he started  you see you had cut off my allowance uncle and i wanted a bit of money to start a chicken farm i mean to say its an absolute cert if you once get a bit of capital you buy a hen and it lays an egg every day of the week and you sell the eggs say seven for twentyfive cents  keep of hens cost nothing profit practically  what is all this nonsense about hens you led me to suppose you were a substantial business man  old bicky rather exaggerated sir i said helping the chappie out the fact is the poor old lad is absolutely dependent on that remittance of yours and when you cut it off dont you know he was pretty solidly in the soup and had to think of some way of closing in on a bit of the ready pretty quick thats why we thought of this handshaking scheme  old chiswick foamed at the mouth  so you have lied to me you have deliberately deceived me as to your financial status  poor old bicky didnt want to go to that ranch i explained he doesnt like cows and horses but he rather thinks he would be hot stuff among the hens all he wants is a bit of capital dont you think it would be rather a wheeze if you were to  after what has happened after thisthis deceit and foolery not a penny  but  not a penny  there was a respectful cough in the background  if i might make a suggestion sir  jeeves was standing on the horizon looking devilish brainy  go ahead jeeves i said  i would merely suggest sir that if mr bickersteth is in need of a little ready money and is at a loss to obtain it elsewhere he might secure the sum he requires by describing the occurrences of this afternoon for the sunday issue of one of the more spirited and enterprising newspapers  by jove i said  by george said bicky  great heavens said old chiswick  very good sir said jeeves  bicky turned to old chiswick with a gleaming eye  jeeves is right ill do it the chronicle would jump at it they eat that sort of stuff  old chiswick gave a kind of moaning howl  i absolutely forbid you francis to do this thing  thats all very well said bicky wonderfully braced but if i cant get the money any other way  wait erwait my boy you are so impetuous we might arrange something  i wont go to that bally ranch  no no no no my boy i would not suggest it i would not for a moment suggest it ii think  he seemed to have a bit of a struggle with himself ii think that on the whole it would be best if you returned with me to england ii mightin fact i think i see my way to doingtoi might be able to utilize your services in some secretarial position  i shouldnt mind that  i should not be able to offer you a salary but as you know in english political life the unpaid secretary is a recognized figure  the only figure ill recognize said bicky firmly is five hundred quid a year paid quarterly  my dear boy  absolutely  but your recompense my dear francis would consist in the unrivalled opportunities you would have as my secretary to gain experience to accustom yourself to the intricacies of political life toin fact you would be in an exceedingly advantageous position  five hundred a year said bicky rolling it round his tongue why that would be nothing to what i could make if i started a chicken farm it stands to reason suppose you have a dozen hens each of the hens has a dozen chickens after a bit the chickens grow up and have a dozen chickens each themselves and then they all start laying eggs theres a fortune in it you can get anything you like for eggs in america chappies keep them on ice for years and years and dont sell them till they fetch about a dollar a whirl you dont think im going to chuck a future like this for anything under five hundred o goblins a yearwhat  a look of anguish passed over old chiswicks face then he seemed to be resigned to it very well my boy he said  whato said bicky all right then  jeeves i said bicky had taken the old boy off to dinner to celebrate and we were alone jeeves this has been one of your best efforts  thank you sir  it beats me how you do it  yes sir  the only trouble is you havent got much out of itwhat  i fancy mr bickersteth intendsi judge from his remarksto signify his appreciation of anything i have been fortunate enough to do to assist him at some later date when he is in a more favourable position to do so  it isnt enough jeeves  sir  it was a wrench but i felt it was the only possible thing to be done  bring my shaving things  a gleam of hope shone in the chappies eye mixed with doubt  you mean sir  and shave off my moustache  there was a moments silence i could see the fellow was deeply moved  thank you very much indeed sir he said in a low voice and popped off     absent treatment   i want to tell you all about dear old bobbie cardew its a most interesting story i cant put in any literary style and all that but i dont have to dont you know because it goes on its moral lesson if youre a man you mustnt miss it because itll be a warning to you and if youre a woman you wont want to because its all about how a girl made a man feel pretty well fed up with things  if youre a recent acquaintance of bobbies youll probably be surprised to hear that there was a time when he was more remarkable for the weakness of his memory than anything else dozens of fellows who have only met bobbie since the change took place have been surprised when i told them that yet its true believe me  in the days when i first knew him bobbie cardew was about the most pronounced young rotter inside the fourmile radius people have called me a silly ass but i was never in the same class with bobbie when it came to being a silly ass he was a plusfour man while my handicap was about six why if i wanted him to dine with me i used to post him a letter at the beginning of the week and then the day before send him a telegram and a phonecall on the day itself andhalf an hour before the time wed fixeda messenger in a taxi whose business it was to see that he got in and that the chauffeur had the address all correct by doing this i generally managed to get him unless he had left town before my messenger arrived  the funny thing was that he wasnt altogether a fool in other ways deep down in him there was a kind of stratum of sense i had known him once or twice show an almost human intelligence but to reach that stratum mind you you needed dynamite  at least thats what i thought but there was another way which hadnt occurred to me marriage i mean marriage the dynamite of the soul that was what hit bobbie he married have you ever seen a bullpup chasing a bee the pup sees the bee it looks good to him but he still doesnt know whats at the end of it till he gets there it was like that with bobbie he fell in love got marriedwith a sort of whoop as if it were the greatest fun in the worldand then began to find out things  she wasnt the sort of girl you would have expected bobbie to rave about and yet i dont know what i mean is she worked for her living and to a fellow who has never done a hands turn in his life theres undoubtedly a sort of fascination a kind of romance about a girl who works for her living  her name was anthony mary anthony she was about five feet six she had a ton and a half of redgold hair grey eyes and one of those determined chins she was a hospital nurse when bobbie smashed himself up at polo she was told off by the authorities to smooth his brow and rally round with cooling unguents and all that and the old boy hadnt been up and about again for more than a week before they popped off to the registrars and fixed it up quite the romance  bobbie broke the news to me at the club one evening and next day he introduced me to her i admired her ive never worked myselfmy names pepper by the way almost forgot to mention it reggie pepper my uncle edward was pepper wells and co the colliery people he left me a sizable chunk of bullioni say ive never worked myself but i admire any one who earns a living under difficulties especially a girl and this girl had had a rather unusually tough time of it being an orphan and all that and having had to do everything off her own bat for years  mary and i got along together splendidly we dont now but well come to that later im speaking of the past she seemed to think bobbie the greatest thing on earth judging by the way she looked at him when she thought i wasnt noticing and bobbie seemed to think the same about her so that i came to the conclusion that if only dear old bobbie didnt forget to go to the wedding they had a sporting chance of being quite happy  well lets brisk up a bit here and jump a year the story doesnt really start till then  they took a flat and settled down i was in and out of the place quite a good deal i kept my eyes open and everything seemed to me to be running along as smoothly as you could want if this was marriage i thought i couldnt see why fellows were so frightened of it there were a lot of worse things that could happen to a man  but we now come to the incident of the quiet dinner and its just here that loves young dream hits a snag and things begin to occur  i happened to meet bobbie in piccadilly and he asked me to come back to dinner at the flat and like a fool instead of bolting and putting myself under police protection i went  when we got to the flat there was mrs bobbie lookingwell i tell you it staggered me her gold hair was all piled up in waves and crinkles and things with a whatdyoucallit of diamonds in it and she was wearing the most perfectly ripping dress i couldnt begin to describe it i can only say it was the limit it struck me that if this was how she was in the habit of looking every night when they were dining quietly at home together it was no wonder that bobbie liked domesticity  heres old reggie dear said bobbie ive brought him home to have a bit of dinner ill phone down to the kitchen and ask them to send it up nowwhat  she stared at him as if she had never seen him before then she turned scarlet then she turned as white as a sheet then she gave a little laugh it was most interesting to watch made me wish i was up a tree about eight hundred miles away then she recovered herself  i am so glad you were able to come mr pepper she said smiling at me  and after that she was all right at least you would have said so she talked a lot at dinner and chaffed bobbie and played us ragtime on the piano afterwards as if she hadnt a care in the world quite a jolly little party it wasnot im no lynxeyed sleuth and all that sort of thing but i had seen her face at the beginning and i knew that she was working the whole time and working hard to keep herself in hand and that she would have given that diamond whatsitsname in her hair and everything else she possessed to have one good screamjust one ive sat through some pretty thick evenings in my time but that one had the rest beaten in a canter at the very earliest moment i grabbed my hat and got away  having seen what i did i wasnt particularly surprised to meet bobbie at the club next day looking about as merry and bright as a lonely gumdrop at an eskimo teaparty  he started in straightway he seemed glad to have someone to talk to about it  do you know how long ive been married he said  i didnt exactly  about a year isnt it  not about a year he said sadly exactly a yearyesterday  then i understood i saw lighta regular flash of light  yesterday was  the anniversary of the wedding id arranged to take mary to the savoy and on to covent garden she particularly wanted to hear caruso i had the ticket for the box in my pocket do you know all through dinner i had a kind of rummy idea that there was something id forgotten but i couldnt think what  till your wife mentioned it  he nodded  shementioned it he said thoughtfully  i didnt ask for details women with hair and chins like marys may be angels most of the time but when they take off their wings for a bit they arent halfhearted about it  to be absolutely frank old top said poor old bobbie in a broken sort of way my stocks pretty low at home  there didnt seem much to be done i just lit a cigarette and sat there he didnt want to talk presently he went out i stood at the window of our upper smokingroom which looks out on to piccadilly and watched him he walked slowly along for a few yards stopped then walked on again and finally turned into a jewellers which was an instance of what i meant when i said that deep down in him there was a certain stratum of sense                                       it was from now on that i began to be really interested in this problem of bobbies married life of course ones always mildly interested in ones friends marriages hoping theyll turn out well and all that but this was different the average man isnt like bobbie and the average girl isnt like mary it was that old business of the immovable mass and the irresistible force there was bobbie ambling gently through life a dear old chap in a hundred ways but undoubtedly a chump of the first water  and there was mary determined that he shouldnt be a chump and nature mind you on bobbies side when nature makes a chump like dear old bobbie shes proud of him and doesnt want her handiwork disturbed she gives him a sort of natural armour to protect him against outside interference and that armour is shortness of memory shortness of memory keeps a man a chump when but for it he might cease to be one take my case for instance im a chump well if i had remembered half the things people have tried to teach me during my life my size in hats would be about number nine but i didnt i forgot them and it was just the same with bobbie  for about a week perhaps a bit more the recollection of that quiet little domestic evening bucked him up like a tonic elephants i read somewhere are champions at the memory business but they were fools to bobbie during that week but bless you the shock wasnt nearly big enough it had dinted the armour but it hadnt made a hole in it pretty soon he was back at the old game  it was pathetic dont you know the poor girl loved him and she was frightened it was the thin edge of the wedge you see and she knew it a man who forgets what day he was married when hes been married one year will forget at about the end of the fourth that hes married at all if she meant to get him in hand at all she had got to do it now before he began to drift away  i saw that clearly enough and i tried to make bobbie see it when he was by way of pouring out his troubles to me one afternoon i cant remember what it was that he had forgotten the day before but it was something she had asked him to bring home for herit may have been a book  its such a little thing to make a fuss about said bobbie and she knows that its simply because ive got such an infernal memory about everything i cant remember anything never could  he talked on for a while and just as he was going he pulled out a couple of sovereigns  oh by the way he said  whats this for i asked though i knew  i owe it you  hows that i said  why that bet on tuesday in the billiardroom murray and brown were playing a hundred up and i gave you two to one that brown would win and murray beat him by twenty odd  so you do remember some things i said  he got quite excited said that if i thought he was the sort of rotter who forgot to pay when he lost a bet it was pretty rotten of me after knowing him all these years and a lot more like that  subside laddie i said  then i spoke to him like a father  what youve got to do my old college chum i said is to pull yourself together and jolly quick too as things are shaping youre due for a nasty knock before you know whats hit you youve got to make an effort dont say you cant this two quid business shows that even if your memory is rocky you can remember some things what youve got to do is to see that wedding anniversaries and so on are included in the list it may be a brainstrain but you cant get out of it  i suppose youre right said bobbie but it beats me why she thinks such a lot of these rotten little dates whats it matter if i forgot what day we were married on or what day she was born on or what day the cat had the measles she knows i love her just as much as if i were a memorizing freak at the halls  thats not enough for a woman i said they want to be shown bear that in mind and youre all right forget it and therell be trouble  he chewed the knob of his stick  women are frightfully rummy he said gloomily  you should have thought of that before you married one i said                                       i dont see that i could have done any more i had put the whole thing in a nutshell for him you would have thought hed have seen the point and that it would have made him brace up and get a hold on himself but no off he went again in the same old way i gave up arguing with him i had a good deal of time on my hands but not enough to amount to anything when it was a question of reforming dear old bobbie by argument if you see a man asking for trouble and insisting on getting it the only thing to do is to stand by and wait till it comes to him after that you may get a chance but till then theres nothing to be done but i thought a lot about him  bobbie didnt get into the soup all at once weeks went by and months and still nothing happened now and then hed come into the club with a kind of cloud on his shining morning face and id know that there had been doings in the home but it wasnt till well on in the spring that he got the thunderbolt just where he had been asking for itin the thorax  i was smoking a quiet cigarette one morning in the window looking out over piccadilly and watching the buses and motors going up one way and down the othermost interesting it is i often do itwhen in rushed bobbie with his eyes bulging and his face the colour of an oyster waving a piece of paper in his hand  reggie he said reggie old top shes gone  gone i said who  mary of course gone left me gone  where i said  silly question perhaps youre right anyhow dear old bobbie nearly foamed at the mouth  where how should i know where here read this  he pushed the paper into my hand it was a letter  go on said bobbie read it  so i did it certainly was quite a letter there was not much of it but it was all to the point this is what it said      my dear bobbiei am going away when you care enough about me     to remember to wish me many happy returns on my birthday i will     come back my address will be box 341 london morning news  i read it twice then i said well why dont you  why dont i what  why dont you wish her many happy returns it doesnt seem much to ask  but she says on her birthday  well when is her birthday  cant you understand said bobbie ive forgotten  forgotten i said  yes said bobbie forgotten  how do you mean forgotten i said forgotten whether its the twentieth or the twentyfirst or what how near do you get to it  i know it came somewhere between the first of january and the thirtyfirst of december thats how near i get to it  think  think whats the use of saying think think i havent thought ive been knocking sparks out of my brain ever since i opened that letter  and you cant remember  no  i rang the bell and ordered restoratives  well bobbie i said its a pretty hard case to spring on an untrained amateur like me suppose someone had come to sherlock holmes and said mr holmes heres a case for you when is my wifes birthday wouldnt that have given sherlock a jolt however i know enough about the game to understand that a fellow cant shoot off his deductive theories unless you start him with a clue so rouse yourself out of that popeyed trance and come across with two or three for instance cant you remember the last time she had a birthday what sort of weather was it that might fix the month  bobbie shook his head  it was just ordinary weather as near as i can recollect  warm  warmish  or cold  well fairly cold perhaps i cant remember  i ordered two more of the same they seemed indicated in the young detectives manual youre a great help bobbie i said an invaluable assistant one of those indispensable adjuncts without which no home is complete  bobbie seemed to be thinking  ive got it he said suddenly look here i gave her a present on her last birthday all we have to do is to go to the shop hunt up the date when it was bought and the things done  absolutely what did you give her  he sagged  i cant remember he said  getting ideas is like golf some days youre right off others its as easy as falling off a log i dont suppose dear old bobbie had ever had two ideas in the same morning before in his life but now he did it without an effort he just loosed another dry martini into the undergrowth and before you could turn round it had flushed quite a brainwave  do you know those little books called when were you born theres one for each month they tell you your character your talents your strong points and your weak points at fourpence halfpenny a go bobbies idea was to buy the whole twelve and go through them till we found out which month hit off marys character that would give us the month and narrow it down a whole lot  a pretty hot idea for a nonthinker like dear old bobbie we sallied out at once he took half and i took half and we settled down to work as i say it sounded good but when we came to go into the thing we saw that there was a flaw there was plenty of information all right but there wasnt a single month that didnt have something that exactly hit off mary for instance in the december book it said december people are apt to keep their own secrets they are extensive travellers well mary had certainly kept her secret and she had travelled quite extensively enough for bobbies needs then october people were born with original ideas and loved moving you couldnt have summed up marys little jaunt more neatly february people had wonderful memoriesmarys speciality  we took a bit of a rest then had another go at the thing  bobbie was all for may because the book said that women born in that month were inclined to be capricious which is always a barrier to a happy married life but i plumped for february because february women are unusually determined to have their own way are very earnest and expect a full return in their companion or mates which he owned was about as like mary as anything could be  in the end he tore the books up stamped on them burnt them and went home  it was wonderful what a change the next few days made in dear old bobbie have you ever seen that picture the souls awakening it represents a flapper of sorts gazing in a startled sort of way into the middle distance with a look in her eyes that seems to say surely that is georges step i hear on the mat can this be love well bobbie had a souls awakening too i dont suppose he had ever troubled to think in his life beforenot really think but now he was wearing his brain to the bone it was painful in a way of course to see a fellow human being so thoroughly in the soup but i felt strongly that it was all for the best i could see as plainly as possible that all these brainstorms were improving bobbie out of knowledge when it was all over he might possibly become a rotter again of a sort but it would only be a pale reflection of the rotter he had been it bore out the idea i had always had that what he needed was a real good jolt  i saw a great deal of him these days i was his best friend and he came to me for sympathy i gave it him too with both hands but i never failed to hand him the moral lesson when i had him weak  one day he came to me as i was sitting in the club and i could see that he had had an idea he looked happier than he had done in weeks  reggie he said im on the trail this time im convinced that i shall pull it off ive remembered something of vital importance  yes i said  i remember distinctly he said that on marys last birthday we went together to the coliseum how does that hit you  its a fine bit of memorizing i said but how does it help  why they change the programme every week there  ah i said now you are talking  and the week we went one of the turns was professor some ones terpsichorean cats i recollect them distinctly now are we narrowing it down or arent we reggie im going round to the coliseum this minute and im going to dig the date of those terpsichorean cats out of them if i have to use a crowbar  so that got him within six days for the management treated us like brothers brought out the archives and ran agile fingers over the pages till they treed the cats in the middle of may  i told you it was may said bobbie maybe youll listen to me another time  if youve any sense i said there wont be another time  and bobbie said that there wouldnt  once you get your money on the run it parts as if it enjoyed doing it i had just got off to sleep that night when my telephonebell rang it was bobbie of course he didnt apologize  reggie he said ive got it now for certain its just come to me we saw those terpsichorean cats at a matinee old man  yes i said  well dont you see that that brings it down to two days it must have been either wednesday the seventh or saturday the tenth  yes i said if they didnt have daily matinees at the coliseum  i heard him give a sort of howl  bobbie i said my feet were freezing but i was fond of him  well  ive remembered something too its this the day you went to the coliseum i lunched with you both at the ritz you had forgotten to bring any money with you so you wrote a cheque  but im always writing cheques  you are but this was for a tenner and made out to the hotel hunt up your chequebook and see how many cheques for ten pounds payable to the ritz hotel you wrote out between may the fifth and may the tenth  he gave a kind of gulp  reggie he said youre a genius ive always said so i believe youve got it hold the line  presently he came back again  halloa he said  im here i said  it was the eighth reggie old man i  topping i said good night  it was working along into the small hours now but i thought i might as well make a night of it and finish the thing up so i rang up an hotel near the strand  put me through to mrs cardew i said  its late said the man at the other end  and getting later every minute i said buck along laddie  i waited patiently i had missed my beautysleep and my feet had frozen hard but i was past regrets  what is the matter said marys voice  my feet are cold i said but i didnt call you up to tell you that particularly ive just been chatting with bobbie mrs cardew  oh is that mr pepper  yes hes remembered it mrs cardew  she gave a sort of scream ive often thought how interesting it must be to be one of those exchange girls the things they must hear dont you know bobbies howl and gulp and mrs bobbies scream and all about my feet and all that most interesting it must be  hes remembered it she gasped did you tell him  no  well i hadnt  mr pepper  yes  was hehas he beenwas he very worried  i chuckled this was where i was billed to be the life and soul of the party  worried he was about the most worried man between here and edinburgh he has been worrying as if he was paid to do it by the nation he has started out to worry after breakfast and  oh well you can never tell with women my idea was that we should pass the rest of the night slapping each other on the back across the wire and telling each other what bally brainy conspirators we were dont you know and all that but id got just as far as this when she bit at me absolutely i heard the snap and then she said oh in that choked kind of way and when a woman says oh like that it means all the bad words shed love to say if she only knew them  and then she began  what brutes men are what horrid brutes how you could stand by and see poor dear bobbie worrying himself into a fever when a word from you would have put everything right i cant  but  and you call yourself his friend his friend metallic laugh most unpleasant it shows how one can be deceived i used to think you a kindhearted man  but i say when i suggested the thing you thought it perfectly  i thought it hateful abominable  but you said it was absolutely top  i said nothing of the kind and if i did i didnt mean it i dont wish to be unjust mr pepper but i must say that to me there seems to be something positively fiendish in a man who can go out of his way to separate a husband from his wife simply in order to amuse himself by gloating over his agony  but  when one single word would have  but you made me promise not to i bleated  and if i did do you suppose i didnt expect you to have the sense to break your promise  i had finished i had no further observations to make i hung up the receiver and crawled into bed                                       i still see bobbie when he comes to the club but i do not visit the old homestead he is friendly but he stops short of issuing invitations i ran across mary at the academy last week and her eyes went through me like a couple of bullets through a pat of butter and as they came out the other side and i limped off to piece myself together again there occurred to me the simple epitaph which when i am no more i intend to have inscribed on my tombstone it was this he was a man who acted from the best motives there is one born every minute     helping freddie   i dont want to bore you dont you know and all that sort of rot but i must tell you about dear old freddie meadowes im not a flier at literary style and all that but ill get some writer chappie to give the thing a wash and brush up when ive finished so thatll be all right  dear old freddie dont you know has been a dear old pal of mine for years and years so when i went into the club one morning and found him sitting alone in a dark corner staring glassily at nothing and generally looking like the last rose of summer you can understand i was quite disturbed about it as a rule the old rotter is the life and soul of our set quite the little lump of fun and all that sort of thing  jimmy pinkerton was with me at the time jimmys a fellow who writes playsa deuced brainy sort of fellowand between us we set to work to question the poor popeyed chappie until finally we got at what the matter was  as we might have guessed it was a girl he had had a quarrel with angela west the girl he was engaged to and she had broken off the engagement what the row had been about he didnt say but apparently she was pretty well fed up she wouldnt let him come near her refused to talk on the phone and sent back his letters unopened  i was sorry for poor old freddie i knew what it felt like i was once in love myself with a girl called elizabeth shoolbred and the fact that she couldnt stand me at any price will be recorded in my autobiography i knew the thing for freddie  change of scene is what you want old scout i said come with me to marvis bay ive taken a cottage there jimmys coming down on the twentyfourth well be a cosy party  hes absolutely right said jimmy change of scenes the thing i knew a man girl refused him man went abroad two months later girl wired him come back muriel man started to write out a reply suddenly found that he couldnt remember girls surname so never answered at all  but freddie wouldnt be comforted he just went on looking as if he had swallowed his last sixpence however i got him to promise to come to marvis bay with me he said he might as well be there as anywhere  do you know marvis bay its in dorsetshire it isnt what youd call a fiercely exciting spot but it has its good points you spend the day there bathing and sitting on the sands and in the evening you stroll out on the shore with the gnats at nine oclock you rub ointment on the wounds and go to bed  it seemed to suit poor old freddie once the moon was up and the breeze sighing in the trees you couldnt drag him from that beach with a rope he became quite a popular pet with the gnats theyd hang round waiting for him to come out and would give perfectly good strollers the missinbaulk just so as to be in good condition for him  yes it was a peaceful sort of life but by the end of the first week i began to wish that jimmy pinkerton had arranged to come down earlier for as a companion freddie poor old chap wasnt anything to write home to mother about when he wasnt chewing a pipe and scowling at the carpet he was sitting at the piano playing the rosary with one finger he couldnt play anything except the rosary and he couldnt play much of that somewhere round about the third bar a fuse would blow out and hed have to start all over again  he was playing it as usual one morning when i came in from bathing  reggie he said in a hollow voice looking up ive seen her  seen her i said what miss west  i was down at the post office getting the letters and we met in the doorway she cut me  he started the rosary again and sideslipped in the second bar  reggie he said you ought never to have brought me here i must go away  go away i said dont talk such rot this is the best thing that could have happened this is where you come out strong  she cut me  never mind be a sportsman have another dash at her  she looked clean through me  of course she did but dont mind that put this thing in my hands ill see you through now what you want i said is to place her under some obligation to you what you want is to get her timidly thanking you what you want  but whats she going to thank me timidly for  i thought for a moment  look out for a chance and save her from drowning i said  i cant swim said freddie  that was freddie all over dont you know a dear old chap in a thousand ways but no help to a fellow if you know what i mean  he cranked up the piano once more and i sprinted for the open  i strolled out on to the sands and began to think this thing over there was no doubt that the brainwork had got to be done by me dear old freddie had his strong qualities he was tophole at polo and in happier days ive heard him give an imitation of cats fighting in a backyard that would have surprised you but apart from that he wasnt a man of enterprise  well dont you know i was rounding some rocks with my brain whirring like a dynamo when i caught sight of a blue dress and by jove it was the girl i had never met her but freddie had sixteen photographs of her sprinkled round his bedroom and i knew i couldnt be mistaken she was sitting on the sand helping a small fat child build a castle on a chair close by was an elderly lady reading a novel i heard the girl call her aunt so doing the sherlock holmes business i deduced that the fat child was her cousin it struck me that if freddie had been there he would probably have tried to work up some sentiment about the kid on the strength of it personally i couldnt manage it i dont think i ever saw a child who made me feel less sentimental he was one of those round bulging kids  after he had finished the castle he seemed to get bored with life and began to whimper the girl took him off to where a fellow was selling sweets at a stall and i walked on  now fellows if you ask them will tell you that im a chump well i dont mind i admit it i am a chump all the peppers have been chumps but what i do say is that every now and then when youd least expect it i get a pretty hot brainwave and thats what happened now i doubt if the idea that came to me then would have occurred to a single one of any dozen of the brainiest chappies you care to name  it came to me on my return journey i was walking back along the shore when i saw the fat kid meditatively smacking a jellyfish with a spade the girl wasnt with him in fact there didnt seem to be any one in sight i was just going to pass on when i got the brainwave i thought the whole thing out in a flash dont you know from what i had seen of the two the girl was evidently fond of this kid and anyhow he was her cousin so what i said to myself was this if i kidnap this young heavyweight for the moment and if when the girl has got frightfully anxious about where he can have got to dear old freddie suddenly appears leading the infant by the hand and telling a story to the effect that he has found him wandering at large about the country and practically saved his life why the girls gratitude is bound to make her chuck hostilities and be friends again so i gathered in the kid and made off with him all the way home i pictured that scene of reconciliation i could see it so vividly dont you know that by george it gave me quite a choky feeling in my throat  freddie dear old chap was rather slow at getting on to the fine points of the idea when i appeared carrying the kid and dumped him down in our sittingroom he didnt absolutely effervesce with joy if you know what i mean the kid had started to bellow by this time and poor old freddie seemed to find it rather trying  stop it he said do you think nobodys got any troubles except you what the deuce is all this reggie  the kid came back at him with a yell that made the window rattle i raced to the kitchen and fetched a jar of honey it was the right stuff the kid stopped bellowing and began to smear his face with the stuff  well said freddie when silence had set in i explained the idea after a while it began to strike him  youre not such a fool as you look sometimes reggie he said handsomely im bound to say this seems pretty good  and he disentangled the kid from the honeyjar and took him out to scour the beach for angela  i dont know when ive felt so happy i was so fond of dear old freddie that to know that he was soon going to be his old bright self again made me feel as if somebody had left me about a million pounds i was leaning back in a chair on the veranda smoking peacefully when down the road i saw the old boy returning and by george the kid was still with him and freddie looked as if he hadnt a friend in the world  hello i said couldnt you find her  yes i found her he replied with one of those bitter hollow laughs  well then  freddie sank into a chair and groaned  this isnt her cousin you idiot he said  hes no relation at all hes just a kid she happened to meet on the beach she had never seen him before in her life  what who is he then  i dont know oh lord ive had a time thank goodness youll probably spend the next few years of your life in dartmoor for kidnapping thats my only consolation ill come and jeer at you through the bars  tell me all old boy i said  it took him a good long time to tell the story for he broke off in the middle of nearly every sentence to call me names but i gathered gradually what had happened she had listened like an iceberg while he told the story he had prepared and thenwell she didnt actually call him a liar but she gave him to understand in a general sort of way that if he and dr cook ever happened to meet and started swapping stories it would be about the biggest duel on record and then he had crawled away with the kid licked to a splinter  and mind this is your affair he concluded im not mixed up in it at all if you want to escape your sentence youd better go and find the kids parents and return him before the police come for you                                       by jove you know till i started to tramp the place with this infernal kid i never had a notion it would have been so deuced difficult to restore a child to its anxious parents its a mystery to me how kidnappers ever get caught i searched marvis bay like a bloodhound but nobody came forward to claim the infant youd have thought from the lack of interest in him that he was stopping there all by himself in a cottage of his own it wasnt till by an inspiration i thought to ask the sweetstall man that i found out that his name was medwin and that his parents lived at a place called ocean rest in beach road  i shot off there like an arrow and knocked at the door nobody answered i knocked again i could hear movements inside but nobody came i was just going to get to work on that knocker in such a way that the idea would filter through into these peoples heads that i wasnt standing there just for the fun of the thing when a voice from somewhere above shouted hi  i looked up and saw a round pink face with grey whiskers east and west of it staring down from an upper window  hi it shouted again  what the deuce do you mean by hi i said  you cant come in said the face hello is that tootles  my name is not tootles and i dont want to come in i said are you mr medwin ive brought back your son  i see him peepbo tootles dadda can see oo  the face disappeared with a jerk i could hear voices the face reappeared  hi  i churned the gravel madly  do you live here said the face  im staying here for a few weeks  whats your name  pepper but  pepper any relation to edward pepper the colliery owner  my uncle but  i used to know him well dear old edward pepper i wish i was with him now  i wish you were i said  he beamed down at me  this is most fortunate he said we were wondering what we were to do with tootles you see we have the mumps here my daughter bootles has just developed mumps tootles must not be exposed to the risk of infection we could not think what we were to do with him it was most fortunate your finding him he strayed from his nurse i would hesitate to trust him to the care of a stranger but you are different any nephew of edward peppers has my implicit confidence you must take tootles to your house it will be an ideal arrangement i have written to my brother in london to come and fetch him he may be here in a few days  may  he is a busy man of course but he should certainly be here within a week till then tootles can stop with you it is an excellent plan very much obliged to you your wife will like tootles  i havent got a wife i yelled but the window had closed with a bang as if the man with the whiskers had found a germ trying to escape dont you know and had headed it off just in time  i breathed a deep breath and wiped my forehead  the window flew up again  hi  a package weighing about a ton hit me on the head and burst like a bomb  did you catch it said the face reappearing dear me you missed it never mind you can get it at the grocers ask for baileys granulated breakfast chips tootles takes them for breakfast with a little milk be certain to get baileys  my spirit was broken if you know what i mean i accepted the situation taking tootles by the hand i walked slowly away napoleons retreat from moscow was a picnic by the side of it  as we turned up the road we met freddies angela  the sight of her had a marked effect on the kid tootles he pointed at her and said wah  the girl stopped and smiled i loosed the kid and he ran to her  well baby she said bending down to him so father found you again did he your little son and i made friends on the beach this morning she said to me  this was the limit coming on top of that interview with the whiskered lunatic it so utterly unnerved me dont you know that she had nodded goodbye and was halfway down the road before i caught up with my breath enough to deny the charge of being the infants father  i hadnt expected dear old freddie to sing with joy when he found out what had happened but i did think he might have shown a little more manly fortitude he leaped up glared at the kid and clutched his head he didnt speak for a long time but on the other hand when he began he did not leave off for a long time he was quite emotional dear old boy it beat me where he could have picked up such expressions  well he said when he had finished say something heavens man why dont you say something  you dont give me a chance old top i said soothingly  what are you going to do about it  what can we do about it  we cant spend our time acting as nurses to thisthis exhibit  he got up  im going back to london he said  freddie i cried freddie old man my voice shook would you desert a pal at a time like this  i would this is your business and youve got to manage it  freddie i said youve got to stand by me you must do you realize that this child has to be undressed and bathed and dressed again you wouldnt leave me to do all that singlehanded freddie old scout we were at school together your mother likes me you owe me a tenner  he sat down again  oh well he said resignedly  besides old top i said i did it all for your sake dont you know  he looked at me in a curious way  reggie he said in a strained voice one moment ill stand a good deal but i wont stand for being expected to be grateful  looking back at it i see that what saved me from colney hatch in that crisis was my bright idea of buying up most of the contents of the local sweetshop by serving out sweets to the kid practically incessantly we managed to get through the rest of that day pretty satisfactorily at eight oclock he fell asleep in a chair and having undressed him by unbuttoning every button in sight and where there were no buttons pulling till something gave we carried him up to bed  freddie stood looking at the pile of clothes on the floor and i knew what he was thinking to get the kid undressed had been simplea mere matter of muscle but how were we to get him into his clothes again i stirred the pile with my foot there was a long linen arrangement which might have been anything also a strip of pink flannel which was like nothing on earth we looked at each other and smiled wanly  but in the morning i remembered that there were children at the next bungalow but one we went there before breakfast and borrowed their nurse women are wonderful by george they are she had that kid dressed and looking fit for anything in about eight minutes i showered wealth on her and she promised to come in morning and evening i sat down to breakfast almost cheerful again it was the first bit of silver lining there had been to the cloud up to date  and after all i said theres lots to be said for having a child about the house if you know what i mean kind of cosy and domesticwhat  just then the kid upset the milk over freddies trousers and when he had come back after changing his clothes he began to talk about what a muchmaligned man king herod was the more he saw of tootles he said the less he wondered at those impulsive views of his on infanticide  two days later jimmy pinkerton came down jimmy took one look at the kid who happened to be howling at the moment and picked up his portmanteau  for me he said the hotel i cant write dialogue with that sort of thing going on whose work is this which of you adopted this little treasure  i told him about mr medwin and the mumps jimmy seemed interested  i might work this up for the stage he said it wouldnt make a bad situation for act two of a farce  farce snarled poor old freddie  rather curtain of act one on hero a wellmeaning halfbaked sort of idiot just likethat is to say a wellmeaning halfbaked sort of idiot kidnapping the child second act his adventures with it ill rough it out tonight come along and show me the hotel reggie  as we went i told him the rest of the storythe angela part he laid down his portmanteau and looked at me like an owl through his glasses  what he said why hang it this is a play readymade its the old tiny hand business always safe stuff parted lovers lisping child reconciliation over the little cradle its big child centre girl lc freddie up stage by the piano can freddie play the piano  he can play a little of the rosary with one finger  jimmy shook his head  no we shall have to cut out the soft music but the rests all right look here he squatted in the sand this stone is the girl this bit of seaweeds the child this nutshell is freddie dialogue leading up to childs line child speaks like boofer lady does oo love dadda business of outstretched hands hold picture for a moment freddie crosses l takes girls hand business of swallowing lump in throat then big speech ah marie or whatever her name isjaneagnesangela very well ah angela has not this gone on too long a little child rebukes us angela and so on freddie must work up his own part im just giving you the general outline and we must get a good line for the child boofer lady does oo love dadda isnt definite enough we want something moreah kiss freddie thats it short crisp and has the punch  but jimmy old top i said the only objection is dont you know that theres no way of getting the girl to the cottage she cuts freddie she wouldnt come within a mile of him  jimmy frowned  thats awkward he said well we shall have to make it an exterior set instead of an interior we can easily corner her on the beach somewhere when were ready meanwhile we must get the kid letterperfect first rehearsal for lines and business eleven sharp tomorrow  poor old freddie was in such a gloomy state of mind that we decided not to tell him the idea till we had finished coaching the kid he wasnt in the mood to have a thing like that hanging over him so we concentrated on tootles and pretty early in the proceedings we saw that the only way to get tootles worked up to the spirit of the thing was to introduce sweets of some sort as a submotive so to speak  the chief difficulty said jimmy pinkerton at the end of the first rehearsal is to establish a connection in the kids mind between his line and the sweets once he has grasped the basic fact that those two words clearly spoken result automatically in aciddrops we have got a success  ive often thought dont you know how interesting it must be to be one of those animaltrainer johnnies to stimulate the dawning intelligence and that sort of thing well this was every bit as exciting some days success seemed to be staring us in the eye and the kid got the line out as if hed been an old professional and then hed go all to pieces again and time was flying  we must hurry up jimmy i said the kids uncle may arrive any day now and take him away  and we havent an understudy said jimmy theres something in that we must work my goodness that kids a bad study ive known deafmutes who would have learned the part quicker  i will say this for the kid though he was a trier failure didnt discourage him whenever there was any kind of sweet near he had a dash at his line and kept on saying something till he got what he was after his only fault was his uncertainty personally i would have been prepared to risk it and start the performance at the first opportunity but jimmy said no  were not nearly ready said jimmy today for instance he said kick freddie thats not going to win any girls heart and she might do it too no we must postpone production awhile yet  but by george we didnt the curtain went up the very next afternoon  it was nobodys faultcertainly not mine it was just fate freddie had settled down at the piano and i was leading the kid out of the house to exercise it when just as wed got out to the veranda along came the girl angela on her way to the beach the kid set up his usual yell at the sight of her and she stopped at the foot of the steps  hello baby she said good morning she said to me may i come up  she didnt wait for an answer she just came she seemed to be that sort of girl she came up on the veranda and started fussing over the kid and six feet away mind you freddie smiting the piano in the sittingroom it was a dash disturbing situation dont you know at any minute freddie might take it into his head to come out on to the veranda and we hadnt even begun to rehearse him in his part  i tried to break up the scene  we were just going down to the beach i said  yes said the girl she listened for a moment so youre having your piano tuned she said my aunt has been trying to find a tuner for ours do you mind if i go in and tell this man to come on to us when hes finished here  ernot yet i said not yet if you dont mind he cant bear to be disturbed when hes working its the artistic temperament ill tell him later  very well she said getting up to go ask him to call at pine bungalow west is the name oh he seems to have stopped i suppose he will be out in a minute now ill wait  dont you thinkshouldnt we be going on to the beach i said  she had started talking to the kid and didnt hear she was feeling in her pocket for something  the beach i babbled  see what ive brought for you baby she said and by george dont you know she held up in front of the kids bulging eyes a chunk of toffee about the size of the automobile club  that finished it we had just been having a long rehearsal and the kid was all worked up in his part he got it right first time  kiss fweddie he shouted  and the front door opened and freddie came out on to the veranda for all the world as if he had been taking a cue  he looked at the girl and the girl looked at him i looked at the ground and the kid looked at the toffee  kiss fweddie he yelled kiss fweddie  the girl was still holding up the toffee and the kid did what jimmy pinkerton would have called business of outstretched hands towards it  kiss fweddie he shrieked  what does this mean said the girl turning to me  youd better give it to him dont you know i said hell go on till you do  she gave the kid his toffee and he subsided poor old freddie still stood there gaping without a word  what does it mean said the girl again her face was pink and her eyes were sparkling in the sort of way dont you know that makes a fellow feel as if he hadnt any bones in him if you know what i mean did you ever tread on your partners dress at a dance and tear it and see her smile at you like an angel and say please dont apologize its nothing and then suddenly meet her clear blue eyes and feel as if you had stepped on the teeth of a rake and had the handle jump up and hit you in the face well thats how freddies angela looked  well she said and her teeth gave a little click  i gulped then i said it was nothing then i said it was nothing much then i said oh well it was this way and after a few brief remarks about jimmy pinkerton i told her all about it and all the while idiot freddie stood there gaping without a word  and the girl didnt speak either she just stood listening  and then she began to laugh i never heard a girl laugh so much she leaned against the side of the veranda and shrieked and all the while freddie the worlds champion chump stood there saying nothing  well i sidled towards the steps i had said all i had to say and it seemed to me that about here the stagedirection exit was written in my part i gave poor old freddie up in despair if only he had said a word it might have been all right but there he stood speechless what can a fellow do with a fellow like that  just out of sight of the house i met jimmy pinkerton  hello reggie he said i was just coming to you wheres the kid we must have a big rehearsal today  no good i said sadly its all over the things finished poor dear old freddie has made an ass of himself and killed the whole show  tell me said jimmy  i told him  fluffed in his lines did he said jimmy nodding thoughtfully its always the way with these amateurs we must go back at once things look bad but it may not be too late he said as we started even now a few wellchosen words from a man of the world and  great scot i cried look  in front of the cottage stood six children a nurse and the fellow from the grocers staring from the windows of the houses opposite projected about four hundred heads of both sexes staring down the road came galloping five more children a dog three men and a boy about to stare and on our porch as unconscious of the spectators as if they had been alone in the sahara stood freddie and angela clasped in each others arms                                       dear old freddie may have been fluffy in his lines but by george his business had certainly gone with a bang     rallying round old george   i think one of the rummiest affairs i was ever mixed up with in the course of a lifetime devoted to butting into other peoples business was that affair of george lattaker at monte carlo i wouldnt bore you dont you know for the world but i think you ought to hear about it  we had come to monte carlo on the yacht circe belonging to an old sportsman of the name of marshall among those present were myself my man voules a mrs vanderley her daughter stella mrs vanderleys maid pilbeam and george  george was a dear old pal of mine in fact it was i who had worked him into the party you see george was due to meet his uncle augustus who was scheduled george having just reached his twentyfifth birthday to hand over to him a legacy left by one of georges aunts for which he had been trustee the aunt had died when george was quite a kid it was a date that george had been looking forward to for though he had a sort of incomean income afterall is only an income whereas a chunk of o goblins is a pile georges uncle was in monte carlo and had written george that he would come to london and unbelt but it struck me that a far better plan was for george to go to his uncle at monte carlo instead kill two birds with one stone dont you know fix up his affairs and have a pleasant holiday simultaneously so george had tagged along and at the time when the trouble started we were anchored in monaco harbour and uncle augustus was due next day                                       looking back i may say that so far as i was mixed up in it the thing began at seven oclock in the morning when i was aroused from a dreamless sleep by the dickens of a scrap in progress outside my stateroom door the chief ingredients were a female voice that sobbed and said oh harold and a male voice raised in anger as they say which after considerable difficulty i identified as vouless i hardly recognized it in his official capacity voules talks exactly like youd expect a statue to talk if it could in private however he evidently relaxed to some extent and to have that sort of thing going on in my midst at that hour was too much for me  voules i yelled  spion kop ceased with a jerk there was silence then sobs diminishing in the distance and finally a tap at the door voules entered with that impressive mylordthecarriagewaits look which is what i pay him for you wouldnt have believed he had a drop of any sort of emotion in him  voules i said are you under the delusion that im going to be queen of the may youve called me early all right its only just seven  i understood you to summon me sir  i summoned you to find out why you were making that infernal noise outside  i owe you an apology sir i am afraid that in the heat of the moment i raised my voice  its a wonder you didnt raise the roof who was that with you  miss pilbeam sir mrs vanderleys maid  what was all the trouble about  i was breaking our engagement sir  i couldnt help gaping somehow one didnt associate voules with engagements then it struck me that id no right to butt in on his secret sorrows so i switched the conversation  i think ill get up i said  yes sir  i cant wait to breakfast with the rest can you get me some right away  yes sir  so i had a solitary breakfast and went up on deck to smoke it was a lovely morning blue sea gleaming casino cloudless sky and all the rest of the hippodrome presently the others began to trickle up stella vanderley was one of the first i thought she looked a bit pale and tired she said she hadnt slept well that accounted for it unless you get your eight hours where are you  seen george i asked  i couldnt help thinking the name seemed to freeze her a bit which was queer because all the voyage she and george had been particularly close pals in fact at any moment i expected george to come to me and slip his little hand in mine and whisper ive done it old scout she loves muh  i have not seen mr lattaker she said  i didnt pursue the subject georges stock was apparently low that am  the next item in the days programme occurred a few minutes later when the morning papers arrived  mrs vanderley opened hers and gave a scream  the poor dear prince she said  what a shocking thing said old marshall  i knew him in vienna said mrs vanderley he waltzed divinely  then i got at mine and saw what they were talking about the paper was full of it it seemed that late the night before his serene highness the prince of saxburgleignitz i always wonder why they call these chaps serene had been murderously assaulted in a dark street on his way back from the casino to his yacht apparently he had developed the habit of going about without an escort and some roughneck taking advantage of this had laid for him and slugged him with considerable vim the prince had been found lying pretty well beaten up and insensible in the street by a passing pedestrian and had been taken back to his yacht where he still lay unconscious  this is going to do somebody no good i said what do you get for slugging a serene highness i wonder if theyll catch the fellow  later read old marshall the pedestrian who discovered his serene highness proves to have been mr denman sturgis the eminent private investigator mr sturgis has offered his services to the police and is understood to be in possession of a most important clue thats the fellow who had charge of that kidnapping case in chicago if anyone can catch the man he can  about five minutes later just as the rest of them were going to move off to breakfast a boat hailed us and came alongside a tall thin man came up the gangway he looked round the group and fixed on old marshall as the probable owner of the yacht  good morning he said i believe you have a mr lattaker on boardmr george lattaker  yes said marshall hes down below want to see him whom shall i say  he would not know my name i should like to see him for a moment on somewhat urgent business  take a seat hell be up in a moment reggie my boy go and hurry him up  i went down to georges stateroom  george old man i shouted  no answer i opened the door and went in the room was empty whats more the bunk hadnt been slept in i dont know when ive been more surprised i went on deck  he isnt there i said  not there said old marshall where is he then perhaps hes gone for a stroll ashore but hell be back soon for breakfast youd better wait for him have you breakfasted no then will you join us  the man said he would and just then the gong went and they trooped down leaving me alone on deck  i sat smoking and thinking and then smoking a bit more when i thought i heard somebody call my name in a sort of hoarse whisper i looked over my shoulder and by jove there at the top of the gangway in evening dress dusty to the eyebrows and without a hat was dear old george  great scot i cried  sh he whispered anyone about  theyre all down at breakfast  he gave a sigh of relief sank into my chair and closed his eyes i regarded him with pity the poor old boy looked a wreck  i say i said touching him on the shoulder  he leaped out of the chair with a smothered yell  did you do that what did you do it for whats the sense of it how do you suppose you can ever make yourself popular if you go about touching people on the shoulder my nerves are sticking a yard out of my body this morning reggie  yes old boy  i did a murder last night  what  its the sort of thing that might happen to anybody directly stella vanderley broke off our engagement i  broke off your engagement how long were you engaged  about two minutes it may have been less i hadnt a stopwatch i proposed to her at ten last night in the saloon she accepted me i was just going to kiss her when we heard someone coming i went out coming along the corridor was that infernal whatshernamemrs vanderleys maidpilbeam have you ever been accepted by the girl you love reggie  never ive been refused dozens  then you wont understand how i felt i was off my head with joy i hardly knew what i was doing i just felt i had to kiss the nearest thing handy i couldnt wait it might have been the ships cat it wasnt it was pilbeam  you kissed her  i kissed her and just at that moment the door of the saloon opened and out came stella  great scott  exactly what i said it flashed across me that to stella dear girl not knowing the circumstances the thing might seem a little odd it did she broke off the engagement and i got out the dinghy and rowed off i was mad i didnt care what became of me i simply wanted to forget i went ashore iits just on the cards that i may have drowned my sorrows a bit anyhow i dont remember a thing except that i can recollect having the deuce of a scrap with somebody in a dark street and somebody falling and myself falling and myself legging it for all i was worth i woke up this morning in the casino gardens ive lost my hat  i dived for the paper  read i said its all there  he read  good heavens he said  you didnt do a thing to his serene nibs did you  reggie this is awful  cheer up they say hell recover  that doesnt matter  it does to him  he read the paper again  it says theyve a clue  they always say that  butmy hat  eh  my hat i must have dropped it during the scrap this man denman sturgis must have found it it had my name in it  george i said you mustnt waste time oh  he jumped a foot in the air  dont do it he said irritably dont bark like that whats the matter  the man  what man  a tall thin man with an eye like a gimlet he arrived just before you did hes down in the saloon now having breakfast he said he wanted to see you on business and wouldnt give his name i didnt like the look of him from the first its this fellow sturgis it must be  no  i feel it im sure of it  had he a hat  of course he had a hat  fool i mean mine was he carrying a hat  by jove he was carrying a parcel george old scout you must get a move on you must light out if you want to spend the rest of your life out of prison slugging a serene highness is l√®semajest√© its worse than hitting a policeman you havent got a moment to waste  but i havent any money reggie old man lend me a tenner or something i must get over the frontier into italy at once ill wire my uncle to meet me in  look out i cried theres someone coming  he dived out of sight just as voules came up the companionway carrying a letter on a tray  whats the matter i said what do you want  i beg your pardon sir i thought i heard mr lattakers voice a letter has arrived for him  he isnt here  no sir shall i remove the letter  no give it to me ill give it to him when he comes  very good sir  oh voules are they all still at breakfast the gentleman who came to see mr lattaker still hard at it  he is at present occupied with a kippered herring sir  ah thats all voules  thank you sir  he retired i called to george and he came out  who was it  only voules he brought a letter for you theyre all at breakfast still the sleuths eating kippers  thatll hold him for a bit full of bones he began to read his letter he gave a kind of grunt of surprise at the first paragraph  well im hanged he said as he finished  reggie this is a queer thing  whats that  he handed me the letter and directly i started in on it i saw why he had grunted this is how it ran      my dear georgei shall be seeing you tomorrow i hope but i     think it is better before we meet to prepare you for a curious     situation that has arisen in connection with the legacy which     your father inherited from your aunt emily and which you are     expecting me as trustee to hand over to you now that you have     reached your twentyfifth birthday you have doubtless heard     your father speak of your twinbrother alfred who was lost or     kidnappedwhich was never ascertainedwhen you were both     babies when no news was received of him for so many years it     was supposed that he was dead yesterday however i received a     letter purporting that he had been living all this time in buenos     ayres as the adopted son of a wealthy south american and has     only recently discovered his identity he states that he is on     his way to meet me and will arrive any day now of course like     other claimants he may prove to be an impostor but meanwhile     his intervention will i fear cause a certain delay before i can     hand over your money to you it will be necessary to go into a     thorough examination of credentials etc and this will take     some time but i will go fully into the matter with you when we     meetyour affectionate uncle                                 augustus arbutt  i read it through twice and the second time i had one of those ideas i do sometimes get though admittedly a chump of the premier class i have seldom had such a thoroughly corking brainwave  why old top i said this lets you out  lets me out of half the darned money if thats what you mean if this chaps not an imposterand theres no earthly reason to suppose he is though ive never heard my father say a word about himwe shall have to split the money aunt emilys will left the money to my father or failing him his offspring i thought that meant me but apparently there are a crowd of us i call it rotten work springing unexpected offspring on a fellow at the eleventh hour like this  why you chump i said its going to save you this lets you out of your spectacular dash across the frontier all youve got to do is to stay here and be your brother alfred it came to me in a flash  he looked at me in a kind of dazed way  you ought to be in some sort of a home reggie  ass i cried dont you understand have you ever heard of twinbrothers who werent exactly alike whos to say you arent alfred if you swear you are your uncle will be there to back you up that you have a brother alfred  and alfred will be there to call me a liar  he wont its not as if you had to keep it up for the rest of your life its only for an hour or two till we can get this detective off the yacht we sail for england tomorrow morning  at last the thing seemed to sink into him his face brightened  why i really do believe it would work he said  of course it would work if they want proof show them your mole ill swear george hadnt one  and as alfred i should get a chance of talking to stella and making things all right for george reggie old top youre a genius  no no  you are  well its only sometimes i cant keep it up  and just then there was a gentle cough behind us we spun round  what the devil are you doing here voules i said  i beg your pardon sir i have heard all  i looked at george george looked at me  voules is all right i said decent voules voules wouldnt give us away would you voules  yes sir  you would  yes sir  but voules old man i said be sensible what would you gain by it  financially sir nothing  whereas by keeping quieti tapped him on the chestby holding your tongue voules by saying nothing about it to anybody voules old fellow you might gain a considerable sum  am i to understand sir that because you are rich and i am poor you think that you can buy my selfrespect  oh come i said  how much said voules  so we switched to terms you wouldnt believe the way the man haggled youd have thought a decent faithful servant would have been delighted to oblige one in a little matter like that for a fiver but not voules by no means it was a hundred down and the promise of another hundred when we had got safely away before he was satisfied but we fixed it up at last and poor old george got down to his stateroom and changed his clothes  hed hardly gone when the breakfastparty came on deck  did you meet him i asked  meet whom said old marshall  georges twinbrother alfred  i didnt know george had a brother  nor did he till yesterday its a long story he was kidnapped in infancy and everyone thought he was dead george had a letter from his uncle about him yesterday i shouldnt wonder if thats where george has gone to see his uncle and find out about it in the meantime alfred has arrived hes down in georges stateroom now having a brushup itll amaze you the likeness between them youll think it is george at first look here he comes  and up came george brushed and clean in an ordinary yachting suit  they were rattled there was no doubt about that they stood looking at him as if they thought there was a catch somewhere but werent quite certain where it was i introduced him and still they looked doubtful  mr pepper tells me my brother is not on board said george  its an amazing likeness said old marshall  is my brother like me asked george amiably  no one could tell you apart i said  i suppose twins always are alike said george but if it ever came to a question of identification there would be one way of distinguishing us do you know george well mr pepper  hes a dear old pal of mine  youve been swimming with him perhaps  every day last august  well then you would have noticed it if he had had a mole like this on the back of his neck wouldnt you he turned his back and stooped and showed the mole his collar hid it at ordinary times i had seen it often when we were bathing together  has george a mole like that he asked  no i said oh no  you would have noticed it if he had  yes i said oh yes  im glad of that said george it would be a nuisance not to be able to prove ones own identity  that seemed to satisfy them all they couldnt get away from it it seemed to me that from now on the thing was a walkover and i think george felt the same for when old marshall asked him if he had had breakfast he said he had not went below and pitched in as if he hadnt a care in the world  everything went right till lunchtime george sat in the shade on the foredeck talking to stella most of the time when the gong went and the rest had started to go below he drew me back he was beaming  its all right he said what did i tell you  what did you tell me  why about stella didnt i say that alfred would fix things for george i told her she looked worried and got her to tell me what the trouble was and then  you must have shown a flash of speed if you got her to confide in you after knowing you for about two hours  perhaps i did said george modestly i had no notion till i became him what a persuasive sort of chap my brother alfred was anyway she told me all about it and i started in to show her that george was a pretty good sort of fellow on the whole who oughtnt to be turned down for what was evidently merely temporary insanity she saw my point  and its all right  absolutely if only we can produce george how much longer does that infernal sleuth intend to stay here he seems to have taken root  i fancy he thinks that youre bound to come back sooner or later and is waiting for you  hes an absolute nuisance said george  we were moving towards the companion way to go below for lunch when a boat hailed us we went to the side and looked over  its my uncle said george  a stout man came up the gangway  halloa george he said get my letter  i think you are mistaking me for my brother said george my name is alfred lattaker  whats that  i am georges brother alfred are you my uncle augustus  the stout man stared at him  youre very like george he said  so everyone tells me  and youre really alfred  i am  id like to talk business with you for a moment  he cocked his eye at me i sidled off and went below  at the foot of the companionsteps i met voules  i beg your pardon sir said voules if it would be convenient i should be glad to have the afternoon off  im bound to say i rather liked his manner absolutely normal not a trace of the fellowconspirator about it i gave him the afternoon off  i had lunchgeorge didnt show upand as i was going out i was waylaid by the girl pilbeam she had been crying  i beg your pardon sir but did mr voules ask you for the afternoon  i didnt see what business if was of hers but she seemed all worked up about it so i told her  yes i have given him the afternoon off  she broke downabsolutely collapsed devilish unpleasant it was im hopeless in a situation like this after id said there there which didnt seem to help much i hadnt any remarks to make  he ssaid he was going to the tables to gamble away all his savings and then shoot himself because he had nothing left to live for  i suddenly remembered the scrap in the small hours outside my stateroom door i hate mysteries i meant to get to the bottom of this i couldnt have a really firstclass valet like voules going about the place shooting himself up evidently the girl pilbeam was at the bottom of the thing i questioned her she sobbed  i questioned her more i was firm and eventually she yielded up the facts voules had seen george kiss her the night before that was the trouble  things began to piece themselves together i went up to interview george there was going to be another job for persuasive alfred vouless mind had got to be eased as stellas had been i couldnt afford to lose a fellow with his genius for preserving a trousercrease  i found george on the foredeck what is it shakespeare or somebody says about some fellows face being sicklied oer with the pale cast of care georges was like that he looked green  finished with your uncle i said  he grinned a ghostly grin  there isnt any uncle he said there isnt any alfred and there isnt any money  explain yourself old top i said  it wont take long the old crook has spent every penny of the trust money hes been at it for years ever since i was a kid when the time came to cough up and i was due to see that he did it he went to the tables in the hope of a run of luck and lost the last remnant of the stuff he had to find a way of holding me for a while and postponing the squaring of accounts while he got away and he invented this twinbrother business he knew i should find out sooner or later but meanwhile he would be able to get off to south america which he has done hes on his way now  you let him go  what could i do i cant afford to make a fuss with that man sturgis around i cant prove theres no alfred when my only chance of avoiding prison is to be alfred  well youve made things right for yourself with stella vanderley anyway i said to cheer him up  whats the good of that now ive hardly any money and no prospects how can i marry her  i pondered  it looks to me old top i said at last as if things were in a bit of a mess  youve guessed it said poor old george  i spent the afternoon musing on life if you come to think of it what a queer thing life is so unlike anything else dont you know if you see what i mean at any moment you may be strolling peacefully along and all the time lifes waiting around the corner to fetch you one you cant tell when you may be going to get it its all dashed puzzling here was poor old george as wellmeaning a fellow as ever stepped getting swatted all over the ring by the hand of fate why thats what i asked myself just life dont you know thats all there was about it  it was close on six oclock when our third visitor of the day arrived we were sitting on the afterdeck in the cool of the eveningold marshall denman sturgis mrs vanderley stella george and iwhen he came up we had been talking of george and old marshall was suggesting the advisability of sending out searchparties he was worried so was stella vanderley so for that matter were george and i only not for the same reason  we were just arguing the thing out when the visitor appeared he was a wellbuilt stiff sort of fellow he spoke with a german accent  mr marshall he said i am count fritz von c√∂slin equerry to his serene highnesshe clicked his heels together and salutedthe prince of saxburgleignitz  mrs vanderley jumped up  why count she said what ages since we met in vienna you remember  could i ever forget and the charming miss stella she is well i suppose not  stella you remember count fritz  stella shook hands with him  and how is the poor dear prince asked mrs vanderley what a terrible thing to have happened  i rejoice to say that my highborn master is better he has regained consciousness and is sitting up and taking nourishment  thats good said old marshall  in a spoon only sighed the count mr marshall with your permission i should like a word with mr sturgis  mr who  the gimleteyed sportsman came forward  i am denman sturgis at your service  the deuce you are what are you doing here  mr sturgis explained the count graciously volunteered his services  i know but whats he doing here  i am waiting for mr george lattaker mr marshall  eh  you have not found him asked the count anxiously  not yet count but i hope to do so shortly i know what he looks like now this gentleman is his twinbrother they are doubles  you are sure this gentleman is not mr george lattaker  george put his foot down firmly on the suggestion  dont go mixing me up with my brother he said i am alfred you can tell me by my mole  he exhibited the mole he was taking no risks  the count clicked his tongue regretfully  i am sorry he said  george didnt offer to console him  dont worry said sturgis he wont escape me i shall find him  do mr sturgis do and quickly find swiftly that noble young man  what shouted george  that noble young man george lattaker who at the risk of his life saved my highborn master from the assassin  george sat down suddenly  i dont understand he said feebly  we were wrong mr sturgis went on the count we leaped to the conclusionwas it not sothat the owner of the hat you found was also the assailant of my highborn master we were wrong i have heard the story from his serene highnesss own lips he was passing down a dark street when a ruffian in a mask sprang out upon him doubtless he had been followed from the casino where he had been winning heavily my highborn master was taken by surprise he was felled but before he lost consciousness he perceived a young man in evening dress wearing the hat you found running swiftly towards him the hero engaged the assassin in combat and my highborn master remembers no more his serene highness asks repeatedly where is my brave preserver his gratitude is princely he seeks for this young man to reward him ah you should be proud of your brother sir  thanks said george limply  and you mr sturgis you must redouble your efforts you must search the land you must scour the sea to find george lattaker  he neednt take all that trouble said a voice from the gangway  it was voules his face was flushed his hat was on the back of his head and he was smoking a fat cigar  ill tell you where to find george lattaker he shouted  he glared at george who was staring at him  yes look at me he yelled look at me you wont be the first this afternoon whos stared at the mysterious stranger who won for two hours without a break ill be even with you now mr blooming lattaker ill learn you to break a poor mans heart mr marshall and gents this morning i was on deck and i overeard im plotting to put up a game on you theyd spotted that gent there as a detective and they arranged that blooming lattaker was to pass himself off as his own twinbrother and if you wanted proof blooming pepper tells him to show them his mole and hed swear george hadnt one those were his very words that man there is george lattaker hesquire and let him deny it if he can  george got up  i havent the least desire to deny it voules  mr voules if you please  its true said george turning to the count the fact is i had rather a foggy recollection of what happened last night i only remembered knocking some one down and like you i jumped to the conclusion that i must have assaulted his serene highness  then you are really george lattaker asked the count  i am  ere what does all this mean demanded voules  merely that i saved the life of his serene highness the prince of saxburgleignitz mr voules  its a swindle began voules when there was a sudden rush and the girl pilbeam cannoned into the crowd sending me into old marshalls chair and flung herself into the arms of voules  oh harold she cried i thought you were dead i thought youd shot yourself  he sort of braced himself together to fling her off and then he seemed to think better of it and fell into the clinch  it was all dashed romantic dont you know but there are limits  voules youre sacked i said  who cares he said think i was going to stop on now im a gentleman of property come along emma my dear give a months notice and get your at and ill take you to dinner at ciros  and you mr lattaker said the count may i conduct you to the presence of my highborn master he wishes to show his gratitude to his preserver  you may said george may i have my hat mr sturgis  theres just one bit more after dinner that night i came up for a smoke and strolling on to the foredeck almost bumped into george and stella they seemed to be having an argument  im not sure she was saying that i believe that a man can be so happy that he wants to kiss the nearest thing in sight as you put it  dont you said george well as it happens im feeling just that way now  i coughed and he turned round  halloa reggie he said  halloa george i said lovely night  beautiful said stella  the moon i said  ripping said george  lovely said stella  and look at the reflection of the stars on the  george caught my eye pop off he said  i popped     doing clarence a bit of good   have you ever thought aboutand when i say thought about i mean really carefully considered the question ofthe coolness the cheek or if you prefer it the gall with which woman as a sex fairly bursts i have by jove but then ive had it thrust on my notice by george in a way i should imagine has happened to pretty few fellows and the limit was reached by that business of the yeardsley venus  to make you understand the full whatdyoucallit of the situation i shall have to explain just how matters stood between mrs yeardsley and myself  when i first knew her she was elizabeth shoolbred old worcestershire family pots of money pretty as a picture her brother bill was at oxford with me  i loved elizabeth shoolbred i loved her dont you know and there was a time for about a week when we were engaged to be married but just as i was beginning to take a serious view of life and study furniture catalogues and feel pretty solemn when the restaurant orchestra played the wedding glide im hanged if she didnt break it off and a month later she was married to a fellow of the name of yeardsleyclarence yeardsley an artist  what with golf and billiards and a bit of racing and fellows at the club rallying round and kind of taking me out of myself as it were i got over it and came to look on the affair as a closed page in the book of my life if you know what i mean it didnt seem likely to me that we should meet again as she and clarence had settled down in the country somewhere and never came to london and im bound to own that by the time i got her letter the wound had pretty well healed and i was to a certain extent sitting up and taking nourishment in fact to be absolutely honest i was jolly thankful the thing had ended as it had done  this letter im telling you about arrived one morning out of a blue sky as it were it ran like this      my dear old reggiewhat ages it seems since i saw anything of     you how are you we have settled down here in the most perfect old     house with a lovely garden in the middle of delightful country     couldnt you run down here for a few days clarence and i would be     so glad to see you bill is here and is most anxious to meet you     again he was speaking of you only this morning do come     wire your train and i will send the car to meet you     yours most sincerely                                elizabeth yeardsley      pswe can give you new milk and fresh eggs think of that      ppsbill says our billiardtable is one of the best he has     ever played on      ppsswe are only half a mile from a golf course bill says     it is better than st andrews      ppsssyou must come  well a fellow comes down to breakfast one morning with a bit of a head on and finds a letter like that from a girl who might quite easily have blighted his life it rattled me rather i must confess  however that bit about the golf settled me i knew bill knew what he was talking about and if he said the course was so topping it must be something special so i went  old bill met me at the station with the car i hadnt come across him for some months and i was glad to see him again and he apparently was glad to see me  thank goodness youve come he said as we drove off i was just about at my last grip  whats the trouble old scout i asked  if i had the artistic whatsitsname he went on if the mere mention of pictures didnt give me the pip i dare say it wouldnt be so bad as it is its rotten  pictures  pictures nothing else is mentioned in this household clarence is an artist so is his father and you know yourself what elizabeth is like when one gives her her head  i remembered thenit hadnt come back to me beforethat most of my time with elizabeth had been spent in picturegalleries during the period when i had let her do just what she wanted to do with me i had had to follow her like a dog through gallery after gallery though pictures are poison to me just as they are to old bill somehow it had never struck me that she would still be going on in this way after marrying an artist i should have thought that by this time the mere sight of a picture would have fed her up not so however according to old bill  they talk pictures at every meal he said i tell you it makes a chap feel out of it how long are you down for  a few days  take my tip and let me send you a wire from london i go there tomorrow i promised to play against the scottish the idea was that i was to come back after the match but you couldnt get me back with a lasso  i tried to point out the silver lining  but bill old scout your sister says theres a most corking links near here  he turned and stared at me and nearly ran us into the bank  you dont mean honestly she said that  she said you said it was better than st andrews  so i did was that all she said i said  well wasnt it enough  she didnt happen to mention that i added the words i dont think  no she forgot to tell me that  its the worst course in great britain  i felt rather stunned dont you know whether its a bad habit to have got into or not i cant say but i simply cant do without my daily allowance of golf when im not in london  i took another whirl at the silver lining  well have to take it out in billiards i said im glad the tables good  it depends what you call good its halfsize and theres a seveninch cut just out of baulk where clarences cue slipped elizabeth has mended it with pink silk very smart and dressy it looks but it doesnt improve the thing as a billiardtable  but she said you said  must have been pulling your leg  we turned in at the drive gates of a goodsized house standing well back from the road it looked black and sinister in the dusk and i couldnt help feeling you know like one of those johnnies you read about in stories who are lured to lonely houses for rummy purposes and hear a shriek just as they get there elizabeth knew me well enough to know that a specially good golf course was a safe draw to me and she had deliberately played on her knowledge what was the game that was what i wanted to know and then a sudden thought struck me which brought me out in a cold perspiration she had some girl down here and was going to have a stab at marrying me off ive often heard that young married women are all over that sort of thing certainly she had said there was nobody at the house but clarence and herself and bill and clarences father but a woman who could take the name of st andrews in vain as she had done wouldnt be likely to stick at a trifle  bill old scout i said there arent any frightful girls or any rot of that sort stopping here are there  wish there were he said no such luck  as we pulled up at the front door it opened and a womans figure appeared  have you got him bill she said which in my present frame of mind struck me as a jolly creepy way of putting it the sort of thing lady macbeth might have said to macbeth dont you know  do you mean me i said  she came down into the light it was elizabeth looking just the same as in the old days  is that you reggie im so glad you were able to come i was afraid you might have forgotten all about it you know what you are come along in and have some tea                                       have you ever been turned down by a girl who afterwards married and then been introduced to her husband if so youll understand how i felt when clarence burst on me you know the feeling first of all when you hear about the marriage you say to yourself i wonder what hes like then you meet him and think there must be some mistake she cant have preferred this to me thats what i thought when i set eyes on clarence  he was a little thin nervouslooking chappie of about thirtyfive his hair was getting grey at the temples and straggly on top he wore pincenez and he had a drooping moustache im no bombardier wells myself but in front of clarence i felt quite a nut and elizabeth mind you is one of those tall splendid girls who look like princesses honestly i believe women do it out of pure cussedness  how do you do mr pepper hark can you hear a mewing cat said clarence all in one breath dont you know  eh i said  a mewing cat i feel sure i hear a mewing cat listen  while we were listening the door opened and a whitehaired old gentleman came in he was built on the same lines as clarence but was an earlier model i took him correctly to be mr yeardsley senior elizabeth introduced us  father said clarence did you meet a mewing cat outside i feel positive i heard a cat mewing  no said the father shaking his head no mewing cat  i cant bear mewing cats said clarence a mewing cat gets on my nerves  a mewing cat is so trying said elizabeth  i dislike mewing cats said old mr yeardsley  that was all about mewing cats for the moment they seemed to think they had covered the ground satisfactorily and they went back to pictures  we talked pictures steadily till it was time to dress for dinner at least they did i just sort of sat around presently the subject of picturerobberies came up somebody mentioned the monna lisa and then i happened to remember seeing something in the evening paper as i was coming down in the train about some fellow somewhere having had a valuable painting pinched by burglars the night before it was the first time i had had a chance of breaking into the conversation with any effect and i meant to make the most of it the paper was in the pocket of my overcoat in the hall i went and fetched it  here it is i said a romney belonging to sir bellamy palmer  they all shouted what exactly at the same time like a chorus elizabeth grabbed the paper  let me look yes late last night burglars entered the residence of sir bellamy palmer dryden park midford hants  why thats near here i said i passed through midford  dryden park is only two miles from this house said elizabeth i noticed her eyes were sparkling  only two miles she said it might have been us it might have been the venus  old mr yeardsley bounded in his chair  the venus he cried  they all seemed wonderfully excited my little contribution to the evenings chat had made quite a hit  why i didnt notice it before i dont know but it was not till elizabeth showed it to me after dinner that i had my first look at the yeardsley venus when she led me up to it and switched on the light it seemed impossible that i could have sat right through dinner without noticing it but then at meals my attention is pretty well riveted on the foodstuffs anyway it was not till elizabeth showed it to me that i was aware of its existence  she and i were alone in the drawingroom after dinner old yeardsley was writing letters in the morningroom while bill and clarence were rollicking on the halfsize billiard table with the pink silk tapestry effects all in fact was joy jollity and song so to speak when elizabeth who had been sitting wrapped in thought for a bit bent towards me and said reggie  and the moment she said it i knew something was going to happen you know that prewhatdyoucallit you get sometimes well i got it then  whato i said nervously  reggie she said i want to ask a great favour of you  yes  she stooped down and put a log on the fire and went on with her back to me  do you remember reggie once saying you would do anything in the world for me  there thats what i meant when i said that about the cheek of woman as a sex what i mean is after what had happened youd have thought she would have preferred to let the dead past bury its dead and all that sort of thing what  mind you i had said i would do anything in the world for her i admit that but it was a distinctly preclarence remark he hadnt appeared on the scene then and it stands to reason that a fellow who may have been a perfect knighterrant to a girl when he was engaged to her doesnt feel nearly so keen on spreading himself in that direction when she has given him the missinbaulk and gone and married a man who reason and instinct both tell him is a decided blighter  i couldnt think of anything to say but oh yes  theres something you can do for me now which will make me everlastingly grateful  yes i said  do you know reggie she said suddenly that only a few months ago clarence was very fond of cats  eh well he still seemserinterested in them what  now they get on his nerves everything gets on his nerves  some fellows swear by that stuff you see advertised all over the  no that wouldnt help him he doesnt need to take anything he wants to get rid of something  i dont quite fellow get rid of something  the venus said elizabeth  she looked up and caught my bulging eye  you saw the venus she said  not that i remember  well come into the diningroom  we went into the diningroom and she switched on the lights  there she said  on the wall close to the doorthat may have been why i hadnt noticed it before i had sat with my back to itwas a large oilpainting it was what youd call a classical picture i suppose what i mean iswell you know what i mean all i can say is that its funny i hadnt noticed it  is that the venus i said  she nodded  how would you like to have to look at that every time you sat down to a meal  well i dont know i dont think it would affect me much id worry through all right  she jerked her head impatiently  but youre not an artist she said clarence is  and then i began to see daylight what exactly was the trouble i didnt understand but it was evidently something to do with the good old artistic temperament and i could believe anything about that it explains everything its like the unwritten law dont you know which you plead in america if youve done anything they want to send you to chokey for and you dont want to go what i mean is if youre absolutely off your rocker but dont find it convenient to be scooped into the lunybin you simply explain that when you said you were a teapot it was just your artistic temperament and they apologize and go away so i stood by to hear just how the at had affected clarence the cats friend ready for anything  and believe me it had hit clarence badly  it was this way it seemed that old yeardsley was an amateur artist and that this venus was his masterpiece he said so and he ought to have known well when clarence married he had given it to him as a wedding present and had hung it where it stood with his own hands all right so far what but mark the sequel temperamental clarence being a professional artist and consequently some streets ahead of the dad at the game saw flaws in the venus he couldnt stand it at any price he didnt like the drawing he didnt like the expression of the face he didnt like the colouring in fact it made him feel quite ill to look at it yet being devoted to his father and wanting to do anything rather than give him pain he had not been able to bring himself to store the thing in the cellar and the strain of confronting the picture three times a day had begun to tell on him to such an extent that elizabeth felt something had to be done  now you see she said  in a way i said but dont you think its making rather heavy weather over a trifle  oh cant you understand look her voice dropped as if she was in church and she switched on another light it shone on the picture next to old yeardsleys there she said clarence painted that  she looked at me expectantly as if she were waiting for me to swoon or yell or something i took a steady look at clarences effort it was another classical picture it seemed to me very much like the other one  some sort of art criticism was evidently expected of me so i made a dash at it  ervenus i said  mark you sherlock holmes would have made the same mistake on the evidence i mean  no jocund spring she snapped she switched off the light i see you dont understand even now you never had any taste about pictures when we used to go to the galleries together you would far rather have been at your club  this was so absolutely true that i had no remark to make she came up to me and put her hand on my arm  im sorry reggie i didnt mean to be cross only i do want to make you understand that clarence is suffering supposesupposewell let us take the case of a great musician suppose a great musician had to sit and listen to a cheap vulgar tunethe same tuneday after day day after day wouldnt you expect his nerves to break well its just like that with clarence now you see  yes but  but what surely ive put it plainly enough  yes but what i mean is where do i come in what do you want me to do  i want you to steal the venus  i looked at her  you want me to  steal it reggie her eyes were shining with excitement dont you see its providence when i asked you to come here i had just got the idea i knew i could rely on you and then by a miracle this robbery of the romney takes place at a house not two miles away it removes the last chance of the poor old man suspecting anything and having his feelings hurt why its the most wonderful compliment to him think one night thieves steal a splendid romney the next the same gang take his venus it will be the proudest moment of his life do it tonight reggie ill give you a sharp knife you simply cut the canvas out of the frame and its done  but one moment i said id be delighted to be of any use to you but in a purely family affair like this wouldnt it be betterin fact how about tackling old bill on the subject  i have asked bill already yesterday he refused  but if im caught  you cant be all you have to do is to take the picture open one of the windows leave it open and go back to your room  it sounded simple enough  and as to the picture itselfwhen ive got it  burn it ill see that you have a good fire in your room  but  she looked at me she always did have the most wonderful eyes  reggie she said nothing more just reggie  she looked at me  well after all if you see what i meanthe days that are no more dont you know auld lang syne and all that sort of thing you follow me  all right i said ill do it  i dont know if you happen to be one of those johnnies who are steeped in crime and so forth and think nothing of pinching diamond necklaces if youre not youll understand that i felt a lot less keen on the job id taken on when i sat in my room waiting to get busy than i had done when i promised to tackle it in the diningroom on paper it all seemed easy enough but i couldnt help feeling there was a catch somewhere and ive never known time pass slower the kickoff was scheduled for one oclock in the morning when the household might be expected to be pretty sound asleep but at a quarter to i couldnt stand it any longer i lit the lantern i had taken from bills bicycle took a grip of my knife and slunk downstairs  the first thing i did on getting to the diningroom was to open the window i had half a mind to smash it so as to give an extra bit of local colour to the affair but decided not to on account of the noise i had put my lantern on the table and was just reaching out for it when something happened what it was for the moment i couldnt have said it might have been an explosion of some sort or an earthquake some solid object caught me a frightful whack on the chin sparks and things occurred inside my head and the next thing i remember is feeling something wet and cold splash into my face and hearing a voice that sounded like old bills say feeling better now  i sat up the lights were on and i was on the floor with old bill kneeling beside me with a soda siphon  what happened i said  im awfully sorry old man he said i hadnt a notion it was you i came in here and saw a lantern on the table and the window open and a chap with a knife in his hand so i didnt stop to make inquiries i just let go at his jaw for all i was worth what on earth do you think youre doing were you walking in your sleep  it was elizabeth i said why you know all about it she said she had told you  you dont mean  the picture you refused to take it on so she asked me  reggie old man he said ill never believe what they say about repentance again its a fools trick and upsets everything if i hadnt repented and thought it was rather rough on elizabeth not to do a little thing like that for her and come down here to do it after all you wouldnt have stopped that sleepproducer with your chin im sorry  me too i said giving my head another shake to make certain it was still on  are you feeling better now  better than i was but thats not saying much  would you like some more sodawater no well how about getting this job finished and going to bed and lets be quick about it too you made a noise like a ton of bricks when you went down just now and its on the cards some of the servants may have heard toss you who carves  heads  tails it is he said uncovering the coin up you get ill hold the light dont spike yourself on that sword of yours  it was as easy a job as elizabeth had said just four quick cuts and the thing came out of its frame like an oyster i rolled it up old bill had put the lantern on the floor and was at the sideboard collecting whisky soda and glasses  weve got a long evening before us he said you cant burn a picture of that size in one chunk youd set the chimney on fire lets do the thing comfortably clarence cant grudge us the stuff weve done him a bit of good this trip tomorrowll be the maddest merriest day of clarences glad new year on we go  we went up to my room and sat smoking and yarning away and sipping our drinks and every now and then cutting a slice off the picture and shoving it in the fire till it was all gone and what with the cosiness of it and the cheerful blaze and the comfortable feeling of doing good by stealth i dont know when ive had a jollier time since the days when we used to brew in my study at school  we had just put the last slice on when bill sat up suddenly and gripped my arm  i heard something he said  i listened and by jove i heard something too my room was just over the diningroom and the sound came up to us quite distinctly stealthy footsteps by george and then a chair falling over  theres somebody in the diningroom i whispered  theres a certain type of chap who takes a pleasure in positively chivvying trouble old bills like that if i had been alone it would have taken me about three seconds to persuade myself that i hadnt really heard anything after all im a peaceful sort of cove and believe in living and letting live and so forth to old bill however a visit from burglars was pure jam he was out of his chair in one jump  come on he said bring the poker  i brought the tongs as well i felt like it old bill collared the knife we crept downstairs  well fling the door open and make a rush said bill  supposing they shoot old scout  burglars never shoot said bill  which was comforting provided the burglars knew it  old bill took a grip of the handle turned it quickly and in he went and then we pulled up sharp staring  the room was in darkness except for a feeble splash of light at the near end standing on a chair in front of clarences jocund spring holding a candle in one hand and reaching up with a knife in the other was old mr yeardsley in bedroom slippers and a grey dressinggown he had made a final cut just as we rushed in turning at the sound he stopped and he and the chair and the candle and the picture came down in a heap together the candle went out  what on earth said bill  i felt the same i picked up the candle and lit it and then a most fearful thing happened the old man picked himself up and suddenly collapsed into a chair and began to cry like a child of course i could see it was only the artistic temperament but still believe me it was devilish unpleasant i looked at old bill old bill looked at me we shut the door quick and after that we didnt know what to do i saw bill look at the sideboard and i knew what he was looking for but we had taken the siphon upstairs and his ideas of firstaid stopped short at squirting sodawater we just waited and presently old yeardsley switched off sat up and began talking with a rush  clarence my boy i was tempted it was that burglary at dryden park it tempted me it made it all so simple i knew you would put it down to the same gang clarence my boy i  it seemed to dawn upon him at this point that clarence was not among those present  clarence he said hesitatingly  hes in bed i said  in bed then he doesnt know even nowyoung men i throw myself on your mercy dont be hard on me listen he grabbed at bill who sidestepped i can explain everythingeverything  he gave a gulp  you are not artists you two young men but i will try to make you understand make you realise what this picture means to me i was two years painting it it is my child i watched it grow i loved it it was part of my life nothing would have induced me to sell it and then clarence married and in a mad moment i gave my treasure to him you cannot understand you two young men what agonies i suffered the thing was done it was irrevocable i saw how clarence valued the picture i knew that i could never bring myself to ask him for it back and yet i was lost without it what could i do till this evening i could see no hope then came this story of the theft of the romney from a house quite close to this and i saw my way clarence would never suspect he would put the robbery down to the same band of criminals who stole the romney once the idea had come i could not drive it out i fought against it but to no avail at last i yielded and crept down here to carry out my plan you found me he grabbed again at me this time and got me by the arm he had a grip like a lobster young man he said you would not betray me you would not tell clarence  i was feeling most frightfully sorry for the poor old chap by this time dont you know but i thought it would be kindest to give it him straight instead of breaking it by degrees  i wont say a word to clarence mr yeardsley i said i quite understand your feelings the artistic temperament and all that sort of thing i meanwhat i know but im afraidwell look  i went to the door and switched on the electric light and there staring him in the face were the two empty frames he stood goggling at them in silence then he gave a sort of wheezy grunt  the gang the burglars they have been here and they have taken clarences picture he paused it might have been mine my venus he whispered it was getting most fearfully painful you know but he had to know the truth  im awfully sorry you know i said but it was  he started poor old chap  eh what do you mean  they did take your venus  but i have it here  i shook my head  thats clarences jocund spring i said  he jumped at it and straightened it out  what what are you talking about do you think i dont know my own picturemy childmy venus see my own signature in the corner can you read boy look matthew yeardsley this is my picture  andwell by jove it was dont you know                                       well we got him off to bed him and his infernal venus and we settled down to take a steady look at the position of affairs bill said it was my fault for getting hold of the wrong picture and i said it was bills fault for fetching me such a crack on the jaw that i couldnt be expected to see what i was getting hold of and then there was a pretty massive silence for a bit  reggie said bill at last how exactly do you feel about facing clarence and elizabeth at breakfast  old scout i said i was thinking much the same myself  reggie said bill i happen to know theres a milktrain leaving midford at threefifteen it isnt what youd call a flier it gets to london at about halfpast nine wellerin the circumstances how about it     the aunt and the sluggard   now that its all over i may as well admit that there was a time during the rather funny affair of rockmetteller todd when i thought that jeeves was going to let me down the man had the appearance of being baffled  jeeves is my man you know officially he pulls in his weekly wages for pressing my clothes and all that sort of thing but actually hes more like what the poet johnnie called some bird of his acquaintance who was apt to rally round him in times of needa guide dont you know philosopher if i remember rightly andi rather fancyfriend i rely on him at every turn  so naturally when rocky todd told me about his aunt i didnt hesitate jeeves was in on the thing from the start  the affair of rocky todd broke loose early one morning of spring i was in bed restoring the good old tissues with about nine hours of the dreamless when the door flew open and somebody prodded me in the lower ribs and began to shake the bedclothes after blinking a bit and generally pulling myself together i located rocky and my first impression was that it was some horrid dream  rocky you see lived down on long island somewhere miles away from new york and not only that but he had told me himself more than once that he never got up before twelve and seldom earlier than one constitutionally the laziest young devil in america he had hit on a walk in life which enabled him to go the limit in that direction he was a poet at least he wrote poems when he did anything but most of his time as far as i could make out he spent in a sort of trance he told me once that he could sit on a fence watching a worm and wondering what on earth it was up to for hours at a stretch  he had his scheme of life worked out to a fine point about once a month he would take three days writing a few poems the other three hundred and twentynine days of the year he rested i didnt know there was enough money in poetry to support a chappie even in the way in which rocky lived but it seems that if you stick to exhortations to young men to lead the strenuous life and dont shove in any rhymes american editors fight for the stuff rocky showed me one of his things once it began      be     be       the past is dead       tomorrow is not born         be today     today       be with every nerve         with every muscle         with every drop of your red blood     be  it was printed opposite the frontispiece of a magazine with a sort of scroll round it and a picture in the middle of a fairlynude chappie with bulging muscles giving the rising sun the glad eye rocky said they gave him a hundred dollars for it and he stayed in bed till four in the afternoon for over a month  as regarded the future he was pretty solid owing to the fact that he had a moneyed aunt tucked away somewhere in illinois and as he had been named rockmetteller after her and was her only nephew his position was pretty sound he told me that when he did come into the money he meant to do no work at all except perhaps an occasional poem recommending the young man with life opening out before him with all its splendid possibilities to light a pipe and shove his feet upon the mantelpiece  and this was the man who was prodding me in the ribs in the grey dawn  read this bertie i could just see that he was waving a letter or something equally foul in my face wake up and read this  i cant read before ive had my morning tea and a cigarette i groped for the bell  jeeves came in looking as fresh as a dewy violet its a mystery to me how he does it  tea jeeves  very good sir  he flowed silently out of the roomhe always gives you the impression of being some liquid substance when he moves and i found that rocky was surging round with his beastly letter again  what is it i said what on earths the matter  read it  i cant i havent had my tea  well listen then  whos it from  my aunt  at this point i fell asleep again i woke to hear him saying  so what on earth am i to do  jeeves trickled in with the tray like some silent stream meandering over its mossy bed and i saw daylight  read it again rocky old top i said i want jeeves to hear it mr todds aunt has written him a rather rummy letter jeeves and we want your advice  very good sir  he stood in the middle of the room registering devotion to the cause and rocky started again      my dear rockmettelleri have been thinking things over for a     long while and i have come to the conclusion that i have been     very thoughtless to wait so long before doing what i have made     up my mind to do now  what do you make of that jeeves  it seems a little obscure at present sir but no doubt it becomes cleared at a later point in the communication  it becomes as clear as mud said rocky  proceed old scout i said champing my bread and butter      you know how all my life i have longed to visit new york and see     for myself the wonderful gay life of which i have read so much i     fear that now it will be impossible for me to fulfil my dream i     am old and worn out i seem to have no strength left in me  sad jeeves what  extremely sir  sad nothing said rocky its sheer laziness i went to see her last christmas and she was bursting with health her doctor told me himself that there was nothing wrong with her whatever but she will insist that shes a hopeless invalid so he has to agree with her shes got a fixed idea that the trip to new york would kill her so though its been her ambition all her life to come here she stays where she is  rather like the chappie whose heart was in the highlands achasing of the deer jeeves  the cases are in some respects parallel sir  carry on rocky dear boy      so i have decided that if i cannot enjoy all the marvels of the     city myself i can at least enjoy them through you i suddenly     thought of this yesterday after reading a beautiful poem in the     sunday paper about a young man who had longed all his life for a     certain thing and won it in the end only when he was too old to     enjoy it it was very sad and it touched me  a thing interpolated rocky bitterly that ive not been able to do in ten years      as you know you will have my money when i am gone but until now     i have never been able to see my way to giving you an allowance i     have now decided to do soon one condition i have written to a     firm of lawyers in new york giving them instructions to pay you     quite a substantial sum each month my one condition is that you     live in new york and enjoy yourself as i have always wished to do     i want you to be my representative to spend this money for me as     i should do myself i want you to plunge into the gay prismatic     life of new york i want you to be the life and soul of brilliant     supper parties      above all i want youindeed i insist on thisto write me     letters at least once a week giving me a full description of all     you are doing and all that is going on in the city so that i may     enjoy at secondhand what my wretched health prevents my enjoying     for myself remember that i shall expect full details and that no     detail is too trivial to interestyour affectionate aunt                                         isabel rockmetteller  what about it said rocky  what about it i said  yes what on earth am i going to do  it was only then that i really got on to the extremely rummy attitude of the chappie in view of the fact that a quite unexpected mess of the right stuff had suddenly descended on him from a blue sky to my mind it was an occasion for the beaming smile and the joyous whoop yet here the man was looking and talking as if fate had swung on his solar plexus it amazed me  arent you bucked i said  bucked  if i were in your place i should be frightfully braced i consider this pretty soft for you  he gave a kind of yelp stared at me for a moment and then began to talk of new york in a way that reminded me of jimmy mundy the reformer chappie jimmy had just come to new york on a hitthetrail campaign and i had popped in at the garden a couple of days before for half an hour or so to hear him he had certainly told new york some pretty straight things about itself having apparently taken a dislike to the place but by jove you know dear old rocky made him look like a publicity agent for the old metrop  pretty soft he cried to have to come and live in new york to have to leave my little cottage and take a stuffy smelly overheated hole of an apartment in this heavenforsaken festering gehenna to have to mix night after night with a mob who think that life is a sort of st vituss dance and imagine that theyre having a good time because theyre making enough noise for six and drinking too much for ten i loathe new york bertie i wouldnt come near the place if i hadnt got to see editors occasionally theres a blight on it its got moral delirium tremens its the limit the very thought of staying more than a day in it makes me sick and you call this thing pretty soft for me  i felt rather like lots friends must have done when they dropped in for a quiet chat and their genial host began to criticise the cities of the plain i had no idea old rocky could be so eloquent  it would kill me to have to live in new york he went on to have to share the air with six million people to have to wear stiff collars and decent clothes all the time to he started good lord i suppose i should have to dress for dinner in the evenings what a ghastly notion  i was shocked absolutely shocked  my dear chap i said reproachfully  do you dress for dinner every night bertie  jeeves i said coldly the man was still standing like a statue by the door how many suits of evening clothes have i  we have three suits full of evening dress sir two dinner jackets  three  for practical purposes two only sir if you remember we cannot wear the third we have also seven white waistcoats  and shirts  four dozen sir  and white ties  the first two shallow shelves in the chest of drawers are completely filled with our white ties sir  i turned to rocky  you see  the chappie writhed like an electric fan  i wont do it i cant do it ill be hanged if ill do it how on earth can i dress up like that do you realize that most days i dont get out of my pyjamas till five in the afternoon and then i just put on an old sweater  i saw jeeves wince poor chap this sort of revelation shocked his finest feelings  then what are you going to do about it i said  thats what i want to know  you might write and explain to your aunt  i mightif i wanted her to get round to her lawyers in two rapid leaps and cut me out of her will  i saw his point  what do you suggest jeeves i said  jeeves cleared his throat respectfully  the crux of the matter would appear to be sir that mr todd is obliged by the conditions under which the money is delivered into his possession to write miss rockmetteller long and detailed letters relating to his movements and the only method by which this can be accomplished if mr todd adheres to his expressed intention of remaining in the country is for mr todd to induce some second party to gather the actual experiences which miss rockmetteller wishes reported to her and to convey these to him in the shape of a careful report on which it would be possible for him with the aid of his imagination to base the suggested correspondence  having got which off the old diaphragm jeeves was silent rocky looked at me in a helpless sort of way he hasnt been brought up on jeeves as i have and he isnt on to his curves  could he put it a little clearer bertie he said i thought at the start it was going to make sense but it kind of flickered whats the idea  my dear old man perfectly simple i knew we could stand on jeeves all youve got to do is to get somebody to go round the town for you and take a few notes and then you work the notes up into letters thats it isnt it jeeves  precisely sir  the light of hope gleamed in rockys eyes he looked at jeeves in a startled way dazed by the mans vast intellect  but who would do it he said it would have to be a pretty smart sort of man a man who would notice things  jeeves i said let jeeves do it  but would he  you would do it wouldnt you jeeves  for the first time in our long connection i observed jeeves almost smile the corner of his mouth curved quite a quarter of an inch and for a moment his eye ceased to look like a meditative fishs  i should be delighted to oblige sir as a matter of fact i have already visited some of new yorks places of interest on my evening out and it would be most enjoyable to make a practice of the pursuit  fine i know exactly what your aunt wants to hear about rocky she wants an earful of cabaret stuff the place you ought to go to first jeeves is reigelheimers its on fortysecond street anybody will show you the way  jeeves shook his head  pardon me sir people are no longer going to reigelheimers the place at the moment is frolics on the roof  you see i said to rocky leave it to jeeves he knows  it isnt often that you find an entire group of your fellowhumans happy in this world but our little circle was certainly an example of the fact that it can be done we were all full of beans everything went absolutely right from the start  jeeves was happy partly because he loves to exercise his giant brain and partly because he was having a corking time among the bright lights i saw him one night at the midnight revels he was sitting at a table on the edge of the dancing floor doing himself remarkably well with a fat cigar and a bottle of the best id never imagined he could look so nearly human his face wore an expression of austere benevolence and he was making notes in a small book  as for the rest of us i was feeling pretty good because i was fond of old rocky and glad to be able to do him a good turn rocky was perfectly contented because he was still able to sit on fences in his pyjamas and watch worms and as for the aunt she seemed tickled to death she was getting broadway at pretty long range but it seemed to be hitting her just right i read one of her letters to rocky and it was full of life  but then rockys letters based on jeevess notes were enough to buck anybody up it was rummy when you came to think of it there was i loving the life while the mere mention of it gave rocky a tired feeling yet here is a letter i wrote to a pal of mine in london      dear freddiewell here i am in new york its not a bad place     im not having a bad time everythings pretty all right the     cabarets arent bad dont know when i shall be back hows     everybody cheeroyours                                  bertie      psseen old ted lately  not that i cared about ted but if i hadnt dragged him in i couldnt have got the confounded thing on to the second page  now heres old rocky on exactly the same subject      dearest aunt isabelhow can i ever thank you enough for giving     me the opportunity to live in this astounding city new york seems     more wonderful every day      fifth avenue is at its best of course just now the dresses are     magnificent  wads of stuff about the dresses i didnt know jeeves was such an authority      i was out with some of the crowd at the midnight revels the other     night we took in a show first after a little dinner at a new     place on fortythird street we were quite a gay party georgie     cohan looked in about midnight and got off a good one about willie     collier fred stone could only stay a minute but doug fairbanks     did all sorts of stunts and made us roar diamond jim brady was     there as usual and laurette taylor showed up with a party the     show at the revels is quite good i am enclosing a programme      last night a few of us went round to frolics on the roof  and so on and so forth yards of it i suppose its the artistic temperament or something what i mean is its easier for a chappie whos used to writing poems and that sort of tosh to put a bit of a punch into a letter than it is for a chappie like me anyway theres no doubt that rockys correspondence was hot stuff i called jeeves in and congratulated him  jeeves youre a wonder  thank you sir  how you notice everything at these places beats me i couldnt tell you a thing about them except that ive had a good time  its just a knack sir  well mr todds letters ought to brace miss rockmetteller all right what  undoubtedly sir agreed jeeves  and by jove they did they certainly did by george what i mean to say is i was sitting in the apartment one afternoon about a month after the thing had started smoking a cigarette and resting the old bean when the door opened and the voice of jeeves burst the silence like a bomb  it wasnt that he spoke loud he has one of those soft soothing voices that slide through the atmosphere like the note of a faroff sheep it was what he said made me leap like a young gazelle  miss rockmetteller  and in came a large solid female  the situation floored me im not denying it hamlet must have felt much as i did when his fathers ghost bobbed up in the fairway id come to look on rockys aunt as such a permanency at her own home that it didnt seem possible that she could really be here in new york i stared at her then i looked at jeeves he was standing there in an attitude of dignified detachment the chump when if ever he should have been rallying round the young master it was now  rockys aunt looked less like an invalid than any one ive ever seen except my aunt agatha she had a good deal of aunt agatha about her as a matter of fact she looked as if she might be deucedly dangerous if put upon and something seemed to tell me that she would certainly regard herself as put upon if she ever found out the game which poor old rocky had been pulling on her  good afternoon i managed to say  how do you do she said mr cohan  erno  mr fred stone  not absolutely as a matter of fact my names woosterbertie wooster  she seemed disappointed the fine old name of wooster appeared to mean nothing in her life  isnt rockmetteller home she said where is he  she had me with the first shot i couldnt think of anything to say i couldnt tell her that rocky was down in the country watching worms  there was the faintest flutter of sound in the background it was the respectful cough with which jeeves announces that he is about to speak without having been spoken to  if you remember sir mr todd went out in the automobile with a party in the afternoon  so he did jeeves so he did i said looking at my watch did he say when he would be back  he gave me to understand sir that he would be somewhat late in returning  he vanished and the aunt took the chair which id forgotten to offer her she looked at me in rather a rummy way it was a nasty look it made me feel as if i were something the dog had brought in and intended to bury later on when he had time my own aunt agatha back in england has looked at me in exactly the same way many a time and it never fails to make my spine curl  you seem very much at home here young man are you a great friend of rockmettellers  oh yes rather  she frowned as if she had expected better things of old rocky  well you need to be she said the way you treat his flat as your own  i give you my word this quite unforeseen slam simply robbed me of the power of speech id been looking on myself in the light of the dashing host and suddenly to be treated as an intruder jarred me it wasnt mark you as if she had spoken in a way to suggest that she considered my presence in the place as an ordinary social call she obviously looked on me as a cross between a burglar and the plumbers man come to fix the leak in the bathroom it hurt hermy being there  at this juncture with the conversation showing every sign of being about to die in awful agonies an idea came to me teathe good old standby  would you care for a cup of tea i said  tea  she spoke as if she had never heard of the stuff  nothing like a cup after a journey i said bucks you up puts a bit of zip into you what i mean is restores you and so on dont you know ill go and tell jeeves  i tottered down the passage to jeevess lair the man was reading the evening paper as if he hadnt a care in the world  jeeves i said we want some tea  very good sir  i say jeeves this is a bit thick what  i wanted sympathy dont you knowsympathy and kindness the old nerve centres had had the deuce of a shock  shes got the idea this place belongs to mr todd what on earth put that into her head  jeeves filled the kettle with a restrained dignity  no doubt because of mr todds letters sir he said it was my suggestion sir if you remember that they should be addressed from this apartment in order that mr todd should appear to possess a good central residence in the city  i remembered we had thought it a brainy scheme at the time  well its bally awkward you know jeeves she looks on me as an intruder by jove i suppose she thinks im someone who hangs about here touching mr todd for free meals and borrowing his shirts  yes sir  its pretty rotten you know  most disturbing sir  and theres another thing what are we to do about mr todd weve got to get him up here as soon as ever we can when you have brought the tea you had better go out and send him a telegram telling him to come up by the next train  i have already done so sir i took the liberty of writing the message and dispatching it by the lift attendant  by jove you think of everything jeeves  thank you sir a little buttered toast with the tea just so sir thank you  i went back to the sittingroom she hadnt moved an inch she was still bolt upright on the edge of her chair gripping her umbrella like a hammerthrower she gave me another of those looks as i came in there was no doubt about it for some reason she had taken a dislike to me i suppose because i wasnt george m cohan it was a bit hard on a chap  this is a surprise what i said after about five minutes restful silence trying to crank the conversation up again  what is a surprise  your coming here dont you know and so on  she raised her eyebrows and drank me in a bit more through her glasses  why is it surprising that i should visit my only nephew she said  put like that of course it did seem reasonable  oh rather i said of course certainly what i mean is  jeeves projected himself into the room with the tea i was jolly glad to see him theres nothing like having a bit of business arranged for one when one isnt certain of ones lines with the teapot to fool about with i felt happier  tea tea teawhat what i said  it wasnt what i had meant to say my idea had been to be a good deal more formal and so on still it covered the situation i poured her out a cup she sipped it and put the cup down with a shudder  do you mean to say young man she said frostily that you expect me to drink this stuff  rather bucks you up you know  what do you mean by the expression bucks you up  well makes you full of beans you know makes you fizz  i dont understand a word you say youre english arent you  i admitted it she didnt say a word and somehow she did it in a way that made it worse than if she had spoken for hours somehow it was brought home to me that she didnt like englishmen and that if she had had to meet an englishman i was the one shed have chosen last  conversation languished again after that  then i tried again i was becoming more convinced every moment that you cant make a real lively salon with a couple of people especially if one of them lets it go a word at a time  are you comfortable at your hotel i said  at which hotel  the hotel youre staying at  i am not staying at an hotel  stopping with friendswhat  i am naturally stopping with my nephew  i didnt get it for the moment then it hit me  what here i gurgled  certainly where else should i go  the full horror of the situation rolled over me like a wave i couldnt see what on earth i was to do i couldnt explain that this wasnt rockys flat without giving the poor old chap away hopelessly because she would then ask me where he did live and then he would be right in the soup i was trying to induce the old bean to recover from the shock and produce some results when she spoke again  will you kindly tell my nephews manservant to prepare my room i wish to lie down  your nephews manservant  the man you call jeeves if rockmetteller has gone for an automobile ride there is no need for you to wait for him he will naturally wish to be alone with me when he returns  i found myself tottering out of the room the thing was too much for me i crept into jeevess den  jeeves i whispered  sir  mix me a bands jeeves i feel weak  very good sir  this is getting thicker every minute jeeves  sir  she thinks youre mr todds man she thinks the whole place is his and everything in it i dont see what youre to do except stay on and keep it up we cant say anything or shell get on to the whole thing and i dont want to let mr todd down by the way jeeves she wants you to prepare her bed  he looked wounded  it is hardly my place sir  i knowi know but do it as a personal favour to me if you come to that its hardly my place to be flung out of the flat like this and have to go to an hotel what  is it your intention to go to an hotel sir what will you do for clothes  good lord i hadnt thought of that can you put a few things in a bag when she isnt looking and sneak them down to me at the st aurea  i will endeavour to do so sir  well i dont think theres anything more is there tell mr todd where i am when he gets here  very good sir  i looked round the place the moment of parting had come i felt sad the whole thing reminded me of one of those melodramas where they drive chappies out of the old homestead into the snow  goodbye jeeves i said  goodbye sir  and i staggered out                                       you know i rather think i agree with those poetandphilosopher johnnies who insist that a fellow ought to be devilish pleased if he has a bit of trouble all that stuff about being refined by suffering you know suffering does give a chap a sort of broader and more sympathetic outlook it helps you to understand other peoples misfortunes if youve been through the same thing yourself  as i stood in my lonely bedroom at the hotel trying to tie my white tie myself it struck me for the first time that there must be whole squads of chappies in the world who had to get along without a man to look after them id always thought of jeeves as a kind of natural phenomenon but by jove of course when you come to think of it there must be quite a lot of fellows who have to press their own clothes themselves and havent got anybody to bring them tea in the morning and so on it was rather a solemn thought dont you know i mean to say ever since then ive been able to appreciate the frightful privations the poor have to stick  i got dressed somehow jeeves hadnt forgotten a thing in his packing everything was there down to the final stud im not sure this didnt make me feel worse it kind of deepened the pathos it was like what somebody or other wrote about the touch of a vanished hand  i had a bit of dinner somewhere and went to a show of some kind but nothing seemed to make any difference i simply hadnt the heart to go on to supper anywhere i just sucked down a whiskyandsoda in the hotel smokingroom and went straight up to bed i dont know when ive felt so rotten somehow i found myself moving about the room softly as if there had been a death in the family if i had anybody to talk to i should have talked in a whisper in fact when the telephonebell rang i answered in such a sad hushed voice that the fellow at the other end of the wire said halloa five times thinking he hadnt got me  it was rocky the poor old scout was deeply agitated  bertie is that you bertie oh gosh im having a time  where are you speaking from  the midnight revels weve been here an hour and i think were a fixture for the night ive told aunt isabel ive gone out to call up a friend to join us shes glued to a chair with thisisthelife written all over her taking it in through the pores she loves it and im nearly crazy  tell me all old top i said  a little more of this he said and i shall sneak quietly off to the river and end it all do you mean to say you go through this sort of thing every night bertie and enjoy it its simply infernal i was just snatching a wink of sleep behind the bill of fare just now when about a million yelling girls swooped down with toy balloons there are two orchestras here each trying to see if it cant play louder than the other im a mental and physical wreck when your telegram arrived i was just lying down for a quiet pipe with a sense of absolute peace stealing over me i had to get dressed and sprint two miles to catch the train it nearly gave me heartfailure and on top of that i almost got brain fever inventing lies to tell aunt isabel and then i had to cram myself into these confounded evening clothes of yours  i gave a sharp wail of agony it hadnt struck me till then that rocky was depending on my wardrobe to see him through  youll ruin them  i hope so said rocky in the most unpleasant way his troubles seemed to have had the worst effect on his character i should like to get back at them somehow theyve given me a bad enough time theyre about three sizes too small and somethings apt to give at any moment i wish to goodness it would and give me a chance to breathe i havent breathed since halfpast seven thank heaven jeeves managed to get out and buy me a collar that fitted or i should be a strangled corpse by now it was touch and go till the stud broke bertie this is pure hades aunt isabel keeps on urging me to dance how on earth can i dance when i dont know a soul to dance with and how the deuce could i even if i knew every girl in the place its taking big chances even to move in these trousers i had to tell her ive hurt my ankle she keeps asking me when cohan and stone are going to turn up and its simply a question of time before she discovers that stone is sitting two tables away somethings got to be done bertie youve got to think up some way of getting me out of this mess it was you who got me into it  me what do you mean  well jeeves then its all the same it was you who suggested leaving it to jeeves it was those letters i wrote from his notes that did the mischief i made them too good my aunts just been telling me about it she says she had resigned herself to ending her life where she was and then my letters began to arrive describing the joys of new york and they stimulated her to such an extent that she pulled herself together and made the trip she seems to think shes had some miraculous kind of faith cure i tell you i cant stand it bertie its got to end  cant jeeves think of anything  no he just hangs round saying most disturbing sir a fat lot of help that is  well old lad i said after all its far worse for me than it is for you youve got a comfortable home and jeeves and youre saving a lot of money  saving money what do you meansaving money  why the allowance your aunt was giving you i suppose shes paying all the expenses now isnt she  certainly she is but shes stopped the allowance she wrote the lawyers tonight she says that now shes in new york there is no necessity for it to go on as we shall always be together and its simpler for her to look after that end of it i tell you bertie ive examined the darned cloud with a microscope and if its got a silver lining its some little dissembler  but rocky old top its too bally awful youve no notion of what im going through in this beastly hotel without jeeves i must get back to the flat  dont come near the flat  but its my own flat  i cant help that aunt isabel doesnt like you she asked me what you did for a living and when i told her you didnt do anything she said she thought as much and that you were a typical specimen of a useless and decaying aristocracy so if you think you have made a hit forget it now i must be going back or shell be coming out here after me goodbye                                       next morning jeeves came round it was all so homelike when he floated noiselessly into the room that i nearly broke down  good morning sir he said i have brought a few more of your personal belongings  he began to unstrap the suitcase he was carrying  did you have any trouble sneaking them away  it was not easy sir i had to watch my chance miss rockmetteller is a remarkably alert lady  you know jeeves say what you likethis is a bit thick isnt it  the situation is certainly one that has never before come under my notice sir i have brought the heathermixture suit as the climatic conditions are congenial tomorrow if not prevented i will endeavour to add the brown lounge with the faint green twill  it cant go onthis sort of thingjeeves  we must hope for the best sir  cant you think of anything to do  i have been giving the matter considerable thought sir but so far without success i am placing three silk shirtsthe dovecoloured the light blue and the mauvein the first long drawer sir  you dont mean to say you cant think of anything jeeves  for the moment sir no you will find a dozen handkerchiefs and the tan socks in the upper drawer on the left he strapped the suitcase and put it on a chair a curious lady miss rockmetteller sir  you understate it jeeves  he gazed meditatively out of the window  in many ways sir miss rockmetteller reminds me of an aunt of mine who resides in the southeast portion of london their temperaments are much alike my aunt has the same taste for the pleasures of the great city it is a passion with her to ride in hansom cabs sir whenever the family take their eyes off her she escapes from the house and spends the day riding about in cabs on several occasions she has broken into the childrens savings bank to secure the means to enable her to gratify this desire  i love to have these little chats with you about your female relatives jeeves i said coldly for i felt that the man had let me down and i was fed up with him but i dont see what all this has got to do with my trouble  i beg your pardon sir i am leaving a small assortment of neckties on the mantelpiece sir for you to select according to your preference i should recommend the blue with the red domino pattern sir  then he streamed imperceptibly toward the door and flowed silently out                                       ive often heard that chappies after some great shock or loss have a habit after theyve been on the floor for a while wondering what hit them of picking themselves up and piecing themselves together and sort of taking a whirl at beginning a new life time the great healer and nature adjusting itself and so on and so forth theres a lot in it i know because in my own case after a day or two of what you might call prostration i began to recover the frightful loss of jeeves made any thought of pleasure more or less a mockery but at least i found that i was able to have a dash at enjoying life again what i mean is i braced up to the extent of going round the cabarets once more so as to try to forget if only for the moment  new yorks a small place when it comes to the part of it that wakes up just as the rest is going to bed and it wasnt long before my tracks began to cross old rockys i saw him once at peales and again at frolics on the roof there wasnt anybody with him either time except the aunt and though he was trying to look as if he had struck the ideal life it wasnt difficult for me knowing the circumstances to see that beneath the mask the poor chap was suffering my heart bled for the fellow at least what there was of it that wasnt bleeding for myself bled for him he had the air of one who was about to crack under the strain  it seemed to me that the aunt was looking slightly upset also i took it that she was beginning to wonder when the celebrities were going to surge round and what had suddenly become of all those wild careless spirits rocky used to mix with in his letters i didnt blame her i had only read a couple of his letters but they certainly gave the impression that poor old rocky was by way of being the hub of new york night life and that if by any chance he failed to show up at a cabaret the management said whats the use and put up the shutters  the next two nights i didnt come across them but the night after that i was sitting by myself at the maison pierre when somebody tapped me on the shoulderblade and i found rocky standing beside me with a sort of mixed expression of wistfulness and apoplexy on his face how the chappie had contrived to wear my evening clothes so many times without disaster was a mystery to me he confided later that early in the proceedings he had slit the waistcoat up the back and that that had helped a bit  for a moment i had the idea that he had managed to get away from his aunt for the evening but looking past him i saw that she was in again she was at a table over by the wall looking at me as if i were something the management ought to be complained to about  bertie old scout said rocky in a quiet sort of crushed voice weve always been pals havent we i mean you know id do you a good turn if you asked me  my dear old lad i said the man had moved me  then for heavens sake come over and sit at our table for the rest of the evening  well you know there are limits to the sacred claims of friendship  my dear chap i said you know id do anything in reason but  you must come bertie youve got to somethings got to be done to divert her mind shes brooding about something shes been like that for the last two days i think shes beginning to suspect she cant understand why we never seem to meet anyone i know at these joints a few nights ago i happened to run into two newspaper men i used to know fairly well that kept me going for a while i introduced them to aunt isabel as david belasco and jim corbett and it went well but the effect has worn off now and shes beginning to wonder again somethings got to be done or she will find out everything and if she does id take a nickel for my chance of getting a cent from her later on so for the love of mike come across to our table and help things along  i went along one has to rally round a pal in distress aunt isabel was sitting bolt upright as usual it certainly did seem as if she had lost a bit of the zest with which she had started out to explore broadway she looked as if she had been thinking a good deal about rather unpleasant things  youve met bertie wooster aunt isabel said rocky  i have  there was something in her eye that seemed to say  out of a city of six million people why did you pick on me  take a seat bertie whatll you have said rocky  and so the merry party began it was one of those jolly happy breadcrumbling parties where you cough twice before you speak and then decide not to say it after all after we had had an hour of this wild dissipation aunt isabel said she wanted to go home in the light of what rocky had been telling me this struck me as sinister i had gathered that at the beginning of her visit she had had to be dragged home with ropes  it must have hit rocky the same way for he gave me a pleading look  youll come along wont you bertie and have a drink at the flat  i had a feeling that this wasnt in the contract but there wasnt anything to be done it seemed brutal to leave the poor chap alone with the woman so i went along  right from the start from the moment we stepped into the taxi the feeling began to grow that something was about to break loose a massive silence prevailed in the corner where the aunt sat and though rocky balancing himself on the little seat in front did his best to supply dialogue we werent a chatty party  i had a glimpse of jeeves as we went into the flat sitting in his lair and i wished i could have called to him to rally round something told me that i was about to need him  the stuff was on the table in the sittingroom rocky took up the decanter  say when bertie  stop barked the aunt and he dropped it  i caught rockys eye as he stooped to pick up the ruins it was the eye of one who sees it coming  leave it there rockmetteller said aunt isabel and rocky left it there  the time has come to speak she said i cannot stand idly by and see a young man going to perdition  poor old rocky gave a sort of gurgle a kind of sound rather like the whisky had made running out of the decanter on to my carpet  eh he said blinking  the aunt proceeded  the fault she said was mine i had not then seen the light but now my eyes are open i see the hideous mistake i have made i shudder at the thought of the wrong i did you rockmetteller by urging you into contact with this wicked city  i saw rocky grope feebly for the table his fingers touched it and a look of relief came into the poor chappies face i understood his feelings  but when i wrote you that letter rockmetteller instructing you to go to the city and live its life i had not had the privilege of hearing mr mundy speak on the subject of new york  jimmy mundy i cried  you know how it is sometimes when everything seems all mixed up and you suddenly get a clue when she mentioned jimmy mundy i began to understand more or less what had happened id seen it happen before i remember back in england the man i had before jeeves sneaked off to a meeting on his evening out and came back and denounced me in front of a crowd of chappies i was giving a bit of supper to as a moral leper  the aunt gave me a withering up and down  yes jimmy mundy she said i am surprised at a man of your stamp having heard of him there is no music there are no drunken dancing men no shameless flaunting women at his meetings so for you they would have no attraction but for others less dead in sin he has his message he has come to save new york from itself to force itin his picturesque phraseto hit the trail it was three days ago rockmetteller that i first heard him it was an accident that took me to his meeting how often in this life a mere accident may shape our whole future  you had been called away by that telephone message from mr belasco so you could not take me to the hippodrome as we had arranged i asked your manservant jeeves to take me there the man has very little intelligence he seems to have misunderstood me i am thankful that he did he took me to what i subsequently learned was madison square garden where mr mundy is holding his meetings he escorted me to a seat and then left me and it was not till the meeting had begun that i discovered the mistake which had been made my seat was in the middle of a row i could not leave without inconveniencing a great many people so i remained  she gulped  rockmetteller i have never been so thankful for anything else mr mundy was wonderful he was like some prophet of old scourging the sins of the people he leaped about in a frenzy of inspiration till i feared he would do himself an injury sometimes he expressed himself in a somewhat odd manner but every word carried conviction he showed me new york in its true colours he showed me the vanity and wickedness of sitting in gilded haunts of vice eating lobster when decent people should be in bed  he said that the tango and the foxtrot were devices of the devil to drag people down into the bottomless pit he said that there was more sin in ten minutes with a negro banjo orchestra than in all the ancient revels of nineveh and babylon and when he stood on one leg and pointed right at where i was sitting and shouted this means you i could have sunk through the floor i came away a changed woman surely you must have noticed the change in me rockmetteller you must have seen that i was no longer the careless thoughtless person who had urged you to dance in those places of wickedness  rocky was holding on to the table as if it was his only friend  yyes he stammered ii thought something was wrong  wrong something was right everything was right rockmetteller it is not too late for you to be saved you have only sipped of the evil cup you have not drained it it will be hard at first but you will find that you can do it if you fight with a stout heart against the glamour and fascination of this dreadful city wont you for my sake try rockmetteller wont you go back to the country tomorrow and begin the struggle little by little if you use your will  i cant help thinking it must have been that word will that roused dear old rocky like a trumpet call it must have brought home to him the realisation that a miracle had come off and saved him from being cut out of aunt isabels at any rate as she said it he perked up let go of the table and faced her with gleaming eyes  do you want me to go back to the country aunt isabel  yes  not to live in the country  yes rockmetteller  stay in the country all the time do you mean never come to new york  yes rockmetteller i mean just that it is the only way only there can you be safe from temptation will you do it rockmetteller will youfor my sake  rocky grabbed the table again he seemed to draw a lot of encouragement from that table  i will he said                                       jeeves i said it was next day and i was back in the old flat lying in the old armchair with my feet upon the good old table i had just come from seeing dear old rocky off to his country cottage and an hour before he had seen his aunt off to whatever hamlet it was that she was the curse of so we were alone at last jeeves theres no place like homewhat  very true sir  the jolly old rooftree and all that sort of thingwhat  precisely sir  i lit another cigarette  jeeves  sir  do you know at one point in the business i really thought you were baffled  indeed sir  when did you get the idea of taking miss rockmetteller to the meeting it was pure genius  thank you sir it came to me a little suddenly one morning when i was thinking of my aunt sir  your aunt the hansom cab one  yes sir i recollected that whenever we observed one of her attacks coming on we used to send for the clergyman of the parish we always found that if he talked to her a while of higher things it diverted her mind from hansom cabs it occurred to me that the same treatment might prove efficacious in the case of miss rockmetteller  i was stunned by the mans resource  its brain i said pure brain what do you do to get like that jeeves i believe you must eat a lot of fish or something do you eat a lot of fish jeeves  no sir  oh well then its just a gift i take it and if you arent born that way theres no use worrying  precisely sir said jeeves if i might make the suggestion sir i should not continue to wear your present tie the green shade gives you a slightly bilious air i should strongly advocate the blue with the red domino pattern instead sir  all right jeeves i said humbly you know   the end
