35605935	the settler and the savage by rm ballantyne    chapter one  the wild karroo  a solitary horsemana youth in early manhoodriding at a snails pace over the great plains or karroo of south africa  his chin on his breast his hands in the pockets of an old shootingcoat his legs in ragged trousers and his feet in wornout boots  regardless of stirrups the last are dangling  the reins hang on the neck of his steed whose head may be said to dangle from its shoulders so nearly does its nose approach the ground  a felt hat covers the youths curly black head and a doublebarrelled gun is slung across his broad shoulders  we present this picture to the reader as a subject of contemplation  it was in the first quarter of the present century that the youth referred tocharlie considine by namerode thus meditatively over that south african karroo  his depression was evidently not due to lack of spirit for when he suddenly awoke from his reverie drew himself up and shook back his hair his dark eyes opened with something like a flash  they lost some of their fire however as he gazed round on the hot plain which undulated like the great ocean to the horizon where a line of blue indicated mountains  the truth is that charlie considine was lostutterly lost on the karroo  that his horse was in the same lost condition became apparent from its stopping without orders and looking round languidly with a sigh  come rob roy said the youth gathering up the reins and patting the steeds neck this will never do  you and i must not give in to our first misfortune  no doubt the want of water for two days is hard to bear but we are strong and young both of us  come lets try at least for a sheltering bush to sleep under before the sun goes down  animated by the cheering voice if not by the words of its rider the horse responded to the exhortation by breaking into a shuffling canter  after a short time the youth came in sight of what appeared to be a herd of cattle in the far distance  in eager expectation he galloped towards them and found that his conjectures were correct  they were cattle in charge of one of that lowest of the human race a bushman  the diminutive blackskinned and monkeyfaced creature was nearly naked he carried a sheepskin kaross or blanket on his left shoulder and a knobbed stick or kerrie in his right hand  can you speak english asked considine as he rode up  the bushman looked vacant and made no reply  where is your masters house asked the youth  a stare was the only answer  cant you speak you driedup essence of stupidity exclaimed charlie with impatience  at this the bushman uttered something with so many klicks klucks and gurgles in it that his interrogator at once relinquished the use of the tongue and took to signs but with no better success his efforts having only the effect of causing the mouth of the bushman to expand from ear to ear  uttering a few more klicks and gurgles he pointed in the direction of the setting sun  as considine could elicit no fuller information he bade him a contemptuous farewell and rode away in the direction indicated  he had not gone far when a dark speck became visible on the horizon directly in front  ho  rob he exclaimed that looks like somethinga bush is it  if so we may find water there who knowseh  no it cant be a bush for it moves he added in a tone of disappointment  why i do believe its an ostrich  well if we cant find anything to drink ill try to get something to eat  urging his jaded steed into a gallop the youth soon drew near enough to discover that the object was neither bush nor ostrich but a horseman  the times of which we write were unsettled  considine although lost was sufficiently aware of his whereabouts to understand that he was near the northeastern frontier of cape colony  he deemed it prudent therefore to unsling his gun  on drawing nearer he became convinced from the appearance of the stranger that he could not be a kafir  when close enough to perceive that he was a white man mounted and armed much like himself he reslung his gun waved his cap in token of friendship and galloped forward with the confidence of youth  the stranger proved to be a young man of about his own agea little over twentybut much taller and more massive in frame  he was indeed a young giant and bestrode a horse suitable to his weight  he was clad in the rough woollen and leathern garments worn by the frontier farmers or boers of that period and carried one of those long heavy flintlock guns or roers which the dutchafrican colonist then deemed the most effective weapon in the universe  well met exclaimed considine heartily as he rode up  humph that depends on whether we meet as friends or foes replied the stranger with a smile on his cheerful countenance that accorded ill with the caution of his words  well met i say again whether we be friends or foes returned considine still more heartily for if we be friends we shall fraternise if we be foes we shall fight and i would rather fight you for love hate or fun than die of starvation in the karroo  what is your name and where do you come from demanded the stranger  one question at a time if you please answered the youth  my name is charles considine  what is yours  hans marais  well mr marais i come from england which is my native home  in the coming i managed to get wrecked in table bay landed at capetown joined a frontier farmer and came up herea long and roughish journey as probably you know and as my garments testify  on the way i lost my comrades and in trying to find them lost myself  for two days nothing in the shape of meat or drink has passed my lips and my poor horse has fared little better in the way of drink though the karroobush has furnished him with food enough to keep his bones together  so now you have my biography in brief and if you be a man possessed of any powers of sympathy you will know what to do  the young dutchman held out his huge hand which considine grasped and shook warmly  come he said while a slight smile played on his bronzed countenance i have nothing here to give you but if you will come with me to yon koppie you shall have both meat and drink  the koppie to which he referred was a scarce discernible knoll on the horizon  hans marais seemed to be a man of few words for he turned and galloped away without for some time uttering another syllable to his companion as for considine the thought of once more feasting on any sort of meat and drink was so fascinating in his then ravenous condition that he cared for nought else and followed his guide in silence  soon the herbage on the plain became more luxuriant and in half an hour the two horsemen found themselves riding among scattered groups of mimosa bushes the thorns of which were from three to five inches long while their sweet fragrance scented the whole atmosphere  on reaching the ridge of one of the undulations of the plain hans marais drew rein and gazed intently towards the distant horizon  at the same time considines horse pricked up its ears pawed the ground and exhibited unwonted signs of a desire to advance  hallo rob exclaimed its master whats wrong with you  your horse has been gifted by his maker with a power said hans which has been denied to man  he scents water  but before he shall taste it he must help me to procure fresh meat  do you see the boks on that koppie  do you mean those white specks like ostrich eggs on the hillock to the right of the big bush  the same  these are springboks  ride away down by that hollow till you get somewhat in their rear and then drive them in the direction of that clump of bushes on our left just under the sun  without waiting for a reply hans rode off at a gallop and considine proceeded to obey orders  a few minutes sufficed to bring him close to the springboks which beautiful antelopes no sooner observed him than after one brief gaze of surprise they bounded away in the direction of the bushes indicated by hansconscious apparently of their superior fleetness for they seemed in no great haste but leaped about as if half in play one and another taking an occasional spring of six feet or more into the air  as they passed the bushes towards which considine drove them a white puff was seen to burst from them and the huge roer of hans marais sent forth its bellowing report  it seemed as if the entire flock of boks had received an electric shock so high did they spring into the air  then they dashed off at full speed leaving one of their number dead upon the plain  when considine came up he found that hans had already disembowelled the springbok and was in the act of fastening the carcase on his horse behind the saddle  remounting immediately the hunter galloped towards a mound on the top of which the bushes formed a dense brake  skirting this till he reached the other side he pulled up exclaiming  there youll find good water in the hollow go drink while i prepare supper on the koppie  considine went off at once  indeed he could not have done otherwise for his impatient horse took the bit in its mouth and galloped towards a small pool of water which was so yellow with mud that it resembled thin peasoup  thirsty though he was the youth could not help smiling at his new friends idea of good water but he was not in a condition to be fastidious  jumping out of the saddle he lay down on his breast dipped his lips into the muddy liquid and drank with as much enjoyment as if the beverage had been nectaror bass  rob roy also stood in a state of perfect bliss in the middle of the pool sucking the water in with unwearied vigour  it seemed as if man and horse had laid a wager as to who should drink most  at last the point of utmost capacity in both was reached and they retired with a sigh of contentment rob roy to browse on the plain and his master to betake himself to the encampment on the knoll where hans marais quickly supplied him with glorious steaks of springbok venison  isnt it an enjoyable thing to eat when one is hungry eh said considine after half an hours silent devotion to the duty in handwhy where got you that  he referred to an ostrich egg which his companion had taken from a saddlebag and in one end of which he was busy boring a hole  found it in the sand just before i found you said hans  did you ever eat one  no never  well then you shall do so now and ill show you how the niggers here make an omelet  he planted the huge egg in the hot ashes as he spoke and kept stirring its contents with a piece of stick until sufficiently cooked  not badeh  glorious exclaimed considine smacking his lips  both youths continued to smack their lips over the egg until it was finished after which charlie pronounced it not only a glorious but a satisfying morsel  this was doubtless true for an ostrich egg is considered equal to twentyfour hens eggs  returning to the springbok steaks the halfstarved youth continued his repast while hans marais having finished extended his huge frame beside the campfire leaned upon his saddle and smoked his pipe in benignant contemplation of his companion  this is pleasant said charlie pausing with a sigh and looking up  ja it is pleasant replied hans  ja repeated charlie quoting the dutch yes of the other are you a dutchman  i am at least i am a cape colonist descended from dutchmen  why are you surprised  because replied his companion while he prepared another steak over the embers you speak english so well that i could not have known it how came you to learn the language so perfectly  my father being wiser than some of his friends and neighbours said hans sent me to capetown to be educated  i suppose that is the reason  we dwelt in the western part of the colony then and i was the eldest of the family  when a number of us dutchmen left that part of the countrybeing disgusted with the governmentand came up here my brothers and sister had to be taken from school  this was a pity for education taught me to know that education is an inestimable blessing the want of it a heavy misfortune  true remarked considine  but being still too busy with the steaks to pursue the subject he merely addeddoes your father live near this  about seven hours ride which as i daresay you know is fortytwo miles  you shall go home with me tomorrow  how many are there of you asked considine looking at the young dutchman over a bone  excuse my being so impolite he added but dyou know one feels horribly like a tiger after a two days fast  dont stand on ceremony said the other with a laugh  when you are satisfied we can converse  there are fifteen of us father mother sister and eleven boys besides myself  ill tell you about them all after supper meanwhile ill go fetch the horses for there are lions about as i daresay you know and some of them are nearly as ravenous as yourself  hans rose put his pipe in the band of his broadbrimmed hat and sauntered heavily out of the thicket  in a few minutes he returned leading the horses and then busied himself in surrounding the camp with an almost impenetrable wall of mimosathorn branches the spikes of which were so tremendous that it seemed as if nothing smaller than an elephant could force its way through  this done he sat down and quietly refilled his pipe while considine having at last finished his meal drew the embers of the fire together disposed his limbs comfortably on the ground lay back on his saddle and prepared to enjoy a contemplative gaze at the cheering blaze and an interrogative conversation with his new friend  do you smoke asked hans  no  why  because it makes me sick and i dont like it  hans looked surprised  this was a new idea to him and he sat for some time pondering it indeed we may say with truth that he smoked it in a few minutes he looked earnestly at the youth and asked why he came to the cape  to make my fortune answered considine  fortunes are not easily made at the cape was the grave reply  my father has been making his fortune for the last quarter of a century and its not made yetwhy did you choose the cape  i didnt choose it  no said the dutchman with a look of surprise  no responded the englishman my coming here was not a matter of choice it was necessity  come i will make a confidant of you and relate my history  dont be alarmed i wont keep you up all night with prosy details  my life as you may see has not yet been a long one and until this year it has been comparatively uneventful  he paused a few moments as if to recall the past while his companion picking his pipe with a mimosa thorn settled himself to listen  father mother brothers and sisters i have none began considine as he whittled a sticka pastime by the way which is erroneously supposed to be an exclusively american privilege  neither have i grandfathers grandmothers aunts nephews nieces or anything else of the sort  they all died either before or soon after i was born  my only living relation is an uncle who was my guardian  he is a seacaptain and a good man but tough  i bear him no illwill  i would not speak disrespectfully of him but he is tough and i incline to think no better than he should be  infancy and boyhood with squalling and schooling i pass over  my uncle ordered me to study for the medical profession and i obeyed  wishing to see a little of the world before finishing my course i sailed in a vessel bound for australia  we touched at table bay in passing  obtaining leave i went ashore at capetown  the ship also went ashorewithout leavein company with six other ships during a terrific gale which sprang up in the night  our vessel became a total wreck  the crew were saved but my effects went with the cargo to the bottom  fortunately however i had carried ashore with me the little cash i possessed  i found the capetown people very kind  one of them took me by the hand and offered me employment but i preferred to proceed into the interior with a trader and work or shoot my way in order to save my money  no trader being about to start at that time i was obliged to accept the offer of a frontier farmer who for a small sum agreed to allow me to accompany his waggons on condition that i should make myself generally useful  i grudged the cash but closed with the offer and next day started on our journey of six hundred milessuch being the distance we had to go according to my employer or comrade jan smit  who exclaimed hans with sudden energy  jan smit repeated considine  do you know him  jabut go on said hans with a nod and a smile  well i soon found that my dutch comrade  hes only half dutch interrupted hans  his mother was dutch but his father is english  well dutch or english he is the most unmitigated scoundrel i ever met  ja muttered hans he is  and i soon found that my trip of pleasure became a trip of torment  it is true we shot plenty of gamelions among the restbut in camp the man was so unbearable that disgust counterbalanced all the pleasure of the trip  i tried hard to get the better of him by goodhumour and jollity but he became so insolent at last that i could not stand it three days ago when i asked him how far we were from his farm he growled that it wasnt far off now whereupon i could not refrain from saying that i was glad to hear it as we should soon have the pleasure of parting company  this put him in a rage  he kicked over the pot containing part of our breakfast and told me i might part company then and there if i pleased  my temper does not easily go but it went at last  i jumped up saddled my horse mounted and rode away  of course i lost myself immediately and for two days have been trying to find myself without success mourning over my fate and folly and fasting from necessity  but for my opportune meeting with you mr marais it might have gone hard with me and my poor horse for the want of water had wellnigh floored us both  youll never make your fortune by doctoring on the frontier said hans after a few minutes silence  nobody gets ill in this splendid climatebesides we couldnt afford to waste time in that way  people here usually live to a great age and then go off without the assistance of a doctor  what else can you turn your hand to  anything replied considine with the overweening confidence of youth  which means nothing i suspect said the dutchman for jackofalltrades is proverbially master of none  it may be so retorted the other nevertheless without boasting i may venture to assertbecause i can prove itthat i am able to make tables chairs chests and suchlike things besides knowing something of the blacksmiths trade  in regard to doctoring i am not entitled to practise for fees not yet being fullfledgedonly a thirdyear studentbut i may do a little in that way for love you know  if you have a leg for instance that wants amputating i can manage it for you with a good carvingknife and a crosscut saw  or should a grinder give you annoyance any sort of pincers small enough to enter your mouth will enable me to relieve you  at this hans smiled and displayed a set of brilliant grinders which did not appear likely to give him annoyance for some time to come  can you shoot asked hans laying his hand on his companions doublebarrelled gun which lay on the ground between them and which with its delicate proportions and percussionlocks formed a striking contrast to the battered heavy flintlock weapon of the dutchman  ay to some extent as the lions skins in jan smits waggon can testifyby the way added considine quickly you said that you knew smit  can you tell me where he lives because i still owe him the half of the money promised for permission to accompany him on this trip and should not like to remain his debtor  ja i know where he lives  hes a bad specimen of a dutch farmer in every respect except as to size  he lives quite close to our farm mores the pityand is one of those men who do their best to keep up bad feeling between the frontiermen and the kafirs  the evil deeds of men such as he are represented in england by designing or foolish persons as being characteristic of the whole class of frontier farmers hence we are regarded as a savage set while in my humble opinion we are no worse than the people of other colonies placed in similar circumstancesperhaps better than some of them  do you know anything of our past history  not much replied considine throwing away the remnant of the stick he had been whittling and commencing on another piece  of course i know that the cape was first doubled by the portuguese commander bartholomew diaz in i think 1486 and after him by vasco de gama and that the dutch formed the first settlement on it under van riebeek in 1652 but beyond this my knowledge of cape history and dates is hazy and confused i know however that your forefathers mismanaged the country for about a century and a half after which it finally came into possession of the british in 1806  humph ejaculated hans while a shade of displeasure flitted for a moment across his broad visage  tis a pity your reading had not extended farther for then you would have learned that from 1806 the colony has been mismanaged by your countrymen and the last fruit of their mismanagement has been a bloody war with the kafirs which has only just been concluded  peace has been made only this year and the frontier is now at rest  but who will rebuild the burned homesteads of this desolated land who will reimburse the ruined farmers above all who will restore the lost lives  the young dutchmans eyes kindled and his stern face flushed as he spoke for although his own homestead had escaped the ruthless savage friends and kindred had suffered deeply in the irruption referred to which took place in 1819 and one or two of his intimate comrades had found early graves in the wild karroo  considine sympathising with his companions feelings said i doubt not that you have much to complain of for there is no colony under the sun that escapes from the evil acts of occasional bad or incompetent governors  but pray do not extend your indignation to me or to my countrymen at large for few of us know the true merits of your case and tell me what was the origin of the war which has just ended  the young farmers anger had passed away as quickly as it came  letting his bulky frame sink back into the reclining position from which he had partially risen he replied  just the old storyselfwill and stupidity  that domineering fellow lord charles somerset intending to check the plundering of the colony by kafirs chose to enter into treaties with gaika as paramount chief of kafirland although gaika himself told him plainly that he was not paramount chief  of course the other chiefs were indignant and refused to recognise such treaties  they did more they made war on gaika and beat him whereupon somerset instead of leaving the niggers to fight their own battles must needs send a great commando of military and burghers to restore gaika to his socalled supremacy  this was done the chief tslambi was driven from his villages and no fewer than 11000 head of cattle were handed over to gaika  while this was going on at the eastern frontier the kafirs invaded the colony at other points drove in the small military posts ravaged the whole land and even attacked the military headquarters at grahamstown where however they were defeated with great slaughter  after this a large force was sent to drive them out of their great stronghold the fish river bush this was successfully accomplished and then at last the right thing was done  the governor met the kafir chiefs when it was agreed that they should evacuate the country between the great fish river and the keiskamma and that the territory so evacuated should form neutral ground  so matters stand at present but i have no faith in kafirs it is their pride to lie their business to make war and their delight to plunder  but is it not the same with all savages asked considine  doubtless it is therefore no savages ought to be trusted as civilised men are trusted till they cease to be savages  we trust them too much  time will showby the way i hear that a new move is about to be attempted  rumour says that your government is going to send out a strong party of emigrants to colonise the eastern frontier  is this true  it is replied considine i wonder that you have not heard all about it before now  good reasons for that  for one thing i have just returned from a long trip into the northwestern districts and i have not been in the way of hearing news for some time  besides we have no newspapers in the colony  everything comes to us by word of mouth and that slowly  tell me about this matter  there is little to tell returned considine replenishing the fire with a thick branch which sent up a magnificent display of sparks and scared away a hyena and two jackals that had been prowling round the campfence  the fact is that there is a great deal of distress in england just now and a redundant population of idlers owing to the cessation of continental wars  this seems to have put it into the heads of some people in power to encourage emigration to the eastern part of this colony  in the house of commons 50000 pounds have been voted in aid of the plan and it seems that when the proposal was first made public no fewer than 90000 wouldbe emigrants applied for leave to come out here  of these i believe 4000 have been selected and twentythree vessels chartered to convey them out  this is all i could learn before i left england but i suppose we shall have more light on the subject ere many months have gone by  a good plan said the dutchman with a grim smile but i pity the emigrants  as considines head drooped at this point and his eyes winked with that owlish look which indicates the approach of irresistible sleep hans marais rose and spreading a large kaross or blanket of leopard skin on the ground invited his companion to lie down thereon  the youth willingly complied stretched himself beside the dutchman and almost instantly fell sound asleep  hans spread a lighter covering over himself and his comrade and with his head on his saddle lay for a long time gazing tranquilly at the stars which shone with an intensity of lustre peculiar to that region of the southern hemisphere while the yelling cries of jackals and the funereal moaning of spotted hyenas with an occasional distant roar from the king of beasts formed an appropriate lullaby    chapter two  introduces a cape dutchman and his family and shows the uncertainty of human plans  the break of day found charlie considine and hans marais galloping lightly over the karroo towards a range of mountains which on the previous evening had appeared like a faint line of blue on the horizon  the sun was just rising in a blaze of splendour giving promise of an oppressive day when the horsemen topped a ridge beyond which lay the primitive buildings of a frontier farm  considine uttered an exclamation of surprise and looked inquiringly at his companion  my fathers farm said hans drawing rein and advancing at a footpace  a lovely spot returned his companion but i cannot say much for the buildings  they are well suited to their purpose nevertheless said hans besides would it be wise to build fine houses for kafirs to burn  is being burnt by kafirs the necessary end of all frontier farms asked considine with a smile  not the necessary but the probable end  many a one has been burnt in times gone by and many a one will be burnt again if the government and people in england do not recognise and admit the two great facts that the interest as well as the main desire of the frontier settler is peace while the chief delight as well as business of the kafir is war  but i suppose that you being an englishman will not believe that until conviction is forced on you by experiencecome i will introduce you to one of those colonists who are supposed to be such discontented fireeaters i think he will receive you hospitably  the young farmer put spurs to his horse as he spoke and dashed away over the plain closely followed by his new friend who was not sorry to drop the conversation being almost entirely ignorant of the merits of the question raised  the style of the group of buildings to which they drew near was not entirely unfamiliar to considine for he had passed one or two similar farms belonging to cape dutchmen on his trip from the seacoast to the interior  there were about this farm however a few prominent points of difference  the cottages being built of sundried bricks were little better than mudhuts but there were more of them than considine had hitherto seen on such farms and the chief dwelling in particular displayed some touches of taste which betokened superior refinement in the inhabitants  the group lay in a hollow on the margin of an insignificant stream whose course through the plain was marked by a thick belt of beautiful mimosabushes  close to the houses these mimosas large enough to merit the title of trees formed a green setting in which the farm appeared to nestle as if desirous of escaping the sunshine  a few cactus shrubs and aloes were scattered about in rear of the principal dwelling in the midst of which stood several mudhuts resembling gigantic beehives  in these dwelt some of the hottentot and other servants of the farm while a little to the right of them on a high mound were situated the kraals or enclosures for cattle and sheep  about fifty yards farther off a clump of tall trees indicated the position of a garden whose fruittrees were laden with the blossoms or beginnings of a rich crop of peaches lemons oranges apricots figs pears plums apples pomegranates and many other fruits and vegetables  this bright and fruitful gem in the midst of the brown and apparently barren karroo was chiefly due to the existence of a large enclosure or dam which the thrifty farmer had constructed about half a mile from the homestead and the clear waters of which shimmered in the centre of the picture even when prolonged drought had quite dried up the bed of its parent stream  the peaceful beauty of the scene was completed by its grand background of blue mountains  a tall powerful middleaged man in a coarse cloth jacket leathern trousers or crackers and a broadbrimmed homemade hat issued from the chief dwellinghouse as the horsemen galloped up and drew rein  the sons of the family and a number of barking dogs also greeted them  hans and considine sprang to the ground while two or three of the eleven brothers of various agesalso in leathern crackers but without coats or hatscame forward kicked the dogs and led the horses away  let me introduce a stranger father whom i have foundlost in the karroo said hans  welcome to eden  come in come in said mynheer conrad marais heartily as he shook his visitor by the hand  considine suitably acknowledged the hospitable greeting and followed his host into the principal room of his residence  there was no hall or passage to the house  the visitor walked straight off the veldt or plain into the drawingroomif we may so style it the house door was also the drawingroom door and it was divided transversely into two halves whereby an open window could at any moment be formed by shutting the lower half of the door  there was no ceiling to the room  you could see the ridgepole and rafters by looking up between the beams on one of which latter a swallowtaking advantage of the ever open door and the general hospitality of the familyhad built its nest  the sixfoot sons almost touched the said nest with their heads as to the smaller youths it was beyond the reach of most of them but had it been otherwise no one would have disturbed the lively little intruder  the floor of the apartment was made of hard earth without carpet  the whitewashed walls were graced with various garments as well as implements and trophies of the chase  from the beams hung joints of meat masses of dried flesh and various kinds of game large whipstermed sjamboks pronounced shamboks made of rhinoceros or hippopotamus hide leopard and lion skins ostrich eggs and feathers dried fruit strings of onions and other miscellaneous objects on the floor stood a large deal table and chairs of the same descriptionall homemadetwo waggon chests a giant churn a large iron pot several wooden pitchers hooped with brass and a sidetable on which were a large brassclasped dutch bible a set of dutch teacups an urn and a brass teakettle heated like a chafingdish  on the walls and in corners were several flintlock guns and one or two of the short light javelins used by the kafirs for throwing in battle named assagais  three small doors led into three inner rooms in which the entire family slept  there were no other apartments the kitchen being an outhouse on the centre table was spread a substantial breakfast from which the various members of the family had risen on the arrival of the horsemen  considine was introduced to mynheer marais vrouw a goodlooking fat and motherly woman verging on fortyand his daughter bertha a pretty little girl of eight or nine  what is mynheers name was the matrons first question  mynheer replied that it was charles considine  was mynheer english  yes mynheer was proud to acknowledge the fact  mrs marais followed up these questions with a host of otherssuch as the age and profession of mynheer the number of his relatives and the object of his visit to south africa  mynheer marais himself after getting a brief outline of his sons meeting with the englishman backed the attack of his pleasantfaced vrouw by putting a number of questions as to the political state of europe then existing and the chances of the british government seriously taking into consideration the unsatisfactory condition of the cape frontier and its relations with the kafirs  to all of these and a multitude of other questions charlie considine replied with great readiness and goodhumour as far as his knowledge enabled him for he began quickly to appreciate the fact that these isolated farmers who almost never saw a newspaper were thirsting for information as to the world in general as well as with regard to himself in particular  during this bombardment of queries the host and hostess were not forgetful to supply their young guest with the viands under which the substantial table groaned while several of the younger members of the family including the pretty bertha stood behind the rest and waited on them  with the exception of the host and hostess none of the household spoke during the meal all being fully occupied in listening eagerly and eating heartily  when the dutch fire began to slacken for want of ammunition considine retaliated by opening a british battery and soon learned that marais and his wife both claimed and were not a little proud of a few drops of french blood  their progenitors on the mothers side they said were descended from one of the french huguenot families which settled in the colony after the revocation of the edict of nantes  you see said mynheer marais with a quiet smile of satisfaction as he applied a boiled cob of mealies or indian corn to his powerful teeth our family may be said to be about twothirds dutch and onethird french  in fact we have also a little english blood in our veins for my greatgrandfathers mother was english on the fathers side and dutch on the mothers  perhaps this accounts to some extent for my tendency to adopt some english and american ideas in the improvement of my farm which is not a characteristic of my capedutch brethren  so i have been told and to some extent have seen said considine with a sly glance in fact they appear to be rather lazy than otherwise  not lazy young sir returned marais with some emphasis  they are easygoing and easily satisfied and not solicitous to add to their material comforts beyond a certain pointin short contented with little like frenchmen which is a praiseworthy condition of mind commended in holy writ and not disposed to make haste to be rich like you english  ah i see rejoined considine who observed a twinkle in the eyes of some of mynheers stalwart sons  yes pursued the farmer buttering another mealiecob and commencing to eat it with infinite gusto you see the cape dutchmen although as fine a set of men as ever lived are just a little too contented and slow on the other hand young sir you english are much too reckless and fast  just so interrupted considine bowing his thanks to the hostess for a third venisonsteak which she had put on his plate the dutch too slow the english too fast so that three parts dutch two parts french and one part englishlike a dash of seasoningis it seems the perfect marais mixture  this remark produced a sudden and unintentional burst of laughter from the young maraises not so much on account of the excess of humour contained in it as from the fact that never before had they heard a jest of any kind fabricated at the expense of their father of whom they stood much in awe and for whom they had a profound respect  conrad marais however could take a joke although not much given to making one  he smiled blandly over the edge of his mealiecob  youre right sirright the mixture is not a bad one  the dutch element gives steadiness the english vigour and the french spiritby the way arend he continued turning to one of his stout olivebranches talking of spirit reminds me that you will have to go to work at that leak in the dam with more spirit than usual for we cant afford to lose water in this dry weather  it is not finished i think  no father but we hope to get it done this afternoon  thats well  how many of you are at it  david and i with six totties  old sam is ill and none of the others can be spared today  cant some of your brothers help asked the farmer  losing water is as bad almost as losing gold  joseph meant to come but he started at six this morning to look after the cattle  we hear that the kafirs carried off some of jan smits sheep yesterday  the black scoundrels exclaimed conrad marais with a growl and a frown they are never at rest either in times of peace or of war  the frown passed as quickly as it came and the genial smile habitual to the farmer resumed its place on his countenance as he ran his fingers through the thick masses of his irongrey hair and rose from the table  come mr considine he said putting on his hat are you disposed for a ride  i take a look round the farm every morning to see that things are going straight  will you join me  of course considine gladly assented and hans said he would accompany them while the other sonsexcept of course the younger ones and the baby who was berthas special chargewent out to their various avocations  a few minutes later the three horsemen were cantering over the plain  during the ride considine was again questioned closely as to his future intentions and prospects but without anything very satisfactory being evolved  at last conrad marais pulled up after a long pause in the conversation and while they advanced at a walk saidwell ive been thinking and here is the outcome  you want work mr considine and i want a workman  youve had a good education which i count a priceless advantage  some of my sons have had a little but since i came here the young ones have had none at all worth mentioning  what say you to become a schoolmaster  you stop with me and give the youngsters as much as you think fit of whatever you know and ill give you houseroom and food with a small salary and a hearty welcome  you need not bind yourself  if you dont like it you can leave it  if you do like it you are welcome to stay as long as you please and youll thus have an opportunity of looking about and deciding on your future plans  what say you  considine received the opening sentences of this proposal with a smile but as the farmer went on he became grave and at length seriously entertained the idea  after having slept a night over it he finally resolved to accept the offer and next day was fairly installed as dominie and a member of the farmers family  schoolbooks were ferreted out from the bottom of family chests a hottentots or totties mudhut was converted into a schoolroom six of the farmers sons beginning almost at the foot of the scaleformed a class  reading writing and arithmetic were unfolded to youthful and not unwilling minds even latin was broached by the eldest of the six and during a separate hour in the evening french was taught to bertha  everything in short was put in train and as considine expressed it the marais academy was going full swing when an event occurred which instantly sent french and latin to the rightabout and scattered the three rs to the four winds  this was nothing less than an order from the colonial government to the field cornets on the frontier to engage waggons and oxen from the farmers to be sent to algoa bay for the purpose of conveying the british immigrantsexpected in a few weeksfrom the coast to the various locations destined for their reception  among others conrad marais was to send two waggons and spans of oxen each span consisting of eighteen animals  hans marais was to go in charge and hans resolved to have considine as a companion for the journey down to the coast was longabout 160 milesand the two youths had formed so strong an attachment during their short acquaintance that considine was as anxious to go as his friend could desire  conrad marais having no objection to this arrangement the oxen were inspanned and the day following that on which the order was received they set off towards the shores of the indian ocean  having to pass the residence of jan smit on the way considine seized the opportunity to visit his former crossgrained companion and pay his debt  jan smit was in a more savage humour than usual when the young man walked up to his dwelling  the farmers back was towards him as he approached  he stood nervously switching a sjambok in his right hand while he stormed in dutch at three of his unfortunate people or rather slaves  one was a sturdy hottentot named ruyter one a malay named abdul jemalee both of whom had travelled with considine on the up journey  the third was the bushman whom he had encountered when lost on the karroo and who owing to his inveterate stupidity had been named booby  they had all been implicated in the recent loss of cattle suffered by their savage master who had already flogged the bushman with the sjambok and was furiously interrogating the hottentot  at last he gave him a tremendous cut across the shoulders which immediately raised a dark red bar thereon  ruyters black eyes flashed  he did not wince but drew himself quickly up like a man about to retaliate  jan smit observing and resenting the action at once knocked him down  ruyter slowly rose and staggered away just as considine came up  the youth could not resist the inclination to exclaim shame  who dares cried jan smit turning fiercely round  he paused in mute surprise at sight of his former companion  i dare said considine sternly many a time the word has been on my lips before and now that it has passed them it may go  i came not here however to bully or be bullied but to pay my debt to you  he drew out a leathern purse as he spoke and the dutchman whose spirit was quelled both by the manner and the matter of his visitors remark led the way to his domicile  the house resembled that of conrad marais in form but in nothing else everything in and around it was dirty and more or less dilapidated there was no dam no gardennothing in short but the miserable dwelling and a few surrounding huts with the cattle kraal  having paid his debt considine did not vouchsafe another word but returned at once to the waggons  on the way he overtook ruyter  my poor fellow he said have you no means of redress  can you not complain to some onesome magistrate  complain exclaimed the hottentot fiercely what de use of complain no one care  nobody listenboh no use complain  the man had learnt a smattering of english  he was a short but very powerful fellow and with a more intellectual head and countenance than is common to his race  where are you going just now ruyter asked considine feeling that it was best to change the subject just then  go for inspan de waggin  ordered down to algoa bay for bring up de white men  then we shall probably meet on the road said considine for i am going to the same place  as he spoke they came to a point where the road forked  the hottentot with a sulky goodday took that path which led towards jan smits cattle kraal while considine followed the other and rejoined his waggons  the two friends mounted their horses the drivers set the oxteams in motion and the huge waggons lumbered slowly over the karroo towards the rising sun    chapter three  describes the somewhat curious beginning of settlerlife in south africa  leaping over time and space with that hilarious mental bound which is so easy and enjoyable to writers and readers let us fold our wings at early morn in the month of may and drop down on the heights in the vicinity of algoa bay  the general aspect of the bay is sandy and sterile  on its blue waters many large vessels lie at anchor  some of them are trim with furled sails and squared yards as if they had been there for a considerable time  others have sails and spars loose and awry as if they had just arrived  from these latter many an emigrant eye is turned wistfully on the shore  the rising ground on which we stand is crowned by a little fortress or fortified barrack styled fort frederick around which are the marquees of the officers of the 72nd regiment  below on the range of sandhills which fringe the beach are pitched a multitude of canvas tents and among these upwards of a thousand men women and children are in busy motion  there are only one or two small wooden houses visible and three thatched cottages  down at the waters edge and deep in the surf crowds of soldiers civilians and halfnaked natives are busy hauling on the ropes attached to the large surfboats which are covered to overflowing with human beings  those in the boats as well as those in the surf and on the beach are in a state of high excitement and more or less demonstrative while the seamen from a neighbouring sloop of war who manage the boats shout to the people at the ropes  the replies of these are drowned ever and anon by the roar of falling rollers  these rollers or great waves calm though the morning be come in with giant force from the mighty sea  they are the mere termination of the oceanswell  reader the scene before you marks an epoch of vast importance in south african history  it is the landing of the british settlers in the year 1820  the spot is that on which now stands the flourishing commercial town of port elizabeth styled not inappropriately by its inhabitants the liverpool of south africa  standing near the stern of one of the surfboats his strong right hand grasping the gunwale and his grave eyes fixed on the shore one of the exiles from scotland lifted his voice that day and said  hech sirs its but a puir illfaurd outlandish sort o country  i wad fain hope the hieland hills of our location inland are mair pleasantlookin than this  keep up your spirits sandy black observed a sturdy highlander who stood at his side those who know the country best say that our location is a splendid oneequal to scotland itself if not superior  it may be so mr mctavish replied sandy in a doubtful tone of voice it may be so  hallo suddenly and loudly exclaimed a dapper little man whose voice betokened him english  what ist jerry demanded sandy black turning his eyes seaward in which direction jerry was gazing  the question needed no reply for sandy and indeed all the various people in the barge who stood high enough on its sides or lading to be able to look over the gunwale observed a mighty wave coming up behind them like a green wall  haul hard roared the seamen in charge  ay ay shouted the soldiers on shore  as they spoke the billow lifted the boat as if it had been a cork fell under it with a deafening roar and bore it shoreward in a tumult of seething foam  next moment the wave let it down with a crash and retired leaving it still however in two or three feet of water  eh man but that was a dunt exclaimed sandy tightening his hold on the gunwale while several of his less cautious or less powerful neighbours were sent sprawling into the bottom of the boat among terrified women and children  all was now bustle and tenfold excitement for the soldiers on the beach hurried waistdeep into the sea for the purpose of carrying the future settlers on shore  thomas pringle the leader of the scotch party and who afterwards became known as the south african poet had previously landed in a gig he gave an opportune hint in broad scotch to a tall corporal of the 72nd highlanders to be careful of his countrymen  scotch folk are they exclaimed the corporal with a look of surprise at pringle  never fear sir but we sal be carefu o them  the corporal was as good as his word for he and his comrades carried nearly the whole party ashore in safety  but there were others there who owned no allegiance to the corporal  one of thesea big sallow hottentotchanced to get jerry surnamed goldboy on his shoulders and either by mischance or design stumbled and fell pitching jerry over his head just as another billow from the indian ocean was rushing to the termination of its grand career  it caught jerry up in a loving embrace as he rose and pitched him with a noisy welcome on the shore  weel done jerry cried sandy black who had just been overturned by the same wave from the shoulders of a burly englishmana previously landed settleryou an mes made an impressive landin  come lets git oot o the bustle  so saying the stout lowlander seized his little english friend by the arm and dragged him towards the town of canvas which had within a few weeks sprung up like mushrooms among the sandhills  although wet from head to foot each forgot his condition in the interest awakened by the strange sights and sounds around him  their immediate neighbourhood on the beach was crowded with emigrants as party after party was carried ashore shoulderhigh by the soldiers who seemed to regard the whole affair as a huge practical joke  the noise was indescribable because compound  there was the boisterous hilarity of people who felt their feet once more on solid ground after a long and weary voyage the shouting of sailors and bargemen in the boats and of soldiers and natives on the beach the talking and laughing of men and women who had struck up sudden friendships on landing as well as of those who had crossed the sea together the gambolling and the shrieking delight of children freed from the restraints of shipboard the shouts of indignant government officials who could not get their orders attended to the querulous demands of people whose luggage had gone astray in process of debarkation the bawling of colonial dutch by gigantic dutchafrican farmers in broadbrimmed hats and leathern crackers with big tobaccopipes in their mouths the bellowing of oxen in reply to the pistolshot cuts applied to their flanks by halfnaked hottentots and bushmen whose whips were bamboos of twenty feet or so in length with lashes twice as long the creaking of capewaggons the barking of dogs and as a measured accompaniment to all the solemn regular booming of the restless sea  disengaging themselves from the crowded beach sandy black and jerry goldboy proceeded towards the town of tents among the sandhills  on their way they passed several large tarpaulincovered depots of agricultural implements carpenters and blacksmiths tools and ironware of all descriptions which had been provided by government to be sold to the settlers at prime costfor this grand effort at colonisation was originated and fostered by the british government  weel weel did ever ee see the like o that noo observed sandy black as he passed some sandhills covered with aloes and cactuses and rare exotics such as one might expect to find in english greenhouses  well yes replied jerry goldboy them are hodd lookin wegitables i cant say that ive much knowledge of suchlike myself avin bin born an bred in london as ive often told you but they do seem pecooliar even to mei say look ere i thought all the people ere was settlers  sandy who was a grave man of few words though not without a touch of sly humour replied weel so they arean what than  why wat are them there demanded jerry pointing to several marquees pitched apart among some evergreen bushes  hm ee may ask that replied the scot but as he did not add more his companion was content to regard his words as a confession of ignorance and passed on with the remark haristocrats  jerry was so far right  the marquees referred to belonged to the higher class of settlers who had resolved to forsake their native land and introduce refinement into the south african wilds  the position chosen by them on which to pitch their tents and the neatness of everything around evinced their taste while one or two handsome carriages standing close by betokened wealth  some of the occupants elegantly dressed were seated in campchairs with books in their hands while others were rambling among the shrubbery on the little eminences and looking down on the bustling beach and bay  the tents of these however formed an insignificant proportion of the canvas town in which sandy black and his friend soon found themselves involved  settlers camp as it was called consisted of several hundred tents pitched in parallel rows or streets and was occupied by the middle and lower class of settlersa motley crew truly  there were jolly farmers and palevisaged tradesmen from various parts of england watermen from the thames fishermen from the seaports artisans from town and country agricultural labourers from everywhere and neerdoweels from nowhere in particular  england scotland ireland were representedin some cases misrepresentedand as character was varied the expression of it produced infinite variety  although the british government had professedly favoured a select four thousand out of the luckless ninety thousand who had offered themselves for emigration it is to be feared that either the selection had not been carefully made or drunkenness and riotous conduct had been surprisingly developed on the voyage out charity however requires us to hope that much of the excitement displayed was due to the prospect of being speedily planted in rural felicity in the wilds of africa  conversation at all events ran largely on this theme as our wanderers could easily distinguishfor people talked loudly and all tentdoors were wide open  after wandering for some time sandy black paused and looking down at his little friend with what may be called a grave smile gave it as his opinion that they had got lost in settlerstoon  i do believe we ave assented jerry  whats to be done  gang to the best hotel suggested sandy  but where is the best otel  hm ee may ask that  a burst of noisy laughter just behind them caused the lost ones to turn abruptly when they observed four tall young men of gentlemanly aspect sitting in a small military tent and much amused apparently at their moist condition  why where did you two fellows come from asked one of the youths issuing from the tent  from england and scotland replied jerry goldboy promptly  from the sea i should say returned the youth to judge from your wet garments  ay weve been drookit said sandy black  bring em in jack shouted one of the other youths in the tent  come inside said he who was styled jack and have a glass of whisky theres nothing like whisky to dry a wet skin is there scotty  to this familiar appeal sandy replied mhm which word we may add for the information of foreigners is the scotch for yes  sit down there on the blankets said the hospitable jack we havent got our armchairs or tables made yet  allow me to introduce my two brothers james and robert skyd my own name is the less common one of john  this young man of six feet two with no money and less brain is not a brotheronly a chumnamed frank dobson  come fill up and drink else youll catch a cold or a south african fever if there is such a thing  whom shall i pledge  my name is jerry goldboy said the englishman your health gentlemen  am sandy black said the scot heres tee  well mr black and mr coldboygoldboy interposed jerryi speak for my brothers and friend when i wish you all success in the new land  do talk less jack said robert skyd the youngest brother and give our friends a chance of speakinghave you come ashore lately  just arrived answered jerry  i thought so  you belong to the scotch party that goes to baviaans river i suppose asked frank dobson  this question led at length to a full and free account of the circumstances and destination of each party with which however we will not trouble the reader in detail  dee ken onything aboot baviaans river inquired sandy black after a variety of subjects had been discussed  nothing whatever answered john skyd save that it is between one and two hundred milesmore or lessinland among the mountains and that its name which is dutch means the river of baboons its fastnesses being filled with these gentry  ay ive heard as much mysel returned sandy an they say the craters are gey fierce  are there ony o the big puggies in the albany district  no none  albany is too level for them  it lies along the seacoast and is said to be a splendid country though uncomfortably near the kafirs  the kawfirs  ay  hm said sandy leaving his hearers to form their own judgment as to the meaning of his words  an what may your tred be sir he added looking at john skyd  the three brothers laughed and john replied  trade we have no trade  our profession is that of clerksknights of the quill at least such was our profession in the old country  in this new land my brother bobs profession is fun jims is jollity and mine is a compound of both called joviality  as to our chum dobson his profession may be styled remonstrance for he is perpetually checking our levity as he calls it always keeping us in order and snubbing us nevertheless we couldnt do without him  in fact we may be likened to a social clock of which jim is the mainspring bob the weight i the striking part of the works and dobson the pendulum  but we are not particular we are ready for anything  ay an fit for nothin observed sandy with a peculiar smile and shrug meant to indicate that his jest was more than half earnest  the three brothers laughed again at this and their friend dobson smiled  dobsons smile was peculiar  the corners of his mouth turned down instead of up thereby giving his grave countenance an unusually arch expression  why what do you mean you cynical scot demanded john skyd  our shoulders are broad enough are they not nearly as broad as your own  oo ay yer shoothers are weel aneugh but i wadna gie much for yer heeds or haunds  reply to this was interrupted by the appearance in the opening of the tent of a man whose solemn but kindly face checked the flow of flippant conversation  you look serious orpin has anything gone wrong asked frank dobson  our friend is dying replied the man sadly  he will soon meet his opponent in the land where all is light and where all disputes shall be ended in agreement  orpin referred to two of the settlers whose careers in south africa were destined to be cut short on the threshold  the two men had been earnestly religious but like all the rest of adams fallen race were troubled with the effects of original sin  they had disputed hotly and had ultimately quarrelled on religious subjects on the voyage out  one of them died before he landed the other was the man of whom orpin now spoke  the sudden change in the demeanour of the brothers skyd surprised as well as gratified sandy black  that sedate and literally as well as figuratively longheaded scot had felt a growing distaste to the flippant young englishers as he styled them but when he saw them throw off their light character as one might throw off a garment and rise eagerly and sadly to question orpin about the dying man he felt as mankind is often forced to feel that a first and especially a hasty judgment is often incorrect  stephen orpin was a mechanic and a wesleyan in virtue of which latter connection and a christian spirit he had been made a local preacher he was on his way to offer his services as a watcher by the bedside of the dying man  this man and his opponent were not the only emigrants who finished their course thus abruptly  dr cotton the head of the nottingham party dr caldecott and some others merely came as it were like moses in sight of the promised land and then ended their earthly career  yet some of these left a valuable contribution in their children to the future colony  while black and his friend jerry were observing orpin as he conversed with the brothers skyd the tall burly englishman from whose shoulders the former had been hurled into the sea chanced to pass and quietly grasped the scot by the arm  here you are at last  why man ive been lookin for you ever since that unlucky accident to offer you a change of clothes and a feed in my tentor i should say our tent for i belong to a party like every one else here  come along  thank ee kindly answered sandy but what between haverin wi thae englishers an drinkin their whusky my freen jerry an mes dry aneugh already  the englishman however would not listen to any excuse  he was one of those hearty men with superabundant animal spiritsto say nothing of physiquewho are not easily persuaded to let others follow their own inclinations and who are so goodnatured that it is difficult to feel offended with their kindly roughness  he introduced himself by the name of george dally and insisted on black accompanying him to his tent sandy being a sociable although a quiet man offered little resistance and jerry being a worshipper of sandy followed with gay nonchalance    chapter four  further particulars of settlers town and a start made for the promised land  threading his way among the streets of settlers town and pushing vigorously through the crowds of excited beings who peopled it george dally led his new acquaintances to a tent in the outskirts of the camp a suburban tent as it were  entering it and ushering in his companions he introduced them as the gentlemen who had been capsized into the sea on landing at which operation he had had the honour to assist  there were four individuals in the tent  a huge german labourer named scholtz and his wife  mrs scholtz was a substantial woman of forty she was also a nurse and in soul body and spirit was totally absorbed in a baby boy whose wild career had begun four months before in a furious gale in the bay of biscay  as that infant lay on that day in the bay of biscay o the elemental strife outside appeared to have found a lodgment in his soul for he burst upon the astonished passengers with a squall which lasted longer than the gale and was ultimately pronounced the worst that had visited the ship since she left england  born in a storm the infant was baptised in a stiff breeze by a wesleyan minister on and after which occasion he was understood to be jabez brook but one of the sailors happening to call him junkie on the second day of his existence his nurse mrs scholtz leaped at the endearing name like a hungry trout at a gay fly and junkie he remained during the whole term of childhood  junkies main characteristic was strength of lungs and his chief delight to make that fact known  six passengers changed their berths for the worse in order to avoid him  one who could not change became nearly deranged towards the end of the voyage and one who was seasick all the way out seriously thought of suicide but incapacity for any physical effort whatever happily saved him  in short junkie was the innocent cause of many dreadful thoughts and much improper language on the unstable scene of his nativity  besides these three there was in the tent a pretty darkeyed refinedlooking girl of about twelve  she was gertrude brook sister and idolater of junkie  her father edwin brook and her mother dwelt in a tent close by  brook was a gentleman of small means but mrs brook was a very rich ladyrich in the possession of a happy temper a loving disposition a pretty face and figure and a religious soul thus edwin brook though poor may be described as a man of inexhaustible wealth  gertrude had come into dallys tent to fetch junkie to her father when sandy black and his friends entered but junkie had just touched the hot teapot with the contents of which mrs scholtz was regaling herself and husband and was not in an amiable humour  his outcries were deafening  now do hold its dear little tongue and go to its popsy said mrs scholtz tenderly  mrs scholtz was an englishwoman  we need not say that junkie declined obedience neither would he listen to the silvery blandishments of gertie  zee chile vas born shrieking ant he vill die shrieking growled scholtz who disliked junkie  the entrance of the strangers however unexpectedly stopped the shrieking and before junkie could recover his previous train of thought gertie bore him off in triumph leaving the hospitable dally and mrs scholtz to entertain their visitors to small talk and tea  while seated thus they became aware of a sudden increase of the din whipcracking and oxbellowing with which the camp of the settlers resounded  they seem fond o noise here observed sandy black handing his cup to mrs scholtz to be refilled  i never eard such an owling before said jerry goldboy what is it all about  new arrivals from zee interior answered scholtz dere be always vaggins comin ant goin  the camp is a changin one said dally sipping his tea with the air of a connoisseur  when youve been here as long as we have youll understand how it never increases much for although ship after ship arrives with new swarms of emigrants from the old country waggon after waggon comes from i dont know wheresomewheres inland anyhowand every now an then long trains of these are seen leaving camp loaded with goods and women and children enough to sink a small schooner and followed by crowds of men tramping away to their new homes in the wildernessthough what these same new homes or wilderness are like is more than i can tell  zee noise is great growled scholtz as another burst of whipmusketry human roars and bovine bellows broke on their ears ant zee confusion is indesgraibable  the gentlemen whose business it is to keep order must have a hard time of it said mrs scholtz i cant ever understand how they does it what between landing parties and locating em and feeding supplying advising and despatching of em to say nothing of scolding and snubbing in the midst of all this babel of bubbledom quite surpasses my understanding  do you understand it mr black  ay replied sandy clearing his throat and speaking somewhat oracularly  ee must know mrs scholtz that its the result of organisation and gineralship  a serjeant or corporal can kick or drive a few men in ony direction thats wanted but it takes a gineral to move an army  if ee was to set a corporal to lead twunty thoosand men hed gie them orders that wad thraw them into a deed lock an than naethin short o a miracle could git them oot ot  mony a battles been lost by brave men through bad gineralship an mony a battles been won by puir enough bodies o men because of their leaders administrative abeelity mrs scholtz  very true mr black replied mrs scholtz with the assurance of one who thoroughly understands what she hears  noo continued sandy with increased gravity if thae kawfir bodies we hear aboot only had chiefs wi powers of organisation an was a united thegither they wad drive the haul o this colony into the sea like chaff before the wind  but theyll niver do it for ee see they want mindan body withoot mind is but a puir thing after a mrs scholtz  im not so shure of zat put in scholtz stretching his huge frame and regarding it complacently it vould please me better to have body vidout mint zan mint vidout body  hm eeve reason to be pleased then muttered black drily  this compliment was either not appreciated by scholtz or he was prevented from acknowledging it by an interruption from without for just at the moment a voice was heard asking a passerby if he could tell where the tents of the scotch party were pitched  those in the tent rose at once and sandy black issuing out found that the questioner was a handsome young englishman who would have appeared what he really was both stout and tall if he had not been dwarfed by his companion a capedutchman of unusually gigantic proportions  we are in search of the scottish party said the youth turning to sandy with a polite bow can you direct us to its whereabouts  im no sure that i can sir though im wan o the scotch pairty mysel for me an my freen hae lost oorsels but doobtless mister dally here can help us  may i ask what ee want wi us  certainly replied the englishman with a smile  mr marais and i have been commissioned to transport you to baviaans river in bullockwaggons and we wish to see mr pringle the head of your party to make arrangementscan you guide us mr dally  have you been to the deputyquartermastergenerals office asked dally  yes and they directed us to a spot said to be surrounded by evergreen bushes near this quarter of the camp  i know itjust outside the ridge between the camp and the government officescome along sir said dally ill show you the way  in a few minutes dally led the party to a group of seven or eight tents which were surrounded by scotch ploughs cartwheels harrows cooking utensils firearms and various implements of husbandry and ironware  here come the lost ones exclaimed kenneth mctavish who with his active wife and sprightly daughter jessie was busy arranging the interior of his tent and bringing strangers with them too  while sandy black and his friend jerry were explaining the cause of their absence to some of the scotch party the young englishman introduced his friend and himself as charles considine and hans marais to the leader mr pringle a gentleman who besides being a good poet afterwards took a prominent part in the first acts of that great drama the colonisation of the eastern frontier of south africa  it is unnecessary to trouble the reader with all that was said and done suffice it to say that arrangements were soon made  the acting governor sir rufane donkin arrived on the 6th of june from a visit to albany the district near the sea on which a large number of the settlers were afterwards located and from him mr pringle learned that the whole of the scotch emigrants were to be located in the mountainous country watered by some of the eastern branches of the great fish river close to the kafir frontier  the upper part of the baviaans or baboons river had been fixed for the reception of his particular section  it was also intended by government that a piece of unoccupied territory still farther to the eastward should be settled by a party of five hundred highlanders who it was conjectured would prove the most effective buffer available to meet the first shock of invasion should the savages ever attempt another inroad  mr pringle laid this proposed arrangement before a council of the heads of families under his charge it was heartily agreed to and preparations for an early start were actively begun  on the day of his arrival sir rufane donkin laid the foundation of the first house of the now wealthy and flourishing though not very imposing town of port elizabeth so named after his deceased wife to whose memory an obelisk was subsequently erected on the adjacent heights  a week later a train of seven waggons stood with the oxen inspanned or yoked ready to leave the camp from which many similar trains had previously set out  the length of such a train may be conceived when it is told that each waggon was drawn by twelve or sixteen oxen  these were fastened in pairs to a single trace or trektow of twisted thongs of bullock or buffalo hide strong enough for a ships cable  each waggon had a canvas cover or till to protect its goods and occupants from the sun and rain and each was driven by a tall dutchman who carried a bamboo whip like a salmon fishingrod with a lash of thirty feet or more  a slave hottentot or bushman led the two front oxen of each span  like pistolshots the formidable whips went off the oxen pulled tossed their unwieldy horns and bellowed the dutchmen growled and shouted the halfnaked totties and bushmen flung their arms and legs about glared and gasped like demons the monstrous waggons moved settlers town was slowly left behind and our adventurers heading for the thorny jungles of the zwartkops river began their toilsome journey into the land of hope and promise  its a queer beginning remarked sandy black as he trudged between hans marais and charlie considine  i hope it will have a good ending said considine  whether that hope was fulfilled the reader shall find out in the sequel  meanwhile some of the english parties took their departure by the same route and journeyed in company till points of divergence were reached where many temporary friendships were brought to a close though some there were which although very recently formed withstood firmly the damaging effects of time trial sorrow and separation    chapter five  adventures and incidents of the first night in the bush  a nightbivouac under the mimosabushes of the zwartkops river  the capewaggons are drawn up in various comfortable nooks the oxen are turned loose to graze campfires are kindled  round these men and women group themselves very much as they do in ordinary society classes keep by themselves not because one class wishes to exclude the other but because habits sympathies interests and circumstances draw like to like  the ruddy glare of the campfires contrasts pleasantly with the cold light of the moon which casts into deepest shadow the wild recesses of bush and brake inducing many a furtive glance from the more timid of the settlers who see an elephant a buffalo or a cape tiger in every bank and stump and stone  their suspicions are not so wild as one might suppose for the neighbouring jungle called the addo bush swarms with these and other wild animals  the distance travelled on this first day was not great the travellers were not much fatigued but were greatly excited by novelty which rendered them wakeful  if one had gone round to the numerous fires and played eavesdropper what eager discussion on the new land he would have heard what anxious speculations what sanguine hopes what noble plans what ridiculous ideas what mad anticipationsfor all were hopeful and enthusiastic  round one of these fires was assembled the family and retainers of our highland farmer kenneth mctavish among whom were sandy black and jerry goldboy  they had been joined by charlie considine who felt drawn somewhat to sandy  quite close to these round another fire were grouped the three bachelor brothers skyd with their friend dobson  at another within earshot of these were edwin brook and his wife his daughter gertrude scholtz and his wife junkie george dally and stephen orpin with bluff hans marais who had somehow got acquainted with the brook family and seemed to prefer their society to that of any other  down in a hollow under a thick spreading mimosa bush was the noisiest fire of all for there were assembled some of the natives belonging to the waggons of hans and jan smit  these carried on an uproarious discussion of some sort appealing frequently to our friend ruyter the hottentot who appeared to be regarded by them as an umpire or an oracle  the hottentot race is a very inferior one both mentally and physically but there are among them individuals who rise much above the ordinary level  ruyter was one of these  he had indeed the sallow visage high cheekbones and dots of curly wool scattered thinly over his head peculiar to his race but his countenance was unusually intelligent his frame well made and very powerful and his expression good  he entered heartily into the fun of attempting to teach the hottentot klick to some of the younger men among the emigrants who were attracted to his fire by the shouts of laughter in which the swarthy slaves and others indulged  abdul jemalee the malay slave was there also booby the bushmanthe former grave and silent almost sad the latter conducting himself like a monkeyto which animal he seemed closely relatedand evoking shouts of laughter from a few youths for whose special benefit he kept in the background and mimicked every one else  what a noisy set they are over there observed edwin brook who had for some time been quietly contemplating the energetic george dally as he performed the duties of cook and waiter to his party  they are sir replied dally like niggers in general fond of showing their white teeth  come gertie your mother can spare you now lets go over and listen to them  gertie complied with alacrity and took her fathers arm  oh she exclaimed with a little scream as a thorn full five inches long gave her a wicked probe on the left shoulder  hans marais sprang up and gallantly raised the branch which had touched her  it is only kafirs who can run against mimosa thorns with impunity said the handsome young dutchman  gertie laughed remarked that mimosa thorns like south african gentlemen were unusually long and sharp and passed on  hans sat down on the ground filled his large pipe and gazed dreamily into the fire with something of the sensation of a hunter when he makes a bad shot  now then goliath said the ever busy george dally move your long legs out o that  dont you see the pots about to bile over  hans quietly obeyed  if i chanced to be alongside o that tottie over there just now continued george id be inclined to stop his noise with a rap on his spotted pate  youd have to make it a heavy rap then to produce any effect said hans taking a long draw at his pipe for he belongs to a hardheaded race  the truth of the young farmers words was verified just then in a way that was alarming as well as unexpected  one of the heavy waggons which had been delayed behind the others by some trifling accident came lumbering up just as hans spoke  there was a softish sandy spot in advance of it into which one of the front wheels plunged  the tilt caught on part of the waggon to which ruyter belonged  to prevent damage the active hottentot sprang forward  in doing so he tripped and fell  at the same instant a tremendous crack of the whip and a shout produced a wrench at the waggon the hind wheel of which went over ruyters head and crushed it into the ground  a roar of consternation followed and several eager hands carefully dug out the poor mans head  to the surprise of all the fiveton waggon had not flattened it  the sand was so soft that it had not been squeezed at allat least to any damaging extenta round stone having opportunely taken much of the pressure on itself so that the hottentot soon revived and beyond a headache was little the worse of the accident  he returned to his place at the fire but did not resume his part in the discussions which were continued as noisily as before  in strong contrast with the other groups were those of the dutchafrican boers who had brought the waggons to the bay  most of them were men of colossal stature  they sat apart smoking their huge pipes in silent complacency and comfort amused a little at the scenes going on around them but apparently disinclined to trouble themselves about anything in particular  supper produced a lull in the general hum of conversation but when pipes were lit the storm revived and continued far into the night  at last symptoms of weariness appeared and people began to make arrangements for going to rest  these arrangements were as varied as the characters of the emigrants  charlie considine and hans marais now become inseparable comrades cleared and levelled the ground under a mimosabush and spreading their kaross thereon lay down to sleep  george dally being an adaptable man looked at the old campaigners for a few minutes and then imitated their example  little jerry goldboy being naturally a nervous creature and having his imagination filled with snakes scorpions tarantulas etcetera would fain have slept in one of the waggons above the baggageas did many of the women and childrenif he had not been laughed out of his desire by dally and induced to spread his couch manfully on the bare ground  it must not be supposed however that jerry although timid was cowardly  on the contrary he was bold as a lion  he could not control his sensitivelystrung nervous system but instead of running away like the coward he was prone to rush furiously at whatever startled him and grapple with it  some families pitched their tents others deeming curtains a needless luxury in such magnificent weather contented themselves with the shelter of the bushes  meanwhile the hottentot attendants replenished the fires while the boers unslung their huge guns and placed them so as to be handy for although elephants and lions were not nearly so numerous as they once had been in that particular locality there was still sufficient possibility of their presence as well as of other nocturnal wanderers in the african wilds to render such precaution necessary  the whole scene was most romantic especially in the eyes of those who thus bivouacked for the first time in the wilderness  to them the great waggons the gigantic capeoxenwhich appeared to have been created expressly to match the waggons as well as to carry their own ponderous horns the wildlooking hottentots and bushmen the big phlegmatic dutchmen the bristling thorns of the mimosas cropping out of comparative darkness the varied groups of emigrants the weird forms of the clumps of cactus aloes euphorbias and other strange plants lit up by the fitful glare of the campfires and canopied by the starspangled depths of a southern skyall seemed to them the unbelievable creations of a wild vision  poor jerry goldboy however had sufficient faith in the reality of the vision to increase his nervous condition considerably and he resolved to lie down with his arms handy  these arms consisted of a flintlock blunderbuss an heirloom in his fathers family and a bowieknife which had been presented to him by an american cousin on his leaving england  twice during that days march had the blunderbuss exploded owing to its owners inexperience in firearms  fortunately no harm had been done the muzzle on each occasion having been pointed to the sky but the ire of the dutch driver in front of jerry had been aroused and he was forbidden to reload the piece  now however observing the preparations above referred to he felt it to be his duty to prepare for the worst and quietly loaded his bellmouthed weapon with a heavy charge of buckshot  whats that youre after boy asked george dally who was making some final arrangements at the fire before lying down for the night  oh nothing replied jerry with a start for he had thought himself unobserved only seein to my gun before turnin in  thats right said george  doubleload it  nothin like bein ready for whatever may turn up in a wild country like this  why i once knew a man named snip who said he had been attacked one night in south america by a sarpint full forty feet long and who saved his life by means of a blunderbuss though he didnt fire at the reptile at all  indeed how was that asked jerry  why just because his weapon was bellmouthed an loaded amost to the muzzle  you see the poor fellow was awoke out of a deep sleep and couldnt well see so that instead o firin at the brute he fired his blunderbuss about ten yards to one side of it but the shot scattered so powerfully that one o the outside bullets hit a stone glanced off and caught the sarpint in the eye and though it failed to kill the brute on the spot the wound gave it such pain that it stood up on its tail and wriggled in agony for full five minutes sending broken twigs and dry leaves flying about like a whirlwind so snip he jumped up dropped his weapon an bolted  he never returned to the encampment and never saw the big snake or his blunderbuss again  what a pity then he lost it said jerry looking with some anxiety at a decayed branch to which the flickering flame gave apparent motion  yes he lost the blunderbuss but he saved his life replied dally as he lay down near his little friend and drew his blanket over him youd better put the gun between us my boy to be handy to bothan if anything comes the one of us that wakes first can lay hold of it and fire  there was we need scarcely observe a strong spice of wickedness in george  if he had suggested a lion or even an elephant there would have been something definite for poor jerrys anxious mind to lay hold of and try to reason down and defy but that dreadful anything that might come gave him nothing to hold by  it threw the whole zoological ferocities of south africa open to his unanchored imagination and for a long time banished sleep from his eyes  he allowed the blunderbuss to remain as his friend had placed it and hugged the naked bowieknife to his breast  in addition to these weapons he had provided himself with a heavy piece of wood something like the exaggerated truncheon of a policeman for the purpose of killing snakes should any such venture near his couch  the wild shrieks of laughter at the neighbouring hottentot fire helped to increase jerrys wakefulness and when this at last lulled the irritation was kept up by the squalling of master junkie whose tent was about three feet distant from jerrys pillow and who kept up a vicious piping just in proportion to the earnestness of mrs scholtzs attempts to calm him  at last however the childs lamentations ceased and there broke upon the night air a sweet sound which stilled the merriment of the natives it was the mellow voice of stephen orpin singing a hymn of praise with a number of likeminded emigrants before retiring to rest  doubtless some of those who had already retired and lay perchance watching the stars and thinking dreamily of home were led naturally by the sweet hymn to think of the home in the better land which might possibly be nearer to some of them than the old home they had left for everay even than the new locations to which they were bound  but whatever the thoughts suggested the whole camp soon afterwards sank into repose  tentdoors were drawn and curtains of waggontilts let down  the boers sticking their big pipes in their hatbands wrapped themselves in greatcoats and regardless of snake or scorpion stretched their limbs on the bare ground while hottentots negroes and bushmen rolling themselves in sheepskin karosses lay coiled up like balls with their feet to the fire  only once was the camp a little disturbed during the early part of the night by the mournful howl of a distant hyena  it was the first that the newcomers had heard and most of those who were awake raised themselves on their elbows eagerly to listen  jerry was just dropping into slumber at the time  he sat bolt upright on hearing the cry and when it was repeated he made a wild grasp at the blunderbuss but dally was beforehand  he caught up the weapon and this probably saved an explosion  come lie down you imp he said somewhat sternly  jerry obeyed and his nose soon told that he had reached the land of dreams  dally then quietly drew the charge of shot but left the powder and laid the piece in its former position  turning over with the sigh of one whose active duties for the day have been completed he then went to sleep  gradually the fires burned low and gave out such flickering uncertain light when an occasional flame leaped up ever and anon that to unaccustomed eyes it might have seemed as though snakes were crawling everywhere and jerry goldboy had he been awake would have beheld a complete menagerie in imagination  but jerry was now in blessed oblivion  when things were in this condition that incomprehensible subtlety the brain of junkie brookor something elseso acted as to cause the urchin to give vent to a stentorian yell  strong though it was it did not penetrate far through the canvas tent but being as we have said within a few feet of jerrys ear it sounded to that unhappy man like the united and as yet unknown shriek of all the elephants and buffaloes in kafirland  starting up with a sharp cry he stretched out his hand towards the blunderbuss but drew it back with a thrill of horror  a huge black snake lay in its place  to seize his truncheon was the act of a moment  the next down it came with stunning violence on the snake  the reptile instantly exploded with a bellowing roar of smoke and flame which roused the whole camp  blockhead what dyou mean by that growled george dally turning round sleepily but without rising for he was well aware of the cause of the confusion  jerry shrank within himself like a guilty thing caught in the act and glanced uneasily round to ascertain how much of death and destruction had been dealt out  relieved somewhat to see no one writhing in blood he arose and in much confusion replied to the numerous eager queries as to what he had fired at  when the true state of affairs became manifest most of the dutchmen who had been active enough when aroused by supposed danger sauntered back to their couches with a goodnatured chuckle the settlers who had turned out growled or chaffed according to temperament as they followed suit and the natives spent half an hour in uproarious merriment over boobys dramatic representation of the whole incident which he performed with graphic power and much embellishment  thereafter the camp sank once more into repose and rested in peace till morning    chapter six  spreading over the land  with the dawn next morning the emigrants were up and away  the interest of the journey increased with every novel experience and each new discovery while preconceived notions and depressions were dissipated by the improved appearance of the country  about the same time that the scotch party left the bay several of the other parties set out some large and some small each under its appointed leader to colonise the undulating plains of the zuurveld  soon the pilgrims became accustomed to the nightly serenade of hyena and jackalalso to breakneck steeps and crashing jolts and ugly tumbles but they were all hopeful and most of them were young and all or nearly all were disposed to make light of difficulties  the country they were about to colonise had been recently overrun by kafir hordes  these had been cleared out and driven across the great fish river by british and colonial troops leaving the land a wilderness with none to dispute possession save the wild beasts  it extended fifty miles along the coast from the bushmans river to the great fish river and was backed by an irregular line of mountains at an average distance of sixty miles from the sea  leaving the zwartkops river not only the scottish party but all the other parties filed successively away in long trains across the sundays river over the addo hill and the quagga flats and the bushmans river heights until the various points of divergence were reached when the column broke into divisions which turned off to their several locations and overspread the land  there was baillies party which crossed lower albany to the mouth of the great fish river and on the way were charmed with the aspect of the country which was at that time enriched and rendered verdant by recent rains and enlivened by the presence of hartebeests quaggas springboks and an occasional ostrich  there was however a wash of shadow laid on part of the pleasant picture to counteract the idea that the elysian plains had been reached in the shape of two or three blackened and ruined farms of the old dutch colonistssad remains of the recent kafir warsolemn reminders of the uncertainties and possibilities of the future  then there was the nottingham party  they took possession of a lovely vale which they named clumber in honour of the duke of newcastle their patron  seftons party settled on the assegai bush river and founded the village of salem afterwards noted as the headquarters of the reverend william shaw a wesleyan and one of the most able and useful of south africas missionary pioneers  wilsons party settled between the waayplaats and the kowie bush across the path of the elephants which creatures some of the party it is said attempted to shoot with fowlingpieces  of the smaller parties those of cock thornhill smith what series of adventurous parties ever went forth without a smiths party osler and richardson located themselves behind the thicketclad sand hills of the kowie and green fountain  but space forbids us referring even in brief detail to the parties of james and hyman and dyson and holder mouncey hayhurst bradshaw southey and of scott with the irish party and that of mahony which at the clay pits had afterwards to meet the first shock of every kafir invasion of lower albany  among these and other parties there were men of power who left a lasting mark on the colony and many of them left numerous descendants to perpetuate their namessuch as dobson bowker campbell ayliffe phillips piggott greathead roberts stanley and others too numerous to mention  but with all these we have nothing to do just now  our present duty is to follow those sections of the great immigrant band with the fortunes of which our tale has more particularly to do  at the points of separation where the long column broke up a halt was made while many farewells and good wishes were said  so youre gaun to settle thereawa said sandy black to john skyd and his brothers as they stood on an eminence commanding a magnificent view of the rich plains and woodlands of the zuurveld  even so friend black replied john and sorry am i that our lot is not to be cast together  however lets hope that we may meet again ere long somewhere or other in our new land  it is quite romantic observed james skyd to look over this vast region and call it our ownat least with the right to pick and choose where we feel inclined  isnt it bob  to this bob replied that it was and that he felt quite like the children of israel when they first came in sight of the promised land  i hope we wont have to fight as hard for it as they did remarked frank dobson  its my opeenion said sandy black that if we haena to fight for it well hae to fight a bit to keep it  perhaps we may returned john skyd and if so fighting will be more to my taste than farmingnot that im constitutionally pugnacious but i fear that my brothers and i shall turn out to be rather ignorant cultivators of the soil  honest sandy black admitted that he held the same opinion  well we shall try our best said the elder skyd with a laugh ive a great belief in that word trygoodbye sandy  he held out his hand  the scot shook it warmly and the freeandeasy brothers after bidding adieu to the rest of the scotch party who overtook them there diverged to the right with their friend frank dobson and walked smartly after their waggons which had gone on in advance  stoot chields they are an pleesant muttered sandy leaning both hands on a thick cudgel which he had cut for himself out of the bush but wofu ignorant o farmin  theyll make their mark on the colony for all that said a quiet voice at sandys elbow  turning and looking up as well as round he encountered the hazel eyes and open countenance of hans marais  nae doot nae doot theyll mak their mark but itll no be wi the pleugh or im sair mistaen  wull mair o the settlers be pairtin frae us here  hans although ignorant of the dialect in which he was addressed understood enough to make out its drift  yes he replied several parties leave us at this point and here comes one of them  as he spoke the cracking of whips announced the approach of a team  a moment later and a small hottentot came round a bend in the road followed by the leading pair of oxen  it was the train of edwin brook who soon appeared riding a small horse  george dally walked beside him  scholtz the german followed conversing with the owner of the waggon  in the waggon itself mrs brook mrs scholtz and junkie found a somewhat uneasy restingplace for being new to the style of travel they had not learned to accommodate themselves to jolts and crashes gertie preferred to walk the pace not being more than three miles an hour  oh father said gertie running up to the side of her sire with girlish vivacity there is the tall dutchman who was so polite to me when i was pricked by the thorn bush  true gertie and there also is the scot who was so free and easy in giving his opinion as to the farming powers of the brothers skyd  your road diverges here sir said hans as brook rode up i fell behind my party to bid you godspeed and to express a hope that we may meet again  thanks friend thanks said brook extending his hand  i am obliged for the aid you have rendered me and the advice given which latter i shall no doubt find valuableyou are bound for the highlands of course he added turning to sandy black  we of the albany lowlands must have a friendly rivalry with you of the highlands and see who shall subdue the wilderness most quickly  this remark sent the scot into a rather learned disquisition as to the merits and probable prospects of a hill as compared with a lowlying region during which hans marais turned to gertie  being so very tall he had to stoop as well as to look down at her pretty face though gertie was by no means short for her age  indeed she was as tall as average women but being only twelve was slender and girlish  how very tall you are mr marais she exclaimed with a laugh as she looked up  true gertie said hans using the only name which he had yet heard applied to the girl true we capedutchmen are big fellows as a race and i happen to be somewhat longer than my fellows  i hope you dont object to me on that account  object oh no  but it is so funny to have to look up so high  its like speaking to father when hes on horseback  well gertie extra height has its advantages and its inconveniences doubtless it was given to me for some good end just as a pretty little face and figure were given to you  you are very impudent mr hans  am i  then i must ask your pardon  but tell me gertie what do you think of the new life that is before you  how stupid you are hans  if the new life were behind me i might be able to answer but how can i tell how i shall like what i dont know anything about  nay but you know something of the beginning of it returned the young dutchman with an amused smile and you have heard much of what is yet to come  what do you think of the prospect before you  think of the prospect repeated gertie knitting her brows and looking down with a pretended air of profound thought let me see the prospect as ive heard father say to motherwhich was just a repetition of what i had heard him previously say to these queer brothers skydis a life in the bushby which i suppose he means the bushesin which we shall have to cut down the trees plough up the new soil build our cottages rear our sheep and cattle milk our cows make our butter grow our food and sometimes hunt it fashion our clothing and protect our homes  is that right  well thats just about it was the answer how do you like that prospect  i delight in it cried the girl with a flash in her brilliant black eyes while she half laughed at her own sudden burst of enthusiasm only fancy mother milking the cows and me making butter and scholtz ploughing and dally planting and nurse tending junkie and making all sorts of garments while father goes out with his gun to shoot food and protect us from the kafirs  tis a pleasant picture returned hans with a bland smile and i hope may be soon realisedi must bid you goodbye now gertie we separate here  do you go far away asked the girl with a touch of sadness as she put her little hand into that of the young giant  a goodish bit  some six or eight days journey from hereaccording to the weather  youll come and see us some day wont you hans  jai will replied hans with emphasis  the whips cracked again the oxen strained the lumbering waggons groaned as they moved away and while the scotch band passed over the zuurbergen range and headed in the direction of the winterberg mountains their english friends spread themselves over the fertile plains of albany  a few days of slow but pleasant journeying and romantic nightbivouacking brought the latter to their locations on the kowie and great fish river  on the way the party to which edwin brook belonged passed the ground already occupied by the large band of settlers known as chapmans party which had left algoa bay a few weeks before them in an imposing procession of ninetysix waggons  they had been accompanied to their future home by a small detachment of the cape corps the officer in command of which gave them the suggestive advice on bidding them goodbye never to leave their guns behind them when they went out to plough  although so short a time located this party had produced a marvellous change in the appearance of the wilderness and gave the settlers who passed farther eastward an idea of what lay before themselves  fields had already been marked out the virgin soil broken up timber cut and bush cleared while fragile cottages and huts were springing up here and there to supplant the tents which had given the first encampments a somewhat military aspect  grotesque dwellings these many of them with mats and rugs for doors and white calico or empty space for windows  it was interesting in these first locations to mark the development of character among the settlers  those who were practical examined the lie of the land and the nature of the soil with a view to their future residence  timid souls chose their sites with reference to defence  men of sentiment had regard to the picturesque and careless fellows squatted in the first convenient spot that presented itself  of course errors of judgment had to be corrected afterwards on all hands but the power to choose and change was happily great at first as well as easy  as brooks party advanced portions of it dropped off or turned aside until at last edwin found himself reduced to one family besides his own even this he parted from on a ridge of land which overlooked his own location and about noon of the same day his waggons came to a halt on a grassy mound which was just sufficiently elevated to command a magnificent view of the surrounding country  your location said his dutch waggondriver with a curious smile as though he should say i wonder what youll do with yourselves  but the dutchman made no further remark  he was one of the taciturn specimens of his class and began at once to unload the waggon  with the able assistance of brook and his men and the feeble aid of the tottie or hottentot leader of the span of oxen the boxes ploughs barrels bags cases etcetera which constituted the worldly wealth of the settlers were soon placed on the green sward  then the dutchman said goedendag or farewell shook hands all round cracked his long whip and went off into the unknown wilderness leaving the brook family to its reflections    chapter seven  the location  in the midst of the confused heap of their property edwin brook sat down on a large chest beside his wife and daughter and gazed for some time in silence on his new estate and home  to say truth it was in many respects a pleasant prospect  a bright blue sky overhead a verdant earth around  grassy hills and undulations of rich pastureland swept away from their feet like a green sea until stopped in the far distance by the great blue sea itself  these were dotted everywhere with copses of the yellowflowered mimosabush through openings in which the glitter of a stream could be seen while to the left and behind lay the dark masses of a dense jungle filled with arboreous and succulent plants acacias and evergreens wildlooking aloes tall euphorbias quaint cactuses and a great variety of flowering shrubsfilled also as was very soon discovered with antelopes snakes jackals hyenas leopards and other wild creatures the only familiar objects which broke the wild beauty of the scene were the distant white specks which they knew to be the tents just put up by those settlers who chanced to be their next neighbours  may god protect and bless us in our new home said edwin brook breaking the silence and reverently taking off his cap  a heartfelt amen was murmured by mrs brook and gertie but a strange though not unpleasant feeling of loneliness had crept over their spirits inducing them to relapse into silence for they could not avoid realising strongly that at last they were fairly left alone to fight the great battle of life  edwin brook in particular on seeing the long team of the dutch driver disappear over a distant ridge was for the first time deeply impressed with as it were the forsaken condition of himself and his family  it was plain that he must take root there and growor die  there was no neighbouring town or village from which help could be obtained in any case of emergency no cart or other means of conveyance to remove their goods from the spot on which they had been left no doctor in case of sickness no minister in cases either of joy or sorrowexcept indeed and it was a blessed exception him who came to our world not to be ministered unto but to minister  strong in the comfort that this assurance gave edwin brook shook off the lethargy that had been stealing over him and set about the duties of the present hour  the tent had to be pitched the trunks and boxes conveyed into it a fire kindled the kettle boiled the goods and chattels piled and secured from the weather firewood cut to prepare for the nightbivouac etcetera  much of this work was already in progress for george dallywith that ready resource and quiet capacity of adaptation to circumstances which he had displayed on the voyage out and on the journey to the location had already kindled a fire sent scholtz to cut firewood and was busy erecting the tent when brook joined him  thats right george he said seizing a tentpeg and mallet we have plenty to do here and no time to waste  very true sir replied george touching his cap for george was an innately respectful manrespectful to all though with a strong tendency to humorous impudence very true sir thats just what i thought when i see you ameditatin so i went to work at once without wastin any time  is zat enough asked scholtz staggering up at the moment with a heavy load of firewood which he threw on the ground  the question was put to george for whom the big german had a special regard and whose orders he consequently obeyed with unquestioning alacrity although george had no special right to command  enough exclaimed george with a look of surprise why zat is not enough to scare a weasel with much less a elephant or aa platzicumroggijoo  george was ignorant of south african zoology and possessed inventive powers  bring ten times as much he added we shall have to keep a blazin bonfire agoin all night  scholtz reshouldered his axe and went off to the jungle with a broad grin on his broader countenance  he was a man who did not spare himself yet of a temperament that kicked at useless labour and of a size that forbade the idea of compulsion but george dally could have led him with a packthread to do anything  before he had reached the jungle and while the smile was yet on his visage his blood was curdled and his face elongated by a most appalling yell  it was not exactly a warwhoop nor was it a cry of pain though it partook of both and filled the entire family with horror as they rushed to the tent on the mound from which the cry had issued  the yell had been given by junkie who had been bitten or stung by something and who under the combined influence of surprise agony and wrath had outjunkied himself in the fervour and ferocity of his indignant protest  the poor child was not only horrified but inconsolable  he wriggled like an eel and delivered a prolonged howl with intermittent bursts for full half an hour while his distracted nurse and mother almost tore the garments off his back in their haste to discover the bite or the brute that had done it  it must have bin a serpent cried the nurse agonising over a knotted string  perhaps a tarantula suggested gertie who only clasped her hands and looked horrified  quick exclaimed mrs brook breaking the unmanageable tape  ze chile is growing black and vill bust murmured scholtz in real alarm  it did seem as if there were some likelihood of such a catastrophe for junkies passion and struggles had rendered him blue in the face but it wes found that the bite or sting whichever it was had done little apparent damage and as the child cried himself out and sobbed himself to sleep in half an hour without either blackening or bursting the various members of the family were relieved and resumed their suspended labours  the shades of evening had fallen and among other orbs of night the stars of that much too highly complimented constellation the southern cross had for some time illumined the sky before these labours were completed and the wearied brook family and household retired to rest with weapons ready at hand and fires blazing  wild beaststo whose cries they were by that time accustomedsoon began their nightly serenade and carried it on till morning but they were not wild enough to disturb the newcomers with anything more formidable than sound  next morning early george dally was the first to bestir himself  on taking a general view of surrounding nature he observed a thin column of smoke rising above the treetops in the direction of the stream or river to which reference has already been made  perhaps its kafirs thought george  following up that thought he returned to what we may style his lairthe place where he had spent the nightunder a mimosabush and there girded himself with a belt containing a long knife  he further armed himself with a fowlingpiece  thus accoutred he sallied forth with the nonchalant air of a sportsman taking his pleasure  going down to the stream and following its course upwards he quickly came in sight of the campfire whose smoke had attracted his attention  a tall man in dishabille was bending over it coaxing the flame to kindle some rather green wood over which a large iron pot hung from a tripod  the fire was in front of a large but not deep cavern in the recesses of which three slumbering figures were visible  drawing cautiously nearer george discovered that the man at the fire was john skyd and of course jumped to the conclusion that the three slumbering figures were his brothers and friend  these enterprising knights of the quill having found what they deemed a suitable spot had selected a cave for their residence as being at once ready and economical  now george dally being gifted with a reckless as well as humorous disposition suddenly conceived the idea of perpetrating a practical joke  perhaps junkies performances on the previous evening suggested it  flinging his cap on the ground he ran his fingers through his thick hair until it stood up in wild confusion and then deliberately uttering a hideous and quite original warwhoop he rushed furiously towards the cave  the brothers skyd and company proved themselves equal to the occasion for they received him at the cavern mouth with the muzzles of four doublebarrelled guns and a stern order to halt  next moment the muzzles were thrown up as they exclaimed in surprise  why dally is it you  didnt you hear it gasped george supporting himself on the side of the cavern  hear what  the warwhoop  of course we didat least we heard a most unearthly yell  what was it  wed best go out and see cried george cocking his gun if it was kafirs the sooner we follow them up the better  not so friend george said frank dobson in a slightly sarcastic tone  if it was kafirs they are far beyond our reach by this time and if they mean us harm we are safer in our fortress here  my opinion is that we should have our breakfast without delay and then we shall be in a fit state to face our foeswhether they be men or beasts  acting on this suggestion with a laugh the brothers leaned their guns against the wall of the cavern and set about the preparation of breakfast in good earnest  meanwhile george gravely assented to the wisdom of their decision and sat down to his morning pipe while he questioned the brothers as to their intentions  they pointed out to him the spot where they thought of commencing agricultural operations and the site of their future dwellingclose they said to the cave because that would be conveniently near the river which would be handy for both washing drinking and boiling purposes  thats truewery true said george but it seems to me you run a risk of bein washed away house and all if you fix the site so low down for ive heard say there are floods in these parts now and again  oh no fear of that said robert skyd who was the quietest of the three brothers dont you see the foundation of our future house is at least ten feet above the highest point to which the river seems to have risen in times past  ah just so responded george with the air of a man not convinced  besides added john skyd lifting the iron pot off the fire and setting it down i suppose that floods are not frequent so we dont need to trouble ourselves about emcome dally youll join us  no thank ee  much obleeged all the same but ive got to prepare breakfast for our own partygoin to begin plantin soon  as soon as ever we can get the soil broken up replied dobson  studied farmin inquired george  not much but we flatter ourselves that what we do know will be of some service to us said john  dally made no reply but he greatly doubted in his own mind the capacity of the brothers for the line of life they had chosen  his judgment in this respect was proved correct a week later when he and edwin brook had occasion to visit the brothers whom they found hard at work ploughing and sowing  come this looks businesslike exclaimed brook heartily as he shook hands with the brothers youve evidently not been idle  i have just come to ask a favour of you gentlemen  we shall grant it with pleasure if within our powers said robert skyd who leaned on a spade with which he had been filling in a trench of about two feet deep  it is that you will do me and mrs brook the pleasure of coming over to our location this afternoon to dinner  it is our gerties birthday she is thirteen today  in a rash moment we promised her a treat or surprise of some sort but really the only surprise i can think of in such an outoftheway place is to have a dinnerparty in her honour will you come  the brothers at once agreed to do so remarking however that they must complete the sowing of their carrotseed before dinner if possible  what did you say you were sowing asked brook with a peculiar smile  carrotseed answered robert skyd  if your carrotseed is sown there said george dally pointing with a broad grin to the trench its very likely to come up in england about the time it does hereby sendin its roots right through the world  how what do you mean  the truth is my dear sir said brook goodhumouredly that youve made a slight mistake in this matter  carrotseed is usually sown in trenches less than an inch deep  youd better leave off work just now and come over to my place at once  ill give you some useful hints as we walk along  the knights of the quill laughed at their mistake and at once threw down their implements of husbandry  but on going over their farm brook found it necessary to correct a few more mistakes for he discovered that the active brothers had already planted a large quantity of indian corn or mealies entire without knocking it off the cobs and in another spot of ground a lot of young onions were planted with the roots upwards  you see miss gertie said john skyd when commenting modestly on these mistakes at dinnertime my brothers and i have all our lives had more to do with the planting of houses and the growth of commercial enterprise than with agricultural products but we are sanguine that with experience and perseverance we shall overcome all our difficulties  have you found many difficulties to overcome  gertie was not sure she thought she had found a few but none worth mentioning  being somewhat put out by the question she picked up a pebblefor the dinner was a species of picnic served on the turf in front of mr brooks tentand examined it with almost geological care  my daughter does not like to admit the existence of difficulties said mrs brook coming to the rescue and to say truth is seldom overcome by anything  oh ma how can you said gertie blushing deeply  thats not true cried mr brook excuse me my dear for so flat a contradiction but i have seen gertie frequently overcome by thingsby junkies obstinacy for instance which i verily believe to be an insurmountable difficulty and ive seen her thoroughly overcome night after night by sleepisnt that true lass  i suppose it is father since you say so but of course i cannot tell  sleep continued brook with a laugh why would you believe it mr skyd i went into what we call the nurserytent one morning last week to try to stop the howling of my little boy and i found him lying with his open mouth close to gerties cheek pouring the flood of his wrath straight into her ear and she sound asleep all the time  my nurse mrs scholtz told me she had been as sound as that all night despite several heavy squalls and notwithstanding a chorus of hyenas and jackals outside that might almost have awakened the deadby the way that reminds me just as i was talking with nurse that morning we heard a most unearthly shriek at some distance off  it was not the least like the cry of any wild animal i have yet heard and for the first time since our arrival the idea of kafirs flashed into my mind  did any of you gentlemen happen to hear it  the brothers looked at each other and at their friend dobson and then unitedly turned their eyes on george dally whoperforming the combined duties of cook and waiter at a fire on the ground not fifteen feet to leeward of the dinnerpartycould hear every word of the conversation  why yes said john skyd we did hear it and so did your man dally we had thought  the truth is sir said george advancing with a miniature pitchfork or tormentor in his hand pardon my interrupting you siri did hear the screech but as i couldnt say exactly for certain you know that it was a kafir not havin seen one i thought it best not to alarm you sir an so said nothing about it  you looked as if you had seen one observed frank dobson drawing down the corners of his mouth with his peculiar smile  did i sir said george with a simple look very likely i did for im timersome by nature an easily frightened  you did not act with your wonted wisdom george in concealing this said edwin brook gravely  im afraid i didnt sir returned george meekly  in future be sure to let me know every symptom of danger you may discover no matter how trifling said brook  yes sir  it was a very tremendous yell wasnt it dally asked john skyd slily as the waitercook was turning to resume his duties at the fire  wery sir  and alarmed us all dreadfully didnt it  oh dreadfully sirspecially me though i must in dooty say that you four gentleman was as bold as brass  it quite relieved me when i saw your tall figurs standin at the mouth o your cavern an the muzzles o your four doublegunsthats eight shotswith your glaring eyes an pale cheeks behind them  ha exclaimed john skyd with a grim smilebut after all it might only have been the shriek of a baboon  i think not sir replied george with a smile of intelligence  perhaps then it was the cry of a zebra or quagga returned john skyd or a south african ass of some sort  wery likely sir retorted george  i shouldnt wonder if it was which is wery consolin to my feelins for id sooner be terrified out o my wits by asses of any kind than fall in with these longlegged savages that dwell in caves  with an appearance of great humility george returned to his work at the fire  it was either owing to a sort of righteous retribution or a touch of that fortune which favours the brave that george dally was in reality the first of this particular party of settlers to encounter the black and naked inhabitant of south africa in his native jungle  it was on this wise  george was fond of sport when not detained at home by the claims of duty  but these claims were so constant that he found it impossible to indulge his taste save as he was wont to say in the early morn and late at eve  one morning about daybreak shouldering his gun and buckling on his huntingknife he marched into the jungle in quest of an antelope experience had taught him that the best plan was to seat himself at a certain opening or pass which lay on the route to a pool of water and there bide his time  seating himself on a mosscovered stone he put his gun in position on his knee with the forefinger on the trigger and remained for some time so motionless that a north american indian might have envied his powers of selfrestraint  suddenly a twig was heard to snap in the thicket before him  next moment the striped black and yellow skin of a leopard or cape tiger appeared in the opening where he had expected to behold a deer  dallys gun flew to his shoulder  at the same instant the leopard skin was thrown back and the right arm of a tall athletic kafir was bared  the hand grasped a light assagai or darting spear  both men were taken by surprise and for one instant they glared at each other  the instance between them was so short that death to each seemed imminent for the white mans weapon was a deadly one and the cast of the lithe savage would doubtless have been swift and sure  in that instant of uncertainty the white mans innate spirit of forbearance acted almost involuntarily  dally had hitherto been a man of peace  the thought of shedding human blood was intensely repulsive to him  he lowered the butt of his gun and held up his right hand in token of amity  the savage possessed apparently some of the good qualities of the white man for he also at once let the butt of his assegai drop to the ground although he knew what dally was not aware of that considering the nature of their weapons he placed himself at a tremendous disadvantage in doing sothe act of throwing forward and discharging the deadly firearm being much quicker than that of poising and hurling an assagai  without a moments hesitation george dally advanced and held out his right hand with a bland smile  although unfamiliar with kafir customs he had heard enough from the dutch farmers who drove the oxteams to know that only chiefs were entitled to wear the leopard skin as a robe  the tall form and dignified bearing of the savage also convinced him that he had encountered no ordinary savage  he also knew that the exhibition of a trustful spirit goes a long way to create goodwill  that his judgment was correct appeared from the fact of the kafir holding out his hand and allowing george to grasp and shake it  but what to do next was a question that puzzled the white man sorely although he maintained on his goodnatured countenance an expression of easy nonchalance  of course he made a vain attempt at conversation in english to which the kafir chief replied with dignified condescension by a brief sentence in his own tongue  as george dally looked in his black face thoughts flashed through his brain with the speed of light  should he kill him outright  that would be simple murder in the circumstances and george objected to murder on principle  should he suddenly seize and throw him down  he felt quite strong enough to do so but after such a display of friendship it would be mean  should he quietly bid him good morning and walk away this he felt would be ridiculous  at that moment tobacco occurred to his mind  he quietly rested his gun against a tree and drew forth a small roll of tobacco from which he cut at least a foot and handed it to the chief  the dignity of the savage at once gave way before the beloved weed  he smiledthat is he grinned in a ghastly way for his face besides being black was streaked with lines of red ochreand graciously accepted the gift  then george made an elaborate speech in dumbshow with hands fingers arms and eyes to the effect that he desired the kafir to accompany him to his location but the chief gravely shook his head pointed in another direction and to the sun as though to say that time was on the wing then throwing his leopardskin robe over his right shoulder with the air of a spanish grandee he turned aside and strode into the jungle  george glad to be thus easily rid of him also turned and hurried home  this time he was not slow to let his employer know that he had met with a native  it behoves us to keep a sharp lookout george said brook  i heard yesterday from young merton that some of the settlers not far from his place have had a visit from the black fellows who came in the night and while they slept carried off some of the sheep they had recently purchased from an upcountry county dutchman  we will watch for a few nights while rumours of this kind are afloat  when all seems quiet we can take it easy  let scholtz take the first watch  you will succeed him and i will mount guard from the small hours onward  for some days this precaution was continued but as nothing more was heard of black marauders the brook family gradually ceased to feel anxious and the nightly watch was given up    chapter eight  shows the pleasures pains and penalties of housekeeping in the bush  dont you think this a charming life asked mrs brook of mrs merton who had been her guest for a week  mrs merton was about thirty years of age and opinionated if not strongminded also rather pretty  she had married young and her eldest son a lad of twelve had brought her from her husbands farm some three miles distant from that of edwin brook  no mrs brook i dont like it at all was mrs mertons emphatic reply  indeed said mrs brook in some surprise  she said nothing more after this for some time but continued to ply her needle busily while mrs scholtz who by some piece of unusual good fortune had got junkie to sleep plied her scissors in cutting out and shaping raw material  the two dames with the nurse and gertie had agreed to unite their powers that day in a resolute effort to overtake the household repairs they were in a cottage now of the style familiarly known as wattle and dab which was rather picturesque than permanent and suggestive of simplicity  they sat on rude chairs made by scholtz round a rough table by the same artist  mrs brook was busy with the rends in a blue pilotcloth jacket a dilapidated remnant of the old england wardrobe the nurse was forming a sheep skin into a pair of those unmentionables which were known among the capecolonists of that period by the name of crackers  mrs merton was busy with a pair of the same the knees of which had passed into a state of nonentity while other parts were approaching the same condition  gertie was engaged on a pair of socks whose original formation was overlaid by and nearly lost in subsequent deposits  why do you like this sort of life mrs brook asked mrs merton suddenly  because it is so new so busy so healthy so thoroughly practical such a constant necessity for doing something useful and a constant supply of something useful to do and then such a pleasant feeling of rest when at last you do get your head on a pillow  oh its delightful interpolated gertie in a low voice  well now that is strange  everything depends on how one looks at thingswhat do you think mrs scholtz asked mrs merton  ive got no time to think maam replied the nurse giving the embryo crackers a slice that bespoke the bold fearless touch of a thorough artist  when junkies not asleep he keeps body and brain fully employed and when he is asleep im glad to let body and brain alone  what is your objection to this life mrs merton asked mrs brook with a smile  oh  ive no special objection only i hate it altogether  how is it possible to like living in a wilderness with no conveniences around one no society to chat with no books to read and above all no shops to go to where one is obliged to drudge at menial work from morning till night and ones boys and girls get into rags and tatters and ones husband becomes little better than a navvy to say nothing of snakes and scorpions in ones bed and boots and the howling of wild beasts all night  i declare one might as well live in a menagerie  but you must remember that things are in a transition state just now rejoined mrs brook  as we spread and multiply over the land things will fall more into shape  we shall have tailors and dressmakers to take the heavy part of our work in this way and the wild beasts will retire before the rifle and the plough of civilised man no doubt also shops will come in due course  and what of the kafirs cried mrs merton sternly  do you flatter yourself that either the plough or the rifle will stop their thievish propensities  have we not learned when too latefor here we are and here we must bidethat the black wretches have been at loggerheads with the white men ever since this was a colony and is it not clear that gentle treatment and harsh have alike failed to improve them  wise treatment has yet to be tried said mrs brook  fiddlesticks returned mrs merton impatiently  what do you call wise treatment  gospel treatment replied mrs brook  oh come now you know that that has also been tried and has signally failed  have we not heard how many hundreds of socalled black converts in this and in other colonies are arrant hypocrites or at all events give way before the simplest temptations  i have also heard returned mrs brook of many hundreds of socalled white christians whose lives prove them to be the enemies of our saviour and who do not even condescend to hypocrisy for they will plainly tell you that they make no pretence to be religious though they call themselves christians  but that does not prove gospel treatment among the english to have been a failure  you have heard i daresay of the hottentot robber africaner who was long the terror and scourge of the district where he lived but who under the teaching of our missionary mr moffat or rather i should say under the influence of gods holy spirit has led a righteous peaceful christian life for many years  he is alive still to prove the truth of what i say  ill believe it when i see it returned mrs merton with a decisive compression of her lips  well many people have testified to the truth of this and some of these people have seen africaner and have believed  humph returned mrs merton  this being an unanswerable argument mrs brook smiled by way of reply and turned a sleeve inside out the better to get at its dilapidations changing the subject she desired gertie to go and prepare dinner as it was approaching noon  what shall i prepare mother asked gertie laying down her work  youd better make a hash of the remains of yesterdays leg of mutton dear it will be more quickly done than the roasting of another leg and we cant spare time on cookery today  i daresay mrs merton will excuse  mrs brook interrupted mrs merton with that spartanlike selfdenial to which she frequently laid claim without however the slightest shadow of a title i can eat anything on a emergency  have the hash by all means  and im afraid mrs merton continued mrs brook in an apologetic tone that we shall have to dine without bread todaywe have run short of flour  my husband having heard that the thomases have recently got a large supply has gone to their farm to procure some but their place is twelve miles off so he cant be back till night  you wont mind i trust  mrs merton vowed that she didnt mind became more and more spartanic in her expression and sentiments and plied her needle with increased decision  just then gertie reentered the cottage with a face expressive of concern  mother theres no meat in the larder  no meat child  you must be mistaken  we ate only a small part of yesterdays leg  oh maam exclaimed the nurse dropping the scissors suddenly and looking somewhat guilty i quite forgot maam to say that master before he left this morning and while you was asleep maam ordered me to give all the meat we had in the house to scholtz as he was to be away four or five days and would require it all so i gave him the leg that was hanging up in the larder and master himself took the remains of yesterdays leg bidding me be sure to tell george to kill a sheep and have meat ready for dinner  oh well it doesnt matter said mrs brook we shall just have to wait a little longer  nurse looked strangely remorseful  but maam she said and paused  well nurse  i forgot maamindeed i didto tell george to kill a sheep  mrs brooks hands and work fell on her lap and she looked from mrs scholtz to her visitor and from her to the anxious gertie without speaking  why whats the matter asked mrs merton  my dear replied mrs brook with a touch of solemnity george dally our man asked me this morning if he might go into the bush to cut rafters for the new kitchen and i gave him leave knowing nothing of what arrangements had been made beforeandandin short theres not a man on the place andtheres nothing to eat  the four females looked at each other in blank silence for a few seconds as the full significance of their circumstances became quite clear to them  mrs merton was the first to recover  now said she while the spartanic elements of her nature became intensified we must rise to this occasion like true women we must prove ourselves to be not altogether dependent on man we must face the difficulty sink the natural tenderness of our sex andandkill a sheep  she laid down the crackers on the table with an air of resolution and rose to put her fell intent in execution  but the carrying out of her plan was not so easy as the good lady had at the first blush of the thing imagined it would be  in the first place like other heroes and heroines she experienced the enervating effects of opposition and vacillating purpose in others  you must all help me she said with the air of a commanderinchief  help you to kill a sheep maam said mrs scholtz with a shudder ill die first  i couldnt do it and i wouldnt for my weight in gold  notwithstanding the vehemence of her protestation the nurse stood by and listened while the other conspirators talked in subdued tones and with horrified looks of the details of the contemplated murder  i never even saw the dreadful deed done said mrs brook becoming pale as she thought of it  oh mamma much better go without meat we could dine on cakes suggested gertie  but my love there is not a cake or an ounce of flour in the house  women exclaimed mrs merton severely we must rise to the occasion i am hungry now and it is not yet noon what will be our condition if we wait till night for our dinner  this was a homethrust  the conspirators shuddered and agreed to do the deed  gertie in virtue of her youth was exempted from taking any active part but an unaccountable fascination constrained her to follow and be a witnessin short an accomplice  do you know wherewherethe knife is kept asked mrs merton  mrs scholtz knew and brought it from the kitchen  it was a keen serviceable knife with a viciously sharp point  mrs merton received it coughed and hurried out to the sheepfold followed by her accomplices  to catch a sheep was not difficult for the animals were all more or less tame and accustomed to gentle treatment by the females but to hold it was quite another thing  mrs merton secured it by the head mrs scholtz laid hold of the tail and mrs brook fastened her fingers in the wool of its back  each female individually was incapable of holding the animal though a very small one had been purposely selected but collectively they were more than a match for it  after a short struggle it was laid on its side and its feet were somewhat imperfectly secured with a pockethandkerchief  now maam cried mrs scholtz holding tight to the tail and shutting her eyes do be quick  mrs merton also shutting her eyes struck feebly with the knife  the others having likewise shut their eyes waited a few seconds in a state of indescribable horror and then opened them to find that the spartan lady had missed her mark and planted her weapon in the ground  so feeble however had been the stroke that it had barely penetrated an inch of the soil  oh mrs merton exclaimed mrs brook remonstratively  mrs merton tried again more carefully and hit the mark but still without success  it wont go in she gasped as on opening her eyes a second time she found only a few drops of blood trickling from a mere scratch in the sheeps neck ii cant do it  at that moment the unfortunate animal suddenly freed its head from the spartan matrons grasp  a sharp wriggle freed its tail and feet and in another moment it burst away from its captors and made for a shallow pond formed by edwin brook for a colony of household ducks  roused to excessive indignation by the weakness and boastfulness of mrs merton mrs scholtz sprang to her feet and gave chase  the others joined  hunger shame determination disappointment combined to give them energy of purpose  the sheep rushed into the pond  mrs scholtz recklessly followedup to the kneescaught it by the horns and dragged it forth  give me the knife she shouted  mrs merton hurriedly obeyed and the nurse shutting her eyes plunged it downwards with a wild hysterical shriek  there was no mistake this time  letting the animal go she fled redhanded into the innermost recess of the cottage followed by her horrified friends  oh what have i done groaned mrs scholtz burying her face in her hands  mrs brook and the othersall shudderingsought to soothe her and in a short time they regained sufficient composure to permit of their returning to the victim which they found lying dead upon the ground  having thus got over the terrible first step the ladies hardened themselves to the subsequent processes and these they also found more difficult than they had anticipated  the skinning of a sheep they did not understand  of the cutting up they were equally ignorant and a terrible mess they made of the poor carcass in their varied efforts  in despair mrs brook suggested to mrs scholtz who was now the chief and acknowledged operator that they had better cut it up without skinning and singe off the wool and skin together but on attempting this mrs scholtz found that she could not find the joints and being possessed of no saw could not cut the bones whereupon mrs merton suggested that she should cut out four slices from any part that would admit of being penetrated by a knife and leave the rest of the operation to be performed by dally on his return  this proposal was acted on  four fat slices were cut from the flanks and carried by gertie to the kitchen where they were duly cooked and afterwards eaten with more relish than might have been expected considering the preliminaries to the feast  this was one of those difficulties that did not occur to them again  it was a preventable difficulty to be avoided in future by the exercise of forethought but there were difficulties and troubles in store against which forethought was of little avail  while they were yet in the enjoyment of the chops which had caused them so much mental and physical pain they were alarmed by a sudden cry from junkie  looking round they saw that urchin on his knees holding on to the side of his homemade crib and gazing in blank amazement at the hole in the wall which served for a window  and well might he gaze for he saw the painted face of a black savage looking in at that window  on beholding him mrs merton uttered a scream and mrs brook an exclamation  mrs scholtz and gertie seemed bereft of power to move or cry  perhaps the kafir took this for the british mode of welcoming a stranger  at all events he left the window and entered by the door being quite naked with the exception of the partial covering afforded by a leopardskin robe his appearance was naturally alarming to females who had never before seen a native of south africa in his warpaint they remained perfectly still however and quite silent while he went through the cottage appropriating whatever things took his fancy  he was the native whom we have already introduced as having been met by george dally though of course the brook household were not aware of this  a few other savages entered the cottage soon after and were about to follow the example of their chief and help themselves but he sternly ordered them to quit and they submissively obeyed  when he had gone out without having condescended to notice any of the household master junkie gave vent to a longsuspended howl and claimed the undivided attention of mrs scholtz whose touching blandishments utterly failed in quieting him  the good nurse was unexpectedly aided however by the savage chief who on repassing the window looked in and made his black face supernaturally hideous by glaring at the refractory child  junkie was petrified on the spot and remained good till forgetfulness and sleep overpowered him  meanwhile mrs merton swooned into a chairor appeared to do soand mrs brook recovering from her first alarm went out with gertie to see what the black marauders were about  they were just in time to see the last tail of their small flock of sheep and their still smaller herd of cattle disappear into the jungle driven by apparently a score of black lithe and naked devils so ugly and unearthly did the kafirs seem on this their first visit to the unfortunate settlers  it was a peculiarly bitter trial to the brooks for the herd and flock just referred to had been acquired after much bargaining from a dutch farmer only a few days before and edwin brook was rather proud of his acquisition seeing that few if any of the settlers had at that time become possessors of live stock to any great extent  it was however a salutary lesson and the master of mount hopeso he had named his locationnever again left his wife and family unguarded for a single hour during these first years of the infant colony    chapter nine  off to the highlands and black snakes in the bush  while the settlers of this section were thus scattering far and wide in more or less numerous groups over the fertile plains of lower albany the scotch party was slowly laboriously toiling on over hill and dale jungle and plain towards the highlands of the interior  the country through which the long line of waggons passed was as varied as can well be imagined being one of the wildest and least inhabited tracts of the frontier districts  the features of the landscape changed continually from dark jungle to rich parklike scenery embellished with graceful clumps of evergreens and from that again to the sterility of savage mountains or parched and desert plains  sometimes they plodded wearily over the karroo for twenty miles or more at a stretch without seeing a drop of water  at other times they came to a wretched mud hovel the farmhouse of a boer near a permanent spring of water again they were entangled among the rugged roadless gorges and precipices of a mountain range through which no vehicle of european construction could have passed without absolute demolition and up parts of which the capewaggons were sometimes compelled to go by means of two teamsthat is from twenty to thirty or more oxenbeing attached to each  at other times they had to descend and reascend the precipitous banks of rivers whose beds were sometimes quite dry and paved with mighty boulders  its an unco rough country observed sandy black to charlie considine as they stood watching the efforts of a double team to haul one of their waggons up a slope so rugged and steep that the mere attempt appeared absolute madness in their eyes  considine assented but was too much interested in the process to indulge in further remark  gin the rope brek continued sandy i wadna gie muckle for the waggon  itll come rowin an stottin doon the hill like a bairns ba  no fear of the rope said hans marais as he passed at the moment to render assistance to ruyter jemalee booby and some others who were shouting at the pitch of their voices and plying the long waggonwhips or the short sjamboks with unmerciful vigour  hans was right  the powerful trektow stood the enormous strain and the equally powerful waggon groaned and jolted up the stony steep until it had nearly gained the top when an unfortunate drop of the right front wheel into a deep hollow combined with an unlucky and simultaneous elevation of the left back wheel by a stone turned the vehicle completely over on its side  the hoops of the tilt were broken and much of the lading was deposited in a hollow beside the waggon but a few of the lighter and smaller articles went hopping or according to sandy black stottin down the slope and were smashed to atoms at the bottom  ruyter booby and jemalee turned towards hans marais with a shrinking action as if they expected to feel the sjambok on their shoulders for their own cruel master was wont on occasions of mischance such as this to visit his men with summary punishment but hans was a good specimen of another and we believe much more numerous class of capedutchmen after the first short frown of annoyance had passed he went actively to work to set the example of unloading the waggon and repairing the damage administering at the same time however a pretty sharp rebuke to the drivers for their carelessness in not taking better note of the form of the ground  that night in talking over the incident with ruyter considine ventured again to comment on the wrongs which the former endured and the possibility of redress being obtained from the proper authorities  for i am told he said that the laws of the colony do not now permit masters to lash and maltreat their slaves as they once did  ruyter though by nature a goodhumoured easygoing fellow was possessed of an unusually high spirit for one of his race and could never listen to any reference to the wrongs of the hottentots without a dark frown of indignation  in general he avoided the subject but on the night in question either his wonted reticence had fled or he felt disposed to confide in the kindly youth from whom on the previous journey from capetown he had experienced many marks of sympathy and goodwill  there be no way to make tings better he replied fiercely  i knows noting bout your laws  only knows dey dont work somehow  allers de same wid me anyhow kick and cuff and lash wen is wrongsometimes wen is rightand nebber git tanks for noting  but that is because your master is an unusually bad fellow replied considine  few cape farmers are so bad as he  you have yourself had experience of hans marais now who is kind to every one  ja he is good masteran sos hims fadder an all hims peepilbut what good dat doos to me returned the hottentot gloomily  it is true your laws do not allow us to be bought and sold like de slaves but dat very ting makes de masters hate us and hurt us more dan de slaves  this was to some extent true  at the time we write of slavery being still permitted in the british colonies the dutch and other cape colonists possessed great numbers of negro slaves whom it was their interest to treat well as being valuable property and whom most of them probably did treat well as a man will treat a useful horse or ox though of course there wereas there always must be in the circumstancesmany instances of cruelty by passionate and brutal owners  but the hottentots or original natives of the south african soil having been declared unsaleable and therefore not property were in many cases treated with greater degradation by their masters than the slaves were made to work like them but not cared for or fed like them because not so valuable  at the same time although not absolute slaves the hottentots were practically in a state of servitude in which the freedom accorded to them by government had by one subterfuge or another been rendered inoperative  not long before this period the colonists possessed absolute power over the hottentots and although recent efforts had been made to legislate in their favour their wrongs had only been mitigatedby no means redressed  masters were it is true held accountable by the law for the treatment of their hottentots but were rarely called to account and the hottentots knew too well from sad experience that to make a complaint would be in many cases worse than useless as it would only rouse the ire of their masters and make them doubly severe  you say de hottentots are not slaves but you treat us all de same as slavesanyhow jan smit does  that is the sin of jan smit not of the british law replied considine  ruyters face grew darker as he rejoined fiercely what de use of your laws if dey wont work  besides what right hab de white scoundril to make slave at allwhether you call him slave or no call him slave look at jemalee  the hottentot pointed with violent action to the malay who with a calm and sad but dignified mien stood listening to the smalltalk of booby while the light of the campfire played fitfully on their swarthy features  well what of jemalee asked considine  you know dat hims a slavea real slave  yes i know that poor fellow  you never hear how him was brought up here  no nevertell me about it  hereupon the hottentot related the following brief story  abdul jemalee a year or two before had lived in capetown where his owner was a man of some substance  jemalee had a wife and several children who were also the property of his owner  being an expert waggondriver the malay was a valuable piece of human goods  on one occasion jan smit happened to be in capetown and hearing of the malays qualities offered his master a high price for him  the offer was accepted but in order to avoid a scene the bargain was kept secret from the piece of property and he was given to understand that he was going up country on his old masters business  when poor jemalee bade his pretty wife and little ones goodbye he comforted them with the assurance that he should be back in a few months  on arriving at smits place however the truth was told and he found that he had been separated for ever from those he most loved on earth  for some time abdul jemalee gave way to sullen despair and took every sort of abuse and cruel treatment with apparent indifference but as time went on a change came over him  he became more like his former self and did his work so well that even the savage jan smit seldom had any excuse for finding fault  on his last journey to the cape smit took the malay with him only part of the way  he left him in charge of a friend who agreed to look well after him until his return  even this crushing of jemalees hope that he might meet his wife and children once more did not appear to oppress him much and when his master returned from capetown he resumed charge of one of the waggons and went quietly back to his home in the karroo  and can you tell what brought about this change asked considine  oh ja i knows replied ruyter with a decided nod and a deep chuckle jemalee hims got a powerful glitter in hims eye now and denbery powerful an strange  and what may that have to do with it asked considine  ruyters visage changed from a look of deep cunning to one of childlike simplicity as he repliedcant go for to say what de glitter of hims eye got to do wid it  snakes eyes glitter sometimesspose cause he cant help it or hes wicked praps  considine smiled but seeing that the hottentot did not choose to be communicative on the point he forbore further question  what a funny man jerry goldboy is said jessie mctavish as she sat that same evening sipping a pannikin of tea in her fathers tent  from the opening of the tent the fire was visible  jerry was busy preparing his supper while he kept up an incessant run of smallchat with booby and jemalee  the latter replied to him chiefly with grave smiles the former with shouts of appreciative laughter  he is funny asserted mrs mctavish and uncommonly noisy  i doubt if there is much good in him  more than you think mopsy said kenneth by this irreverent name did the highlander call his betterhalf jerry goldboy is a small package but hes made of good stuff depend upon it  no doubt hes a little nervous but ive observed that his nerves are tried more by the suddenness with which he may be surprised than by the actual danger he may chance to encounter  on our first night out when he roused the camp and smashed the stock of his blunderbuss no doubt i as well as others thought he showed the white feather but there was no lack of courage in him when he went last week straight under the tree where the tiger was growling and shot it so dead that when it fell it was not far from his feet  i heard some of the men papa observed jessie say that it was dutch courage that made him do that  what did they mean by dutch courage  jessie being little more than eight was ignorant of much of the worlds slang  capesmoke my dear answered her father with a laugh  capesmoke exclaimed jessie what is that  brandy child peachbrandy much loved by some of the boers im told and still more so by the hottentots but there was no more capesmoke in jerry that day than in you  it was true english pluck  no doubt he could hardly fail to make a dead shot at so close a range with such an awful weapon loaded as it usually is with handfuls of slugs buckshot and gravel but it was none the less plucky for all that  the old flintlock might have missed fire or he mightnt have killed the brute outright and in either case he knew well enough it would have been all up with jerry goldboy  whos that taking my name in vain said jerry himself passing the tent at the moment in company with sandy black  we were only praising you jerry cried jessie with a laugh for the way in which you shot that tiger the other day  it wasnt a teeger miss jessie interposed sandy black it was only a leopardane o thae wee spottit beasts that theyre sae prood o in this country as to ca them teegers  come sandy cried jerry goldboy dont rob me of the honour that is my due  the hanimal was big enough to ave torn you limb from limb if ed got old of you  it may be sae but he wasna a teeger for a that retorted blackdee know sir he continued turning to mctavish that mr pringles been askin for ee  no sandy but now that youve told me ill go to his tent  so saying the highlander rose and went out to attend a council of heads of families  hitherto we have directed the readers attention chiefly to one or two individuals of the scotch party but there were in that party a number of families who had appointed mr pringle their head and representative  in this capacity of chiefhead or leader mr pringle was in the habit of convening a meeting of subordinate heads when matters of importance had to be discussed  while the elders of the party were thus engaged in conclave at the door of their leaders tent and while the rest were busy round their several fires a man with a body much blacker than the night was secretly gliding about the camp like a huge snake now crouching as he passed quickly but without noise in rear of the thick bushes now creeping on hands and knees among the waggons and oxen and anon gliding almost flat on his breast up to the very verge of the light thrown by the campfires  at one and another of the fires he remained motionless like the blackened trunk of a dead tree with his glittering eyes fixed on the settlers as if listening intently to their conversation  whatever might be the ultimate designs of the kafirfor such he was his intentions at the time being were evidently peaceful for he carried neither weapon nor shield  he touched nothing belonging to the white men though guns and blankets and other tempting objects were more than once within reach of his hand  neither did he attempt to steal that which to the kafir is the most coveted prize of alla fat ox gradually he melted away into the darkness from which he had emerged no eye in all the emigrant band saw him come or go in his snakelike glidings yet his presence was known to one of the partyto ruyter the hottentot  soon after the kafir had taken his departure ruyter left his campfire and sauntered into the bush as if to meditate before lying down for the night  as soon as he was beyond observation he quickened his pace and walked in a straight line like one who has a definite end in view  the hottentot fancied that he had got away unperceived but in this he was mistaken  hans marais having heard considines account of his talk with ruyter about jemalee had been troubled with suspicions about the former which led to his paying more than usual attention to him  these suspicions were increased when he observed that the hottentot went frequently and uneasily into the bushes and looked altogether like a man expecting something which does not happen or appear  when therefore he noticed that after supper ruyters anxious look disappeared and that after looking carefully round at his comrades he sauntered into the bush with an overdone air of nonchalance he quietly took up his heavy gun and followed him  the youth had been trained to observe from earliest childhood and having been born and bred on the karroo he was as well skilled in tracking the footprints of animals and men as any red savage of the north american wilderness  he took care to keep the hottentot in sight however the night being too dark to see footprints  lithe and agile as a panther he found no difficulty in doing so  in a few minutes he reached an open space in which he observed that the hottentot had met with a kafir and was engaged with him in earnest conversation  much however of what they said was lost by hans as he found it difficult to get within earshot unobserved  and why he at length heard the savage demand why should i spare them for an hour  he spoke in the kafir tongue in which the hottentot replied and with which young marais was partially acquainted  because hintza said ruyter naming the paramount chief of kafirland the time has not yet come  one whose opinion you value bade me tell you so  what if i choose to pay no regard to the opinion of any one demanded the chief haughtily  ruyter quietly told the savage that he would then have to take the consequences and urged in addition that it was folly to suppose the kafirs were in a condition to make war on the white men just then  it was barely a year since they had been totally routed and driven across the great fish river with great slaughter  no warrior of common sense would think of renewing hostilities at such a timetheir young men slain their resources exhausted  hintza had better bide his time  in the meanwhile he could gratify his revenge without much risk to himself or his young braves by stealing in a quiet systematic way from the white men as their herds and flocks increased  besides this ruyter assuming a bold look and tone which was unusual in one of his degraded race told hintza firmly that he had reasons of his own for not wishing the scotch emigrants to be attacked at that time and that if he persisted in his designs he would warn them of their danger in which case they would certainly prove themselves men enough to beat any number of warriors hintza could bring against them  lying flat on the ground with head raised and motionless hans marais listened to these sentiments with much surprise for he had up to that time regarded the hottentot as a meek and longsuffering man but now though his longsuffering in the past could not be questioned his meekness appeared to have totally departed  the kafir chief would probably have treated the latter part of ruyters speech with scorn had not his remarks about sly and systematic plunder chimed in with his own sentiments for hintza was preeminently falsehearted even among a race with whom successful lying is deemed a virtue though when found out it is considered a sin  he pondered the hottentots advice and apparently assented to it  after a few moments consideration he turned on his heel and reentered the thick jungle  well was it for hans marais that he had concealed himself among tall grass for hintza chanced to pass within two yards of the spot where he lay  the kafir chief had resumed the weapons which for convenience he had left behind in the bush while prowling round the white mans camp and now stalked along in all the panoply of a savage warriorchief with oxhide shield bundle of short sharp assagais leopardskin robe and feathers  for one instant the dutchman supposing it impossible to escape detection was on the point of springing on the savage but on second thoughts he resolved to take his chance  even if hintza did discover him he felt sure of being able to leap up in time to ward off his first stab  fortunately the kafir was too much engrossed with his thoughts  he passed his white enemy and disappeared in the jungle  meanwhile the hottentot returned to the campassuming an easygoing saunter as he approached its firesand soon after hans marais reentered it from an opposite direction  resolving to keep his own counsel in the meantime he mentioned the incident to no one but after carefully inspecting the surrounding bushes and stirring up the watchfires he sat down in front of his leaders tent with the intention of keeping guard during the first part of the night    chapter ten  the location on the river of baboons  the scotch immigrants at last found themselves in the wild mountainregions of the interior after a weary but deeply interesting march of nearly two hundred miles  they had now arrived at the mouth of the baboons or baviaans river one of the affluents of the great fish river and had already seen many of the wild inhabitants of its rugged glen  their particular location was a beautiful wellwatered region among the mountains which had been forfeited by some of the frontier boers at the time of their insurrection against the english government some years before  they had now crossed the great fish river and though still within the old boundary of the colony were upon its utmost eastern verge  the country beyond as we are told by pringle in his graphic account of the expedition see note 1 for a distance of seventy miles to the new frontier at the chumi and keisi rivers had been the preceding year forcibly depeopled of its native inhabitants the kafirs and ghonaquas and now lay waste and void a howling wilderness occupied only by wild beasts and haunted occasionally by wandering banditti of the bushman race bosjesmen who were represented as being even more wild and savage than the beasts of prey with whom they shared the dominion of the desert  just before their arrival at this point the old waggons with the drivers who had accompanied them from algoa bay were exchanged for fresh teams and men and here ruyter jemalee and booby left them to proceed over a spur of one of the mountain ranges to jan smits farm on the karroo  but hans marais having taken a fancy to some of the scotch men determined to proceed with them until he had seen them fairly established in their new homes  of course charlie considine accompanied hans  in a wild spot among the mountains they were hospitably received at the solitary abode of a fieldcornet named opperman who said that he had orders to assist them with an escort of armed boers over the remaining portion of their journey and to place them in safety on their allotted ground  this remaining portion he told them was up the baviaans river glen and although little more than twentyfive miles would prove to be harder than any part of the journey they had yet encountered  remembering some of the breakneck gorges of the zuurberg jerry goldboy said that he didnt believe it possible for any route to be worse than that over which they had already passed to which sandy black replied with a humph and an opinion that the fieldcornet o the distric was likely to know what he was speakin aboot  but jerry never had been and of course never could be convinced by reason  nothing he candidly admitted but hard facts had the least weight with him  eeve got hard facs noo jerry said sandy about noon of the following day as he threw down the axe with which he had been hewing the jungle and pulled off his hat from the crown of which he took a red cotton handkerchief wherewith to wipe his thicklybeaded brow  jerry could not deny the truth of this for he also had been engaged since early morning with a south african axe nearly as large as himself in assisting to out a passage up the glen  not only was there no road up this mountain gorge but in some parts it was scarcely possible to make one so rugged was the ground so dense the jungle  but the preliminary difficulties were as nothing compared to those which met them further up yet it was observable that the dutch waggoners faced them with the quiet resolution of men accustomed to the overcoming of obstacles  youd go up a precipice hans i do believe if there was no way round it said considine as he gazed in admiring wonder at his tall friend driving his oxen up an acclivity that threatened destruction to waggon beasts and men  at ony rate hed try remarked sandy black with one of his grave smiles  hans was too busy to heed these remarks if he heard them for the oxen being restive claimed his undivided attention and the wielding of the twentyfoot whip taxed both his arms muscular though they were  when the long line of emigrants had slowly defiled through the poort or narrow gorge of the mountains from which baviaans river issues into the more open valley where it joins the great fish river they came suddenly upon a very singular scene and a still more singular man  in the middle of the poort they found a small farm where tremendous precipices of naked rock towered all round so as to leave barely sufficient space on the bank of the river for the houses and cattlefolds with a wellstocked garden and orchard  there was also a small plot of cornland on the margin of the stream  tis a little paradise exclaimed kenneth mctavish as he and considine joined a knot of men on a knoll whence they had a good view of the little farm  its an unco rocky paradise observed sandy black an the angelic appendages o wings wadna be unsuitable to its inhabitants for it seems easier to flee oot ot ower the precipices than to scramble intilt ower the rocks an rooten trees  i wonder wha it belangs to  hans marais who came up at the moment explained that it belonged to a dutch boer named prinsolo who had been a leader some years before in a rebellion but had been pardoned and allowed to retain his lands youve sometimes said you thought me a big fellow considine remarked hans and i cant gainsay you but you shall see a much bigger fellow if prinsolo is at home for hes a giant even among cape dutchmen  we call him groot willem big william for he is burly and broad as well as tallperhaps he is taking his noon nap added hans moving forward he seldom lets even a single waggon come so near withoutah  i thought so  as he spoke a peculiarly deep bass yawn was heard inside the principal house of the farm to which the party now drew near  next moment a heavy thump sounded as if on the floor and immediately after there issued from the open door a veritable giant in his shirtsleeves  groot willem was rough shaggy and rugged as a giant ought to be  he was also sluggish in his motions goodhumoured and beaming as many of the dutch giants are  appropriately enough on beholding the settlers he uttered a deep bass halloo which was echoed solemnly by the mighty cliffs at his back  it was neither a shout of alarm nor surprise for he had long been aware that this visit was pending but a hasty summons to his household to turn out and witness the stirring and unwonted sight  it might have been supposed that a giant whose kindred had been deprived of their lands by the british government and some of whom had been executed for high treason would have regarded the british immigrants with no favourable eye but groot willem appeared to have a large heart in his huge body for he received the advanceguard of the party with genuine hospitality  perhaps he was of an unusually forgiving spirit or it may be that his innate sense of justice led him to recognise the demerit of himself and his kindred or perchance he was touched by the leniency extended to himself but whatever the cause he shook the newcomers heartily by the hand said he regarded them as next doorneighbours started the echoes of the precipiceswhich he styled krantzesand horrified the nearest baboons with shouts of bass laughter at every word from himself or others which bore the remotest semblance to a joke and insisted on as many of the strangers as could be got into his house drinking to their better acquaintance in homemade brandy the same deadly beverage was liberally distributed to the men outside and groot willem wound up his hospitalities by loading the party with vegetables pomegranates lemons and other fruits from his garden as he sent them on their way rejoicing  soon afterwards he followed them to aid in forcing a passage up the valley  in return as a slight acknowledgment of gratitude hans supplied the giant with a little powder and lead and mr pringle gave his family a few dutch tracts and hymnbooks  wondersll niver cease in this land said sandy black to jerry goldboy as they left the farm  thats true sandy its a houtrageous country  to think continued the scot that we should foregather wi goliath amang the heeland hills o afriky an him fond o his dram taehech man look thereat the puggies  he pointed as he spoke to a part of the precipice where a group of baboons were collected gazing indignantly and chattering furiously at the intruders on their domain  the ursine baboon is not naturally pugnacious but neither is he timid or destitute of the means of defence  on the contrary he is armed with canine teeth nearly an inch long and when driven to extremities will defend himself against the fiercest wolfhound  he usually grapples his enemy by the throat with his fore and hind pawstakes a firm bite with his formidable tusks and tears and tugs till he sometimes pulls away the mouthful  many a stout baboon has in this manner killed several dogs before being overpowered  it is said that even the leopard is sometimes attacked and worried by baboons but it is only collectively and in large bands that they can oppose this powerful enemy and baboons are never the aggressors  it is only in defence of their young that they will assail him  the strong attachment of these creatures to their young is a fine trait in their character  this quality has been shown on many occasions especially when the creatures have been engaged in orchardrobbingfor they are excessively fond of fruit and remarkably destitute of conscience  on such occasions when hunted back to the mountains with dogs the females when separated accidentally from their young have been seen to return to search for them through the very midst of their pursuers being utterly regardless of their own safety  the group to which black now directed attention consisted of several females with a number of young ones  they were all huddled in a cleft of the precipice looking down in apparent surprise at the strangers on a neighbouring height sat a big old satyrlike male who had been placed there as a sentinel  baboons are wise creatures and invariably place sentinels on points of vantage when the females and their young are feeding on the nutritious bulbs and roots that grow in the valleys the old gentleman in question had done his duty on the first appearance of the human intruders  he had given a roar of warning the forty or fifty baboons that were down near the river had scampered off precipitately dashed through the stream or leaped over it where narrow hobbled awkwardly on allfours over the little bit of level ground and clambered with marvellous agility up the cliffs till they had gained the ledge from which they now gazed and chattered feeling confident in the safety of their position  did iver ee see the like  theyre almost human said sandy  just look at that big grandmother with the blue face and the little baby on er back exclaimed jerry  how dyou know shes a grandmother asked considine  wy because shes much fonder of the baby than its own mother could be  as he spoke one of the party below them fired and the echoes sprang in conflict from the surrounding heights as a bullet whizzed over their heads and hit the rocks sending a shower of harmless chips and dust among the baboons  with a shriek of consternation they scattered and fled up the heights at racing speed  a burst of laughter from the settlersall the more hearty that no damage had been doneincreased the terror inspired by the shot and seemed to invest the animals with invisible wings  tallyho shouted considine in excitement  the black ane for ever cried sandy  ill back the grey one with the short tail said kenneth mctavish coming up at the moment although she has two little ones clinging to her  ten to one cried jerry bending eagerly forward on the bluenosed grandmother wi the baby on her back  it did indeed seem as if jerrys favourite was going to reach the top of the crags before any of the other horrified creatures for she was powerful as well as large and her burden was particularly small  the infant required no assistance but clung to its dam with its two little hands like a limpet so that she could use her limbs freely  but an unusually long and vigorous bound chanced to loosen the little ones grasp  it fell off with a pitiful shriek and with an imploring upward look on its miserable countenance clasped its little hands in mute despair  granny or mammawe know not whichwith the quick intuition of a great general took in the whole position like a flash of light  she turned on the ledge she had gained and dropped her tail  baby seized it and clambered up  then away she went like a rocket and before the little one had well regained its former position she had topped the ridge full two yards ahead of the whole troop  well done cried mctavish  huzza shouted jerry  brute exclaimed considine striking up the muzzle of a gun which was pointed at the grandmother and child by a panting young idiot who rushed up at the moment would you commit murder  the gun exploded and sent its ball straight to the new moon which early though it was had begun to display the washedout horns of its first quarter in the sky  confound you cried the socalled brute who was by no means a coward throwing down his gun and hitting considine a heavy blow on the chest  charlie returned on the forehead and sent the brute head over heels on the turf but he sprang up instantly and there would certainly have been a battleroyal if groot willem who opportunely appeared had not seized considine by the arm while hans marais grasped the brute by the neck and rendered further action impossible  a moment sufficed to cool the youths for the brute was young and they both shook hands with a laugh and a mutual apology  soon after leaving the giants farm the travellers reached a point where the main stream was joined by a subsidiary rivulet  its corresponding valley branched off to the right about eight miles in length containing fine pasturage and rich alluvial soil  it extended eastward behind the back of the kahaberg where the settlers observed the skirts of the magnificent timber forests which cover the southern fronts of that range stretching over the summits of the hills at the head of the glen  to this valley and the wooded hills which bound it was given the name of ettrick forest while the main valley itself was named glen lynden  not far from this point the apology for a waggon track ended altogether and thenceforth the settlers found the route difficult and dangerous to a degree far exceeding their previous experiences or their wildest conceptions  jerry goldboy had now facts enough to overturn all his unbelief  the axe crowbar pick and sledgehammer were incessantly at work  they had literally to hew their path through jungles and gullies and beds of torrents and rocky acclivities which formed a series of obstructions that tested the power of the whole partygroot willem and the allies includedto the uttermost  of course the difficulties varied with the scenery  here the vale was narrow and gorgelike with just sufficient room for the stream to pass while precipices of naked rock rose abruptly like rampart walls to a height of many hundred feet  these in some places seemed actually to overhang the savagelooking pass or poort through which the waggons had to struggle in the very bed of the stream  elsewhere it widened out sufficiently to leave space along the riverbank for fertile meadows which were picturesquely sprinkled with mimosa trees and evergreen shrubs and clothed with luxuriant pasturage up to the girths of the horses  everywhere the mountains rose around steep and grand the lower declivities covered with good pasturage the cliffs above of freestone and trap frowning in wild forms like embattled ramparts whose picturesque sides were sprinkled with various species of succulent plants and flowering aloes  for five days did they struggle up this short glen two of these days being occupied in traversing only three miles of a rugged defile to which they gave the name of eildon cleugh  but nothing is denied to welldirected labour  they smashed two waggons damaged all the others halfkilled their oxen skinned all their knuckles blackandblued all their shins and nearly broke all their hearts till at length they passed through the last poort of the glen and gained the summit of an elevated ridge which commanded a magnificent view to the extremity of the vale  and now mynheer said the fieldcornet in charge of their escort there lies your country  at lastthank god said the leader of the band looking round on their beautiful though savage home with feelings of deep gratitude for the happy termination of their long and weary travels  the toil of journeying was now succeeded by the bustle and excitement of settling down  their new home was a lovely vale of about six or seven miles in length and varying from one to two in breadth like a vast basin surrounded on all sides by steep and sterile mountains which rose in sharp wedgelike ridges with snowclad summits that towered to an estimated height of five thousand feet above the level of the sea  the contrast between the warm peaceful valley and the rugged amphitheatre of mountains was very great  the latter dark and forbiddingyet homelike and gladdening to the eyes of scotsmensuggested toil and trouble while the former with its meandering river verdant meadows groves of sweetscented mimosatrees and herds of antelopes quaggas and other animals pasturing in undisturbed quietude filled the mind with visions of peace and plenty  perchance god spoke to them in suggestive prophecy for the contrast was typical of their future chequered career in these almost unknown wilds of south africa  left by their escort on the following dayas their english brethren had been left in the zuurveld of lower albanyto take root and grow there or perish the heads of families assembled and their leader addressed them  here at last said he our weary travels by sea and land have come to an end  exactly six months ago to a day we left the shores of bonny scotland  since then we have been wanderers without any other home than the crowded cabin at sea and the narrow tent on shore  now we have through gods great goodness and mercy reached the promised land which is to be our future home our place of rest  we have pitched our tents among the mimosatrees on the rivers margin and our kind dutch friends with the armed escort have left us  we are finally left to our own resources it behoves us therefore kindred and comrades to proceed systematically to examine our domain and fix our several locations  for this purpose i propose that an armed party should sally forth to explore while the rest shall remain to take care of the women and children and guard the camp  acting on this advice an exploration party was at once organised and set forth on foot as they had at that time no horses or live stock of any kindsave one dog which had been purchased by the brute whose proper name by the way was andrew rivers from groot willem on the way up  they found the region most desirable in all respects  open grassy pastures were interspersed everywhere with clumps and groves of mimosatrees while the river a gurgling mountainbrook meandered musically through the meadows  from grove and thicket sprang the hartebeest and duiker  from their lairs among the reeds and sedges of the river rushed the reitbok and wild hog while troops of quaggas appeared trotting on the lower declivities of the hills  a magnificent region truly remarked kenneth mctavish as they returned home at night  eaven upon earth said jerry goldboy with quiet enthusiasm  what splendid scenery exclaimed charlie considinewho was addicted to the pencil  what glorious sport cried his former antagonist riverswho was fond of the rod and gun  and what aboot the kawfirs and bushmen asked sandy black who to use his own language could aye objec  time enough to think of them when they appear said rivers  i dont believe theyre half so bad as people say cried goldboy stoutly  maybe no rejoined black  the place is paradise today as you sagaciously remarked jerry but if the kawfirs come itll be pandemonium tomorry  its my opinion that we should get oursels into a defensible camp as soon as we can an than gae aboot our wark wi easy minds  ye mind what goliath and hans marais said before they left us aboot keepin a sharp lookoot  as no one replied to this the scot changed the subject by asking considine when he meant to leave  not till hans marais comes over the hills to fetch me was the reply he has taken upon himself to give me extended leave of absence  you know sandy that i fill the office of professor in his fathers house and of course the marais sprouts are languishing for want of water while the schoolmaster is abroad so i could not take it on myself to remain longer away if hans had not promised to take the blame on his own shoulders  besides rain in africa is so infrequent that the sprouts wont suffer much from a week more or less of drought  your leader wishes me to stay for a few days and i am anxious to see how you get on  ill be able to help a bit and take part in the nightwatches which i heard mr pringle say he intends to institute immediately  on the day following a site was fixed for the commencement of the infant colony and the tents etcetera were removed to it  the day after being sunday it was unanimously agreed to rest from labour and to keep it holy  it was an interesting and noteworthy occasion the assembling of the scotch emigrants on that sabbath day to worship god for the first time in glen lynden  their church was under the shade of a venerable acaciatree close to the margin of the stream which murmured round the camp  on one side sat the patriarch of the party with silvery locks the bible on his knee and his family seated round himthe type of a grave scottish husbandman  near to him sat a widow who had seen better days with four stalwart sons to work for and guard her  beside these were delicate females of gentle blood near to whom sat the younger brother of a scotch laird who wisely preferred independence in the southern wilds of africa to dependence at home  besides these there were youths and maidens of rougher though not less honest mould some grave others gay but all at that time orderly and attentive while their leader gave forth the beautiful hymn which begins    o god of bethel by whose hand   thy people still are fed  and followed it with a selection of prayers from the english liturgy and a discourse from a volume of sermons  while they were singing the last psalm a beautiful antelope which had wandered down the valleyall ignorant of the mighty change that had taken place in the prospects of its mountain homecame suddenly in sight of the party and stood on the opposite side of the river gazing at them in blank amazement  andrew rivers who sat meekly singing a fine bass chanced to raise his head at the time  immediately his eyes opened to their full extent and the fine bass stopped short though the mouth did not close  with the irresistible impulse of a true sportsman he half rose but sandy black who sat near caught him by the coattails and forced him firmly though softly down  whist man keep a calm sough  the young man becoming instantly aware of the impropriety of his action resigned himself to fate and sandy and recovered selfpossession in time to close the interrupted line with two or three of the deepest notes in the bass clef  the innocent antelope continued to listen and gaze its fill and was finally permitted to retire unmolested into its native jungle    note 1  see narrative of a residence in south africa by thomas pringle late secretary to the antislavery society    chapter eleven  explorations and hunting experiences  oh they were happy times these first days of the infant colony when every man felt himself to be a real robinson crusoewith the trifling difference of being cast on heights of the mainland instead of an islet of the sea and with the pleasant addition of kindred company  so rich and lovely was their domain that some of the facetious spirits in looking about for sites for future dwellings affected a rollicking indifference to situations that would have been prized by any nobleman in making choice of a spot for a shootingbox  come now mctavish said considine on one of their exploring expeditions you are too particular  yonder is a spot that seems to have been made on purpose for youa green meadow for the cattle and sheep when you get em stones scattered here and there of a shape that will suit admirably for building purposes without quarrying or dressing a clump of mimosatrees to shelter your cottage from winds that may blow down the valley and a gentle green slope to break those that blow up a superb acacia standing by itself on a readymade lawn where your front door will be under which you may have a rustic seat and table to retire to at eventide with mrs mctavish and lovely young jessie to smoke your pipe and sip your tea  or toddy suggested sandy black  or toddy assented considine  besides all this you have the river making a graceful bend in front of your future drawingroom windows and a vista of the valley away to the left with a rocky eminence on the right whence baboons can descend to rob your future orchard at night and sit chuckling at you in safety during the day with a grand background of wooded gorgesor corries as you scotch have it or kloofs according to the boersand a noble range of snowclad mountains to complete the picture  not a bad description for so young a man said mctavish surveying the spot with a critical eye quite in our poetical leaders style  you should go over it again in his hearing and ask him to throw it into verse  no i cannot afford to give away the valuable produce of my brain  i will keep and sell it some day in england  but our leader has already forestalled me i fear  he read to me something last night which he has just composed and which bears some resemblance to it  listen    now we raise the eye to range   oer prospect wild grotesque and strange   sterile mountains rough and steep   that bound abrupt the valley deep   heaving to the clear blue sky   their ribs of granite bare and dry   and ridges by the torrents worn   thinly streaked with scraggy thorn   which fringes natures savage dress   yet scarce relieves her nakedness   but where the vale winds deep   below   the landscape hath a warmer glow   there the spekboom spreads its bowers   of light green leaves and lilac flowers   and the aloe rears her crimson crest   like stately queen for gala drest   and the brightblossomed beantree shakes   its coral tufts above the brakes   brilliant as the glancing plumes   of sugarbirds among its blooms   with the deepgreen verdure blending   in the stream of light descending  something or other follows i forget what and then    with shattered rocks besprinkled oer   behind ascends the mountain hoar   where the grin satyrfaced baboon   sits gibbering to the rising moon   or chides with hoarse or angry cry   thintruder as he wanders by  therei cant remember the rest of it said considine and im not even sure that what ive quoted is correct but you see mr pringles mind has jumped before mineand higher  man its no that bad observed black with emphasis  depend ont though i mak nae pretence to the gift o prophecyhell come oot as a bard yetthe bard o glen lynden maybe or sooth afrikyhech sirs added sandy pointing with a look of surprise to a tree many of the pendent branches of which had peculiar roundshaped birdsnests attached to them whats goin on there think ee  the tree to which the scot directed attention overhung the stream and down one of its branches a snake was seen twining itself with caution it evidently meant to rob one of the nests for the little owner with some of its companions was shrieking and fluttering round the wouldbe robber  this kind of bird has been gifted with special wisdom to guard its home from snakes  it forms the entrance to its pendent nest at the bottom instead of the top and hangs the nest itself at the extreme point of the finest twigs so that the snake is compelled to wriggle downwards perpendicularly and at last has to extend part of its body past the nest in order to be able to turn its head upwards into the hole  great unquestionably is a snakes capacity to hold on by its tail but this holding on as it were to nexttonothing is usually too much for it  while the explorers were watching the snake turned its head upwards for the final dive into the nest but its coils slipped and it fell into the water amid triumphant shrieks from the little birds  nothing daunted however the snake swam ashore and made another attemptwith the same result  again it made the trial a third time it failed and then in evident disgust went off to attack some easier prey  while considine and his companions were thus out in search of good localities on which to plant future homesteads the greater part of the settlers were engaged at a spot which they had named clifton in erecting temporary huts of the wattleanddab order  mr pringle himself with a bold fellow named rennie remained to guard the camp as they had reason to fear a surprise from bushmen marauders known at that time to be roaming the neighbourhood  more than once the sentinels were tempted to fire into a band of baboons whom they not unnaturally mistook for bushmen  other parties were sent out to cut wood and reeds which they had to carry into camp sometimes two or three miles on their shoulders while some were despatched into the kloofs to hunt provisions having by that time grown scarce  not being a sportsman himself and not feeling sure of the power of his men who were at that time unaccustomed to the gun mr pringle wisely sent two of the party to the nearest stationabout forty miles distantto inquire about a supply of provisions and a few horses which were expected from the governmentfarm of somerset  the first hunting party sent out was not a select one the people generally being too eager about examining and determining their immediate locations to care about sport  it consisted of young rivers and jerry goldboy  the former was appointed or rather allowed to go more because of his sporting enthusiasm than because of any evidence he had yet given of his powers and the latter merely because he desired to go  for the same reason he was permitted to arm himself with his blunderbuss  rivers carried a heavy doublebarrelled fowlingpiece  he was a stout active impulsive young fellow with the look of a capable nimrod  youd have been better with a fowlingpiece or even a dutch roer said rivers casting a doubtful look at the blunderbuss as they entered the jungle and began to ascend one of the nearest subsidiary glens or kloofs  well now sir said jerry respectfully i dont agree with you  a man who goes ashootin with a fowlinpiece or a dutch gun must ave some sort o capacity for shootinmustnt e sir  well i suppose he must  wereas continued jerry a man who goes ashootin with a blunderbuss dont require no such qualificationthats were it is sir  dyou mean to say that you cant shoot asked rivers with a look of surprise  no more sir replied jerry with emphasis than the weathercock of a dutch reformed church  of course i know ow to loadpowder first ball or shot arterwards its usually gravel with me that bein so to speak andy and cheap  an i knows wich end o the piece to putt to my shoulder likewise ow to pull the trigger but of more than that im hinnocent as the babe unborn  ah you may laugh sir but after all im a pretty sure shot  indeed i seldom miss because i putt in such a eavy charge and the buss scatters so fearfully that its all but impossible to missunless you fairly turn your back on the game and fires in the opposite direction  youre a pleasant hunting companion said rivers  do you know the importance of always keeping the muzzle of your gun away from the unfortunate fellow you chance to be shooting with  ho yes sir  the dangerous natur of my weapon is so great that ive adopted the plan of always walking as you see with what the milingtary call shouldered arms which endangers nothin but the skyincludin the planetory systemexcept wen i appens to fall wen of course its every man lookout for hisself  but theres one consolation for you sirmy blunderbuss dont go off easy  it takes two pulls of the trigger mostly to bring fire out o the flint and as i often forget to primetheres a third safeguard in that so to speak  further converse was interrupted by the sudden bursting of a duiker or large antelope from a thicket close beside them  both sportsmen levelled their pieces but the jungle there being dense the animal vanished before either could fire  with the eager haste of tyros however they ran stumbling after it until they came to an open stretch of ground which led them to the edge of a small plain  here they simultaneously discovered that no duiker was to be seen though they observed a troop of quaggas far out of range and a hartebeest in the distance  the former observing them kicked up their heels and dashed away into the mountains  the latter a handsome creature the size of an average pony and fleet as a stag bounded into the jungle  no use going after these said rivers with a wistful gaze  no sirnone watever  better keep to the jungle and be ready next time said the young sportsman  we mustnt talk jerry  no sir mums the word  but ow if we should meet with a lion  shoot it of course  but there is no such luck in store for us  after this the hunters proceeded with greater caution  as they kept in the thick bush they frequently startled animals which they heard leaping up and bursting through the underwood but seldom got a glimpse and never a shot  tantalising aint it sir  hush  they issued on another open space at this point and seeing a thick bed of sedges near the margin of a stream proceeded towards it separating from each other a few yards in order to cover the ground  there was a sudden and violent shaking in the sedges on their approach as if some large animal had been aroused from sleep but the tall reeds prevented its being seen  look out jerry and keep more on the other sidetherehallo  as he spoke a creature called by the dutch colonists a reitvark or reedswine whose quick starts and sharp stoppages betrayed its indecision at length made up its mind and rushed out of the reeds in wild alarm close to rivers who although ready was incapable of restraining himself and fired in haste  the ball nevertheless slightly grazed the animals side  with a shriek of intense agony such as only a brute of the porcine tribe can utter the reitvark swerved aside and ran straight though unintentionally at jerry goldboy  selfcontrol not being jerrys forte he uttered a great cry presented the blunderbuss with both hands shut his eyes and fired  the butt of his piece came back on his chest and floored him and the halfpound of gravel charge went into the forehead of the reitvark which dropped with a final groan whose clear import wasno earthly use in struggling after that  recovering himself jerry was jubilant over his success  rivers was almost envious  they proceeded but killed nothing more afterwards though they saw much  among other things they saw a footprint in the sand which filled them with interest and awe  it was that of a lion  during the journey up from the coast they had seen much game large and small of every kind except the cape tiger and the lion  they had indeed once or twice heard the peculiar growl or gurr of the former but until this day none of the party had seen even the footprint of the king of beasts  of course the interest and excitement was proportional  of course also when the subject was discussed round the campfires that night there was a good deal of chaffing among the younger men about the probability of a mistake as to the nature of the footprints by such unaccustomed sportsmen but rivers was so confident in his statements and jerry was so contemptuous in his manner of demanding whether there was any difference between the paw of a cat and a lion except in size and whether he was not perfectly familiar with a cats paw that no room for scepticism remained  it had been a threatening day  muttered thunder had been heard at intervals and occasional showersthe first that had assailed them since their arrival in the glen  the night became tempestuous cold and very dark so that soon all were glad to seek the shelter of the tents or of the halffinished wattleanddab huts except the sentinels of these two were appointed for every watch  masters and servants shared this disagreeable duty equally  particularly disagreeable it was that night for the rain came down in such torrents that it was difficult to keep the fires alight despite a good supply of firewood  about midnight the sleeping camp was aroused by the roar of a lion close to the tents  it was so loud and so tremendous that some of the sleepyheads thought for a moment a thunderstorm had burst upon them every one was up in a secondthe men with guns pistols swords and knives  there was no mistaking the expression of the roarthe voice of fury as well as of power  whereaboots is the brute cried sandy black who roused to unwonted excitement by the royal voice issued from his tent in a red nightcap and drawers with a gun in one hand and a carvingknife in the other  here  there  in this direction  no it isnt  i say it is and similar exclamations burst from every one  the uncertainty was probably occasioned partly by the mode the animal has of sometimes putting his mouth close to the ground when he roars so that the voice rolls along like a billow partly also by the echo from a mountainrock which rose abruptly on the opposite bank of the river  finding it impossible to decide the question of direction the party fired volleys and threw firebrands in all directions and this they did with such vigour that his kingship retired without uttering another sound  it was a grand a royal almost a humorous mode of breaking a spellthe spell of unbelief in lionswhich some of the party had been under up to that moment  they remained under it no longer  as if to confirm and fix the impression thus made this lionor anothergave some of the party a daylight interview  george rennie mctavish considine black and others had gone up the river to cut reeds in the bed of the stream  while they were busily engaged with their sickles up rose a majestic lion in their very midst  preserve us a exclaimed black who was nearest to him  jerry goldboy turned to seize his blunderbuss  the lion leaped upon the bank of the river turned round and gazed upon the men  let go exclaimed jerry in a hoarse whisper endeavouring to shake off the vicelike grip that black had laid on his arm  keep quiet man growled black sternly  the rest of the party were wise enough not to interfere with the lion they were at that time inexperienced  to have wounded him would have brought disaster perhaps death on some of them  george rennie who afterwards became a celebrated lionhunter was emphatic in advising caution  after gazing in quiet surprise on the intruders for a minute or so he turned and retired first slowly and then after getting some distance off at a good round trot  this was the first sight they had of the royal beast  afterwards during the winter and spring they had frequent visits from lions but did not suffer actual damage from them  they also in course of time dared to beard the lion in his denbut of that more anon  the labour of the settlers at this timebefore oxen and horses were procuredwas very severe  of course this had the effect of weeding the little company of some of its chaff in the shape of lazy and discontented men  one said that he had not been engaged to work by day and watch by night as well as living in constant fear of being scalped by savages or devoured by wild beasts  the observation being true and unanswerable he was graciously permitted to retire from the service and returned to algoa bay  but on the whole there was little murmuring and no rebellion  by degrees difficulties were smoothed down  a squatter on one of the forfeited farms about eight miles off who with his family lived solely on flesh and milk was engaged to lend a hand with his waggon and oxen to flit the families to their various locations  he also sold the settlers a few sheep  in time more sheep and oxen were purchased from the dutch farmers on the tarka a river on the other side of the mountains  hottentots came from somerset with flour  thatched huts replaced the tents  a few horses were obtained gardens were cleared and enclosed  trenches for irrigation were cut trees were rooted out and ploughs were set to work  ten armed hottentots were sent by the magistrates of the district to which they belonged to guard and relieve them of nightwatches and with these came the news that ten of their friend oppermans cattle and seven belonging to their neighbour the squatter had been carried off by bushmen  at this point sandy black aroused the admiration of the ten hottentots by setting to work one morning in septemberthe beginning of spring in south africawith a scotch plough which was guided entirely by himself and drawn by only two oxen  his darkskinned admirers had never seen any other plough than the enormous unwieldy implement then in use among the dutch which had only one handle no coulter was usually drawn by ten or twelve oxen and managed by three or four men and boys  by degrees those of the party who were good linguists began to pick up dutch  mr pringle especially soon became familiar enough with it to be able to hold a dutch service on sundays in addition to the english for the benefit of the hottentot guards  he also added a slight knowledge of medicine to his other qualifications and was thus enabled to minister to the wants of body and soul at a time when the people had no regular physician or professional minister of the gospel  the arrival of horses gave the settlers opportunities of making more extended and more thorough explorations of their own domain and the daily routine of life was varied and enlivened by an occasional visit from the tarka boers whom they found goodnatured and hospitablealso very shrewd at a bargain  thus they took root and began to grow  but before many of these things occurred hans marais came over the mountains according to promise and professor considine was fain to bid the scotch settlers farewell promising however to return and visit them on some future day    chapter twelve  gives some account of a great lionhunt  although the lions roar had been frequently heard by the settlers of glen lynden some months elapsed before they came into actual conflict with his majesty  by that time the little colony had taken firm root it had also been strengthened by a few families of halfcastes or mulattos  one morning it was discovered that a horse had been carried off by a lion and as his track was clearly traceable into a neighbouring kloof the boldest men of the settlement as well as some dutchmen who chanced to be there at the time were speedily assembled for a regular hunt after the audacious thief  it was a great occasion and some of the men who became noted for prowess in after years began their career on that day  george rennie who ultimately acquired the title of the lionhunter came to the rendezvous with a large elephantgun on his shoulder also his brother john fearless and daring as himself  then followed the brothers diederik and christian mullerfrank free generoushearted dutchmen who were already known as among the most intrepid lionhunters of south africa and arend coetzer of elandsdrift and lucas van dyk a tall dark muscular man of about six feet two with a bushy black beard and an eye like an eagles carrying a gun almost as long and unwieldy as himself and slinger allie and dikkop their sturdy hottentot servants with dugal a halftamed bushman the special charge of mr pringle  these and several others were all armed with gun and spear and knife  soon our friend sandy black who had been summoned from work in his garden joined them with a rusty old flintlock gun  he was followed by young rivers with a doublebarrelled percussion of large calibre and by kenneth mctavish accompanied by his wife and jessie both imploring him earnestly not to be rash and to keep well out of danger  oh  kenneth entreated mrs m do be careful  a lion is such a fearful thing  my dear its not a thing its an animal growled kenneth trying to induce his wife to go home  yes but it is so dangerous and only think if it should get hold of youand i know your headstrong courage will make you do something foolhardywhat is to become of me and jessie  it was evident from the tone of mctavishs reply that he did not care much what should become of either wife or daughter just then for he saw that his male friends were laughing at him but he was fortunately relieved by jerry goldboy coming up at the momentwith the blunderbuss on his shoulderand informing mrs mctavish that her pet a lamb which had been recently purchased from one of the tarka boers was at large with two or three hungry dogs looking earnestly at it  the good lady at once forsook the old goat and ran back with jessie to the rescue of the pet lamb  what have ee putt i the buss asked sandy black of jerry with a sly look as the latter joined the group of hunters  well dyou know i aint quite sure replied jerry in some confusion ii was called out so suddenly that i ad scarce time to think  think repeated black it doesna tak muckle time to think hoo to load a gun but to be sure your gun is a pecooliar ane  well you see returned jerry with the troubled look still on his countenance it does require a little consideration because it would be useless to load with my ordinary charge of gravel for a lion  then i feared to put in large stones lest they should jam in the barrel an bust the hold thing  so i collected a lot of hold buttons and a few nails besides two or three thimbles but  weel said black as his friend paused thae sort o slugs wull at least gie the lion a peppery sort o feeling if naethin waur  yes but dyou see continued jerry there was a silver teaspoon on the table when i made the collection of things and after i had loaded i i couldnt find the teaspoon and i fear  just at that moment groot willem galloped upon the scene and was received with a hearty cheer  the hottentots were now sent on in advance to trace out the spoorin other words the track of the lion  on the way one of the dutchmen entertained those of the settlers who were inexperienced with an account of the mode in which lionhunts should be conducted  the right way to go to work he said was to set the dogs into the cover and drive the lion into the open when the whole band of hunters should march forward together and fire either singly or in volleys  if he did not fall but should grow furious and advance upon his assailants then they should stand close in a circle and turn their horses with their heads from the foe horses being usually much frightened at the sight of a lion  some should hold the bridles while others should kneel and take careful aim at the approaching enemy which would crouch now and then as if to measure his distance and calculate the power of his spring  when he crouched that was the time to shoot him fair in the head  if they should miss which was not unlikely or only wound the lion and the horses should get frantic with tenor at his roars and break loose there was reason to fear that serious mischief might follow  no red indian of the backwoods ever followed the trail of beast or foe more unerringly than these hottentots and mulattos tracked that lion through brushwood and brake over grass and gravel where in many places to an unskilled eye there was no visible mark at all  their perseverance was rewarded they came upon the enemy sooner than had been expected  at the distance of about a mile from the spot where he had killed the horse they found him in a straggling thicket  from this point of vantage he would by no means come out  the dogs were sent in and they barked furiously enough but the lion would not condescend to show fight  after some hours spent in thus vainly heating about the bush george rennie became impatient and resolved to storm the stronghold  in company with his brother john and another man named ekron he prepared to enter the thicket where the lion was concealed and persuaded three of the mulattos to follow in rear and be ready to fire if their assault should prove abortive  it was of no use that lucas van dyk and the mullers and other experienced dutchmen tried to dissuade them from their enterprise by assuring them that it was a ridiculous as well as reckless mode of attack and would be almost certainly attended with fatal consequences the brothers rennie as yet inexperienced were obstinate  they were bent on attacking the lion in his den  while this arrangement was being made the soul of jerry goldboy became unfortunately inflated with a desire to distinguish himself spiritually brave though physically nervous he made a sudden resolve to shoot that lion or die in the attempt  without uttering a word he cocked his blunderbuss and before any one could prevent him made a bold dash into the jungle at a point where the hounds were clamouring loudest  save us a the bodys gane gyte exclaimed sandy black promptly following  come on freens or hes a deed man  sandys impulse was suddenly arrested by a roar from the lion so tremendous that it appeared to shake the solid earth  next moment jerry beheld a large animal bound with a crash through the brake straight at him  his heart leaped into his mouth but he retained sufficient vitality to present and fire  a wild yell followed as the animal fell dead at his feet and jerry found that he had lodged the whole collection of buttons nails and miscellaneous articles along with the teaspoon in the head of the best hound which had been scared by the monarchs appalling roar  it is difficult to say whether laughter or indignant growls were loudest on the occurrence of this but it is certain that the brothers rennie entered the thicket immediately after despite the almost angry remonstrances of the more knowing men advanced to within about fifteen paces of the spot where the lion lay crouched among the gnarled roots of an evergreen bush with a small space of open ground on one side of it  now then boys said george rennie casting a hasty glance over his shoulder at the mulatto supports steady and take good aim after we fire  he put the elephant gun to his shoulder as he spoke his brother and comrade did the same a triple report followed and the three heavy balls aimed with deadly precision struck a great block of red stone behind which the lion was lying  with a furious growl he shot from his lair like the bolt from a crossbow  the mulattos instinctively turned and fled without firing a shot  the three champions with empty guns tumbled over each other in eager haste to escape the dreaded clawsbut in vain for with one stroke he dashed john rennie to the ground put his paw on him and looked round with that dignified air of grandeur which has doubtless earned for his race the royal title  the scene was at once magnificent thrilling and ludicrous  it was impossible for the other hunters to fire because while one man was under the lions paw the others were scrambling towards them in such a way as to render an aim impossible  after gazing at them steadily for a few seconds the lion turned as if in sovereign contempt scattered the hounds like a pack of rats and with a majestic bound over bushes upwards of twelve feet high reentered the jungle  with a feeling of indignation at such contemptuous treatment george rennie recharged his gun in haste vowing vengeance against the whole feline racea vow which he fully redeemed in after years  his brother john who was injured to the extent of a scratch on the back and a severe bruise on the ribs by the rough treatment he had received arose and slowly followed his example and groot willem growling in a tone that would have done credit to the lion himself and losing for the moment the usual wisdom of his countrymen in such encounters strode savagely into the jungle followed by sandy black and jerry the latter of whom appeared to labour under a sort of frenzied courage which urged him on to deeds of desperate valour  at all events he had recharged his piece of ordnance to the very muzzle with a miscellaneous compound of sand stones and sticksanything in short that would go down its capacious throatand pushing wildly past groot willem took the lead  it was perhaps well for these strangelyassorted hunters that the lion had made up his mind to quit the jungle  a few minutes later he was seen retreating towards the mountains and the chase was renewed with hounds and hottentots in full cry  they came up with him in a short time at bay under a mimosatree by the side of a streamlet  he lashed his tail and growled fiercely as he glared at the dogs which barked and yelped round him though they took good care to keep out of reach of his claws  while they stirred up his wrath to the boiling point they at the same time distracted his attention so that a party of hottentots getting between him and the mountain side took up a position on a precipice which overlooked the spot where he stood at bay  suddenly the lion appeared to change his mind  turning as before and clearing all obstacles at a bound he took refuge in a dense thicket into which a heavy fire was poured without any effect  again george rennie lost patience  he descended from the height accompanied by a favourite little dog and threw two large stones into the thicket  his challenge was accepted on the spot  the lion leaped out with a roar and was on the point of making another bound which would certainly have been fatal to the hunter but the little dog ran boldly up and barked in his face the momentary interruption saved rennie who leaped backward but the dog was instantly killed with a flashing pat from the royal paw  at the same moment a volley was fired by the hottentots from the heights unfortunately the position of rennie rendered it impossible for the mullers or any of the other expert shots to fire  whether the volley had taken effect was uncertain but it at all events turned the lion from his purpose  he wheeled round and abandoning the bush took to a piece of open ground across which the hunters and dogs followed him up hotly  the lion now took refuge in a small copse on a slight eminence diederik and christian muller were in advance groot willem on his mighty charger came next  van dyk was running neck and neck with jerry goldboy who flourished the blunderbuss over his head and yelled like a very demon  it was obvious that he was mad for the time being  the rest came up in a confused body many of the men on foot having kept up with the horsemen  the rennies having by that time become wiser gave up their reckless proceedings and allowed christian muller who was tacitly acknowledged the leader of the party to direct  he gave the signal to dismount when within a short distance of the copse and ordered the horses to be tied together as the different riders came up  this was quickly done and of course all possibility of retreat was thus cut off  the plan was to advance in a body up the slope leaving the horses in charge of the hottentots  the preparations did not take long but before they were completed a growl was heard then a terrific roar and the lion who had made up his mind to act on the offensive burst from the thicket and bore down on the party his eyeballs glaring with rage  being thus taken by surprise they were unprepared  his motion was so rapid that no one could take aimexcept indeed jerry who discharged his piece at the sky and losing his balance fell back with a wild halloo  selecting one of the horses the lion darted furiously at it  the affrighted animal sprang forward and in so doing wheeled all the other horses violently round the lion missed his aim but faced about and crouched at a distance of only ten yards for another spring  it was a terrible moment  while the monster was meditating on which victim he should leap christian muller was taking quick but deadly aim  if he should merely wound the brute certain death to some one of the party would have been the instantaneous result  most of them knew this well  knowing also that muller was cool and sure they breathlessly awaited the result  only three or four seconds were spent in aiming but instants become minutes in such a case  some of the men almost gasped with anxiety  another moment and christian fired  the under jaw of the lion dropped and blood gushed front his mouth  he turned round with a view to escape but george rennie shot him through the spine turning again with a look of vengeance he attempted to spring but the once powerful hindlegs were now paralysed  at the same moment groot willem van dyk sandy black and mctavish put balls into different parts of his body and a man named stephanus put an end to his existence by shooting him through the brain  it was a furious combat while it lasted and a noble enemy had been subdued for this lion besides being magnificent of aspect even in death measured full twelve feet from the point of his nose to the tip of his tail    chapter thirteen  adventure with an ostrich  time passed rapidly and the settlers both highland and lowland struck their roots deeper and deeper into the soil of their adoptionwatched and criticised more or less amiably by their predecessors the few dutchafrican farmers who up to that time had struggled on the frontier all alone  one day hans marais was riding with charlie considine on the karroo not far from the farmhouse  they had been conversing on the condition and prospects of the land and the trials and difficulties of the british settlers  suddenly they came on an ostrich sitting on its eggs under a bush  the bird rose and ran on seeing the horsemen  i daresay the cockbird is not far off observed hans riding up to the nest which was merely a slight hollow scraped in the sandy soil and contained a dozen eggs  he is a gallant bird guards his wife most faithfully and shares her duties  ive sometimes thought said considine musingly that the ostrich might be tamed and bred on your farms  with such valuable feathers it would be worth while to try  you are not the first who has suggested that charlie  my own mother has more than once spoken of it  stay a minute said considine i shall take one of the eggs home to her  not fit to eat  probably half hatched said hans  no matter returned the other dismounting  well ill ride to the ridge and see if the papa is within hail  hans did but bare justice to the cock ostrich when he said he was a gallant bird  it is within the mark to say that he is not only a pattern husband but a most exemplary father for besides guarding his wife and her nest most jealously by day he relieves her at night and sits himself on the nest while his betterhalf takes food and relaxation  while hans rode forward a few hundred yards the cock which chanced to be out feeding on the plain observed his wife running excitedly among the bushes and at the same moment caught a glimpse of the dutchman  sevenleague boots could not have aided that ostrich  with mighty strides and outstretched wings the giant bird rushed in furious rage to defend its nest  hans saw it and instantly putting spurs to his horse also made for the nest but the ostrich beat him  look out charlie shouted hans  charlie did look out somewhat anxiously too turning his head nervously from side to side for while the thunder of hoofs and the warning cry of hans assailed him on one side a rushing and hissing sound was heard on the other  the suspense did not last long  a few seconds later and the ostrich appeared bearing down on him with railway speed  he raised his gun and fired but in the haste of the moment missed  the cap of the second barrel snapped  he clubbed his gun but before he could raise it the ferocious bird was on him  towering high over his head it must have been between eight and nine feet in height  one kick of its great twotoed foot sufficed  the ostrich kicks forward as a man might when he wishes to burst in a door with his foot and no prizefighter can hit out with greater celerity no horse can kick with greater force  if the blow had taken full effect it would probably have been fatal but considine leaped back  it reached him howeveron the chestand knocked him flat on the nest where he lay stunned amid a wreck of eggs  the vicious bird was about to follow up its victory by dancing on its prostrate foe when hans galloped up  the bird turned on him at once with a hiss and a furious rush  the terrified horse reared and wheeled round with such force as almost to throw hans who dropped his gun in trying to keep his seat  jumping into the air and bringing its foot down with a resounding smack the bird sent its two formidable nails deep into the steeds flank from which blood flowed copiously  the horse took the bit in its teeth and ran  hans marais was very strong but fear was stronger  the horse fairly ran off and the ostrich pursued  being fleeter than the horse it not only kept up with ease but managed ever and anon to give it another kick on flank sides or limbs  hans vainly tried to grasp his assailant by the neck  if he succeeded in this he knew that he could easily have choked it for the ostrichs weak point is its long slender neckits strong point being its tremendous leg the thigh of which blueblack and destitute of feathers resembles a leg of mutton in shape and size  at last hans bethought him of his stirrup  unbuckling it he swung it by the leather round his head and succeeded after one or two attempts in hitting his enemy on the head with the iron  the ostrich dropped at once and never rose again  returning to the nest with his vanquished foe strapped to his saddle he found considine sitting somewhat confused among the eggdebris much of which consisted of flattened young ones for the eggs were in an advanced state of incubation  why charlie are you going to try your hand at hatching cried hans laughing in spite of himself  considine smiled rather ruefully  i believe my breastbone is knocked in  just help me to examine but first catch my horse like a good fellow  it was found on examination that no bones were broken and that beyond a bruise considine was none the worse of his adventure  one egg was found to have survived the general destruction  this was taken to the farm and handed to mrs marais and that amiable lady adopted and hatched it  we do not mean to assert that she sat upon it but having discovered from mysterious sounds inside that the young ostrich contained in it was still alive and being a woman of an experimental tendency she resolved to become a mother to it  she prepared a box by lining it with a warm feather pillow above which she spread several skin karosses or blankets and into this she put the egg every morning and every evening she visited the nest felt the egg to ascertain its temperature and added or removed a blanket according to circumstances  how the good woman knew the proper temperature is a mystery which no one could explain but certain it is that she succeeded for in a few days the little one became so lively in its prison as to suggest the idea that it wanted out  mrs marais then listened attentively to the sounds and having come to a decision as to which end of the egg contained the head of the bird she cracked the shell at that point and returned it to the nest  thus aided the infant ostrich whose head and feet lay in juxtaposition began life most appropriately with its strongest point put its best foot foremost drove out the end of its prison with a kick and looked astonished  one or two more kicks and it was out  next time its fostermother visited the nest she found the little one freebut subdued as if it knew it had been naughtyand with that wellwhat next expression of countenance which is peculiar to very young birds in general  when born this little creature was about the size of a small barndoor hen but it was exceeding weak as well as long in the legs and its first efforts at walking were a mere burlesque  the feeding of this foundling was in keeping with its antecedents  mrs marais was a thoroughgoing but incomprehensible woman  one would have thought that boiled sheeps liver chopped fine and hens eggs boiled hard were about the most violently opposed to probability in the way of food for an ostrich old or young  yet that is the food which she gave this baby  the manner of giving it too was in accordance with the gift  sitting down on a low stool she placed the patientso to speakon its back between her knees and held it fast then she rammed the liver and egg down its throat with her fingers as far as they would reach after which she set it on its legs and left it for a few minutes to contemplation  hitching it suddenly on its back again she repeated the operation until it had had enough  in regard to quantity she regulated herself by feeling its stomach  in the matter of drink she was more pronounced than a teetotaler for she gave it none at all  thus she continued perseveringly to act until the young ostrich was old enough to go out in charge of a little hottentot girl named hreikie who became a very sister to it and whose life thenceforward was spent either in going to sleep under bushes on the understanding that she was taking care of baby or in laughing at the singular way in which her charge waltzed when in a facetious mood  there is no doubt that this ostrich would have reached a healthy maturity if its career had not been cut short by a hyena  not until many years after this did ostrichfarming and featherexporting become as it still continues one of the most important branches of commercial enterprise in the cape colony but we cannot avoid the conclusion that as watt gave the first impulse to the steamengine when he sat and watched the boiling kettle so mrs marais opened the door to a great colonial industry when she held that infant ostrich between her knees and stuffed it with minced eggs and liver    chapter fourteen  the bergenaars  so you like the study of french said charlie considine as he sat one morning beside bertha marais in the porch of her fathers dwelling  yes very much answered the girl  she said no more but she thought especially when i am taught it by such a kind painstaking teacher as you  and you like to live in the wild karroo asked the youth  of course i do was the reply with a look of surprise  of course  it was a stupid question bertha i did not think at the moment that it is home to you and that you have known no other since you were a little child  but to my mind it would be a dull sort of life to live here always  do you find it so dull asked bertha with a sad look  no not in the least replied the youth quickly  how could i living as i do with such pleasant people like one of their own kith and kin hunting with the sons and teaching the daughtersto say nothing of scolding them and playing chess and singing and riding  oh no  im anything but dull but i was talking generally of life in the karroo if i lived alone for instance like poor horley or with a disagreeable family like that of jan smitby the way that reminds me that we have heard news of the three runaways ruyter jemalee and booby  oh  im so glad cried bertha her fair face brightening up with pleasure for i am very fond of ruyter  he was so kind to me that time he found me lying near smits house when my pony ran away and threw me and i felt so miserable when i heard that his master was cruel and often beat him with a sjambok  often and often since he ran awayand it must be nearly a year nowi have prayed god that he might come back and that jan smit might become good to himwhat have you heard  considines face wore a troubled look  i fear he said the news will distress you for what i heard was that the three men driven to desperation by the harsh treatment received from their master have joined one of the fiercest of these gangs of robbers called the bergenaarsthe gang led i believe by dragoener  it was lucas van dyk the hunter who told me and he is said to be generally correct in his statements  berthas nether lip quivered and she hid her face in her hands for a few moments in silence  oh  im so sorryso sorry she said at length looking up  he was so gentle so kind  i cant imagine ruyter becoming one of those dreadful bergenaars about whose ferocious cruelty we hear so muchhis nature was so different  i cant believe it  i fear rejoined considine gently that it is true  you know it is said that oppression will drive even a wise man mad and a man will take to anything when he is mad  it could not drive a christian to such a life returned the girl sadly  oh  i wish he had become a christian when stephen orpin spoke to him but he wouldnt  when did orpin speak to him and what did he say asked considine whose own ideas as to christianity were by no means fixed or clear  it was just after that time rejoined bertha when jan smit had had him tied to a cartwheel and flogged so terribly that he could not walk for some days  orpin happened to arrive at the time with his waggon you know he has taken to going about as a traderand he spoke a great deal to ruyter about his soul and about jesus coming to save men from sin and enabling them to forgive their enemies but when ruyter heard about forgiving his enemies he wouldnt listen any more  pointing to his wounds he said do you think i can forgive jan smit  i dont wonder said considine it is too much to expect a black fellow smarting under the sjambok to forgive the man who applies it especially when it is applied unjustly and with savage cruelty  bertha was not gifted with an argumentative spirit  she looked anxiously in the face of her companion and murmured some broken sentences about the lords prayer and the golden rule and wound up by saying hesitatingly how can we ask forgiveness if we do not forgive  you are right bertha was considines rejoinder uttered gravely but truly a man must be more than a man to act on such principles think now of the state of things at the present time with regard to the settlers  the rust as they call that strange disease which has totally ruined the first years crop of wheat has thrown the most of them into difficulties and in the midst of this almost overwhelming calamity down came the kafirs on the albany district and the bergenaars of whom we have just been speaking not like men to fight openlythat were endurablebut like sly thieves in the dead of night to carry off sheep and cattle from many of the farmsin some cases even killing the herdsmen  now what think you must be the feelings of the settlers towards these kafirs and runaway robberscan they forgive  bertha didnt know  she thought their feelings must be very harsh diverging from the question however she returned to the first regret namely that her friend ruyter had joined the bergenaars  hallo  considine hi where are you came the sonorous voice of conrad marais in the distance interrupting the conversation  next moment the hearty countenance of the farmer followed his voice round the corner of the house  come get your gun my boy he cried in some excitement  these villains have been down last night and carried off two spans of my best oxen besides killing and devouring several sheep  considine started up at once  we shall be off in half an hour continued the farmer hans is away gathering one or two neighbours and the people are almost ready  do you accompany them asked considine  of course i do  come along  the youth required no urging  in a few minutes he was armed and mounted galloping in company with a score of horsemenblack brown and whitetowards the cattlekraals  here was already assembled by hans a troop of mounted men among whom were jan smit and his three sons david jacob and hendrik also the hunter van dyk  after a brief consultation in which van dyk took a prominent part they rode off at a smart gallop  we change the scene now to a large and dark cavern up among the wild heights of the winterberg mountains  it was evening but the sun had still a considerable distance to descend before finding its bed on the western horizon  a faint gleam of day entered the cave which was further illuminated by three fires over which a band of savagelooking darkskinned men were roasting chops and marrowbones  abdul jemalee the malay slave and booby the bushman were there assisting at the feast  at the inner end of the cave seated beside two men was ruyter the hottentot  he was a good deal changed from the rough but careless and jolly fellow whom we first introduced to the reader  there was a stern severity on his countenance coupled with a touch of sadness when in repose but when called into action or even when conversing the softer feeling vanished and nothing remained but the lines indicative of a stern settled purpose  most of the robbers around him had like himself fled from harsh masters and become hardened in a career of crime  the expression of almost every countenance was vindictive sensual coarse  ruyters was not so  unyielding sternness alone marked his features which we have elsewhere remarked were unusually good for a hottentot  being a man of superior power he had become the leader of this robberband  it was only one of many that existed at that time among the almost inaccessible heights of the mountainranges bordering on the colony  his companions recognised the difference between themselves and their captain and did not love him for it though they feared him  they also felt that he was irrevocably one of themselves having imbrued his hands in white mans blood more than once and already made his name terrible on that part of the frontier  they should be here by this time said ruyter in dutch to one of the men at his side  why did you send them off before i returned  he said this with a look of annoyance  the man replied that he had acted according to the best of his judgment and had been particular in impressing the leader of the party that he was not to touch the flocks of old marais but to devote himself entirely to those of jan smit  to this ruyter observed with a growl that it was not likely they would attend to such orders if marais herds chanced to be handy but the robber to whom he spoke only replied with a sly smile showing that he was of the same opinion  just then a man rushed into the cave announcing the fact that their comrades were returning with plenty cattle and sheep but that they were pursued  instantly the chops and marrowbones were flung aside and the robbers hastily arming mounted their horses and descended to the rescue  the band of which ruyter had become leader had existed some time before he joined  it was a detachment from a larger band who acknowledged as their chief a desperado named dragoener  this bushman had been in the service of diederik muller but on being severely flogged by a hottempered kinsman of his master had fled to the mountains vowing vengeance against all white men  it is thus that one white scoundrel can sometimes not only turn a whole tribe of savages into bitter foes of the white men in general but can bring discredit on his fellows in the eyes of christian people at a distance who have not the means of knowing the true state of the case  be this as it may however dragoener with his banditti soon took ample revenge on the colonists for the sjamboking he had received  not long previous to the period of which we write he had been reinforced by ruyter jemalee booby and several other runaway slaves besides some wild bushmenmen who had never been in service and were so called to distinguish them from men who had been caught like our friend booby and tamed  a few deserters from the cape corps who possessed firearms had also joined him  thus reinforced dragoener and his lieutenant had become bolder than ever in their depredations  one of his bands had recently carried off a large number of cattle and horses from the tarka boers who had called out a commando and gone in pursuit  driven into a forest ravine and finding it impossible to retain possession of their booty the robbers had cut the throats of all the animals and scattering into the jungle made their escape  another band had frequently annoyed the scotsmen at baviaans river  when therefore the band under ruyter heard of the approach of their comrades with booty and of the pursuit by colonists they went to the rescue somewhat emboldened by recent successes  on meeting their comrades who were driving the cattle and horses before them in frantic haste they were told that the pursuers were in strong force and numbered among them several of the boldest men and best shots on the frontier  there was no time for holding a council of war  ruyter at once divided his men into two bands  with the larger well armed and having two or three deserters with muskets he crept into the woods to lay an ambush for the enemy  the other band was ordered to continue driving the cattle with utmost speed and in the event of being overtaken to cut the animals throats and each man look out for himself  if ruyters men had been as bold and cool as himself they might have checked the pursuit but when the hunter van dyk who knew their ways advanced in front of his comrades by a path known to himself discovered their ambush and sent a bullet through the head of one of their number they awaited no further orders but rose en masse fled through the jungle and made for the mountains  van dyk reloading in hot haste followed swiftly but he had not taken three steps when charlie considine was at his heels  he had dismounted and followed van dyk  the other pursuers made a detour on horseback to cut off the robbers as they passed over some open ground in advance  in attempting this they came on a spot where the ground was strewn with the dead or dying cattle  with a yell of rage they pushed on but utterly failed for the bandits had headed in another direction and gained the cliffs where pursuit on horseback was impossible  knowing that it would have been equally fruitless to continue the chase on foot they returned to the point where van dyk and considine had entered the jungle fully expecting to find them there as it would have been madness they thought for two unsupported men to follow up the flying band  to their surprise they found no one there  we must follow their spoor boys said conrad marais with an anxious look they cannot be far off but we must not leave them unsupported in the jungle with such a lot of black villains flying about  action was at once taken  the most experienced men dismounted and traced the spoor with the unerring certainty of bloodhounds  but they shouted and searched in vain till night compelled them to desist  meanwhile van dyk and considine had been captured by the bergenaars  when charlie overtook the hunter as already described his ardent spirit and strong supple limbs enabled him to outrun his more massive though not less enthusiastic companion  a short run soon convinced the hunter that there was no chance of a clothed white man overtaking a more than halfnaked native in a thorny jungle  indeed he was already well convinced by former experience of this fact and had intended to engage in pursuit for only a short time in order if possible to obtain a flying shot at one or two of the robbers but his young comrades resolute continuance of the chase forced him to hold on longer than he desired  stop stop young fellow he shouted with stentorian voice stop i say  youll only waste your breath for no good he shouted  but considine heard him not  he had caught sight of one of the bandits who seemed to be losing strength and being himself sound in wind and limb he recklessly determined to push on  ill leave you to your fate roared van dyk if you dont stop  he might as well have roared to a mad buffalo  considine heeded or heard not  it wont do growled the hunter in a stern soliloquy as he stopped a moment to tighten his belt  well well i little thought van dyk that youd be brought to such a miserable fix as this in such a stupid way too  but he mustnt be left to the bushmens tender mercies  the hunters swart countenance grew darker as he spoke for he well knew the extremity of danger into which the reckless youth was compelling him to run but he did not hesitate  instead however of following in the steps of one who was fleeter of foot than himself he made a detour to the right  in an hour he reached a cliff under which he knew from the form of the valley up which the pursuit had been conducted his young companion must needs pass  the route he had taken was a short cut  he had headed considine and saw him a few minutes later in the gorge below in full pursuit of the robber  hm grunted van dyk as he sat down on a rock and examined the priming of his great elephantgun i thought as much  the black scoundrel is just playing with himdecoying the young idiot on till he gets him surrounded by his comrades but ill spoil his game though its like to be the last shot ill ever fire  a low quiet sigh escaped from the hunter as he watched the two men and awaited the proper moment  he was evidently right in his conjecture for as they drew near the cliff the black man looked over his shoulder once or twice and slackened his pace  the next moment he gave a shout which proved to be a signal for two of the robbers sprang out from the bushes and seized considine almost before he had seen them  vigorously he struggled and would perhaps have thrown off both had not the man he had been chasing turned and run to aid the others  quickly but steadily van dyk raised his gun and covered this man  next moment the muzzle was struck aside the ball flew harmlessly into the jungle and the hunter was pinioned overthrown and rendered helpless by four of the robbers who had been watching his motions all the time  van dyk was not taken much by surprise  he knew that such danger was probable and had done his best to avoid it  with that selfcommand which a life of constant danger in the woods had taught him he bowed to the inevitable and quietly submitted to be bound and led away  mean while ruyter for it was he who had been chased came up in time to assist in securing his victim  what ruyter is it you exclaimed considine in amazement  when the robberchief became aware who he had captured an expression of deep annoyance or regret crossed his face but it quickly passed into one of stern almost sulky determination as he ordered the two men in dutch to make the bonds secure  he deigned no reply to the prisoners question  he did not even appear to recognise him but strode on in front while the two robbers drove the youth up into the rocky fastnesses of the mountains  that night our hero found himself seated in the deepest recesses of a cavern by the side of his comrade van dyk  the arms of both were firmly bound behind their backs but their legs were free their captors knowing well that a scramble among such giddy and rugged heights without the use of the hands was impossible  in the centre of the cavern sat the robbers round a small fire on which some of them were cooking a few scraps of meat  a pretty mess youve led yourself and me into young fellow said the hunter sternly  indeed i have replied considine with a very penitent air and i would give or do anything to undo the mischief  jaalways the same with wildcaps like you returned the otherready to give anything when youve got nothing and to do anything when youre helpless  how much easier it would have been to have given a little heed and shown a little common sense when you had the chance  there was a touch of bitterness almost fierceness in the hunters tone which knowing the mans kindly nature considine could not quite understand  do you know what them reptiles there are saying continued van dyk after a brief pause  no their language is mere gibberish to me  theyre discussin the best method of puttin us out of existence said the hunter with a grim smile  some of em want to cut our throats at once and have done with it some would like to torture us first others are in favour of hangin but all agree that we must be killed to prevent our tellin the whereabouts of their hidingplace up hereall except one the one you gave chase to this afternoon  he advises em to let us go but he dont seem very earnest about it  i think i know the reason of his favouring us said considine with a look of hope  indeed  yes he once journeyed with me from capetown to the karroo and probably he feels a touch of regard for his old travelling companion  hm  i wouldnt give much for his regard growled van dyk  the reed is slender but its the only one we have to lean on now  however weve got a reprieve for i heard em say just now that theyll delay executing us till tomorrow after reaching one of their other and safer retreats in the mountains  the prisoners were put into a smaller cave close to the large one that night  their bonds were made more secure and as an additional precaution their legs were tied  two men were also appointed to guard the entrance of their prison  about midnight the camp was perfectly still and the only sounds that broke the silence were the tinkling of a neighbouring rill and the footfall of the sentinels  van dyk and considine were lying uneasily on the bare ground and thinking of the tragic fate that awaited them on the morrow when they observed the dim figure of a man approaching from the innermost end of the cavern with a drawn knife in his right hand both started up and leant on their elbows more than this they could not do  they felt some alarm it is true but both came to the same conclusionthat it is foolish to cry out before you are hurt  the figure bent over van dyk and whispered in his ear  next moment the hunter stood on his feet with his limbs free  you were right young sir he said to considine as he stooped over him and cut his bonds there is a touch of humanity in the rascally hottentot after all  come he bids us follow him  knows a secret passage out o the cave no doubt  the blackbearded huntsman turned as he spoke and followed the dim figure which melted into the depths of the cavern as if it had been a spirit  a few minutes gliding through darkness tangible and they found themselves in the open air among thick bushes  though the night was very dark there was sufficient light to enable considine to see the glittering of white teeth close to his face as a voice whispered in broken englishyous better tink twice when you try for to chases tottie next time  go van dyk hims old hand in de bush will guide you safe  before morning considine was back in conrad marais parlour relating his adventures among the bergenaars with a halfbelief that the whole affair was nothing more than a romantic dream    chapter fifteen  treats of the zuurveld again and one or two surprising incidents  seated one evening at the door of their dugout hut or cavern on the banks of the river the three brothers skyd discussed the affairs of the colony and smoked their pipes  never knew such a country said john skyd never  abominable observed james  detestable remarked robert  why dont you skydaddle then cried frank dobson  if i thought it as bad as you do id leave it at once  but you are unjust  unjust echoed john skyd that were impossible  what could be worse here have we been for three years digging and ploughing raking and hoeing carting and milking churning andandand what the better are we now  barely able to keep body and soul together with the rust ruining our wheat and an occasional kafir raid depriving us of our cattle while we live in a hole on the rivers bank like rabbits with this disadvantage over these facetious creatures that we have more numerous wants and fewer supplies  thats so said bob if we could only content ourselves with a few bulbous roots and grass all would be well but frank we sometimes want a little tea and sugar occasionally we run short of tobacco now and then we long for literature coffee sometimes recurs to memory at rare intervals especially when domestic affairs go wrong the thought of woman as of a longforgotten being of angelic mould will come over us  ah  frank it is all very well for you to smile you who have been away enjoying yourself for months past hunting elephants and other small game in the interior but you have no notion how severely our failures are telling on our spirits  why jim there tried to make a joke the other day and it was so bad that jack immediately went to bed with a sickheadache  true said jack solemnly quite true and i couldnt cure that headache for a whole day though i took a good deal of capesmoke before it came on as well as afterwards  but my dear chums remonstrated dobson is it not  now dont ask is it not your own fault with that wiseacre look of yours said john skyd testily tapping the bowl of his pipe on a stone preparatory to refilling it  we are quite aware that we are not faultless that we once or twice have planted things upside down or a yard too deep besides other little eccentricities of ignorance but such errors are things of the past and though we now drive our drills as straight as once heigho we ruled our accountbooks things dont and wont improve  if you had not interrupted me jack you might have spared much breath and feeling  i was about to say is it not a fact that many of the other settlers are beginning to overcome their difficulties though you are not  true it has now been found that the wheat crops on which we at first expected almost entirely to depend have for three seasons proved an entire failure and sheep do not thrive on our sour grass pasturage though they seem to have done admirably with the scotch at baviaans river but have not many of those around us been successful in raising rye barley oats and indian corn have they not many herds of healthy cattle are not pumpkins and potatoes thriving pretty well and gardens beginning to flourish  our roasted barley makes very fair coffee and honey is not a bad substitute for sugar  you have made a successful bag this trip i see by your taking such a healthy view of our circumstances said bob  yes ive done very well returned dobson and i find the hunters life so congenial and withal so profitable that im really thinking of adopting it as a profession  and that brings me to the object of my visit here tonight  the fact is my dear fellows that men of your genius are not fit for farmers  it takes quietgoing men of sense to cultivate the soil  if you three were to live and dig to the age of methuselah youd never make a living out of it  thats plain speaking said john with a nod and i agree with you entirely  i mean to speak plainly rejoined dobson and now what i propose is that you should give it up and join me in the ivory business  it will pay i assure you  here their friend entered into a minute and elaborate account of his recent hunting expedition and imparted to john skyd some of his own enthusiasm but james and robert shook their heads  leaving them to think over his proposal their friend went to make a call on the brooks of mount hope  drat that boy hes escaped again and after mischief ill be bound was the first sound that saluted him as he walked towards the house  it was mrs scholtzs voice on the other side of the hedge with which the garden was surrounded  the remark was immediately followed by a piercing shriek from the nurse who repeated it again and again  dobson could see her through an opening in the branches standing helpless with her hands clasped and eyeballs glaring  thoroughly alarmed he dashed towards the gate  at the same moment the voice of a child was heard  oh looklook ere nuss aint i cotched a pritty tingsuch a pritty ting  springing through the gate dobson beheld master junkie staggering up the track like a drunken man with one hand clasped tight round the throat of a snake whose body and tail were twining round the chubby arm of its captor in a vain effort at freedom while its forked tongue darted out viciously  it was at once recognised as one of the most deadly snakes in the country  aint it a booty cried junkie confronting dobson and holding up his prize like the infant hercules whom he very much resembled in all respects  dobson seizing the childs hand in his own left compressed it still tighter drew his huntingknife and sliced off the reptiles head just as edwin brook with his wife and daughter attracted by the nurses outcry rushed from the cottage to the rescue  scholtz and george dally at the same time ran out respectively from stable and kitchen  mrs scholtz had gone into a hysterical fit of persistent shrieking and laughter which she maintained until she saw that her darling was saved then finishing off with a prolonged wail she fell flat on the grass in a dead faint  junkie at the same moment as it were took up the cry  to be thus robbed of his newfound pet would have tried a better temper than his without a moments hesitation he rushed at frank dobson and commenced violently to kick his shins while he soundly belaboured his knees with the still wriggling tail of the poor snake  what a blessing exclaimed mrs brook grasping dobson gratefully by the hand  what a mercy murmured gertie catching up the infant hercules and taking him off to the cottage  what a rumpus growled dally taking himself off to the kitchen  scholtz gave no immediate expression to his feelings but lifting his better half from the grass he tucked her under one of his great arms and with the muttered commentary zhe shrieckz like von mad zow carried her off to his own apartment where he deluged her with cold water and abuse till she recovered  your arrival has created quite a sensation dobson said edwin brook with a smile as they walked up to the house  say rather it was opportune said mrs brook but for your prompt way of using the knife our darling might have been bitten  oh  i do dread these snakes they go about in such a sneaking way and are so very deadly  i often wonder that accidents are not more frequent considering the numbers of them that are about  so do i mrs brook returned dobson but i suppose it is owing to the fact that snakes are always most anxious to keep out of mans way and few men are as bold as your junkie  i never heard of one being collared before though a friend of mine whom i met on my last visit to the karroo used sometimes to catch hold of a snake by the tail whirl it round his head and dash its brains out against a tree  youll stay with us today dobson said brook  frank involuntarily casting a glance at the pretty face of gertiewho had by that time attained to the grace of early womanhoodaccepted the invitation and that day at dinner entertained the family with graphic accounts of his experiences among the wild beasts of the great fish river jungles and dilated on his prospects of making a fortune by trading in ivory  if that foolish law he said had not been made by our governor prohibiting traffic with the kafirs i could get waggonloads of elephants tusks from them for an old song  as it is i must knock over the elephants for myselfat least until the laws in question are rescinded  the governor seems to have a special aptitude said brook with a clouded brow not only for framing foolish laws but for abrogating good ones  the governor referred to was lord charles somerset who did more to retard the progress of the new settlements on the frontiers of kafirland than any who have succeeded him  having complicated the relations of the colonists and kafirs and confused as well as disgusted not to say astonished the natives during his first term of office he went to england on leave of absence leaving sir rufane shaw donkin to act as governor in his place  lord charles seems to have been a resentful as well as an incapable man for immediately after his return to the colony in 1821 he overturned the policy of the acting governor simply because he and sir rufane were at personal enmity  the colony at that time and the home government afterwards approved of the wise measures of the latter  he had arranged the military forces on the frontier so as to afford the new settlers the greatest possible amount of protection the cape corps men had been partly placed at their disposal both to assist and defend those who found their allotted farms too small had them increased to the extent of the farms of their dutch neighbours acceptable public officers were appointed provisions were supplied on credit and everything in short had been done to cheer and encourage the settlers during the period of gloom which followed their first great calamity the failure of the wheatcrops  all this was upset on the return of lord charles somerset  with a degree of tyranny and want of judgment worthy of a mere jackinoffice he immediately removed from the magistracy of the british settlement of albany a favourite and able man to make room for one of his own proteges and supporters  he withdrew troops from one of the most important frontier villages in a strategic point of view and stopped the formation of a road to it thus compelling the settlers to desert it and leave their standing crops to the surprised but pleased kafirs who were perplexed as well as emboldened by the vacillating policy of white governors  in addition to this he gave permission to the savage chief macomo to occupy the land so vacated thus paving the way for future wars  instead of encouraging traffic with the kafirs he rendered it illegal  he issued a proclamation forbidding all public meetings for political purposes he thwarted the philanthropic and literary pringle and fairbairn in their attempts to establish a newspaper and drove the former from the colony but why proceed  we cite these facts merely to account for the cloud on edwin brooks brow and for the fact that at this time many of the british settlers who would gallantly have faced the rust and other troubles and difficulties sent to them by providence could not bear the oppression which driveth a wise man mad but throwing up all their hopes and privileges as settlers scattered themselves far and wide over the colony  this as it happened was much to the advantage of themselves and the old dutch settlers with whom they mingled  those of them who remained behind however continued to fight the battle against oppression and circumstances most manfully  long and patiently did mrs brook listen to her visitor and husband while they indignantly discussed these subjects  but why said she at last giving vent to her feelings why does the government at home not remove such an incapable and wicked governor and give us a better  because my dear replied edwin with a smile the incapable and wicked governor happens to possess almost despotic power and can gain the ear of men in high places at home so that they are deceived by him while all who venture to approach them except through this governor are regarded with suspicion being described as malcontents  and yet continued brook growing warm at the thought of his wrongs we do not complain of those at home or of the natural disadvantages of the country to which we have been sent  we settlers are actuated by one undivided feeling of respect and gratitude to the british government which future reverses will never efface but it is peculiarly hard to have been sent to this remote and inaccessible corner of the globe and to be left to the control of one individual who misrepresents us and debars us the right to express our collective sentiments  why we might as well be living under the dominion of the turk  but a word in your ear frank dobson meetings have been held private ones while you were away in the bush and our case has been properly represented at last and a royal commission of inquiry is to be sent out to put things right  so theres hope for us yet  the clouds which have been so long lowering are i think beginning to clear away  while the sanguine settler was thus referring to the clouds of adversity which had for more than two years hovered over the young settlement the natural clouds were accumulating overhead in an unusually threatening manner  long periods of drought are frequently followed in south africa by terrible thunderstorms  one of them seemed to be brewing just then  i fear hans and considine will get wet jackets before they arrive said frank dobson rising and going to the window  hans and considine exclaimed gertie with a flush are they here  ay they came with me as far as grahamstown on business of some sort by the way what a big place that is becoming quite a town  when we saw it first you remember it was a mere hamlet the headquarters of the troops  it will be a city some day prophesied brook as he put on an old overcoat that had hitherto survived the ravages of time you see all our comrades who have discovered that farming is not their vocation are hiving off into it and many of them being firstrate mechanics they have taken to their trades while those with mercantile tendencies have opened stores  you shall see that things will shake into their proper places and right themselves in time and this will become a flourishing colony for the most of us are young and full of british pluck while the climate despite a few trifling disadvantages is really splendid  edwin brook spoke heartily as he clapped his hat firmly on preparatory to going out to make things secure against the expected storm  at the same moment the south african stormfiend an unusually large though not frequently obtrusive one laughed in a voice of thunder and nearly dashed in the windows with a tempest of wind and rain  as if his voice had called up spirits from the vasty deep two horsemen suddenly appeared approaching at full speed  one of them was of unusual size  here they come just in time exclaimed gertie clapping her hands in excitement  the girl spoke and acted there  then she blushed for the woman interfered  hans marais reached the quince hedge first and sprang off his steed charlie considine came second  with a wild whoop he caused his steed to leap the garden gate and dismounted at the cottage door  then there was a hearty welcoming and inquiring and shaking of bands while the travellers were congratulated on having just escaped the storm  while this was going on at mount hope the skyds were actively engaged in gathering in their rattle and otherwise making their place secure they had more than once been warned that their position was one of danger but being young athletic and rollicking they had not cared hitherto to remove their humble dwelling  it was time enough to do that they said when lovely woman should come on the scene and render improvement in domicile necessary  bob skyd had more than once attempted to induce a lovely woman to invade the land and enlighten the cave but somehow without success  we shall have it stiff said john as the three brothers approached their burrow  and heavy added bob  james made no remark but opened the door  it was growing dark at the time and inside their cavern only a dim light prevailed  whywhatshallo  i say  jim leaped back with a look of alarm  the brothers gazed in and saw in the region of their bed which held three easily a pair of glaring eyeballs  the brothers although not superstitious were by no means free from human weakness  at the same time they were gifted with a large share of animal courage  with beating heart john struck a light and held up a flaming brimstone match  this caused the eyes to glare with fearful intensity and revealed a distinct pair of horns  at that moment the match went out  with anxious trepidation another light was struck and then it was discovered that a recently purchased goat had under a wrong impression taken possession of the family bed  laughing at this they lit a tallow candle which was stuck into that most convenient of candlesticksan empty bottle  the brothers although not proficients were mechanical in their way one had set up the household bed another had constructed a table which had broken down only six times since their arrival and the third had contrived a sofa  this last was jims work  it was a masterpiece in its way of simplicity and consisted of two rough planks laid on two mounds of earth the whole being covered with a piece of chintz which fell in a curtain to the floor  this curtain like love covered a multitude of improprieties in the shape of old boots dirty linen miscellaneous articles and a seachest  sitting down on the sofa john skyd laughed long and heartily at the scene with the goat  his laugh suddenly ceased and was replaced by an exclamation and a look of anxious surprise  something had moved under the sofa  snakes occurred to their minds at once and the deadly character of south african snakes was well known  look out boys cried john leaping on the sofa and seizing a sword which hung on a peg just above itfetch the light  bob quickly obeyed and revealed the tail of a large cobra disappearing among the improprieties  jim ran to a rude cupboard where pistols and ammunition were kept and began to load with small shot  this way i hold it closer to the wall said john in an earnest voice i see one of his coils at the back of the sofa  now then steady there  he made a deadly thrust as he spoke and pinned the snake to the ground but evidently by the wrong coil for in a moment its angry head was seen twining up towards the handle of the sword  quick jimthe pistol  jim was ready and bob raised the curtain of the sofa while john stood in readiness to let go the sword and bolt if the reptile should prove to be capable of reaching his hand  fire jim fire look sharp cried john skyd  jim took aim and fired  the candle was put out by the concussion  in the dark john could risk the danger no longer  he let go the sword and sprang with a shout upon the bed  bob and jim made for the same place of refuge and tumbling over each other broke the pint bottle and the candle  securing a fragment of the latter they proceeded once more to strike a light with quaking hearts while a horrible hissing and lashing was heard under the sofa  at last light was again thrown on the scene and when the curtain was cautiously raised the cobra was seen to be writhing in its deathagoniesriddled with shot and still pinned with the sword  this scene closed most appropriately with a flash of lightning and a tremendous clap of thunderfollowed immediately by cataracts of rain    chapter sixteen  the great floods of 1823  all that night and all next day rain came down on the land in continuous floods  the settlers had previously been visited with occasional storms which had roused some alarm among the timid and done a little damage but nothing like this had yet befallen them  the water appeared to descend in sheets and not only did the great rivers wax alarmingly but every rill and watercourse became a brawling river  the skyds and one or two others who like themselves had built too near the edge of streams were the first to suffer  this wont do said john skyd on the evening of the second day as he and his brothers sat in front of their cavern gazing at the turbid river which thick and yellow as peasoup was hurrying trees bushes and wrack in formidable masses to the sea  we must shift our abode come along  without a word more the brothers entered their cave and began to carry out their goods and chattels  they were strong and active but they had miscalculated the rapidity of the flood  fortunately most of their valuables were removed to higher ground in time but before all was got out a sudden increase in the rushing river sent a huge wave curling round the entire piece of ground on which their farm lay  it came on with devastating force bearing produce fences fruittrees piggeries and every movable thing on its foaming crest  the brothers dropped their loads and ran  next moment the cavern was hollowed out to twice its former size and the sofa the rude cupboard the seachest and family bed were seen with all the miscellaneous improprieties careering madly down the yellow flood  in their trousers and shirtsleevesfor they had thrown off their coats as all active men do in an emergencythe brothers watched the demolition of their possessions and hopes in solemn silence  i think said john at length with a sigh ive made up my mind to join frank dobson now  bob and jim smiled grimly but said never a word  meanwhile the settlers of mount hope farm were not idle  although not fully alive to the danger of the storm they saw enough to induce a course of rapid action  goods and cattle were removed from lowlying buildings to higher ground but the dwellinghouse being on the highest point in the neighbourhoodwith the exception of the hills themselves was deemed safe  in these arrangements the family were ably assisted by the unexpected accession of their friends  hans considine and dobson taxed their activity and strength to the utmost so that things were soon put in a state of security  dobson did indeed think once or twice of his old chums on the river but a feeling of gallantry prevented his deserting the ladies in the midst of danger and besides he argued the skyds are well able to look after themselves  just as this thought passed through his mind the chums in question appeared upon the scene announcing the fact that their entire farm had been swept away and that the water was still rising  well it cant rise much higher now said edwin brook after condoling with his young friends on their misfortunes and the moment it begins to abate we shall go down to save all we can of your property  you know my poor fellows that i shall be only too glad to help you to the utmost of my power in such a sad extremity as this  the brothers thanked their neighbour and meanwhile aided the others in removing the farmproduce and implements to higher ground  night at length settled down on the scene and the wearied party returned to the cottage for food and rest  do you think mr marais said gertie looking up timidly at the handsome young dutchman that the worst of it is over  hans who felt somewhat surprised and chilled by the mister replied that he hoped it was  but hans was wrong  late that night after they had all lain down to rest edwin brook feeling sleepless and uneasy rose to look out at the window  all was comparatively still and very dark  there was something grey on the ground he thought but judged it to be mist  the noise of the storm with the exception of rushing streams had gone down and though it still rained there was nothing very unusual to cause alarm  he lay down again and tried to sleep but in vain  then he thought he heard the sound of the river louder than before  at the same time there was a noise that resembled the lapping of water round the frame of the house  jumping up he ran to his door opened it discovered that the supposed mist was water and that his dwelling was an island in a great sea  to shout and rouse the household was the work of an instant  his guests were men of promptitude  they had merely thrown themselves down in their clothes and appeared in an instant  mrs brook and gertie were also ready but mrs scholtz being fond of comfort had partially undressed and was distracted between a wild effort to fasten certain garments and restrain junkie who startled by the shout was roaring lustily  not a moment to lose said brook running hastily into the room where all were now assembled  everything is lost  we must think only of life  lend a helping hand to the women friendsmind the boycome wife  brook was sharp cool and decisive in his manner  seizing his wife round the waist he hurried her out into the dark night stepping as he did so above the ankles in rising water  dobson considine and the three brothers turned with a mutual impulse towards gertie but hans marais had already taken possession of her and almost carrying her in his powerful arms followed her father  come my howlin toolip said george dally youre my special and precious charge  shut up will you  he seized the child and bore him away with such violence that the howling was abruptly checked while scholtz quietly gathering his still halfclad spouse under an arm followed with heavy stride  the others each seizing the object that in his eyes appeared to be most valuablesuch as a desk or workboxsprang after the household and left the house to its fate  they first made for the cattlekraals but these were already flooded and the cattle gone  then they tried a barn which stood a little higher but it was evidently no place of refuge for the stream just there was strong and broke against it with violence  to the hills shouted hans lifting gertie off the ground altogether as if she had been a little child  there was no time for ceremony  edwin brook lifted his wife in the same manner for the water was deepening at every step and the current strengthening  the darkness which had appeared dense at first seemed to lighten as they became accustomed to it and soon a terrible state of things became apparent  turbid water was surging among the trees and bushes everywhere and rushing like a millrace in hollows  one such hollow had to be crossed before the safety of the hills could be gained the water reached edwins waist as he waded through  to prevent accident john skyd and considine waded alongside and supported him james skyd performed the same office for hans and bob waded just below scholtz and his burdenwhich latter in a paroxysm of alarm still tried frantically to complete her toilet  the hills were reached at last and the whole party was safeas far at least as the flood was concernedbut a terrible prospect lay before them  the farm of mount hope was by that time a sea of tumultuous water which seemed in the darkness of the night to be sweeping away and tearing up trees bushes and houses  behind and around them were the hills whose every crevice and hollow was converted into a wild watercourse  above was the black sky pouring down torrents of rain incessantly so that the very ground seemed to be turning into mud and slipping away from beneath their feet  fortunately there was no wind  to spend the night here will be death to the women and child said edwin brook as they gathered under a thick bush which formed only a partial shelter yet i see no way of escape  soaked as they are a cavern even if we can find one will not be of much service for our matches are hopelessly wet  we must try to reach widow mertons farm said john skyd  it is only three miles off and stands on highish ground  its a bad enough road by daylight in fine weather said george dally on whose broad shoulder junkie had fallen sound asleep quite regardless of damp or danger but in a dark night with a universal flood it seems to me that it would be too much for the ladies  i know a cave now up on the hillside not far off which is deep an like to be dryish  never do interrupted hans marais to whose arm gertie clung with a feeling that it was her only hope theyd die of cold before morning we must keep moving  yes let us try to reach the widows farm said poor mrs brook anxiously i feel stronger i think i can walk now  zee vidow is our only chanzehold up mein vrow said scholtz taking a firmer grasp of his wife who having leisure to think and look about her now felt her heart begin to fail  i know zee road vell continued scholtz  it is bad but i have zeen vurse  ve must carry zee vimen  zey could not valk  as the women made no objection those who had carried them from the house again raised them in their armsmrs scholtz insisting however on being treated a little less like a sack of old clothesand the march along the hillside was begun  george dally knowing the way best was set in advance to take the responsibility of guide as well as the risk of being swept away while fording the torrents  the brothers skyd being free from precious burdens marched next to be ready to support the guide in case of accident and to watch as well as guard the passage of dangerous places by those in rear  then followed in succession mr brook with his wife charlie considine hans with gertie and scholtz with his vrow the procession closing with frank dobson and junkie the latter having been transferred to frank when dally took the lead  it was a slow as well as dangerous march on that dreary night because every step had to be taken with care and the rivulets white though they were with foam could scarcely be seen in the thick darkness  many a fall did they get too and many a bruise though fortunately no bones were broken  once george dally miscalculating the depth of a savage little stream stepped boldly in and was swept away like a flash of light  jack skyd made a grasp at him lost his balance and followed for a moment the others stopped in consternation but they were instantly relieved by hearing a laugh from george a few yards down the stream as he assisted skyd to land  at another time scholtz was not careful enough to follow exactly in the footsteps of hans and while crossing a torrent he put his foot in a deep hole and went down to the armpits thereby immersing his vrow up to her neck  a wild shriek from the lady was followed by zounds hold me op from the man  hans turned short round stretched out his long right armthe left being quite sufficient to support gertieand seizing the germans shaggy hair with a mighty grip held on till one of the skyds returned to the rescue  it was also a melancholy march on that dismal night for poor edwin brook was well aware and fully alive to the fact that he was a ruined man  his labour for the previous three years was totally lost and his property swept entirely away  only life was sparedbut for that he felt so thankful as to feel his losses slightly at the time  the brothers skyd were also painfully alive to the fact that they were ruined and as they staggered and stumbled along a sinking of heart unusual to their gay and cheerful natures seemed to have the effect of sinking their steps deeper in the soft mire through which they waded  only two of the party were in any degree cheerful  gertie although overwhelmed by the sudden calamity which she had yet very imperfectly realised felt a degree of comforta sort of undercurrent of peaceat being borne so safely along in such powerful arms and hans marais huge and deepchested though he was felt a strange and mysterious sensation that his heart had grown too large for his body that night  it perplexed him much at the time and seemed quite unaccountable  the storm had revelled furiously round the widow mertons wattleanddab cottage and the water had risen to within a few feet of its foundations but the effect on her mind was as nothing compared with that produced by the sudden storming of her stronghold by the mount hope family in the dead of night or rather in the small hours of morning the widow was hospitable  she and her sons at once set about making the unfortunates as comfortable as the extent of their habitation and the state of their larder would admit  but the widow merton was not the only one of the albany settlers who had to offer hospitality during the continuance of that terrible catastrophe of 1823 and edwin brooks was not the only family that was forced to accept it  all over the land the devastating flood passed like the besom of destruction  hundreds of those who had struggled manfully against the blight of the wheat crops and kafir thefts and bandit raids and oppression on the part of those who ought to have afforded aid and protection were sunk to the zero of misfortune and despair by this overwhelming calamity for in many cases the ruin was total and apparently irremediable  everywhere standing crops implements of husbandry and even dwellings were swept away and whole families found themselves suddenly in a state of utter destitution  the evil was too widespread to admit of the few who were fortunate enough to escape rendering effectual assistance to the many sufferers for it was obvious that hundreds of pounds would not be sufficient to succour the infant colony  in this extremity gods opportunity was found  the hearts of men and women far away at capetown in india and in england were touched by the story of distress generosity was awakened and purses were opened men such as he rutherfoord of capetown the reverend doctor philip the reverend w shaw and others likeminded entered heartily into the work of charity and eventually some ten thousand pounds were distributed among those who had suffered  to many this was as life from the dead some who would never have recovered the blow took heart again braced their energies anew and ere long the wattleanddab cottages were rebuilt the gardens replanted and the lands cultivated as before  the existence of the settlement was saved but its prosperity was not yet secured  the battle had gone sorely against the valiant band of immigrants and very nearly had they been routed but the reinforcements had enabled them to rally and renew the fight  still it was a fight and much time had yet to come and go before they could sit down in the sunshine of comparative peace and enjoy the fruits of their industry  meanwhile the oppressions and mismanagements of the colonial government went on as before  it were useless in a tale like this to inflict details on our readers  suffice it to say that in the distribution of lands in treaties with the kafirs in the formation of laws for the protection of hottentots and slaves in the treatment of the settlers a state of things was brought about which may be described as confusion worse confounded and the oppressed people at last demanded redress with so loud a voice that it sounded in england and produced the royal commission of investigation already referred to in a previous chapter  the arrival of the gentlemen composing this commission followed close on the floods of 1823  the event long looked for and anxiously desired was hailed with a degree of eager delight scarcely to be understood except by those who had gone through the previous years of highhanded oppression of weary wrangling and appeal and of that hope deferred which maketh the heart sick  expectation was raised to the highest pitch and when it was heard that the commissioners had reached capetown preparations were made in grahamstown to give them a warm reception    chapter seventeen  treats of hopes fears and prospects besides describing a peculiar battle  mounted on a pair of sturdy ponies hans marais and charlie considine galloped over the plains of the zuurveld in the direction of grahamstown  the brothers skyd had preceded them edwin brook was to follow  it was a glorious day though this was nothing unusual in that sunny clime and the spirits of the young men were high  excitement has a tendency to reproduce itself  hans and his friend did not feel particularly or personally interested in the arrival of the royal commissioners but they were sympathetic and could not resist surrounding influences  everywhere they overtook or passed or somehow met with cavaliers on the roadmiddleaged and youngfor old men were not numerous there at that timeall hastening to the same goal the city of the settlers and all had the same tale to tell the same hopes to express  things are going to be put right now  the commissioners have full powers to inquire and to act  we court investigation  the sky is brightening at last the sun of prosperity will rise in the east ere long  in grahamstown itself the bustle and excitement culminated  friends from the country were naturally stirred by meeting each other there besides being additionally affected by the object of the meeting crowds gathered in the chief places of the fast rising town to discuss grievances and friends met in the houses of friends to do the same and draw up petitions  at last the commissioners arrived and were welcomed by the people with wild enthusiasm  abel slingsby an impulsive youth and a friend of hans marais who had just been married to a pretty neighbour of hans in the karroo and was in grahamstown on his honeymoon declared that he would without a moments hesitation throw up his farm and emigrate to brazil if things were not put right without delay  no you wouldnt said his pretty bride with an arch look youd take time to think well over it and consult with me first  right lizzie right so i would cried slingsby with a laugh  but you must admit that we have had and still have great provocation just think he added with returning indignation of freeborn british subjects being allowed no newspaper to read except one that is first revised by a jealous despotic governor and of our being obliged to procure a pass to entitle us to go about the country as if we were kafirs or hottentotsto say nothing of the insolence of the jacksinoffice who grant such passes or the ridiculous laws regarding the nativesbah  i have no patience to recount our wrongs come hans lets go out and see whats doing and dont forget liz to have candles ready for the illumination and tell the tottie to clean my gun  i must be ready to do them honour like other loyal subjects  the young men sallied forth and found that the commissioners had been received by the authorities with sullen courtesy  a clear sign that the authorities know themselves to be in the wrong said considine for honest men always court open investigation  this attitude looks like rebellion against the british government on the part of the colonial authorities said hans  i shouldnt wonder if we were to get a surprise from them while in such a mood  evening drew on apace and crowds of people moved about to witness the illumination and other evidences of rejoicing while some of the more enthusiastic sought to express their sentiments by firing a volley with small arms  according to an eyewitness see note 1 the signal was taken up at once and the example spreading like wildfire the hills soon resounded on all sides with a noise that might have been mistaken for the storming of the town  this was a demonstration the authorities could not brook  the necessary orders were given and soon the bugles of the garrison sounded the assembly at scotts barracks while the trumpets of the mounted rifles at fort england sent squadrons of horse thundering up bathurst street to assist in the terrible emergency caused by blank cartridges and joyous hurrahs  parties of infantry patrolled the streets making prisoners in all directions and the people assembled in church square to see the illuminations were surrounded by troops  the leading men there foreseeing the advantage that would result so their cause by such a style of repressing public opinion advised those around them to keep quiet and be true to their principles  hans marais and his friends happened to be in church square at the time and at once fell in with and acted on the peaceful advice though the impulsive slingsby found it difficult to restrain his british spirit  see he said pointing to a gentleman who approached there goes the reverend mr geary  do you know him hans  hes a man of the true sort  let me tell you in your ear that i heard he has got into bad odour in high quarters for refusing to have anything to do with a proscription list furnished by the governor which contains the names of persons who are to be shunned and narrowly watchedsome of these persons being the best and most loyal in the colony  as he spoke the clergyman referred to was stopped by a friend and they overheard him express much gratification at the arrival of the commissioners and a hope that abuses would soon be reformed at the same time stating his determination not to be a party man  unfortunately for the clergyman there were minions of the government within earshot at the time  his words were reported and shortly afterwards he was summarily removed  just then some of the cape corps men charged part of the crowd and scattered it  at the same time various persons were arrested  among these was the indignant slingsby  unable to restrain his ire he called out shame and was instantly pounced upon by a serjeant and party of infantry  immediately becoming sensible of his folly after a momentary struggle he suffered himself to be led quietly away but looked over his shoulder as he was marched off to the tronk and said hurriedly  console lizzie hans  with a look of sympathy hans assured his friend that he would do so without fail and then with considine proceeded to the house where poor lizzie had already lit up the windows and got the gun in readiness  they dare not keep him long said hans in his vain attempts to comfort the weeping bride and depend upon it that the conduct of the authorities this evening will go a long way to damage their own cause and advance that of the settlers  hans was right  slingsby was liberated the following morning  the commissioners turned out to be able men who were not to be hoodwinked true a considerable period elapsed before the report afterwards made by them took effect and for some time the settlers continued to suffer but in the following year the fruits of the visit began to appear among other improvements was the creation of a council to advise and assist the governorconsisting of seven members including himself whereby a wholesome check was put upon his arbitrary power  trial by jury was also introduced and the power of magistrates was modified these and other more or less beneficial changes took place so that there was reason to believe a time of real prosperity had at length dawned  but the settlers were not yet out of the furnace  providence saw fit to send other troubles to try them besides unjust and foolish men in power  there was still another plague in store  one day charlie considine rode towards the farm which had now for several years been his home  the young members of the marais family had grown learned under his care and he was now regarded as a son by old marais and his wife while the children looked on him as an elder brother  charlie had not intended to stay so long and sometimes his conscience reproved him for having given up his profession of medicine but the longer he stayed with those sweettempered dutchafrican farmers with whom his lot had been cast the more he liked them and the more they liked him  what more natural then that he should stay on from day to day until he became almost one of themselves  when people are happy they desire no change  but it must not be supposed that the youths office was a sinecure  the young marais were numerous and some of them were stupidthough amiable  the trouble caused by these however was more than compensated by the brightness of others the friendship of hans and the sunshine of bertha  the last by the way had now like gertrude brook sprung into a woman and though neither so graceful nor so sprightly as the pretty english girl she was preeminently sweet and lovable  well one day as we have said charlie considine rode towards the farm he had been out hunting alone and a springbok tied across the horse behind him showed that he had been successful  rousing himself from a reverie he suddenly found himself in the midst of a scene of surpassing beauty  in front lay a quiet pond whose surface was so still that it might have been a sheet of clear glass  on his left the familiar mountainrange beyond the farm appeared bluer and nearer than usual owing to the intense heat  to the right the undulating karroo covered with wildflowers and dotted with clumps of mimosabush terminated abruptly in a lake which stretched away in some places like a sea to the horizon  islands innumerable studded the smooth surface of this lake and were reflected in its crystal depths not a breath of air riffled its surface and there was a warm sunny brightness a stillness a deep quietude about the whole scene which were powerfully suggestive of heavenly peace and rest  glorious exclaimed considine reining up to a walking pace  how delicious while it lasts and yet how evanescent  does it not resemble my life here  that cannot last  charlie was not given to moralising but somehow he could not help it that day  with an unusually profound sigh he shook the reins and cantered towards the lake  it was not the first time he had seen it and he knew full well that it would not bar his progress  even as he gave vent to the sigh the glassy waters trembled undulated retreated and under the influence of a puff of air slowly melted away leaving the waterless karroo in its place  truly it is no wonder that thirsty travellers in african deserts have from time immemorial rushed towards these phantom waters of the wellknown mirage to meet with bitter disappointment  the resemblance is so perfect that any one might be deceived if unacquainted with the phenomenon  see note 2  on coming within sight of the farm considine observed columns of thick smoke rising from various parts of the homestead  with a vague feeling of alarm he put spurs to his horse  drawing quickly nearer he perceived that the smoke arose from the garden and that the people seemed to be bustling about in a state of violent activity  stretching out at full speed he was soon at the garden gate and found that all the bustle energising and shouting went on at the end farthest from the gate  as he threw the reins over a post and sprang in he could see through the trees that every one in the establishment was engaged in a wild frantic fight in which sticks and stones bushes and blankets were used indiscriminately  the smoke that rose around suggested fire on the plains and he ran in haste to render assistance  it was a goodly garden that he passed through  fruittrees of every kind were so laden with golden treasures that many of the branches unable to bear the strain had given way and the superabundance trailed upon the earth  vegetables of all kinds covered the borders with lusciouslooking bulbs and delicious green leaves while grapes currants figs etcetera half smothered their respective bushes through this rich display of plenty considine dashed and on reaching the wall at the further end found conrad marais with his wife and daughter sons servants and slaves engaged in furious conflict with locusts  the enemy had come on them suddenly and in force  the ground was alive with them  armies legions were therenot fullgrown flying locusts but young ones styled footgangers in other words crawlers walkers or hoppersand every soul in the establishment had turned out to fight  even the modest bertha was there defending a breach in the garden wall with a big shawl dishevelled in dress and hair flushed in face bold and resolute in aspect laying about her with the vigour of an amazon the usually phlegmatic conrad defended another weak point while his at other times amiable spouse stood near him making fearful and frequent raids upon the foe with the branch of of a thorntree  hans like gulliver among the lilliputs guarded a gate in company with four of his brothers and they toiled and moiled like heroes while perspiration rolled in streams from their blazing faces  elsewhere men and women boys and girlsblack brown and yellowexerted themselves to the uttermost  never was fortress more gallantly defended never were ramparts more courageously assailed  hundreds thousands tens of thousands were slain under that garden wallhundreds of thousands millions hopped over their comrades backs and continued the assault with unconquerable pluck  the heroes of ancient greece and rome were nothing to them horses cattle and sheep were driven in among them and made to prance wildly not in the hope of destroying the foeas well might you have attempted to blot out the milky waybut for the purpose of stemming the torrent and turning if possible the leading battalions aside from the garden  they would not turn aside  on hoppers onstraight on was their watchword  death or victory must have been their motto  at one spot was a hollow trench or dry ditch leading towards an outhouse which intervened between the locusts and the garden  no storming party was detailed to carry the point  where the numbers were so vast as to cover the whole country that was needless  they marched in columns and the columns that chanced to come up to the point voluntarily and promptly undertook the duty  they swarmed into the ditch  considine and a small hottentot boy observed the move and with admirable skill kept the advancing column in check until a fire was kindled in the ditch  it was roused to a pitch of fierce heat that would have satisfied nebuchadnezzar himself and was then left for other points of danger in the walls claimed more vigorous attention  onward hopped and crawled the enemy and stormed the fire  the leading files were roasted alive those following tumbled over their dead bodies into the flames had the rest wished to take warning by the fate of their comradeswhich they did notthey would have found it impossible to escape for those behind pushed them on  the fire was filled with the dead overwhelmed by the dying fairly put out by both and the victorious army marched over in triumph  then the outhouse met them but they scorned to turn aside although there was a four foot wall which one might have supposed more practicable  they walked straight up the outhouse and over it and were triumphantly descending the other side in myriads before they were discovered and met with shrieks of vengeance by mrs marais  its of no use lads gasped old marais pausing for a moment to recover breath the place is doomed  dont say so father cried hanscome on boys weve nearly stopped them at this gate  nearlybut not quite  a few minutes later and the strength of the garrison began to fail  how longhas thislasted asked considine pausing for a moment beside bertha and panting violently  sincebreakfast gasped the exhausted girl wediscovered them just after youleft ussee they come  hallo this way hans bring the flags shouted considine observing the tremendous body of reserves which were following up the success of the stormers of the fire  it is a curious fact that the waving of flags had been found of more avail on that occasion than most other means  the beating of the enemy with bushes and blankets was no doubt very effective but it killed scattered and confused them so that they pressed as it were blindly on their fate whereas the flagwaving appeared to touch a cord of intelligence  they saw it were obviously affected though not killed by it and showed a tendency to turn aside  it was however only a tendency soon the advance was resumed in force  the human giants were beatenfairly overwhelmed  the wall was scaled and the garden finally entered by countless myriads of this truly formidable though individually contemptible enemy  thus are the strong at times confounded by things that are weak  had these been flying instead of pedestrian locusts they might perhaps have been turned aside by fires for this is sometimes done  when a farmer sees a cloud of them cominga cloud it may be of three miles in length by half a mile in breadth or morehe kindles fires round his garden and fields raises a dense smoke and may sometimes though not often succeed in preventing them from alighting  but the younger or jumping locusts strong in the stupidity of youth cannot be turned aside thus  nothing indeed but a rushing stream will stop them even a mighty river if not rapid is insufficient  stagnant pools they cross by drowning the leading multitudes until a bridgenot of sighs butof death is formed of size sufficient to carry them over they even cross the great orange river thus in places where its flow is calm  in africa they pass in such countless swarms both winged and wingless that their approach is viewed with dismay for where they rest they devour every green thing and flocks and herds are left utterly destitute so that starvation or change of ground is unavoidable  they usually begin their march or flight after sunrise and encamp at sunsetand woe betide the luckless farmer on whose lands they chance to fix their temporary abode  locustswarms are followed by a little birdnamed springkaanvogel or locustbirdwhich comes in such dense flocks as almost to darken the air  these locustbirds are about the size of a swallow with numerous speckles like a starling  they live exclusively on locustsfollow them build their nests rear their young in the midst of them and devour them  but this is by no means the locusts only enemy  every animal domestic and wild destroys and eats him  cattle sheep horses fowls dogs antelopesall may be seen devouring him with greediness  he even eats himself the cannibal for if any of his comrades get hurt or meet with accidents in travelling as they often do the nearest fellowtravellers fall on kill and devour the unfortunates without delay  the only human beings who rejoice at sight of the terrible locusts are the bushmen  these have neither herds flocks nor crops to lose and though the wild animals on which they subsist are by these insects driven away the bushmen care little for they delight in fresh locusts follow them up feed on them and preserve quantities by drying them for future use  before morning the splendid garden of conrad marais was a leafless fruitless wilderness  not a scrap of green or gold was left  and his case was by no means singular  the whole colony was more or less visited by this plague at that time and thus the reviving spirits of the settlers were once again knocked down by a crushing blow    note 1  reverend aa dugmore the reminiscences of an albany settler page 23    note 2  the author having seen the mirage while riding on the karroo writes from personal experience    chapter eighteen  fairs fights freetrade factions and other matters  in the heart of the wild mountain scenery of the frontier a grimlooking fort had been built to keep the kafirs in check  it was named fort wilshire and a truly warlike place it was with its high walls and cannon its red troops of the line green rifles and blue artillery lying remote from civilised men it was a dreary enough place to the troops stationed there though with that ready spirit of adaptation to circumstances which characterises the british soldier the garrison dispelled some of its ennui by hunting  at one period of the year however the little frontier fortress thoroughly changed its silent and solitary character  the government yielding at last to earnest entreaties and strong representations had agreed to permit under certain restrictions the opening of trade with the kafirs  a periodical fair was established and appointed to be held under the guns of fort wilshire  the colonial traders full of energy and thirsting for opportunity took advantage of the fair and assembled in hundreds while the kafirs in a species of unbelieving surprise met them in thousands to exchange wares  it was a new idea to many of these black sons and daughters of nudity that the horns which they used to throw away as useless were in reality valuable merchandise and that the gum which was to be had for the gathering could procure for them beads and buttons and brasswire and cotton with many other desirable things that caused their red mouths to water  on the day in which we introduce the scene to the reader some of the colonial traders had already arrived at the fair  these were not all of the same calibre  some of small means had commenced modestly with a shoulderbundle and went through the new land as peddlers and packmen in older lands had done before them  others with more means had set up the horsepack or the cart and all aspired while some had attained to the waggon  these penetrated to every part of the frontier supplying the dutch boers with luxuries hitherto undreamed of which ere long became necessities obtaining from them sheep and cattle in exchange with a fair proportion of their hoarded rixdaalers  the traders then returned to the towns sold their stock purchased fresh supplies and went back to the interior  thus was laid the foundation of a commerce which was destined in future years to become of great importance not only to the colony but to the world  the opening of trade with the kafirs had added materially to the prosperity of the traders and those assembled at fort wilshire represented all the different classes  among the crowds who encamped under the fort guns stephen orpin the wesleyan represented those who stood on the first round of the mercantile ladder  orpin was stout of limb broad of shoulder strong of heart and empty of pocket he therefore carried a pack in which were to be found not only gloves neckerchiefs and trinkets for the women as well as gaudy waistcoats etcetera for the men but new testaments tracts and little books in the dutch language wherewith stephen hoped to do good to the souls of his customers  orpin had come to the fair with the double view of trading and holding intercourse on spiritual things with the kafirs  he longed to preach christ the crucified saviour to the heathen  of such men thank god there always have been and we believe always will be many in the worldmen in regard to whom bigots are apt to say lord forbid him for he followeth not with us but of whom the lord said forbid him not for he that is not against us is on our part  among those who had attained to the enviable oxwaggon were our friends john skyd and frank dobson  possessing a remnant of their means when they gave up farming two of the brothers james and robert established a small general store in grahamstown while john and frank set up a joint waggon and took to hunting and trading on a large scale  of course they bought all their supplies of brasswire beads and buttons powder and shot etcetera from the skyd store and sold their ivory etcetera at the same place with mutual benefit  it was a strange and stirring sight to behold the long files of kafir women straight and graceful as venus in body ugly almost as baboons in visage coming to the fair from all parts of the land with enormous loads on their heads of oxhides horns gum and elephants tusks threading the narrow bushpaths in long single files they came from hillside and thicket towards the great centre of attraction  gradually the crowd thickened  kafir chiefs with leopardskins thrown over their otherwise naked bodies stalked about with an assumption of quiet dignity which they found it difficult to maintain amid the excitement and temptations of the fair  swarthy groups found shelter among the trees that fringed the keiskamma below the postthe women resting after having gladly laid down their burdens their lords sitting on their heels with knobkerrie in hand jealously guarding their property  the great chief himself was there laying seignorial taxation on his people and even condescending to beg for the white mans brandy  come with me said orpin to a newly made dutch friend im told you understand kafir and i want you to interpret for me  will you  the dutchman said ja and went for orpin had a persuasive tongue and pleasant manner which induced all sorts of men to aid him  and so they two went down into the bush among the darkskinned crew and stephen preached in their wondering ears the old old story of the crossa story which is never told entirely in vain though many a time it does seem as if the effect of it were woefully disproportioned to the efforts of those who go forth bearing the precious seed  meanwhile skyd and dobson were driving lucrative bargains in another part of the field speaking wonderful kafir in the midst of a babel of dutch and english that was eminently suggestive of the ancient tower itself  besides the difficulties of language there were troubles also in reference to trade for kafirs although savage are fastidious  the men were as particular about their necklaces as any beau could be about the cut of his coat and the women were at times very hard to please in the matter of turbancovers and kaross backstripes  but after much haggling the contending parties came to terms to their mutual benefit and satisfaction  in another part of the market there seemed to be a tendency to riot either bargaining was more hotly carried on there or spirits of a pugnacious tendency were congregated  among them was a tall powerful kafir who had been evidently treated to a glass of something stronger than water  he was not tipsy he was only elevated but the elevation roused his ire to such an extent that he began to boast loudly that he could fight any one and flourished his sticks or kerries in a defiant manner  kafirs always fight with two sticks one to hit with the other to guard  a trader from the green isle chanced to pass this man and to be jostled by him  every one knows of the worlds opinion of the irishmans love for fighting  pat became nettled  arrah says he yer mighty fond o swagger but ill tache you manners you black baste  come on  the big kafir came on at once and made a blow at pats head with his knobkerrie that would have ended the fight at once if it had taken effect but the irishman well trained in the art guarded it neatly and returned with a blow so swift and vigorous that it fell on the pate of the savage like a flail  as well might pat have hit a rock  if there is a strong point about a black man it is his head  the irish man knew this but had forgotten it in the first flush of combat  he became wiser  meanwhile a crowd of excited traders and kafirs gathered round the combatants and backed them  the kafir made another wild swoop at his enemys skull but the blow was easily turned aside  pat returned with a feint at his foes head but came down with terrible force on the inside of his right knee  the kafir dropped his sticks seized his knee with both hands stood on one leg and howled in agony  scorning to strike a defenceless foe paddy gave him a dab on the end of his already flat nose by way of reminding him that he was off his guard  the kafir took the hint caught up his sticks and sprang at his opponent with the yell of a hyena whirling aloft both sticks at once the irishman had to leap aside and as he did so drew from the kafir a shriek of pain by hitting him sharply on the left shin adding to the effect immediately by a whack under the right eye that might have finished an average ox  the kafir fell more however because of the pain of the double blow than because of its force for he rolled about bellowing for a few seconds  then jumping up he renewed the fight there is no saying how long it might have lasted had not a party of troops chanced to pass just then who separated the combatants and dispersed the crowd  the fair however was made use of not only as an occasion for trading preaching and fighting but for plotting  chiefs met there in peace who might otherwise have failed to meet except in battle and these with chiefs of banditti from the mountains and malcontents from all quarters concocted and hatched designs against the wellbeing of individuals and of the public at large  at this time the colonists besides being troubled by savage thieves were threatened with disturbance from the intertribal feuds of the savages themselves  one tremendous zulu monster of the name of chaka who excelled nero himself in crueltywas driving other tribes of kafirs down into the colony and designing chiefs were beginning to think or hope that the opportunity had arrived for carrying out their favourite idea of driving the white man into the sea  in a dark forest glade not far from the fort and within hearing of its buglecalls stephen orpin walked up and down with one of the malcontents  i tell you ruyter it is in vain to join with the kafirs said orpin if all the hottentots in africa were to unite with them you would not be strong enough to crush the white man  why not demanded the hottentot angrily in his broken english we be strong as you and brave  but you are not so well armed said orpin  fact returned the freebooter but time vill make dat all squaar smugglers bring guns to we an pooder  ver soon be all right  listen ruyter you are like a child  you know nothing  the land from which the white man comes will never suffer him to be driven out of africa  england is rich in everything and will send men to fill the places of those who fall  besides i think god is on the white mans side because the white man in the main intends and tries to do good just think of the fair  the black man wants beads and brass wire and cotton and many other thingsthe white man brings these things from over the sea  on the other hand the white man wants hides horns ivorythe black man can supply these things  they meet to exchange good is done by each to the other  why should they fight  for revenge said ruyter darkly  no doubt revenge is sweet to you but it is sinful returned orpin besides the sweetness does not last long and will it let me ask make the black man happier or the white man more sorrowful in the longrun  you should think of others not only of yourself ruyter  does jan smit ever tink of odersof anybody but hisself  perhaps not but conrad marais does and so do many other men of like mind  god the father of all men is a god of peace and does not permit his children to gratify feelings of revenge  jesus the saviour of lost man is the prince of peace he will not deliver those who wilfully give way to revenge  i no want deliverance said the robber chief sternly  i know that replied orpin and it was to deliver you from that state of mind that jesus came  think ruyter think  he was interrupted at this point by the sound of an approaching oxwaggon  ruyter being a wellknown outlaw did not dare to show himself at the fair although not a whit worse in any respect than most of the kafir chiefs who walked openly there unchallenged  he shrank back into the shelter of the jungle while the trader awaited the coming up of the waggon  aha here you are orpinnot kept you waiting long i hope said john skyd as he followed his waggon into the glade  not long answered the trader but we must make the most of our time now for the day is far spent  it is but i could not manage to get away sooner  we had to lay in a supply of powder and lead for the hunt besides many other things dobson will be here with the other waggon immediatelyhes not fifty yards behindand then we shall start fair for the elephantground youre quite sure that you know the way i suppose  i would not undertake to guide you if i were not sure  in a few minutes dobson came up with the second waggon and the whole party set forth on a hunting expedition into the interior under the guidance of stephen orpin who had already wandered so much about the colony that he was beginning to be pretty well acquainted with a great extent of the border line  about the same time that skyd and dobson went off to the interior another party of hunters and explorers set out on an expedition from the scottish settlement of glen lynden  but before touching on this we will turn aside to relate an incident which affected the movements of both parties and has reference to a small though not unimportant personage of our story    chapter nineteen  describes a series of early risings  one fine morning early high up among the krantzes and dark jungles of a kloot or mountain gorge which branched off from glen lynden a noble specimen of an african savage awoke from his nights repose and stretched himself  he had spent the night among the lower branches of a mimosabush the opening into which was so small that it was a wonder how his large body could have squeezed through it  indeed it would have been quite impossible for him to have gained the shelter of that dark retreat if he had not possessed a lithe supple frame and four powerful legs furnished with tremendous claws  we should have mentioned perhaps that our noble savage was a magnificent leopardor cape tiger  as he stretched himself he laid back his head shut his eyes and yawned by which act he displayed a tremendous collection of canines and grinders with a pink throat of great capacity  the yawn ended in a gasp and then he raised his head and looked quietly about him gently patting the ground with his tail as a man might pat his bedclothes while considering what to do next  not unlike man he lay down at full length and tried to go to sleep again but it would not do  he had evidently had his full allowance and therefore got up and stretched himself again in a standing position  in this act bending his deep chest to the ground he uttered a low gurr of savage satisfaction sank his claws into the soil and gently tore a number of tough roots into shreds  sundry little creatures of various kinds in the neighbourhood hearing the gurr presented their tails to the sky and dived into their little holes with incredible rapidity  the leopard now shook off dull sloth and lashing his sides in a penitential manner with his tail glided through the opening in the mimosabush bounded into the branches of a neighbouring tree ran nimbly out to the end of one of them and leaping with a magnificent spring over a gully alighted softly on the turf at the other side trotting calmly into an open space he stopped to take a survey of surrounding nature  breakfast now naturally suggested itself  at least we may suppose so from a certain eager look which suddenly kindled in the leopards eye and a wrinkling of his nose as a bird flitted close over his head  at that moment a species of rabbit or cony chanced to hop round the corner of a rock  the lightningflash is not quicker than the spring with which the capetiger traversed the twenty feet between himself and his prey  the result was very effectual as regarded the cony but it was not much to gurr about in the way of breakfast  it was a mere whet to the appetite which increased the desire for more  advancing down the kloof with that stealthy gliding motion peculiar to the feline race the leopard soon came in sight of a fine bushbok whose sleek sides drew from him an irrepressible snicker of delight  but the bushbok was not within springrange  he was at the foot of a low precipice  creeping to the top of this with great caution the leopard looked over with a view to estimate distance  it was yet too far for a spring so he turned at once to seek a better way of approach  in doing so he touched a small stone which rolled over the krantz bounded from crag to cliff and carrying several other stones larger than itself along with it dashed itself at the very feet of the bushbok which wisely took to its heels and went off like the wind  sulky beyond all conception the leopard continued to descend the kloof until he reached a narrow pass from which were visible not far off the abodes of men  here he paused and couched in quiet contemplation  now there was another early waking on that fine morning though not quite so early as the one just described  master junkie brook lying in a packingbox which served as an extempore crib in the cottage of kenneth mctavish opened his large round eyes and rubbed them  getting up he observed that mrs scholtz was sound asleep and quietly dressed himself  he was a precocious child and had learned to dress without assistance  the lesson was more easily learned than beings living in civilised lands might suppose owing to the fact that he had only two garmentsa large leather jacket and a pair of leather trousers one huge button in front and one behind holding the latter securely to the former  a pair of veltschoen and a fur cap completed a costume which had been manufactured by the joint efforts of his mother and sister and mrs scholtz  the husband of the last on seeing it for the first time remarked that it vas more like me garb of a man of dirty zan a boy of dree  the garb had been made of such tough material that it seemed impossible to wear it out and of such an extremely easy fit that although the child had now lived in it upwards of two years there were not more than six patches on it anywhere  how junkie got to the baviaans river may perhaps perplex the reader  it is easily explained  hans had invited all or any of the brook family to visit his fathers farm on the karroo  gertie catching a cold or in some other way becoming feeble wanted a change of air  her father recalling the invitation and happening to know that hans was in grahamstown at the time drove her over with mrs scholtz and junkie to make the thing proper and offered a visit of all three  you may be sure hans did not refuse to take them to his home in his new cart after spending some time there mrs scholtz took a fancy that she would like to go with hans on one of his frequent excursions to glen lynden but she would not leave junkie behind  hans objected to junkie at first but finally gave in and thus the little hero found his way to the river of baboons  when dressedwhich was soon done as he omitted washingjunkie began to consider what he had best do  mischief of course but of what sort that was the question  his room was on the ground floor and had a lattice window which opened like a door into the back premises  he pushed the window and found that it opened  what a chance  mrs scholtz was still asleep and snoring absence without leave was his chief delight  in two minutes he was deep in the jungle panting  knowing from long and bitter experience that he would be pursued by the inveterate mrs scholtz the urchin ran up the kloof bent on placing the greatest possible space between him and his natural enemy in the shortest possible time  in this way he was not long of drawing near to the leopards point of observation  no doubt that keensighted animal would quickly have observed the child if its attention had not at the moment been attracted by other and equally mischievous game  a troop of baboons came down the kloof to pilfer the white mans fruit and vegetables  they had evidently risen late for breakfast and were in a hurry to reach their breakfast parlour before the white man should awake  there were a dozen or so of females several huge males and quite a crowd of children of various ages besides one or two infants clinging to their mothers waists  it was pitiful to see the sad anxious faces of these infants  perhaps they knew their parents errand and disapproved of it  more probably they felt their own weakness of frame and dreaded the shocks sustained when their heedless mothers bounded from rock or stump like balls of indiarubber  they were extremely careless mothers  even junkie as he stood paralysed with terror and surprise could not avoid seeing that the troop was led by a great bluefaced oldman baboon with a remarkably saturnine expression  on reaching the top of the rock which the leopard had just vacated the old man called a halt  the others came tumbling awkwardly towards him on allfours with the exception of several of the youngsters who loitered behind to play  one of these a very small bad little boybaboon deliberately turned aside to explore on his own account  he came down near to the foot of the rock where the leopard had concealed himself  catching sight of his glaring enemy the bad boy uttered a terrified squawk  instantly all the males headed by the old man rushed to the rescue  powerful though he was the leopard was cowardly at heart  a large troop of baboons had some time ago made mincemeat of his own grandmother  remembering this he sloped under a bank glided round a corner of the cliff bounded over a bush and sought refuge in a thicket  it was at this moment while in the act of bounding that he caught sight of junkie but being confused at the moment and ashamed of having been twice foiled he slunk away with his tail between his legs and concealed himself among the branches of an old gnarled and favourite tree  the bad boybaboon was the only one who had seen the leopard the old males therefore had to content themselves with a few fierce looks round in all directions and several defiant roars  born and bred in the midst of alarms however they were soon composed enough to resume their descent on the white mans storesto the great relief of the petrified junkie of whom in their alarm they took no notice regarding him possibly as a badly executed statue of a baboon  junkie quickly recovered himself and seeing the baboons descend the kloof thought it safer as well as more in accord with his original plans to ascend  gladly hopefully did the leopard observe his decision and watch his progress  to him the tide of fortune seemed to have taken a favourable turn for junkie in the innocence of his heart made straight for the gnarled tree  but one of the many slips so often quoted with reference to cups and lips was at this time impending over the unfortunate leopard  there was yet one other early riser that morningnamely booby the bushman  in pursuance of his calling that illused and misguided son of the soil arose about daybreak with much of his native soil sticking to his person and with a few other desperadoes like himself made a descent on glen lyndennot by any means the first that his fraternity had made  not so bloodthirsty as the leopard quite as mischievous as junkie and much more cunning than the baboons booby chanced to arrive at the gorge already mentioned just at the time when junkie was approaching it  there was if you will somewhat of a coincidence here in regard to time but there was no coincidence in the fact of such characters selecting the same route because whoever passed up or down that kloof must needs go by the gorge  slowly junkie picked his way up the ragged path towards the gnarled tree  the leopard scarcely believing in his good luck licked his lips  rapidly the bushman and his men descended the same path  they rode on horsesstolen horses of course  the leopard heard the clatter of hoofs and looked back  junkie drew nearer to the gnarled tree the leopard looked forward  never was savage beast more thoroughly perplexed  anxiety glared in his eyes exasperation grinned in his teeth indecision quivered in the muscles of his tail  just at that moment booby caught sight of his spotted skin  had the leopard been less perturbed he would have been too wise to allow his carcass to appear  a poisoned arrow instantly quivered in his flank  it acted like a spur with an angry growl and a clear bound of no one knows how many feet he reentered the jungle and fled to the mountains  petrified again junkie remained motionless till the bushmen robbers rode up  booby knew that his leopard was safe for a poisoned arrow is sure to kill in time so he did not care to hasten after it just then but preferred to continue his approach to the white mans habitations great then was his amazement when he all but rode over junkie  amazement was quickly succeeded by alarm  his knowledge of the white mans ways and habits told him at once the state of affairs  the appearance of junkie in the company of tigers and baboons was he knew well a mere juvenile indiscretion  he also knew that parental instincts among white men were keen and thence concluded that discovery and pursuit would be immediate  his own plans were therefore not only defeated but his own safety much endangered as his presence was sure to be discovered by his tracks  lets be off instanter was the substance of boobys communication to his brethren  the brethren agreed but booby had lived among white men and although his own particular master was a scoundrel there were those of his household especially among the femaleswho had taught him something of christian pity  he could not leave the child to the tender mercies of wild beasts  he did not dare to convey him back to the cottage of kenneth mctavish  what was he to do  delay might be death  in these circumstances he seized the horrified junkie by the arm swung him on the pommel of his saddle and galloped away up the kloof and over the mountains into the deepest recesses of kafirland  when mrs scholtz awoke that morning rubbed her eyes looked up and discovered that junkies crib was empty she sprang from her bed perceived the open lattice and gave vent to an awful scream  in barbarous times and regions a shriek is never uttered in vain  the mctavish household was instantly in the room some of them in deshabillesome armedall alarmed  oh myoh me cried mrs scholtz leaping back into bed with unfeminine haste hes gone  whos gone asked mctavish  junkie  what where when how why said mrs mctavish jessie and others  mrs scholtz gasped and pointed to the lattice at the same time she grasped her garments as a broad hint to the men  they took it hastily  come boys search about and one of you saddle up  go call groot willem was the masters prompt order as he turned and left the room  six hottentots a bushman and a bechuana boy obeyed but those who searched sought in vain  yet not altogether in vainthey found junkies spoor and traced it into the jungle  while two followed it the others returned and saddled up the horses  groot willem chanced to be on a visit to the highlanders at the time  what a pity he said coming out of his room and stretching himself it was quite an impressive sight to see such a giant stretch himself that the hunters are off  they might have helped us  the giant spoke with goodhumoured sarcasm believing that the urchin would assuredly be found somewhere about the premises and he referred to the departure of an exploring and hunting party under george rennie which had left glen lynden the previous day for the interior  but when groot willem with his companions had ridden a considerable way up the kloof and found junkies spoor mingling with that of baboons he became earnest  when he came to the gnarled tree and discovered that it was joined by that of horses and cape tigers he became alarmed  a diligent examination was made  drops of blood were found on the ground  the leopard itself was ultimately discovered stone dead in a thicket with the poisoned arrow in its side the horsespoor was followed up a long way and then it was pretty clearly seen that the child had been carried off by marauders of some sort  of course a thorough search was made and pursuit was immediately instituted  groot willem and mctavish pushed on promptly to follow the spoor while men were sent back to the glen for a supply of ammunition etcetera in case of a prolonged search becoming necessary  the search was ably planned and vigorously carried out but all in vain junkie had departed that life as thoroughly as if he had never been and mrs scholtz remained at glen lynden the very personification of despair  we shall now turn to the exploring party which had left the baviaans river on the previous day  about this time the rumours of war among the natives of the vast and almost unknown interior of the land had become unusually alarming  a wandering and warlike horde named the fetcani had been for some time past driving all the other tribes before them and were said at last to be approaching the winterberg frontier of the colony  in order to ascertain what foundation there was for these reports as well as to explore the land the party under rennie was sent out  among those who formed this party were charlie considine hans marais sandy black and his satellite jerry goldboy andrew rivers diederik and christian muller and the tall blackbearded hunter lucas van dyk besides slinger dikkop and other hottentots and bushmen  this is what i call real enjoyment said considine as he rode with hans somewhat in advance of the cavalcadesplendid weather magnificent scenery lots of game big and little good health and freedom  what more could a man wish  ja said hans quietly you have reason to be thankfulyet there is more to wish for  what more asked considine  that the whole world were as happy as yourself said hans looking full at his friend with a bland smile  and so i do wish that returned considine with enthusiasm  do you asked hans with a look of surprise  of course i do why do you doubt it asked his friend with a perplexed look  hans did not reply but continued to gaze at the mountainrange towards which the party was riding  and truly it was a prospect which might well absorb the attention and admiration of men less capable of being affected by the beauties of nature than hans marais  they were passing through a verdant glen at the foot of the mountains the air of which was perfumed with wild flowers and filled with the garrulous music of paroquets and monkeys  in front lay the grand range of the winterberg with its coronet of rocks its frowning steeps its grassy slopes and its skirts feathered over with straggling forest all bathed in the rich warm glow of an african sunset  you have not answered me hans said considine after a pause  why do you think i am indifferent to the worlds happiness  because replied the other with an expression unusually serious on his countenance i do not see that you make any effortbeyond being goodnatured and amiable which you cannot helpto make the world better  considine looked at his friend with surprise and replied with a laughwhy hans you are displaying a new phase of character  your remark is undoubtedly trueso true indeed that although i object to that commonplace retortyoure anotheri cannot help pointing out that it applies equally to yourself  it is just because it applies equably to myself that i make it rejoined hans with unaltered gravity  you and i profess to be christians we both think that we are guided by christian principles and doubtless to some extent we are but what have we done for the cause that we call good that is good  i speak for myself at all eventsi have hitherto done nothing absolutely nothing  my dear fellow said considine with a sudden burst of candour i believe you are right and i plead guilty but then what can we do  we are not clergymen  stephen orpin is not a clergyman yet see what he does  it was seeing what that man does and how he lives that first set me athinking on this subject  he attends to his ordinary calling quite as well as any man of my acquaintance and ill be bound makes a good thing of it but any man with half an eye can see that he makes it subservient to the great work of serving the saviour whom you and i profess to love  i have seen him suffer loss rather than work on the lords day  more than once ive seen him gain discredit for his socalled fanaticism  he is an earnest man eagerly seeking an end which is outside himself therefore he is a happy man  to be eager in pursuit is to be in a great degree happy even when the pursuit is a trifling one if it be a great and good one the result must be greater happiness if the pursuit has reference to things beyond this life and ultimate success is hoped for in the next it seems to me that lasting as well as highest happiness may thus be attained  love of self charlie is not a bad motive as some folk would falsely teach us the almighty put love of self within us  it is only when love of self is a superlative affection that it is sinful because idolatrous  when it is said that love is the fulfilling of the law it is not love to god merely that is meant i think but love to him supremely and to all created things as well self included because if you can conceive of this passion being our motive power and fairly balanced in our breastsgod and all created beings and things occupying their right relative positionsself although dethroned would not be ignored depend on it charlie there is something wrong here  the young dutchman smote himself heavily on his broad chest and looked at his friend for a reply  what that reply was we need not pause to say  these two young men ever since their first acquaintance had regarded each other with feelings akin to those of david and jonathan but they had not up to this time opened to each other those inner chambers of the soul where the secret springs of life keep working continually in the dark whether we regard them or notworking oftentimes harshly for want of the oil of human intercourse and sympathy  the floodgates were now opened and the two friends began to discourse on things pertaining to the soul and the saviour and the world to come whereby they found that their appreciation and enjoyment of the good things even of this life was increased considerably  subsequently they discovered the explanation of this increased power of enjoyment in that word which throws light on all things where it is written that godliness is profitable for the life that now is as well as that which is to come    chapter twenty  treats of the delights dangers and distresses of the wilderness  afar in the desertfar beyond the frontier settlements of the colony far from the influences of civilisation in the home of the wild beast and the savage the explorers now ride under the blaze of the noontide sun  they had passed over mountain and dale into the burning plains of the karroo and for many hours had travelled without water or shelter from the scorching heat  lucas van dyk who guided them said he knew where water was to be got but there was no possibility of reaching it before evening  this announcement was received in silence for not a drop of the lifegiving fluid had passed the lips of man or beast since an early hour on the previous day and their powers of endurance were being tried severely  the insupportable heat not only increased the thirst but rendered the hunters less able to bear it  all round them the air quivered with the radiation from the glaring sand and occasionally the mirage appeared with its delicious prospects of relief but as the dutchmen knew the ground well none were deceived by it though all were tantalised  compressing their lips and urging their wearied cattle to the utmost they pushed steadily on no sound breaking the stillness of the desert save the creak of a waggonwheel or the groan of an exhausted animal  at last charlie considine sought to relieve his feelings by conversation  this is one of the unpleasant experiences of african travel  hans marais to whom the remark was made replied ja but as he added nothing more and looked stern charlie relapsed into silence  ere long one of the weaker oxen fell  the party halted a few minutes while the hottentot drivers plied their cruel whips unmercifully but in vain  one more merciful than the drivers was theredeath came to release the poor animal  immediately as if by magic vultures appeared in the burning sky  from the faroff horizon they came sailing by twos and threes as if some invisible messenger like death himself had gone with lightningspeed to tell that a banquet awaited them  no time was wasted a brief word from the leader sufficed  the dying ox was released from the yoke that had galled it so long and the party proceeded  before they were a mile off the ox was dead its eyes were out its carcass torn open and the obscene birds were gorging themselves  before night it was an empty skeleton covered with a dried hide  not many hours would suffice to remove the hide and leave only the bleaching bones  such remains are familiar objects on south african roadsides  that evening according to their leaders prophecy water was reached it was a thick muddy pool but it sufficed to relieve them all and a night of comparative comfort followed a day of suffering  next morning just after breakfast a herd of springboks was observed and several of the more eager of the party dashed off in pursuit  among these was considine hans andrew rivers and jerry goldboy  the two last were always first in the mad pursuit of game and caused their placid dutch friends no little anxiety by the scrapes they frequently ran themselves into  follow them theyll get lost said van dyk to a group of hottentots  two of these slinger and dikkop obeyed the order  the antelopes were on a distant sandhill in the plain  there were two groups of them  riven and jerry made for one of these  becoming suddenly imbued with an idea worthy of a hunter jerry diverged to the right intending to allow his companion to start the game while he should lie in wait for it under the shelter of a bush  unfortunately the game took the opposite direction when started so that jerry was thrown entirely out  as it chanced however this did not matter much for jerrys horse becoming unmanageable took to its heels and dashed away wildly over the plain followed by dikkop the hottentot  mind the antbear holes shouted dikkop but as he shouted in dutch jerry did not understand him and devoted himself to vain endeavours to restrain the horse  at first the animal looked after itself and avoided the holes referred to but as jerry kept tugging furiously at the reins it became reckless and finally put a foreleg into a hole  instantly it rolled over and the hunter flew off its back turning a complete somersault in the air  a low shrub grows in the karroo called the illtempered thorn  it resembles a mass of miniature porcupine quills an inch or two in length planted as thickly as possible together with the needlepoints up and bristling  on one of these shrubs poor jerry alighted  oh eavens this is hagony he groaned jumping up and stamping while dikkop almost fell off his horse with laughing  to hide his mirth he bolted off in pursuit of jerrys charger which he soon caught and brought back looking supernaturally grave  we will rejoin the unters dikkop said jerry in the tone of a man who endeavours to conceal his sufferings  ja mynheer said dikkop  whatever jerry goldboy might have said that hottentot would have replied ja mynheer for he understood not a word of english  jerry mounted with an illsuppressed groan and rode back to the party leaning very much forward in the saddle while dikkop followed showing the white teeth in his dirty black visage from ear to ear  rivers soon afterwards returned with a springbok behind him but there was no appearance of considine or hans  as however the latter was known to be an experienced traveller no anxiety was felt for them and the main party proceeded on its way  when night came they found that a well on which they had counted was dried up and were therefore obliged to lie down without water  several shots were fired after dark to guide the absent ones but no reply was made  still those in camp felt no anxiety knowing that hans was quite able to take care of himself  and so he was truly but he could not take care of a hotheaded youth who was as eager as jerry in the chase and much more daring  at first he and considine ran together after the springboks then hans got near enough dismounted and shot one  while he was busy fastening the carcass on his horse considine continued to pursue the others going at full speed he was soon far away on the horizon  still hans would have been able to see him if he had not got among some scattered groups of mimosabushes which were sufficiently large to conceal him when he remounted and looked around his friend was not to be seen  he saw a few springboks however racing on the horizon in the direction in which considine had galloped and concluded somewhat hastily that they were pursued by his friend  away he went therefore but soon discovered that he was mistaken  he turned then and rode quickly back blaming himself for not having followed the footprints of his friends horse  this he now did and at last came up with him but at so late an hour and at such a distance from the line of march that a bivouac in the plain was inevitable  oh hans he said im so glad youve found me  i had no idea that one could get so easily lost in an open plain  youve had enough experience too one would think to have remembered the vastness of the karroo said hans dismounting and making the fastenings of the springbok more secure a man soon dwindles to the size of a crow in plains like this when you gallop away from him  men not accustomed to them misjudge distances and sizes in a wonderful way i remember once being out hunting with a fellow who mistook a waggon for a springbokbut come mount we must ride on to a better campingplace than this and be content to sleep without blankets tonight  i hope the campingplace is not far off for im parched with thirst said considine mounting and following at a smart gallop  im sorry for you returned hans for youll see no water this night tomorrow well start early and get to the waggons by breakfasttime  this was depressing news to considine for the heat of the day and exertions of the chase had as he expressed it almost dried him up there was nothing for it however but patience  about sunset they came to a place where were some old deserted huts  in one of these they resolved to pass the night though from certain holes in the side it was evidently used at times as an abode by beasts of prey  having flint and steel they made a fire and while thus engaged were serenaded by the distant and dolorous howls of a hyena and the inharmonious jabberings of a jackal  pleasant company observed considine as he roasted a steak over the fire  ja replied hans who being a more expert cook was already busy with a rib  the melancholy hoot of an owl seemed to indicate that the animal kingdom agreed with the sentiment and the young men laughed  they were not however disposed to talk much  after a silent supper they lay down and slept soundly quite oblivious of the prowlers of the night who came more than once near to the door of the hut  it was late next day when they awoke  hans likewise missed his way and though he afterwards discovered his mistake they found it impossible to regain the track of their companions before sunset  all that day they were compelled to travel without tasting a drop of water and their poor horses became so fatigued as to be scarcely equal to more than a walking pace  as hans knew that water was not far off he pushed on after sunset so as to have the shorter distance to travel to it in the morning  it is very tantalising he said drawing rein when the darkness of the night rendered travelling almost impossible to know that our friends cannot be far off and yet be unable to reach them  hadnt we better fire a shot asked considine  not of much use i fear but there can be no harm in trying  the shot was fired and was instantly replied to by a tremendous roar from a lion apparently close to where they stood  no wood was near them to make a fire nothing but tufts of grass they therefore pushed on towards a range of dark mountains as fast as their jaded steeds would go  halt a moment said hans in a low voice  they stopped and listened  the approach of the lion in rear was distinctly heard  we cannot escape from him charlie said hans as they again urged their horses onward and in the dark we cannot take aim at him  our only chance is to reach yonder pass or glen that looms like a black cleft in the hills and clamber up some precipice whence we can pelt him with stones  he spoke in quick earnest tones  they soon entered the gorge and were greeted by the grunt of a baboon and the squalling of its young ones which helped to increase the savage aspect of the towering cliffs on either side  they had not proceeded far when the lion gave another tremendous roar which echoing from cliff to cliff gave the luckless hunters the feeling of having got into the very heart of a lions den no suitable place to scramble up being found they pushed madly on over a track of sand and bushes expecting every instant to see the monster bound upon them  but the defile was shorter than hans had supposed  on issuing from it they were cheered by the moon rising bright in the east and found that their enemy had ceased to follow them at that point still though weary and with their tongues cleaving to the roofs of their mouths they continued their march for several hours and lying down at last they scarcely knew how or there they went to sleep with a prayer for protection and deliverance on their parched lips  the weary wanderers passed that night in a very paradise bathing in cool streams and slaking their thirst nearly but never quite to the full  there was always a peculiar desire to drink again and even then to wish for more  heavenly music too sounded in their ears and the sweet shade of green trees sheltered them  it was daybreak when they were roused from these delights by a hyenas howl and awoke to find that they were speechless with thirst their eyes inflamed and their whole frames burning  saddling the horses at once they rode forward and in a couple of hours reached a hill near the top of which there was a projecting rock  dont let me raise your hopes too high said hans pointing to the rock but it is just possible that we may find water there  god grant it said considine  your horse is fresher than mine said hans and you are lighter than i amgo first  if there is water hail meif not i will wait your return  with a nod of assent the youth pushed forward gained the rock and found the place where water had once been a dry hole  for a few minutes he stood gazing languidly on the plain beyond the ridge  despair had almost taken possession of his breast when his eye suddenly brightened  he observed objects moving far away on the plain with bated breath he stooped and shaded his eyes with his hand  yes there could be no doubt about ita party of horsemen and bullockwaggons  he tried to cheer but his dry throat refused to act turning quickly he began to descend the hillside and chanced to cough as he went along  instantly he was surrounded by almost a hundred baboons some of gigantic size which came fearlessly towards him  they grunted grinned and sprang from stone to stone protruding their mouths and drawing back the skin of their foreheads threatening an instant attack  considines gun was loaded but he had lived long enough in those regions to be fully aware of the danger of wounding one of these creatures in such circumstances  had he done so he would probably have been torn to pieces in five minutes  he therefore kept them off with the muzzle of his gun as he continued the descent  some of them came so near as to touch his hat while passing projecting rocks at last he reached the plain where the baboons stopped and appeared to hold a noisy council as to whether they should make a great assault or not  he turned and levelled his gun  come thought he at that moment dont do it charlie  you have escaped  be thankful and leave the poor brutes alone  obeying the orders of his conscience he reshouldered his gun and returned to his friend whom he found reclining under a low bush and informed him of what he had seen  the young dutchman jumped up at once and mounting rode round a spur of the hill and out upon the plain  in an hour they had overtaken their comrades but great was their dismay on finding that they had long ago consumed every drop of water and that they were suffering from thirst quite as much as themselves  never mind said lucas van dyk let me comfort you with the assurance that we shall certainly reach water in a few hours  the hunter was right  some hours before sunset the oxen and horses quickened their pace of their own accordsure sign that they had scented water from afar  shortly after they came in sight of a stream the excitement of all increased as they pushed forward  they broke into a wild run on nearing the stream and then followed a scene which is almost indescribable  the oxen were cast loose the riders leaped to the ground and the whole party men oxen and horses ran in a promiscuous heap into the water  wow man jerry hae a care eell be squizzen atween the beasts said sandy black as the active jerry passed him in the race  the scots warning was not without reason for next moment jerry was up to the knees in the stream between two oxen who closing on each other almost burst him  easing off they let him drop on hands and knees and he remained in that position drinking thankfully  the whole place was quickly stirred up into a muddy compound like peasoup but neither man nor beast was particular  they struggled forward and fell on their kneesnot inappropriatelyto drink  one man was pushed down by an ox but seemed pleased with the refreshing coolness of his position and remained where he was drinking  another in his haste tumbled over the edge of the bank and rolled down preceded by an impatient horse which had tripped over him  both gathered themselves up somehow with their lips in the waterand drank  young rivers happening to gain the stream at a point where oxen and horses were wedged together tightly tried to force in between them but failing in this he stooped to crawl in below them  at that moment slinger the tottie gave a yell in dutch and said that a horse was trampling on him whom dikkop consoled by saying that he was fast in the mudand so he was but not too fast to prevent drinking  meanwhile the dutchmen and the knowing ones of the party restrained themselves and sought for better positions where the water was clearer  there they likewise bent their tall heads and suggestedthough they did not singthe couplet    oh that a dutchmans draught might be   as deep as the rooolling zuyderzee  the limit of drinking was capacity  each man and beast drank as much as he or it could hold and then unwillingly left the stream covered with mud and dripping wet  oh it was a delicious refreshment which some thought fully repaid them for the toil and suffering they had previously undergone  the aspect of the whole band may be described in the language of sandy black who beholding his friends after the fray remarked that they were all dirty and drookit    chapter twenty one  treats of matters too numerous and stirring to be briefly referred to  soon after this the explorers passed beyond the level country and their sufferings were for the time relieved  the region through which they then passed was variedhilly wooded and beautiful and to crown all water was plentiful  large game was also abundant and one day the footprints of elephants were discovered  to some of the party that day was one of deepest interest and excitement  charlie considine who was as we have said an adept with the pencil longed to sit down and sketch the lordly elephant in his native haunts andrew rivers and jerry goldboy wanted to shoot him so did george rennie and the mullers and lucas van dyk  more moderate souls like sandy black said they would be satisfied merely to see him while slinger and dikkop with their brethren declared that they wanted to eat him  at last they came in sight of him  it was a little after midday  they were traversing at the time a jungle so dense that it would have been impassable but for a kafirpath which had been kept open by wild animals  the hunters had already seen herds of quaggas and buffaloes and some of the larger sorts of antelopes also one rhinoceros but not yet elephants  now to their joy the giant tracks of these monsters were discovered  near the river in swampy places it was evident that some of them had been rolling luxuriously in the ooze and mud  but it was in the forests and jungles that they had left the most striking marks of their habits and mighty power for there thorny brakes of the most impenetrable character had been trodden flat by them and trees had been overturned  in traversing such places the great bullelephant always marches in the van bursting through everything by sheer force and weight breaking off huge limbs of the larger trees with his proboscis when these obstruct his path and overturning the smaller ones bodily while the females and younger members of the family follow in his wake  a little further on they came to a piece of open ground where the elephants had torn up a number of mimosatrees and inverted them so that they might the more easily browse on the juicy roots  it was evident from appearances that the animals had used their tusks as crowbars inserting them under the roots to loosen their hold of the earth and it was equally clear that like other and higher creatures they sometimes attempted what was beyond their strength for some of the larger trees had resisted their utmost efforts  as these signs multiplied the hunters proceeded with increased vigilance and caution each exhibiting the peculiarity of his character more or less by his look and actions  the mullers van dyk rennie hans and other experienced men rode along calmly watchful yet not so much absorbed as to prevent a humorous glance and a smile at the conduct of their less experienced comrades  considine and rivers showed that their spirits were deeply stirred by the flash of their everroving eyes the tight compression of their lips the flush on their brows and the position of readiness in which they carried their gunselephantguns by the way lent them by their dutch friends for the occasion  sandy black rode with a cool sober sedate air looking interested and attentive but with that peculiar twinkle of the eyes and slightly sarcastic droop at the corners of the mouth which is often characteristic of the sceptical scotsman  on the other hand jerry goldboy went along blazing with excitement while every now and then he uttered a suppressed exclamation and clapped the blunderbuss to his shoulder when anything moved or seemed to move in the jungle  jerry had flatly refused to exchange his artillery for any other weapon and having learned that small shot was useless against elephants he had charged it with five or six large pebblessuch as david might have used in the slaying of goliath  mixed with these was a sprinkling of large nails and one or two odd buttons  he was a source of constant and justifiable alarm to his friends who usually compelled him either to ride in front with the blunderbuss pointing forward or in the rear with its muzzle pointing backward  there go your friends at last jerry said van dyk curling his black moustache with a smile as the party emerged from a woody defile into a wide valley  what where eh in which direction point em out quick cried jerry cocking the blunderbuss violently and wheeling his steed round with such force that his haunch hit sandy blacks leg pretty severely  hoot ye loupin eedyit growled the scot somewhat nettled  jerry subdued himself with a violent effort while the experienced hunters pointed out the elephants and consulted as to the best plan of procedure  there were fifty at least of the magnificent animals scattered in groups over the bottom and sides of a valley about three miles in extent some were browsing on the succulent spekboom of which they are very fond others were digging up and feeding among the young mimosathorns and evergreens  the place where the hunters stood was not suitable for an attack  it was therefore resolved to move round to a better position as they advanced some of the groups of elephants came more distinctly into view but they seemed either not to observe or to disregard the intruders  why not go at em at once asked young rivers in an impatient whisper  because we dont want to be killed was the laconic reply from diederik muller  dont you see explained van dyk with one of his quiet smiles that the ground where the nearest fellows stand is not suitable for horsemen  well i dont see exactly but ill take your word for it  while they were speaking and riding through a meadow thickly studded over with clumps of tall evergreens considine observed something moving over the top of a bush close ahead of him  look out there he exclaimed but those in advance had already turned the corner of a bush and found themselves within a hundred paces of a huge male elephant  jerry at once pointed the blunderbuss and shut his eyes and would infallibly have pulled the trigger if sandy black who had in some measure become his keeper had not seized his wrist and wrenched the weapon from his grasp  man yell be the death o somebody yet he said in a low stern tone  jerry at once became penitent and on giving a solemn promise that he would not fire till he obtained permission received his weapon back  een groot gruwzaam karl whispered one of the hottentots in broken dutch  my certie but he is a great gruesome carl said black echoing in scotch the dutchmans expression as he gazed in admiration  hes fourteen feet high if hes an inch observed george rennie  the scent and hearing of the elephant are both keen but his sight is not very good  as the wind chanced to blow from him to the hunters he had not perceived them  this was fortunate for it would have been highly dangerous to have attacked him in such ground  they wheeled round therefore and galloped away towards some scattered rocks whence they could better approach him on foot  dismounting the leaders formed a hasty plan of operations and immediately proceeded to put it in execution  it may have been that their explanation of the plan was not lucid or that jerry goldboys head was not clear but certain it is that after having been carefully told what to do he dashed into the jungle after sandy black and did what seemed right in his own eyes  black kept close to the heels of hans marais and so did considine but jerry soon began to pant with excitement then he stumbled and fell before recovering himself from a waitabit thorn he had been left out of sight behind  he pushed valiantly on however and came to a small open plain where he looked anxiously round but his comrades were nowhere to be seen  just then a shot was fired it was followed quickly by another and then was heard above the shouting of excited hottentots the shrill screaming of wounded and enraged elephants jerry heard the tremendous sounds for the first time and quaked in his spinal marrow  observing the smoke of a shot on the opposite side of the little plain he proceeded to cross over hastily but had barely gained the middle of the open space when the shrill screams were repeated with redoubled fury  at the same time jerry heard cries of warning coupled with his own name  he looked right and left in alarm not knowing where the threatened danger was likely to come from  he was not kept long in suspense  behind him he heard the crackling and crashing of branches caused by elephants bursting through the wood  then a large female with three young but by no means small ones issued from the edge of the jungle and made straight at the unfortunate man  jerry turned and ran but he had no chance the elephants gained on him so fast that he felt with an awful sickening of the heart it was not possible to reach the rocky ground beyond the meadow where he might have been safe  with the courage of despair he faced about and fired straight in the face of the old female which ran him down with a shriek of indignation  she had only one tusk but with that she made a prod at jerry that would have quickly ended his days if it had not missed the mark and gone deep into the ground  she then caught him by the middle with her trunk threw him between her forefeet and attempted to tread him to death  this she certainly would have accomplished but that jerry was remarkably agile and very small the ground being soft and muddy was also in his favour once she set her foot on his chest and he felt the bones bending  of course had the creatures full weight pressed it jerry would have been cracked like a walnut but the monsters foot was rounded and wet and the poor man making a desperate wrench it slipped into the mud then she trod on his arm and squeezed it into the ground without snapping the bone  thus stamping and wriggling for a few seconds the two fought on for vengeance and for life while george rennie hans and the two mullers ran to the rescue and fired a volley  this caused the animal to wince and look up  jerry taking advantage of the pause jumped up and dived out from below her between her hindlegsalighting on his head and turning a complete somersault  he regained his feet just as she turned round again to seize him  at that critical moment lucas van dyk put a ball in her head and considine sent another into the root of her trunk which induced her to turn and join her screaming offspring in the bushes  the hunters pursued while jerry covered with mud and bruises and scarcely able to run made off in the opposite direction  he had scarcely reached the shelter of some broken ground when the enormous male elephant which had been previously encountered came running past either to the rescue of its mate or flying in alarm at the firing  it caught one of the hottentots who had loitered in rear of the attacking party carried him some distance in its trunk and then throwing him on the ground brought its four feet together and trod and stamped on him for a considerable time  the unfortunate man was killed instantly  it left the corpse for a little and then returned to it as if to make quite sure of its deadly work and kneeling down crushed and kneaded the body with its forelegs  then seizing it again with its trunk it carried it off and threw it into the jungle  this delay on the elephants part gave the hunters time to return from the destruction of the female and with several successful shots to kill the male  tis a heavy price to pay for our sport said considine sadly as he stood with his companions gazing on the body of the hottentot which was trodden into a shapeless mass  hunters dont go out for mere sport said lucas van dyk they do it in the way of businessfor ivory and hides  of course they must take the chances of a risky trade  this sad incident naturally cast a gloom over the party and they remained there only long enough to cut out the tusks of the male elephant and stow them away with choice parts of the meat in their waggon  after quitting the valley they fell in with the party under john skyd and frank dobson and led by stephen orpin  they were much surprised to find with these their friends kenneth mctavish and groot willem who soon accounted for their unexpected appearance  they had been steadily tracing the spoor of poor junkie had lost and refound it several times and during their pursuit had crossed the waggontracks of skyd and his party whom they followed up in the faint hope that they might have heard or seen something to guide them in their search  in this they were disappointed  after a brief council of war it was resolved to join their forces and continue the search after junkie  proceeding on their way they fell in with a wounded kafir  he lay dying under a bush and made no attempt to escape although he evidently regarded the white men as enemies  having been reassured on this point and comforted with a piece of tobacco he told them that his village had been attacked by the fetcani and completely destroyed with all the women and childrenonly a few of the wounded warriors like himself having escaped to perish in the jungle  the fetcani he described as the most ferocious warriors ever seen  they did not use the ordinary assagai or throwing spear but a short stabbing one and invariably closed at once with their foes with irresistible impetuosity  on being questioned about prisoners and reference being made to white mens children he said that he had heard of a white boy who was brought to a village a days march or more from where they then were but added that the fetcani hordes had gone off to destroy that village just after destroying his own and that he had no doubt it was by that time reduced to ashes and all its inhabitants slain  on hearing this and learning the direction of the village in question the hunters went off at full gallop leaving the waggons to follow their spoor  it was nearly sunset when they came to an eminence beyond which lay the kafir town of which they were in search  the first glance showed that something unusual was going on in itat the same time it relieved their fears to observe that it was not yet destroyed  the mud hovels like huge beehives in which the kafirs dwelt were not yet burnt and the only smoke visible was that which rose from cooking fires  but it was quite plain that the people who in the distance seemed to swarm in and about the place like black ants were in wild excitement  no doubt theyve heard that the fetcani are coming said groot willem riding to the highest point of the ridge on which they stood  the place seems pretty strong  i think we might do worse than go lend the niggers a helping hand till weve made inquiries about the lad  lucas van dyk echoed this sentiment and so did stephen orpin but there were others who thought it best to let the niggers fight their own battles  well friends said kenneth mctavish you may hold what opinion you like on that point but my business just now is to go into that town and see if i can find junkie brook  the sooner i do so the better so let those who choose follow me  he rode off at a brisk trot and was followed by the whole party  on reaching the town they halted and the principal chief eno came out to meet them  one of the hottentots being called to interpret the hunters were informed that the fetcani had threatened to attack the town and that the inhabitants were busy putting themselves in a state of defence they were glad said the chief to see the white men and hoped they would stay to assist him  to this stephen orpin replied through the interpreter  stephen somehow fell naturally into the position of spokesman and chief of the party in positions where tact and eloquence or diplomacy were wanted though in the huntingfield he held a very subordinate place  he told eno that the white men had come to seek for a white boy who had been stolen from one of the frontier settlements and that he had heard the boy was in his enos town  that he was glad to hear it though of course he did not suppose eno had stolen the boy seeing that none of his people had been yet near the colony  that he and his friends now came to claim the boy and would be glad to aid them in defending the town if attacked while they were in it  in reply the chief said he knew nothing about a white boy being in his town but would make inquires  while this conference was going on a man was seen to approach running at full speed  he fell from exhaustion on arriving and for some moments could not speak  recovering he told that he had just escaped from a band of two hundred fetcani warriors who were even then on their way to attack the town  instantly all was uproar and confusion  the warriors seizing their shields and spears sallied forth under their chief to meet the enemya few of the youngest being left behind to guard the women and children a party of the hottentots under kenneth mctavish also remained to guard the town while the rest set off to aid the kafirs  they were compelled however to ride back a short distance to meet the waggons and obtain a supply of ammunition  thus a little time was lost and before they could reach the scene of action the kafirs had met with the fetcani warriors been thoroughly beaten and put to flight  on the appearance however of the horsemen the pursuers halted  now lads cried groot willem a steady volley and a charge home will send them to the right about  better fire over their heads said orpin earnestly  we are not at war with these men  let us not kill if we can help it  i agree with that heartily cried charlie considine  so do i said hans  depend ont the sound will suffice for men who perhaps never saw firearms before  quite right maister marais said sandy black with grave approval an if oor charge is only heeded by groot willem an jerry goldboy tak my word fort thae fitcanny cratersll flee like chaff before the wund  very good said groot willem with a grincome along jerry  the dauntless little man answered the summons with delight and the whole party approached the wondering fetcani at a trot  halting when within about eighty yards they fired a volley from horseback over the heads of the enemy  then through the smoke they charged at full speed like thunderbolts groot willem roaring like a mad buffalobull jerry goldboy shrieking like a wounded elephant and energising fearfully with legs arms reins and blunderbuss while the others shouted or laughed in wild excitement  the fetcani as sandy black had prophesied could not stand it  turning their backs to the foe they fled as only panicstricken and naked niggers can fly and were soon scattered and lost in the jungle  while this was going on far out on the plain kenneth mctavish had much ado to keep the people quiet in the townso great was their dread of falling into the hands of the ferocious fetcani  but when the wounded warriors began to come in breathless gashed and bleeding with the report of their disaster he found it impossible to restrain the people the young warriors ignominiously left the place and fled while the women followed carrying their children and such of their worldly goods as they were loath to leave behind  for some time mctavish managed to restrain the latter but when at last the hunters came thundering back after their bloodless victory the poor women fancying they were the enemy flung down goods and even babies and ran  the horsemen called out to assure them they were friends but their terror was too great to permit of their comprehending and they continued to fly  come charlie we must head these poor creatures and drive them back said hans as he rode over ground which was strewn with utensils mantles and victuals among which many little black and naked children were seen running stumbling tottering or creeping according to age and courage  followed by the other horsemen they rode ahead of the flying multitude and cracking their whips menacingly in front with an occasional charge they succeeded in staying the flight and turning the poor women back  no sooner did these comprehend how matters stood than they turned and caught up their little ones with as much affection and thankfulness as if they had just shown a readiness to die for rather than forsake them  among these children was one who although as black as the ace of spades in body and face had light curly flaxen hair  he ran about in a wild unaccountable manner darting hither and thither from side to side  mctavish and the others who had by that time dismounted and were standing at their horses heads amused spectators of the scene looked at this urchin in surprise until they observed that he was endeavouring to escape from a stout young woman who did her best to catch him  she had nearly succeeded when he suddenly doubled like a hare and bore straight down on the horsemen  seeing this the woman gave in and turning fled to the town while the little fellow ran and clasped the highlander by the knees  oh  missr tavish he cried and looked up  ah whyits junkie cried the highlander catching the child up in his arms and hugging him by which means he left a dark imprint of him on his own breast and face  it was indeed junkienaked as on the day of his birth greased from head to foot and charcoaled as black as the king of ashantee  although an object of the deepest interest to the white men poor junkie was not at that moment personally attractive  he was however unspeakably happy at seeing white and familiar faces once more  he was also very much subdued and had obviously profited by the rude teaching he had undergone in kafirland for his obedience to orders was prompt and unquestioning  the first important matter was to clean junkie  this was only partially effected and with difficulty  the next was to clothe him  this was done on the spur of the moment with pockethandkerchiefs each hunter contributing one till the costume was complete  a large red cotton one formed a sort of plaid a blue one with a hole in the middle through which his head was thrust served as a pretty good poncho or tippet a green one with white spots tied round the loins did duty as a tunic or kilt and one of crimson silk round the head formed a gorgeous turban  returning to the village the hunters found eno the chief and after expressing much satisfaction at having arrived in time to lend him effectual aid at so critical a period they presented him with gifts of brass wire and cotton cloth from the stores in skyd and dobsons waggons  the chief expressed his gratitude in glowing terms and begged the hunters to stay with him for some time  but this they would not do as it was important to return to the colony and report what they had seen without delay  notwithstanding their professions of gratitude however these rascals stole as many small articles front the waggons as they could lay hands on and would doubtless have taken all that the hunters possessed if they had not been impressed by their valour and by the dreadful firearms which they carried  this accidental skirmish was the first meeting of the colonists with the fetcani  it was not till two years later that the government felt constrained to take active measures against these savages  the fetcani or mantatee hordes having been driven from their own country by the bloodthirsty zulu chief chaka had been preying upon other tribes for many years and at last in 1827 they precipitated themselves on the tambookies and afterwards on the galekas threatening to extirpate these kafirs altogether or to drive them into the colony as suppliants and beggars  in this extremity the kafir chief hintza urgently craved assistance  it was granted  a body of the colonists sent out by government under major dundas of the royal artillery defeated the warlike fetcani who were afterwards utterly routed and scattered and their dreaded power finally annihilated near the sources of the umtata river by a body of troops under colonel somerset  hintzas warriors were present at that affair to the number of about twenty thousand and they hovered about during the engagement admiringly though without rendering assistance but when the enemy were routed and in confused retreat they fell upon them and despite the remonstrances of the white men committed the most appalling atrocities mutilating the dead and cutting off the arms and legs of the living in order the more easily to obtain their brass rings and ornaments  this warlike episode did not however affect the general condition of the frontier  the settlers having overcome the misfortunes of the first years began to prosper and multiply troubled a good deal no doubt by the thievish propensities of their ungrateful black neighbours but on the whole enjoying the fruit of their labours in comparative peace for several years    chapter twenty two  tells of dark and threatening clouds and war  the exigencies of our somewhat acrobatic tale require at this point that we should make a considerable bound  we shall beg the obliging reader to leap with us into the year 1834  hans marais moustached bearded bronzed and in the prime of life sits at the door of a cottage recently built close to that of his father  beside him sits his wifeformerly miss gertrude brook and now as sweet and pretty a young woman as you would find in a months ride through a country where sweet pretty women were and still are very numerous in proportion to the population  whether it was that hans was timid or gertie shy we cannot tell but somehow it is only three months since they began their united career and hans considers himself to have married rather late in life gertie being now twentysix begins to think herself quite an old woman  it is evident however that this ancient couple wear well and are sufficiently happyif we may presume to judge from appearances  gertie said hans patting the fingers which handed him his big dutch pipe i fear that my father is determined to go  do you think so said gertie while a sad expression chased the sunshine from her face  yes he says he cannot stand the treatment we capedutchmen receive from the british government and that he means to give up his farm take his waggons and goods and treck away to the north with the friends who are already preparing to go in search of free lands in the wilderness where the union jack does not fly  i must be very stupid hans returned his wife with a deprecating smile for although ive heard your father discussing these matters a good deal of late i cannot quite understand them  of course i see well enough that those men who approve of slavery must feel very much aggrieved by the abolition but your father like yourself and many others is not one of thesewhat then does he complain of  of a great deal gertie replied hans with an amused glance at her perplexed face and not only in connection with slavery but other things  it would take hours of talk to tell you all  but cant you give me some sort of idea of these things in a few words  yes at least ill try said hans  i need scarcely tell you that there has been a sort of illwill in the capedutch mind against the british governmentmores the pityever since the colony passed into the possession of england owing partly to their not understanding each other partly to incompetent and tyrannical governors pursuing unwise policy partly to unprincipled or stupid men misrepresenting the truth in england and partly to the people of england being too ready to swallow whatever they are told  what is all the fault on the side of the english interrupted gertie with a laugh  hear me out wife returned hanspartly owing to foolish dutchmen rebelling against authority and taking the law into their own hands and partly to rascally dutchmen doing deeds worthy of execration evil deeds are saddled on wrong shoulders motives are misunderstood actions are exaggerated judges both here and in england are sometimes incompetent prejudice and ignorance prevent veils from being removed and six thousand miles of ocean to say nothing of six hundred miles of land intervene to complicate the confusion surrounding right or wrong  dear me what an incomprehensible state of things said gertie opening her blue eyes very wide  rather returned hans with a smile and yet there are sensible englishmen and sensible capedutchmen who are pretty well agreed as to the true merits of the questions that trouble us  there is the abolition of slavery for instance many on both sides are convinced as to the propriety of that but nearly all are agreed in condemning the way in which it is being gone about believing that the consequences to many of the slaveholders will be ruinous  but it is useless to go into such matters now gertie  right or wrong many of the dutch farmers are talking seriously of going out of the colony and my father i grieve to say is among the number  and you hans  i will remain on the old homesteadat least for a time  if things improve we may induce father to return if not i will follow him into the wilderness  and what of considine asked gertie  he remains to help me to manage the farm  there is no chance for him in the present exasperated state of my fathers mind  he unhappily extends his indignation against england to englishmen and vows that my sister bertha shall never wed charlie considine  is he likely to continue in that mind  i think so  then there is indeed no chance for poor charlie was the rejoinder for bertha marais will never marry in direct opposition to her fathers wishes  heigho  tis the old story about the course of true love  he may changehe will change his mind i think said hans but in the meantime he will go off into the wilderness carrying bertha along with him  i would have gone with him myself without hesitation had it not been that i cannot bear to think of tearing you away just yet from the old people and i may perhaps do some good here in the way of saving the old home  hans looked round with a somewhat mournful gaze at the home of his childhood which bore evidences of the preparations that were being made by conrad marais to leave it  that evening a large party of disaffected boers arrived at the homestead of conrad marais with waggons wives children goods and arms on their way to the far north  some of these men were sterling fellows good husbands and fathers and masters but with fiery independent spirits which could not brook the restraints laid on them by a government that had too frequently aroused their contempt or indignation  others were cruel selfish savages who scorned the idea that a man might not wallop his own nigger and were more than half pleased that the abolition of slavery and its consequences gave them a sort of reason for throwing off allegiance to the british crown and forsaking their homes in disgust and some there were who would have been willing to remain and suffer but could not bear the idea of being left behind by their kindred  next morning conrad completed the loading of his waggons placed his wife and childrenthere was still a babyin them mounted his horse with the sons who yet remained with him and bade farewell to the old home on the karroo  he was followed by a long train of his compatriots waggons  they all crossed the frontier into kafirland and thenceforth deemed themselves free  this was the first droppings of a showerthe first leak of a torrent the first outbreak of that great exodus of the dutchafrican boers which was destined in the future to work a mighty change in the south african colony  hans and gertie accompanied the party for several hours on their journey and then bidding them godspeed returned to their deserted home  but now a cloud was lowering over the land which had been imperceptibly though surely gathering on the horizon for years past  we have said that hitherto the colony despite many provocations thefts and occasional murders had lived in a state of peace with the kafirsthe only time that they took up arms for a brief space being in their defence at hintzas request against the fetcani  latterly we have also observed the british settlers had toiled hard and prospered  the comforts of life they had in abundance  trade began to be developed and missions were established in kafirland  among other things the freedom of the press had been granted them after a hard struggle  the first cape newspaper the south african commercial advertiser edited by pringle the poet and fairbairn was published in 1824 and the grahamstown journal the first eastern province newspaper was issued by mr godlonton in 1831  schools were also established  woolgrowing began to assume an importance which was a premonition of the future staple of the eastern provinces savingsbanks were established and in short everything gave promise of the colonyboth east and westbecoming a vigorous as it was obviously a healthy chip of the old block  but amongst all this wheat there had been springing up tares  with the growing prosperity there were growing evils  a generous and wellmeant effort on the part of christians and philanthropists to give full freedom and rights to the hottentots resulted to a large extent in vagabondism with its concomitant robbery  the kafirs emboldened by the weak and exasperated by the incomprehensible policy of the colonial government at that time not only crossed the border to aid the hottentot thieves in their work and carry off sheep and cattle by the hundred but secretly prepared for war  behind the scenes were the paramount chief hintza the chief macomo and others  the first forgetting the deliverance wrought for him by the settlers and british troops in 1828 secretly stirred up the kafirs whilst the second brooding over supposed wrongs fanned the flame of discontent raised among the hottentots by the proposal of a vagrancy act  when all is ready for war it takes but a spark to kindle the torch  the kafirs were ready the british however were not  the settlers had been peacefully following their vocations many of the troops which ought to have been there to guard them had been unwisely withdrawn and only a few hundred men remained in scattered groups along the frontier the armed hottentots of the kat riversent there as a defencebecame a point of weakness and required the presence of a small force to overawe them and prevent their joining the kafirs  at last the electric spark went forth  a farmer nell was robbed of seven horses which were traced to the kraal of a chief on the neutral territory  restoration was refused  a military patrol was sent to enforce restitution opposition was offered and the officer in command wounded with an assagai  hintza began to retreat and plunder british traders who were residing in his territory under his pledged protection and at length a trader named purcell was murdered near the chiefs kraal and his store robbed  then macomo began hostilities by robbing and murdering some farmers on the lower part of the kat river and two days afterwards the kafir hordes variously estimated at from eight to fifteen thousand men burst across the whole frontier wrapped the eastern colony in the smoke and flames of burning homesteads scattered the unprepared settlers demolished the works of fourteen years labour penetrated to within twenty miles of algoa bay and drove thousands of sheep and cattle back in triumph to kafirland    chapter twenty three  war  it was at this juncturethe christmastide of 1834 and the summertime in south africathat a merry party was assembled under the shade of umbrageous trees that crowned a little knoll from which could be seen the blue smoke curling from a prosperouslooking homestead in the vale below  it was a party of settlers enjoying their christmas festivities in the open air  hans marais and charlie considine were among them but feeling less inclined than was their wont to join in the hilarity of the young folks they had sauntered into the shrubbery and conversed sadly about the departure of conrad marais and his family and of the unsettled state of the frontier at that time  while they talked an armed band of savages had crept past them unperceived and advanced stealthily towards the party of revellers on the knoll  coming suddenly across the tracks of these savages hans cast an anxious look at his companion and said quickly  look here charliethe spoor of kafirs  lets go  the sentence was cut short by a wild warcry which was immediately followed by shouts of men and screams of women  turning without another word the two friends ran back to the knoll at full speed drawing their huntingknives which were the only weapons they happened to carry at the time  on reaching the knoll a fearful scene presented itself  the kafirs had already killed every man of the partyhaving come on them unawares and thrown their assagais with fatal precision from the bushes  they were completing the work of death with shouts and yells of fierce delight not a woman was to be seen  they had either been dragged into the bushes and slain or had sought refuge in flight  with a mighty shout of rage hans and considine dashed into the midst of the murderers and two instantly fell stabbed to the heart  seizing the assagais of these they rushed through the midst of their foes and as if animated by one mind made for the homestead below  to reach the stables and get possession of their horses and rifles was their object  the savages of whom there were about thirty were so taken aback by the suddenness and success of this onset that for a few seconds they did not pursue  then probably guessing the object of the fugitives they uttered a furious yell and followed them down the hill  but hans and considine were active as well as strong  they kept well ahead gained the principal house and secured their rifles  then instead of barricading the doors and defending themselves they ran out again and shot the two kafirs who first came up  well did the savages know the deadly nature of the white mans rifle although at that time they had not themselves become possessed of it when their comrades fell and the two white men were seen to kneel and take deliberate aim at those who followed the whole party scattered right and left and took refuge in the bush  but the friends did not fire  these were not the days of breechloaders  prudently reserving their fire they made a rush towards the stables saddled up in a few seconds and mounting rode forth at a gallop straight back to the bloodstained hillock  to rescue if possible some of the females was their object  regardless of several assagais that whizzed close to them they galloped hither and thither among the bushes but without success  lets try yonder hollow cried considine pointing as he spoke  the words had scarce left his lips when a host of some hundreds of kafirs with the shields assagais and feathers of savage warriors burst out of the hollow referred to  they had probably been attracted by the two shots and instantly rushed towards the white men  hans marais dismounted kneeled to take steadier aim fired and shot the foremost warrior  then springing on his steed at a bound he galloped away loading as he went and closely followed by his friend having reloaded hans pulled up and again leapt to the ground  this time considine appreciating his plan followed his example and both were about to kneel and fire when they perceived by a burst of smoke and flame that the farmbuildings had been set on fire  in a straight line beyond two other columns of dense smoke indicated the position of two neighbouring farms and a third column away to the right and further removed from the line of the frontier suddenly conveyed to the mind of hans the fact that a general rising of the kafirs had taken place  instead of firing he rose and remounted exclaiming  home charliehome  at the moment a shout was heard in another direction  turning round they observed a body of a dozen or so of mounted kafirs making straight towards them  to have killed two or four of these would have been easy enough to firstrate shots armed with doublebarrels but they knew that those unhurt would continue the chase  they therefore turned and fled in the direction of their own home  their steeds were good and fresh but their pursuers were evidently well mounted for they did not seem to lose ground  in the kitchen of conrad maraiss homestead gertie stood that day busily employed in the construction of a plumpudding with which she meant to regale hans and charlie on their return  and very pretty and happy did gertie look with her white apron and her dark hair looped up in careless braids and her face flushed with exertion and her pretty round arms bared to the dimpled elbows and scarcely capable of being rendered whiter by the flour with which they were covered  a young hottentot venus of indescribable ugliness assisted in retarding her  the master will be here soon said gertie wiping the flour and pieces of dough off her hands we must be quick  is the pot ready  venus responded with a ja and a grin which displayed a splendid casket of pearls  just then the clatter of hoofs was heard  why here they come already and in such a hurry too said gertie in surprise untying her apron hastily  before the apron was untied however hans had pulled up at the door and shouted gertie in a voice so tremendous that his wife turned pale and came quickly to the door  oh hans what  come darling quick  there was no time for more  hans held out his hand  gertie took it mechanically  your foot on my toe  quick  gertie did as she was bid and felt herself swung to the saddle in front of her husband who held her in his strong right arm while in the grasp of his huge left hand he held the reins and an assagai  poor gertie had time in that brief moment to note that charlie considine sat motionless on his panting horse gazing sternly towards the karroo and that a cloud of dust was sweeping over the plain towards them  she guessed too surely what it was but said not a word while her husband leaped his horse through a gap in the garden wall in order to reach the road by a short cut  doubleweighted thus the horse did not run so well as before  considine was frequently obliged to check his pace and look back  the stern frown on the dutchmans brow had now mingled with it a slightly troubled look  go on  ill follow immediately said considine as he reined in  dont be foolhardy cried hans with an anxious look as he shot past  without replying considine dismounted knelt on a slight eminence on the plain and deliberately prepared to fire  the pursuing savages observed the act and when within about six or seven hundred yards began to draw rein  charlie considine knew his rifle well although not sighted for such a range it was capable of carrying the distance when sufficiently elevated and practice had accustomed him to longrange shots  he aimed a little above the head of the foremost rider fired and killed his horse  with the second barrel he wounded one of the kafirs  at the same moment he observed that his late home was wrapped in flames and that the cattle and sheep of conrad marais which had been left in charge of hans were being driven off by the savages towards the mountains  this was enough  remounting charlie followed his friend and was rejoiced to find on looking back that the kafirs had ceased their pursuit  strange he said on overtaking hans that they should have given in so easily  it is not fear that influences them returned his friend with deeply knitted brows the reptiles know there is a pass before us and they will surely try to cut us off  they know all the short cuts better than i do  push on  urging their horses to their utmost speed the fugitives soon approached a more broken country and skirted the mountain range through which the pass referred to by hans led into level ground beyond  it was a narrow track through jungle which was dense in some places open in others they were soon in it riding furiously  at one of the open spaces they caught a glimpse of a mounted kafir making towards a part of the pass in advance of them  hans pulled up at once and looked eagerly anxiously round while he pressed the light form of gertie tighter to his breast  we must fight here charlie he said as he made for a little mound which was crowned with a few bushes  if you and i were alone we might risk forcing a passage butcome they observe our intention  a few bounds placed them on the top of the mound where they took shelter among the bushes  these were scarcely thick enough to cover the horses but among them was found a hole or crevice into which hans told his wife to creep  she had barely found refuge in this place when several assagais whizzed over their heads  sheltering themselves behind stones hans and considine looked eagerly in the direction whence the assagais had been thrown and the former observed the ears of a horse just appearing over a bush  he fired at the spot where he conjectured the rider must be and a yell told that he had not missed his mark  at the same moment his companion observed part of a kafirs form opposite to him and firing brought him to the ground  seeing this the other savages made a rush at the mound supposing probably that both guns were empty  they had either forgotten about or were ignorant of doublebarrelled weapons  two more shots killed the two leading kafirs and the rest turned to fly but a gigantic fellow shouted to them fiercely to come on and at the same moment leaped on charlie considine with such force that although the latter struck him heavily with the butt of his rifle he was borne to the ground  the triumph however was momentary  next instant hans marais seized him stabbed him in the throat and hurled him back among his comrades a lifeless corpse  charlie recovering himself pointed his unloaded gun at the savages who recoiled turned and fled back to the cover of the opposite bush  now is our time said hans dragging his wife from the place of shelter  mount and make a dash before they recover  while speaking hans was acting  in another moment gertie was in her old place considine in the saddle and the two men made a bold push for life  it turned out as the dutchman had conjectured  the kafirs had left all parts of the surrounding jungle to join in the assault on the mound and when the fugitives made a dash through them only a few had presence of mind to throw their assagais and these missed their mark  a few bounds carried hans and charlie once more in advance of their enemies but the clatter of hoofs immediately afterwards told that they were hotly pursued  there is no saying how the chase might have ended if they had not met with a piece of good fortune immediately afterwards  on emerging from the other end of the pass they almost ran into a small patrol of cape mounted rifles who attracted by the shots and cries in the pass were galloping to the rescue  they did not halt to ask questions but with a hearty cheer and a friendly wave of the hand from the officer in command dashed into the pass and met the pursuing savages in the very teeth  of course the latter turned and fled leaving however several of their comrades dead on the ground  during this early period of the war the whole defending force of the frontier consisted of only between seven and eight hundred men composed of cape mounted rifles and the 75th regiment with a few of the artillery and engineers and these had to be broken up into numerous small companies who were sent here and there where succour was most needed  with this little patrol hans gertie and considine bivouacked that night and travelling with them soon afterwards reached grahamstown  the sight of the country as they approached was a sad one  from all quarters men women children vehicles horses cattle and sheep were crowding into the town as a place of refuge  at first the settlers nearest the eastern frontier taken by surprise fled to temporary rallyingpoints  these however had to be abandoned for stronger places of refuge  on entering the town they found that the greatest confusion and excitement prevailed  the church had been set apart as an asylum for the women and children who had to put up however with the undesirable accompaniments of firearms and gunpowder  public meetings were being held picquets of armed citizens were being despatched to watch the main roads  all the houses were thronged to suffocation with refugeeswhite brown and black  the streets squares yards gardens and other vacant places were crowded by night and the surrounding hills by day with the flocks and herds that had been saved from the invaders while the lowing and bleating of these were mingled with the sobs and wails of the widow and fatherless  what misery exclaimed gertie as she rode slowly through the crowds by the side of her husband mounted on a horse lent her by one of the patrol oh how i dread to hear the news from home  gertie referred to her fathers home about the condition of which she knew nothing at the time  where shall we go to seek for news she asked anxiously  to the barracks replied hans  you need not be anxious i think said considine if anything very serious had happened it is likely the patrol who rescued us would have heard some account of it before leaving grahamstown  dont you think he added turning to hans that we had better inquire first at dobsons place  at that moment they were passing a large store over the door of which was a blue board with the words dobson skyd and company emblazoned in large white letters thereon  the store itself presented in its windows and interior an assortment of dry goods so extensive and miscellaneous as to suggest the idea of one being able to procure anything in itfrom a silk dress to a grindstone it was an extremely full prosperouslooking store and in the midst of it were to be seen sitting on the counters james and robert skyd both looking bluffer and stronger than when we last met them though scarcely a day older  james and robert were the managing partners of this prosperous firm dobson and john skyd were what the latter styled the hunting partners  robert skyd had recently married a pretty grahamstown girl and her little boythen about one year oldwas so said his father the sleeping partner of the firm who had been vaguely hinted at by the company long before he was born  indeed the company had been prudently inserted with special reference to what might turn up in after years  at the time the firm was formed it had been suggested that it should be styled dobson skyd and sons but as it was possible nothing but daughters might fall to the lot of any of them company was substituted as being conveniently indefinite  dobson took precedence in the title in virtue of his having brought most capital into the firm  he had invested his all in itamounting to three pounds four and ninepence halfpenny  john skyd had contributed halfacrown which happened to be a bad one  james brought nothing at all and robert entered it a little in debt for tobacco  the great waggon of the hunting partners loaded with hides horns and ivory stood at the door of the store as gertie and her protectors passed having just arrived from a successful trip into kafirland and fortunately escaped the outbreak of the war  fastening their bridles to one of its wheels hans gertie and considine entered  the first face they saw was that of edwin brook into whose arms gertie ran with a wild cry of joy  why hans marais cried james skyd jumping off the counter and grasping his big friend by the hand while robert seized that of considine where have you dropped frombut i need scarcely ask for all the world seems to be crowding into the town  not hurt i hope he added observing the blood which stained his friends dress  not in person answered hans with a smile returning his cordial grasp  and what of property asked edwin brook looking round  all gone returned hans sadly  i rose this morning a reasonably wealthy mannow i am a beggar  but tell me what of your family mr brook  all saved thank god was the reply  junkie dear boy who is the most active young fellow in the land managed toah here he comes and will speak for himself  as he spoke a tall strapping youth of about fifteen entered opened wide his laughing blue eyes on seeing hans and after a hearty greeting told with some hesitation that he had chanced to be out hunting on foot in the jungles of the great fish river when the kafirs crossed the frontier and had managed being a pretty good runner to give his father warning so that the family had time to escape  he did not tell however that he had in a narrow pass kept above sixty kafirs in check with his own hand and gun until george dally could run to the house for his weapons and ammunition and that then the two held a hundred of them in play long enough to permit of the whole family escaping under the care of scholtz  but said edwin brook who related all this with evident satisfaction i am like yourself hans in regard to property  mount hope is a blackened ruin the farm is laid waste and the cattle are over the borders  and where is mrs brook asked considine  in this house  upstairs  come gertie is getting impatient  let us go to see her  now friends said considine to the brothers skyd who had by that time been joined by the hunting partners there is a matter on which we must consult and act without delay  here he told of conrad maraiss departure with the boers across the frontier and added that if the party was to be saved at all it must be gone about instantly  you cant go about it today charlie said john skyd so dont give way to impatience  for such a long trip into the enemys country we must go well armed and supplied  i will brook no delay said considine with flushing countenance  if it had not been for the necessity of bringing gertie here in safety hans and i would have set out at once and alone on their spoor  is it not so  hans nodded assent  no friends he said turning to the brothers with decision we must be off at once  what without your suppers exclaimed bob skyd but to be serious it wont be possible to get things ready before tomorrow  surely that will do if we start at daybreak  besides the party with your father hans is a strong one well able to hold out against a vastly superior force of savages  moreover if you wait we shall get up a small body of volunteers  hans and charlie were thus constrained unwillingly to delay  at grey dawn however they rode out of grahamstown at the head of a small party consisting of the entire firm of dobson and skyd inclusive of junkie whose father granted him permission to go  his mother silently acquiesced  mrs scholtz violently protested and when she found that her protests were useless she changed them into pathetic entreaties that junkie would on no account whatever go to sleep in camp with wet feet  as soon as the invasion took place an express had been sent to capetown and the able governor sir benjamin durban took instant and energetic measures to undo as far as possible the mischief done by his predecessors  colonel afterwards sir harry smith was despatched to the frontier and rode the distancesix hundred milesin six days  arriving in grahamstown he took command with a firm hand organised the whole male population into a warlike garrison built barricades across the streets planted cannon in commanding positions cleared the town of flocks and herds which were breeding a nuisance sent them to the open country with a cattle guard and prepared not only to defend the capital but to carry war into the enemys country  in short he breathed into the people much of his own energy and soon brought order out of confusion  the state of affairs in the colony had indeed reached a terrible pass from all sides news came in of murder and pillage  the unfortunate traders in kafirland fared ill at that time  one of these rodgers was murdered in the presence of his three children  a man named cramer was savagely butchered while driving a few cattle along the road  another named mahony with his wife and soninlaw were intercepted while trying to escape to the military post of kafir drift and mahony was stretched a corpse at his wifes feet then the soninlaw was murdered but mrs mahony escaped into the bush with two of her children and a hottentot female servant and after many hardships reached grahamstown  a mounted patrol scouring the country fell in with a farmhouse where three dutchmen in a thick clump of bushes were defending themselves against three hundred kafirs  of course the latter were put to flight and the three heroestwo of them badly wounded were rescued  nearly everywhere the settlers outnumbered had to fly and many were slain while defending their homes but at the little village of salem they held their ground gallantly  the wesleyan chapel missionhouse and schoolhouse were filled with refugees and although the kafirs swooped down on it at night in large numbers and carried off the cattle they failed to overcome the stout defenders  theopolis also held out successfully against themand so did the scottish party at baviaans river although attacked and harassed continually  during an attack near the latter place a scottish gentleman of the pringle race had a narrow escape  sandy black was with him at the time three or four kafirs suddenly attacked them  mr pringle shot one sandy wounded another  a third ran forward while pringle was loading and threw an assagai at him  it struck him with great force on the leathern bulletpouch which hung at his belt  sandy black took aim at the savage with a pistol  aim low sandy said pringle continuing to load  sandy obeyed and shot the kafir dead then turning round said anxiously  are ee stickit sir  im not sure sandy replied pringle putting his hand in at the waist of his trousers theres blood i see  on examination it was found that the assagai had been arrested by the strong pouch and belt and had only given him a trifling scratch so that the gallant and amiable mr dods pringle lived to fight in future kafir wars  see note 1  in another place near the kat river thirty men were attacked by a hundred and fifty kafirs  the latter came on with fury but five of the farmers brought down seven of the enemy at the first discharge and thereafter poured into them so rapid and destructive a fire that they were seized with panic and fled leaving seventyfive of their number dead  instances of individual heroism might be endlessly multiplied but we think this is enough to show the desperate nature of the struggle which had begun  in the course of one fortnight the labours of fourteen years were annihilated  fortyfour persons were murdered 369 dwellings consumed 261 pillaged and 172000 head of livestock carried off into kafirland and irretrievably lost and what aggravated the wickedness of the invasion was the fact that during a great part of the year the governor had been engaged in special negotiations for a newand to the kafirs most advantageoussystem of relations with which all the chiefs except one had expressed themselves satisfied  writing on the condition of the country colonel smith said already are seven thousand persons dependent on government for the necessaries of life  the land is filled with the lamentations of the widow and the fatherless  the indelible impressions already made upon myself by the horrors of an irruption of savages upon a scattered population almost exclusively engaged in the peaceful occupations of husbandry are such as to make me look on those i have witnessed in a service of thirty years ten of which in the most eventful period of war as trifles to what i have now witnessed and compel me to bring under consideration as forcibly as i am able the heartrending position in which a very large portion of the inhabitants of this frontier are at present placed as well as their intense anxiety respecting their future condition  sir benjamin durban arriving soon afterwards constituted a board of relief to meet the necessities of the distressed and relief committees were established in capetown stellenbosch graaffreinet and other principal towns while subscriptions were collected in mauritius saint helena and india  soon after the arrival of colonel smith burgher forces were collected troops arrived with the governor on the scene of action and the work of expelling the invader was begun in earnest  skirmishes by small bodies of farmers and detachments of troops took place all over the land in which the dutchafrican colonists and english settlers with their descendants vied with each other and with the regulars in heroic daring  justice requires it to be added that they had a bold enemy to deal with for the kafirs were physically splendid men full of courage and daring although armed only with light spears    note 1  the author had the pleasure of spending a night last year 1876 under the hospitable roof of mr pringle shortly before his death and saw the identical assagai which was bent by the force with which it had been hurled against him on that occasion    chapter twenty four  shows what befell a trader and an emigrant band  stephen orpin with the goods of

bowed his head and continued as far as in him lay to fulfil the end for which he seemed to have been created  he travelled with goods far and wide throughout the eastern districts of the colony became a walking newspaper to the farmers of the frontier and a guide to the better land to whoever would grant him a hearing  but stephens mercantile course like that of his affections did not run smooth  at the present time it became even more rugged than the mountain road which almost dislocated his waggon and nearly maddened his hottentot drivers for when involved in the intricacies of a pass he was suddenly attacked by a band of wild bushman marauders  the spot chanced to be so far advantageous that a high precipice at his back rendered it impossible to attack him except in front where the ground was pretty open  orpin was by no means a milksop and although a christian man did not understand christianity to teach the absolute giving up of all ones possessions to the first scoundrel who shall demand them  the moment therefore that the robbers showed themselves he stopped the waggon at the foot of the precipice drew his everready doublebarrelled largebore gun from under the tilt and ran out in front calling on his men to support him  kneeling down he prepared to take a steady aim at the bushman in advance a wildlooking savage in a sheepskin kaross and armed with an assagai  the robbers were evidently aware of the nature of a gun for they halted on seeing the decided action of the trader  come on shouted orpin to his men looking back over his shoulder but his men were nowhere to be seen they had deserted him at the first sight of the robbers and scrambled away into the jungle like monkeys  to resist some dozens of savages singlehanded stephen knew would be useless and to shed blood unnecessarily was against his principles  he therefore made up his mind at once how to act  rising and turning round he discharged his gun at the precipice to prevent the bushmen from accidentally doing mischief with it then sitting down on a piece of fallen rock he quietly took out his pipe and began to light it  this was not meant as a piece of bravado but stephen was eccentric and it occurred to him that there was a touch of nature in a pipe which might possibly induce the bushmen to be less rude to him personally than if he were to stand by and look aggrieved while his waggons were being pillaged  in this conjecture he was right  the robbers rushed towards the waggon without doing him any harm  one of them however picked up the gun in passing  then the leader seized the long whip and drove the waggon away leaving its late owner to his meditations  stephen would have been more than human if he could have stood the loss of all his earthly goods with perfect equanimity  he groaned when the oxen began to move and then feeling a desperate desire to relieve his feelings and a strong tendency to fight he suddenly shut his eyes and began to pray that the robbers might be forgiven and himself enabled to bear his trials in a becoming manner  opening his eyes again he beheld a sturdy bushman gazing at him in openmouthed surprise with an uplifted assagai in his hand  stephen judged that this was the chief of the band who had remained behind to kill him  at all events when he ceased to pray and opened his eyes the bushman shut his mouth and poised his assagai in a threatening manner  unarmed as he was stephen knew that he was at the mans mercy  in this dilemma and knowing nothing of the bushman language he put powerful constraint on himself and looked placidly at his wallet in which he searched earnestly for something quite regardless to all appearances of the deadly spear whose point was within ten feet of his breast  the bushmans curiosity was awakened  he waited until stephen had drawn a lump of tobacco from his pouchwhich latter he took care to turn inside out to show there was nothing else in it  rising quietly the trader advanced with a peaceful air holding the tobacco out to the bushman who looked suspiciousand distrustfully shook his assagai but stephen took no heed  stopping within a couple of yards of him he held out the tobacco at the full length of his arm  the bushman hesitated but finally lowered his assegai and accepted the gift  stephen immediately resumed his pipe and smiled pleasantly at his foe  the bushman appeared to be unable to resist this  he grinned hideously then turning about made off in the direction of his comrades as fast as his naked legs could carry him  it was booby the follower of ruyter the hottentot who had thus robbed the unfortunate trader and not two hours afterwards ruyter himself fell in with stephen wending his way slowly and sadly down the glen  desiring his men to proceed in advance the robber chief asked orpin to sit down on a fallen tree beside him and relate what had happened when he had done so ruyter shook his head and said in his broken english  yous bin my friend orpin but i cannot help you dis time  booby not under me now an wes bof blong to dragoeners band  is sorry but not can help you  never mind ruyter i daresay youd help me if you could said stephen with a sigh then with an earnest look in the hottentots face he continued im not however much distressed about the goods the lord who gave them has taken them away and can give them back again if he has a mind to but tell me ruyter why will you not think of the things we once spoke ofthat time when you were so roughly handled by jan smitabout your soul and the saviour  how you knows i not tink demanded the hottentot sharply  because any man can know a tree by its fruit returned orpin  if you had become a christian i should not now have found you the leader of a band of thieves  no i not a christian but i do tink returned ruyter only i no can onderstan  de black heathenso you calls himlive in de land white christianso you calls himcome and take de land make slabe ob black man and kick im about like pair ob ole bootsi not onderstan nohow  come i will try to make you understand returned orpin pulling out the new testament which he always carried in his pocket  some white men who call themselves christians are heathens and some black men are christians  we are allblack and whiteborn bad and god has sent us a saviour and a message so that all who will black or white may become good  orpin here commenced to expound the word and to tell the story of the cross while the hottentot listened with rapt attention or asked questions which showed that he had indeed been thinking of these things since his last meeting with the trader many years before  he was not very communicative however and when the two parted he declined to make any more satisfactory promise than that he would continue to tink  stephen orpin spent the night alone in a tree up which he had climbed to be more secure from wild beasts  sitting there he meditated much and came to the conclusion that he ought in future to devote himself entirely to missionary labours  in pursuance of that idea he made his way to one of the wesleyan mission stations in kafirland  on the road thither he came to a kafir kraal where the men seemed to be engaged in the performance of a wardance  on being questioned by these kafirs as to who he was and where he came from orpin replied in his best kafir that he was a trader and a missionary  the chief looked surprised but on hearing the whole of orpins story a cunning look twinkled in his eyes and he professed great friendship for the missionaries stating at the same time that he was going to one of the wesleyan stations and would be glad to escort orpin thither thereafter he gave orders that the white man should be taken to one of his huts and supplied with a basket of milk  the white man gratefully acknowledged the kind offer and asking the name of the friendly chief was informed that it was hintza  just then a court fool or jester stepped forward and cried aloud his announcements of the events of the day mixed with highly complimentary praises of his master  stephen did not understand all he said but he gathered thus muchthat the warriors had been out to battle and had returned victorious that hintza was the greatest man and most courageous warrior who had ever appeared among the kafirs to gladden their hearts and enrich their bands and that there was great work yet for the warriors to do in the way of driving certain barbarians into the seato which desirable deed the heroic the valiant the wise the unapproachable hintza would lead them  orpin feared that he understood the meaning of the last words too well but being aware that hintza was regarded by the colonists as one of the friendliest of the kafir chiefs he hoped that he might be mistaken  hintza was as good as his word and set out next day with a band of warriors giving the white man a good horse that he might ride beside him  on the way they came on a sight which filled orpin with sadness and anxiety  it was the ruins of a village which from the appearance of the remains had evidently been occupied in part by white men  he observed that a gleam of satisfaction lit up hintzas swarthy visage for a moment as he passed the place  dismounting the party proceeded to examine the ruins but found nothing  the kafirs were very taciturn but the chief said on being pressed that he believed it had been a mission station which wicked men of other tribes had burned  on the outbreak of this war some of the missionaries remained by their people others were compelled to leave them  the station just passed had been deserted  at the one to which hintza was now leading orpin the missionaries had remained at their post there he found them still holding out but in deep dejection for nearly all their people had forsaken them and gone to the war  even while he was talking with them crowds of the bloodstained savages were returning from the colony laden with the spoils of the white man and driving thousands of his sheep and cattle before them  in these circumstances stephen resolved to make the best of his way back to salem  on telling this to hintza that chief from some cause that he could not understand again offered to escort him  he would not accompany him personally he said but he would send with him a band of his warriors and he trusted that on his arrival in the colony he would tell to the great white chief the governor that he hintza did not aid the other kafir tribes in this war  stephens eyes were opened by the last speech and from that moment he suspected hintza of treachery  he had no choice however but to accept the escort  on the very day after they had started they came to a spot where a terrible fight had obviously taken place  the ground was strewn with the mangled corpses of a party of white men while the remains of waggons and other signs showed that they had formed one of the bands of dutch emigrants which had already begun to quit the colony  the savages made ineffectual attempts to conceal their delight at what they saw and orpin now felt that he was in the power of enemies who merely spared his life in the hope that he might afterwards be useful to them  the band which escorted him consisted of several hundred warriors a few of whom were mounted on splendid horses stolen from the settlers  he himself was also mounted on a good steed but felt that it would be madness to attempt to fly from them  on the second day they were joinedwhether by arrangement or not orpin had no means of judgingby a band of over a thousand warriors belonging to a different tribe from his escort  as the trader rode along in a dejected state of mind one of the advanceguard or scouts came back with excited looks saying that a large band of dutch farmers was encamped down in a hollow just beyond the rise in front of them  the chief of the kafirs ordered the scout sternly to be silent at the same time glancing at orpin  then he whispered to two men who quietly took their assagais and stationed themselves one on either side of their white prisonerfor such he really was  orpin now felt certain that the group of principal men who drew together a little apart were concerting the best mode of attacking the emigrant farmers and his heart burned within him as he thought of them resting there in fancied security while these black scoundrels were plotting their destruction  but what could he doalone and totally unarmed  he thought of making a dash and giving the alarm but the watchful savages at his side seemed to divine his intentions for they grasped their assagais with significant action  a desperate disease thought orpin requires a desperate remedy  i will try it and may succeedgod helping me  a thought occurred just then  disengaging his right foot from the stirrup he made as if he were shortening it a little but instead he detached it from the saddle and taking one turn of the leather round his hand leaped his horse at the savage nearest him and struck him full on the forehead with the stirrupiron  dashing on at full speed he bent low and as he had hoped the spear of the other savage whizzed close over his back  the act was so sudden that he had almost gained the ridge before the other mounted kafirs could pursue  he heard a loud voice however command them to stop and looking back saw that only one kafirthe leader gave chase but that leader was a powerful man armed and on a fleeter horse than his own  a glance showed him the camp of the emigrant farmers in a hollow about a mile or so distant  he made straight for it  the action of the next few seconds was short sharp and decisive  the dutchmen having had a previous alarm from a small kafir band were prepared  they had drawn their waggons into a compact circle closing the apertures between and beneath them with thornbushes which they lashed firmly with leather thongs to the wheels and disselbooms or waggonpoles  within this circle was a smaller one for the protection of the women and children  great was the surprise of the farmers when they heard a loud shout and beheld a white man flying for his life from a solitary savage  with the promptitude of men born and bred in the midst of alarms they seized their guns and issued from their fortified enclosure to the rescue but the kafir was already close to orpin and in the act of raising his assagai to stab him  seeing the urgency of the case conrad marais who was considered a pretty good shot among his fellows took steady aim and at the risk of hitting the white man fired  the right arm of the savage dropped by his side and the assagai fell to the ground but plucking another from his bundle with his left hand he made a furious thrust  stephen orpin swaying aside was only grazed by it  at the same time he whirled the stirrup once round his head and bringing the iron down with tremendous force on the skull of his pursuer hurled him to the ground  stephen orpin exclaimed conrad marais in amazement as the trader galloped up  youve got more pluck than i gave you credit for growled jan smit  youll need all your own pluck presently retorted orpin who thereupon told them that hundreds of kafirs were on the other side of the ridge and would be down on them in a few minutes  indeed he had not finished speaking when the ridge in question was crossed by the black host who came yelling on to the attackthe few mounted men leading  come boys lets meet them as far as possible from the waggons cried conrad  the whole band of farmers each mounted and carrying his gun dashed forward  when quite close to the foe they halted and every man dismounting knelt and fired  nearly all the horsemen among the enemy fell to the ground at the discharge and the riderless steeds galloped over the plain while numbers of the footmen were also killed and wounded  but most of those savages belonged to a fierce and warlike tribe  though checked for a moment they soon returned to the attack more furiously than before  the dutch farmers remounting galloped back a short distance loading as they went halting again they dismounted and fired as before with deadly effect  there is no question that the white men if sufficiently supplied with ammunition could have thus easily overcome any number of the savages but the waggons stopped them  on reaching these they were obliged to stand at bay and being greatly outnumbered took shelter inside of their enclosure  of course their flocks and herds being most of them outside were at once driven away by a small party of the assailants while the larger proportion with savage yells and warcries made a furious attack on their position  closing round the circle they endeavoured again and again to break through the line or to clamber over the waggontilts and never did savage warriors earn a better title to the name of braves than on that occasion  even the bristling four and sixinch thorns of the mimosabushes would not have been able to turn back their impetuous onset if behind these the stout dutchmen fighting for wives and children had not stood manfully loading and firing volleys of slugs and buckshot at armslength from them  the crowded ranks of the kafirs were ploughed as if by cannon while hundreds of assagais were hurled into the enclosure but happily with little effect though a few of the defendersexposing themselves recklesslywere wounded  while conrad marais was standing close to the hindwheels of one of the waggons watching for a good shot at a kafir outside who was dodging about for the double purpose of baulking conrads intention and thrusting an assagai into him another active kafir had clambered unobserved on the tilt of the waggon and was in the very act of leaning over to thrust his spear into the back of the dutchmans neck when he was observed by stephen orpin who chanced to be reloading his gun at the moment  with a loud roar very unlike his usual gentle tones orpin sprang forward seized a thick piece of wood like a fourfoot rollingpin and therewith felled the savage who tumbled headlong into the enclosure  oh father exclaimed a terrified voice at that moment while a light touch was laid on conrads shoulder  what brings you here bertha said conrad with an impatient gesture dont you know  come quick to mother cried the girl interrupting  no more was needed  in a moment conrad was in the central enclosure where crowded under a rude erection of planks and boxes were the women and children  an assagai had penetrated an unguarded crevice and passing under the arm of poor mrs marais had pinned her to the family trunk against which she leaned  bertha could not pull it out said mrs marais with a faint smile on her pale face but i dont think im much hurt  in a moment her husband had pulled out the spear found that it had penetrated her clothing and only grazed her breast took time merely to make sure of this and then leaving her in berthas hands returned to the scene of combat  he was not an instant too soon  a yell was uttered by the savages as they rushed at a weak point where the thornbush defences had been broken down  the point appeared to be undefended  they were about to leap through in a dense mass when ten dutchmen who had reserved their fire discharged a volley simultaneously into the midst of them  it was a ruse of the defenders to draw the savages to that point  whilst the kafirs tumbled back over heaps of dead and dying several other farmers thrust masses of impenetrable mimosa bush into the gap and refilled it this discomfiture checked the assailants for a little they drew off and retired behind the ridge to concert plans for a renewed and more systematic attack    chapter twenty five  treats of various strange incidents some interesting matters and a rescue  while the emigrant farmers were thus gallantly defending themselves the party under hans marais and charlie considine was hastening on their spoor to the rescue  their numbers had been increased by several volunteers among whom were george dally and scholtz also david jacob and hendrik the sons of jan smit who had made up their minds not to follow the fortunes of their savagetempered sire but who were at once ready to fly to his rescue on learning that he was in danger  while passing through the country they were further reinforced by a band of stout burghers and by four brothers named bowker  there were originally seven brothers of this family who afterwards played a prominent part in the affairs of the colony  one of these bowkers was noted for wearing a very tall white hat in which being of a literary turn of mind he delighted to carry old letters and newspapers  from this circumstance his hat became known as the postoffice  although small this was about as heroic a band of warriors as ever took the fieldnearly every man being strong active a dead shot well trained to fight with wild beasts and acquainted with the tactics of wilder men  proceeding by forced marches they soon drew near to that part of the country where the beleaguered farmers lay  one evening having encamped a little earlier than usual owing to the circumstance of their having reached a fountain of clear good water some of the more energetic among them went off to search for game among these were the brothers bowker  theres very likely a buffalo or something in that bush over there said septimus bowker who was the owner of the postoffice hat come mr considine you wanted towheres considine  every one looked round but considine and hans were not there  one of the skyds however remembered that they had fallen behind half an hour before with the intention of procuring something fresh for supper  well we must go without him  he wanted to shoot a buffalo  will no one else go  no one else felt inclined to go except junkie brook so he and the four bowkers went off septimus pressing the postoffice tightly on his brows as they galloped away  they had not far to go game of all kinds being abundant in that region but instead of finding a buffalo or gnu they discovered a lioness in a bed of rushes  the party had several dogs with them and these went yelping into the rushes while the brothers stationed themselves on a mound standing in a row one behind another  the brother with the tall white hat stood in front  being the eldest he claimed the post of honour  they were all fearless men and crack shots  junkie was ordered to stand back and complied with a bad grace being an ardent sportsman  look out exclaimed the brother in front to the brothers in rear  ready was the quiet response  next moment out came the lioness with a savage growl and went straight at septimus who cocked his gun as coolly as if he were about to slay a sparrow  while the enraged animal was in the act of bounding septimus fired straight down its throat and suddenly stooped  by so doing he saved his head  perhaps we should say the tall white hat saved it for the crushing slap which the lioness meant to give him on the side of the head took effect on the postoffice and scattered its contents far and wide  spurning septimus on the shoulders with her hindlegs as she flew past the lioness made at the brothers  firm as the horatii stood the other three  deliberate and cool was their action as they took aim junkie followed suit and the whole fired a volley which laid the lioness dead at their feet  gathering himself up septimus looked with some concern at the white hat before putting it on  remarking that it was tough he proceeded to pick up its literary contents while his brothers skinned the lioness shortly afterwards they all returned to camp  passing that way an hour or so later hans marais and charlie considine came upon the spoor of the lioness  i say charlie called out hans there must be a lion in the vley there  ive got the spoor  come here  its not in the vley now replied charlie come here yourself ive found blood and hallo heres a newspaper  why it must be a literary lion  look hans can you make out the namehowker dowker or something o that sort  do lions ever go by that name  bowker exclaimed hans with a laugh  ah my boy theres no lion in the vley if the bowkers have been here and see its all plain as a pikestaff  they shot it here and skinned it there and have dragged the carcass towards that bush yes here it isa lioness  theyre back to camp by this time  come lets follow them  as they rode along hans who had been glancing at the newspaper turned suddenly to his companion  i say charlie heres a strange coincidence  its not every day that a man finds a times newspaper in the wilds of southern africa with a message in it to himself  what do you mean hans  tell me charlie about that uncle of whom you once spoke to melong agoin rather disrespectful tones if not terms  was he rich  i believe so but was never quite certain as to that  did he like you  i rather think not  had you a male cousin or relative of the same name with yourself whom he did like  then allow me to congratulate you on your good fortune and read that said hans giving him the newspaper  charlie read  if this should meet the eye of charles considine formerly of golden square hotchester he is requested to return without delay to england or to communicate with aggard ale and ixley solicitors 23a fitzbustaway square london  most amazing exclaimed considine after a pause and there can be no doubt it refers to me for these were my uncles solicitorsmost agreeable menwho gave me the needful to fit me out and it was their chief clerka romannosed jovial sort of fellow named rundle something or otherwho accompanied me to the ship when i left and wished me a pleasant voyage with a tear or a drop of rain im not sure which rolling down his roman nose  well but as i said before isnt it an astonishing coincidence  it wasnt you who said that before it was i returned hans but we must make allowance for your state of mind  and now as were nearing the camp what is it to besilence  silence of course said charlie  theres no fear of bowker reading the advertisements through he has far too much literary taste for that and even if he did hes not likely to stumble on this one  so lets be silent  there was anything but silence in the camp however when the friends reached it and reported their want of luck for the warriors were then in the first fervour of appealing their powerful appetites  next morning they started at sunrise  early in the day they came on the mangled remains of the emigrant farmers before referred to  at first it was supposed this must be the remnant of the band they were in search of but a very brief examination convinced them experienced as they were in men and signs that it was another band  soon after they came in sight of the party for which they were searching just as the kafirs were making a renewed attack already a few volleys had been fired by the dutchmen the smoke of which hung like a white shroud over the camp and swarms of savages were yelling round it  the cattle and flocks have been swept away growled frank dobson  but the women and children must be safe as yet said considine with a sigh of relief  now boys cried hans who had been elected captain we must act together  when i give the word halt and fire like one man and then charge where i lead you  dont scatter  dont give way to impetuous feelings  be under command if you would save our friends  he spoke with quick abrupt vigour and waited for no reply or remark but putting himself where he fancied a leader should be in front of the centre of his little line set off in the direction of the emigrants camp at a smart gallop  as the horsemen drew near they increased their pace and then a yell from the savages and a cheer from their friends told that they had been observed by the combatants on both sides  the kafirs were seen running back to the ridge on the other side of the camp and assembling themselves hurriedly in a dense mass  on swept the line of stalwart burghers over the plain and down into the hollow in dead silence  the force of their leaders character seemed to have infused military discipline into them  most of them kept boot to boot like dragoons  even dally and scholtz kept well in line and none lagged or shot ahead  as they passed close to the camp without drawing rein the dutchmen gave them an enthusiastic cheer but no reply was made save by junkie who could not repress a cry of fierce delight down deeper into the hollow they went and up the opposite slopethe thunder of their tread alone breaking the stillness  halt cried the leader in a deep loud voice  they drew up together almost as well as they had run  next moment every man was on the ground and down on one knee then followed the roar of their pieces and a yell of wild fury told that none had missed his mark  before the smoke had risen a yard they were again in the saddle no further order was given  hans charged the rest followed like a wall at racing speed with guns and bridles grasped in their left hands and sabres drawn in their right  the savages did not await the onset  they turned scattered and fled many were overtaken and cut down  the dutchmen sallied from the camp and joined in the pursuit  the kafirs were routed completely and all the cattle and flocks were recovered  that same day there was a hot discussion over the campfires as to whether the emigrant farmers should return at once to the colony or wait until they should gather together some of the other parties of emigrants which were known to have crossed the frontier  at last it was resolved to adopt the latter course but the wives and families were to be sent back to fort wilshire under the escort of their deliverers there to remain till better times should dawn  charlie said conrad marais as he walked up and down with his friend i must stick by my party but i can trust you and hans  youll be careful of the women and little ones  you may depend on us replied considine with emphasis  and you neednt be afraid to speak to bertha by the way said conrad with a peculiar side glance  charlie looked up quickly with a flush  do you mean sir thatthat  of course i do cried the stout farmer grasping his friend by the hand i forgive your being an englishman charlie and as i cant make you a dutchman the next best i can do for you is to give you a dutch wife who is in my opinion better and prettier than any english girl that ever lived  hold cried considine returning the grasp i will not join you in making invidious comparisons between dutch and english but ill go farther than you and say that bertha is in my opinion the best and prettiest girl in the whole world  thatll do lad thatll do  so now well go see what the totties have managed to toss us up for breakfast  before the sun set that night the emigrant farmers united with another large band were entrenched in a temporary stronghold and the women and children with the rescue partystrengthened by a company of hunters and traders who had been in the interior when the war broke out were far on their way back to fort wilshire    chapter twenty six  relates incidents of the war and a great deliverance  on reaching the frontier fort it was found to be in a state of excitement bustle and preparation  news had just been received that the treacherous chief hintza although professedly at peace with the colony was secretly in league with the invading chiefs and the governor was convinced of the necessity of taking vigorous measures against him  the savages flushed with success and retiring for a time to their own land with the cattle they had carried off found in hintza one ready to aid them in every way  it transpired that he had not only allowed the stolen cattle to be secreted in his territory but many of his own people were out with the confederate chiefs fighting against the colonists while traders under his protection had by his orders been seized and plundered  a message had therefore been sent to hintza requiring him at once and decidedly to declare his intentions  to this instead of a reply the savage chief sent one of his braves whose speech and conduct showed that his wily master only wished to gain time by trifling diplomacy  the brave was therefore sent back with another message to the effect that if he hintza should afford any of the other chiefs shelter or protection and did not restore the booty concealed in his territory he would be treated as an enemy  it was also proposed that himself should come and have an interview with the governor but this invitation he declined sir benjamin durban therefore resolved to menace the truculent chief in his own dominions and when hans marais with his band entered the square of the little fort he found the troops on the point of setting out  the force consisted of a body of regulars and a burgher band collected from all parts of the colony  among them were hardy englishmen from the zuurveld tough with the training of fourteen years in the wilderness and massive dutchmen from the karroo splendid horsemen and deadly shots  while the bustle was at its height a party of horsemen galloped up to the gate headed by a giant  it turned out to be a contingent from glen lynden under groot willem of baviaans river with andrew rivers jerry goldboy and several of the dutch farmers of the tarka in his train  ho here you are cried groot willem in his hearty bass roar as he leaped to the ground and seized hans marais by the hand  all well at edeneh  burnt out said hans quietly  the giant looked aghast for a moment  then his friend ran hurriedly over the main points of his story  but there was no time for talk while salutations were being exchanged by the members of the various parties thus assembled sir benjamin appeared mounted his horse gave orders to several of his officers and spoke a few words to groot willem and hans  in a few minutes the troops were marched out of the fort and next day reached the right bank of the kei river  this was the western boundary of hintzas particular territory  on arriving the governor issued general orders to the effect that hintza was not to be treated as an enemy  no kraals were to be burnt no gardens or fields pillaged and no natives meddled with unless hostilities were first begun by them and that no act of violence should be committed until due notice of the commencement of hostilities had been given  you see said sir benjamin in a private conversation with one of his staff i am resolved to take every possible precaution to avoid giving cause of complaint to the great chief and to endeavour by mild forbearance to maintain peace  at the same time it is essential that i should act with vigour because undue forbearance is always misinterpreted by savages to mean cowardice and only precipitates the evils we seek to avoid  on arriving at a spot where a trader named purcell had been plundered and murdered the troops were met by several councillors from hintza and from the chief booko who were still a days journey distant  to these the governor said  go tell the great chief that i request an interview with himself because i desire that peace should be between us and that justice should be done  i will not cease to advance until such interview is obtained and it will depend on his own conduct whether hintza is treated by the british government as a friend or a foe  but the great chief was doggedly bent on meeting his fate  he returned no answer to the message and the troops moved on  arriving at the mission station of butterworth they found it destroyed and here they were met by a large body of fingoesnative slaveswho eagerly offered their services to fight against their cruel masters the kafirs  these fingoesdestined in after years to make a deep impression on the colonywere the remains of eight powerful nations who broken up and scattered by the ferocious chaka and his zulu hordes had taken refuge with hintza by whom they were enslaved and treated in the most brutal manner  he gave them generally the name of fingo which means dog their eager offer to serve under the british chief was therefore most natural but sir benjamin declined their services at the time as war had not yet been declared  soon after a detachment of thirty men was sent back to the colony with despatches in charge of an ensign named armstrong who was waylaid and murdered by some of hintzas kafirs  the governor finding that his overtures were treated with studied neglect and that hostilities were thus begun called to him a kafir councillor and warrior and said  your master has treated all my messages with contempt  he is in secret alliance with the chiefs who have invaded our colony  he has received and concealed cattle stolen from the white men  a british trader has been deliberately murdered in his territory near his own residence and under his protection and no steps have been taken to punish the murderers  violence and outrage have been committed by him on british traders and missionaries living under his safeguard have been forced to flee to the tambookie chief to save their lives  i will no longer treat with him  since hintza is resolved on war he shall have it  i will now take the fingoes under my special protection make them subjects of the king of england and severely punish any who commit violence upon them  i will also carry off all the cattle i can findgo tell your master his blood shall be on his own head  this message which was followed up by prompt action the capture of considerable numbers of cattle and a successful attack on one of his principal kraals brought the great chief to his sensesapparently but not really as the sequel will show  he sent in four messengers with proposals but the governor refused to treat with any one except hintza himself  terrified at last into submission he entered the camp with a retinue of fifty followers and was courteously received by the commanderinchief  during the course of these proceedings detached parties were frequently sent hither and thither to surprise a kraal or to capture cattle and the two parties under groot willem and hans marais having arrived at fort wilshire at the same time were allowed to act pretty much in concert  one night they found themselves encamped in a dark mountain gorge during a thunderstorm  well well said jerry goldboy to junkie who with scholtz had taken refuge under the very imperfect shelter of a bush its orrible ard work this campaigning specially in bad weather with the point of ones nose amost cut off  jerry referred to a wound which an assagai aimed at his heart had that day inflicted on his nose  the wound was not severe but it was painful and the stickingplaster which held the point of his unfortunate member in its place gave his countenance an unusually comical appearance  is it very zore boy asked scholtz  zore  i wish you ad it an you wouldnt ave to ask returned jerry  how did you come by it asked junkie looking grave with difficulty  well it aint easy to say exactly  you see it was getting dark at the time and i was doin my best to drive a thief of a hox down a place in the kloof where it had to stand upright amost on its frontlegs with its tail whirlin in the hair  an i adnt much time to waste neither for i knew there was kafirs all about an the troops was gettin aead of me an my oss was tied to a yellowwood tree at the foot o the kloof an i began to feel sort o skeery with the gloomy thickets all around an rugged precipices lookin as if theyd tumble on me an the great mountains goin up to eavenoh  i can tell you it wasit was  in short the most horrible sight you ever saw said junkie drawing his blanket tighter round his shoulders and crouching nearer to the bulky form of scholtz for protection from the wind which was rising  yes junkie it wasthe most orrible sight i ever saw for wild savageness so i drew my sword and gave the hox a prog that sent im ead over eels down the kloof were e broke is back  just at that werry momentwould you mind takin your toe out o my neck junkie it aint comfortable thank youwell as i was sayin at that very moment i spied a black fellow stealin away in the direction of my oss he saw me too but thought i didnt see im  up i jumps an run for the oss  up e jumps an run likewise  but i was nearer than im an a deal fasterthough i dont mean to boast  an a deal frighteneder suggested junkie  praps owever i got to the oss first  i didnt take time to mount but went leapfrog over is tail slap into the saddle which gave the hold oss such a skeer that e bolted  the kafir e gave a yell an sent is assagai after me an by bad luck i looks round just as it went past an all but took off the point of my nose  wasnt it unlucky  unlucky you ungrateful man growled scholtz  you should be ver glad de assagai did not stick you in de neck like von zowis zat rain vich i feels in ze back of mine head  like enough  theres plenty of it anyhow said junkie trying to peer through the gloom in the direction of the tents occupied by a small body of regular troops which accompanied them  as he did so a sudden squall struck the tents levelling two with the ground and entirely whisking off one which after making a wild circle in the air was launched over a precipice into thick darkness and never more seen  lying under another bush not far distant considine and hans lay crouched together for the purpose at once of keeping each other warm and presenting the smallest possible amount of surface to the weather  they did not sleep at first and being within earshot of the bush under which the brothers skyd had sheltered themselves found sufficient entertainment in listening to their conversation  we scarce counted on this sort of thing said john skyd when fifteen years ago we left the shores of old england for africs southern wilds  thats true jack was bob skyds reply and i sometimes think it would have been better if we had remained at home  craven heart what do you mean demanded james  ay what do you mean repeated dobson will nothing convince you  it is true we made a poor job of the farming owing to our ignorance but since we took to merchandise have we not made a good thing of itaint it improving every day and wont we rise to the very pinnacle of prosperity when this miserable war is over  supposing that we are not killed in the meantime said stephen orpin who formed one of the group  that is a mere truism and quite irrelevant retorted dobson  talking of irrelevant matters does any one know why sandy black and mctavish did not come with groot willem asked orpin  to this john skyd replied that he had heard some one say a party of the glen lynden men had gone off to root out a nest of freebooters under that scoundrel ruyter who taking advantage of the times had become more ferocious and daring than ever  yet some say observed dobson that the hottentot robber is becoming religious or cravenhearted i dont know which  perhaps brokenhearted suggested orpin  perhaps  anyhow it is said his followers are dissatisfied with him for some reason or other  he does not lead them so well as he was wont to  while the white men were thus variously engaged in jesting over their discomforts or holding more serious converse their sable enemies were preparing for them a warm reception in the neighbouring pass  but both parties were checked and startled by the storm which presently burst over them  at first the thunderclaps were distant but by degrees they came nearer and burst with deafening crash seemingly close overhead while lightning ran along the earth like momentary rivulets of fire  at the same time the windows of heaven were opened and rain fell in waterspouts drenching every one to the skin  the storm passed as suddenly as it came and at daybreak was entirely gone leaving a calm clear sky  sleepy wet covered with mud and utterly miserable the party turned out of their comfortless bivouac and after a hasty meal of cold provisions resumed their march up the kloof  at the narrowest part of it some of the troops were sent in advance as skirmishers and the ambush was discovered  even then they were in an awkward position and there can be no question that if the natives had been possessed of firearms they would have been cut off to a man  as it was the savages came at them with dauntless courage throwing their assagais when near enough and hurling stones down from the almost perpendicular cliffs on either side  but nothing could resist the steady fire of men who were most of them expert shots  few of the white men were wounded but heaps of the kafirs lay dead on each other ere they gave way and retreated before a dashing charge with the bayonet  oh it was a sad sightsad to see men in the vigorous health of early youth and the strong powers of manhoods prime cast lifeless on the ground and left to rot there for the mistaken idea on the kafirs part that white men were their natural enemies when in truth they brought to their land the comforts of civilised life sad to think that they had died for the mistaken notion that their country was being taken from them when in truth they had much more country than they knew what to do withmore than was sufficient to support themselves and all the white men who have ever gone there and all that are likely to go for many years to come sad to think of the stern necessity that compelled the white men to lay them low sadder still to think of the wives and mothers sisters and little ones who were left to wail unavailingly for fathers and brothers lost to them for ever and saddest of all to remember that it is not merely the naked savage in his untutored ignorance but the civilised white man in his learned wisdom who indulges in this silly costly murderous brutal and accursed game of war  returning from the fight next day with a large herd of captured cattle the contingent found that hintza had agreed unconditionally to all the proposals made to him by the governor among others that he should restore to the colonists 50000 head of cattle and 1000 horsesone half to be given up at once the remainder in the course of a year  the deceitful chief was thus ready in his acquiescence simply because he had no intention whatever of fulfilling his engagements  to blind his white enemies the more effectually he himself offered to remain in the camp as a hostage with his followers  two other chiefs kreli and booko also joined him  this seemingly gracious conduct won for hintza so much confidence that orders were immediately given to evacuate his territory  he became the guest of colonel smith and the governor presented him with numerous conciliatory gifts  thereafter the camp was broken up and the governor took his departure  no sooner was his back turned than hintzas people commenced a general massacre of the fingoes  about thirty were murdered in cold blood near to colonel somersets camp  full of indignation when he heard this the governor summoned hintza to his presence and related what had occurred  well and what then was the kafirs cool reply are they not my dogs  sir benjamin met this by giving orders that hintza and all the people with him should be put under guard and held as hostages for the safety of the fingoes  he instantly despatched messengers to stop the carnage and said that if it continued after three hours he would shoot two of hintzas suite for every fingo killed  he added moreover that if he found there was any subterfuge in the message they sentas he had discovered to have been the case in former messageshe would hang hintza kreli and booko on the tree under which they were sitting  in less than ten minutes the messengers of the chiefs were scampering off at full speed in different directions with orders  so potent was the power of this vigorous treatment that within the short time specified the massacre was stopped  but the governor knew well the character of the men with whom he had to deal  to have left the fingoes in their hands after this would have been tantamount to condemning them to suffer the revengeful wrath of their cruel masters who would no doubt have resumed the massacre the instant the troops were withdrawn  sir benjamin therefore collected them together along with the few missionaries and other british subjects who had found temporary refuge at the station of clarkeburg he placed them under the care of the reverend mr ayliffe for whom the fingoes expressed sincere regard and transported the whole body in safety across the kei  an amazing sight observed charlie considine to a knot of his comrades as they reined up on the top of a knoll and watched the long line of fingoes defiling before him like an antediluvian black snake trailing its sinuous course over the land with a little knot of redcoats in front looking like its fiery head and sundry groups of burghers and other troops here and there along its body like particoloured legs and claws  the length of this mighty snake may be estimated when it is said that of the fingo nation not fewer than 2000 men 5600 women and 9200 children with 22000 cattle were led across the kei into the colony at that time  the whole scene with its multitudinous details was a commingling of the ludicrous the touching and the sublime  it was mirthprovoking to observe the wild energy of the coalblack men as they sprang from side to side with shield and assagai driving in refractory cattle the curious nature of the bundles borne by many of the women the frolicking of the larger children and the tottering of the smaller ones whose little black legs seemed quite unequal to the support of their rotund bodies  it was touching to see here and there a stalwart man pick up a tired goat and lay it on his shoulders or relieve a weary woman of her burdenor catch up a stumbling little one that had lost its mother and carry it along in his arms  and it was a sublime thought that this great army was being led like the israelites of old out of worse than egyptian bondage into a christian colony as the adopted sons and daughters of a civilised government  it was in one sense a nation born in a day for the fingoes were destined in after years to become the faithful allies of their white deliverers and the creators of much additional wealth in the colonya raw native material which at that time gladdened and still rejoices the hearts of those missionaries who look to the fingoes with reasonable hope as likely to become in time the bearers of the gospel to their kindred in the wilds of central africa    chapter twenty seven  the fate of the paramount chief of kafirland  meanwhile hintza not having shown sufficient readiness and alacrity in redeeming his promises was held as a hostage in the hands of the white man  he was however treated with the utmost consideration and when he proposed to accompany a division of the troops in order to exercise to the utmost his personal influence in recovering from his people the cattle and horses due and to apprehend the murderers according to treaty he was allowed to do so not only quite free in person but even with his weapons in his hands  colonel smith however who commanded the force distinctly told the chief through an interpreter that if he attempted to escape he would instantly be shot  the force consisted of detachments of the cape mounted rifles the 72nd regiment and the corps of guides350 men in all  towards the afternoon of the day on which they marched a circumstance occurred which justified colonel smiths suspicions as to hintzas sincerity  they had reached a streamlet and encamped when one of the guides reported to him that two kafirs with five head of cattle were near the camp and that hintza on the plea that they would be afraid to approach had sent one of his people to bring them in  on being questioned the chief declined to give any explanation on the subject and the kafirs not only did not come in as they were ordered but made off and carried the horse of hintzas messenger along with them  the suspicion excited by this circumstance was increased by the evasive answers given to the colonels repeated inquiries as to the point on which hintza wished the troops to march  we are going right was the only answer that could be elicited from the taciturn savage  after crossing the range of the guadan hills the troops bivouacked on the guanga and here hintza became more communicative said that he wished them to march towards the mouth of the bashee by a route which he would point out and that they must move at midnight  this was done and they continued to move forward till eight oclock in the morning observing as they went the spoor of numerous herds of cattle that had been driven in that direction quite recently  the men being tired were then halted for refreshment  at this point hintza became particularly uneasy at the vigilance with which he was watched  what have the cattle done he said testily that you should want them and why should my subjects be deprived of them  why do you ask such questions hintza replied colonel smith you know well the many outrages committed on the colonists by your people and the thousands of cattle that have been stolen  it is in redress of these wrongs that we demand them  the chief looked stern but made no rejoinder  he appeared to recover himself however after breakfast and was in high spirits while on the march  he rode a remarkably strong horse that day which he appeared very anxious to spare from fatiguedismounting and leading him up every ascent  as the party advanced the tracks of numerous cattle were still found leading onward but the animals themselves were nowhere to be seen  you see remarked the chief with a touch of sarcasm in his tone as he rode beside the colonel you see how my subjects treat me they drive their cattle from me in spite of me  i do not want your subjects cattle hintza was the colonels pointed reply i want and will have the colonial cattle which they have stolen  then returned the chief allow me to send forward my councillor umtini to tell my people i am here that they must not drive away their cattle and that the cattle of your nation will be alone selected  although it was quite evident that the chief meditated mischief it was thought best to agree to this proposal  accordingly the councillor after being enjoined to return that night which he promised to do mounted and left the camp at full speed accompanied by an attendant  there was ground for uneasiness and much caution in all this for those who knew hintza best were wont to say that he possessed in a high degree all the vices of the savageingratitude avarice cunning and cruelty and his treatment of the traders and missionaries under his protection as well as his secret encouragement of the border chiefs fully bore out their opinion  now exclaimed the chief in high spirits when umtini had left you need not go on to the bashee you will have more cattle than you can drive on the xabecca  the path the troops were passing was a mere cattletrack leading up hill from the bed of the xabecca river among tangled brushwood and occasionally passing through a cleft in the rocks  colonel smith was the only member of the party who rode up the hill hintza and the others led their homes  on drawing near to the summit the chief and his attendants mounted and rode silently but quickly past the colonel into the bushes  one of the guides observing the action called to the colonel who immediately shouted hintza stop  the savage had no intention of stopping but finding himself entangled in the thicket was compelled to return to the track  he did so with such coolness and with such an ingenuous smile that the colonel who had drawn a pistol felt half ashamed of his suspicions and allowed the chief to ride forward as before  at the top of the steep ascent the country was quite open  the xabecca river was seen in front with a few kafir huts on its banks  here the chief set off at full speed in the direction of the huts  colonel smith and three of the guides pursued  the latter were quickly left behind but the colonel being well mounted kept up with the fugitive  spurring on with violence he soon overtook him  stop hintza he shouted  but hintza was playing his last card  he urged his horse to greater exertion and kept stabbing at his pursuer with an assagai  the colonel drew a pistol but it snapped  a second was used with like ill success  he then spurred close up struck the chief with the butt end of the pistol and in so doing dropped it  hintza looked round with a smile of derision and the colonel hurling the other pistol at him struck him on the back of the head  the blow was ineffectual hintza rode on the troops followed as they best could  they were now nearing the huts  at length making a desperate effort the colonel dashed close up to the chief  having now no weapon he seized him by the collar of his kaross or cloak and with a violent effort hurled him to the ground  both horses were going at racing speed  the colonel unable to check his passed on but before he was beyond reach the agile savage had leaped to his feet drawn another assagai from the bundle which he carried and hurled it after his enemy  so good was the aim that the weapon passed within a few inches of the colonels body  the act afforded time to those behind to come up  although hintza turned aside instantly and ran down the steep bank of the xabecca the foremost of the guidesnamed southeygot within gunshot and shouted in the kafir tongue to the chief to stop  no attention being paid to the order he fired and hintza fell wounded in the left leg  leaping up in a moment he resumed his flight when southey fired again and once more the chief was hit and pitched forward but rose instantly and gained the cover of the thicket which lined the bank of the river southey leaped off his horse and gave chase closely followed by lieutenant balfour of the 72nd regiment  the former kept up and the latter down the stream  they had proceeded thus in opposite directions some distance when southey was startled by an assagai striking the cliff on which he was climbing  turning sharply he saw hintzas head and his uplifted arm among the bushes within a few feet of him  the savage was in the act of hurling another assagai  quick as thought the guide levelled his gun and fired  the shot completely shattered the upper part of hintzas skull and next instant a mangled corpse was all that remained of the paramount chief of kafirland    chapter twenty eight  the results of war  peace at last said edwin brook to george dally on arriving at his ravaged and herdless farm in the zuurveld whither george had preceded him  peace is it sir  ah thats well  its about time too for weve got a deal to dohavent we sir  george spoke quite cheerily under the impression that his master required comforting  you see sir weve got to go back pretty well to where we was in 1820 and begin it all over again  it is somewhat aggrawatin  might have been avoided too if theyd kep a few more troops on the frontier  well jack the treaty is signed at last said robert skyd to his brother as he sat on his counter in grahamstown drumming with his heels  not too soon replied john skyd taking a seat on the same convenient lounge  it has cost us something houses burnt all over the settlement from end to end crops destroyed cattle carried off and worst of all trade almost ruinedexcept in the case of lucky fellows like you bob who sell to the troops  war would not have broken out at all returned bob if the kafirs had only been managed with a touch of ordinary common sense in times past our losses are tremendous  just look at the kafir trade which last year i believe amounted to above 40000 poundsthats crushed out altogether in the meantime and wont be easily revived  kafirs in hundreds were beginning to discard their dirty karosses and to buy blankets handkerchiefs flannels baize cotton knives axes and what not while the traders had set up their stores everywhere in kafirland to say nothing of your own business jack in the gum ivory and shooting way and our profits thereon  we were beginning to flourish so well too as a colony  i believe that weve been absorbing annually somewhere about 150000 pounds worth of british manufactured articles not to mention other things and nowoh jack mankind is a monstrous idiot  peace comes too late for us gertie said hans marais to his wife on their return to the old homestead on the karroo which presented nothing but a blackened heap of dry mud bricks and charred timbers herds and flocks gonedreary silence in possessionthe very picture of desolation  better late than never remarked charlie considine sadly  we must just set to work restock and rebuild  not so difficult to do so as it might have been however owing to that considerate uncle of mine were better off than some of our poor neighbours who have nothing to fall back upon  they say that more than 3000 persons have been reduced to destitution 500 farmhouses have been burnt and pillaged 900 horses 55000 sheep and goats and above 30000 head of cattle carried off only a few of which were recovered by colonel smith on that expedition when hintza was killed  however well keep up heart and go to work with a willshant we my little wife  berthanow bertha considinewho leaned on charlies arm spoke not with her lips but she lifted her bright blue eyes and with these orbs of light declared her thorough belief in the wisdom of what ever charlie might say or do  they say its all settled cried jerry goldboy hastily entering kenneth mctavishs stable  whats all settled demanded sandy black  peace with the kafirs said jerry  peace wi the kawfirs echoed sandy in a slightly contemptuous tone hm they should never hae had war wi them jerry my man  but aving ad it aint it well that its hover returned jerry  its cost us a bonnie penny rejoined black  nae doot glen lynden has come off better than ither places for weve managed to haud oor ain no that ill but waes me for the puir folk o the low country  an ill be bound the imperial treasuryll smart fort  see note 1 but its an ill wind that blaws nae gude  weve taken a gude slice o land frae the thievin craters for its said sir benjamin durban has annexed all the country between the kei and the keiskamma to the colony  a most needfu addition for the jungles o the great fish river or the buffalo were jist fortresses where the kawfirs played hideanseek wi the settlers an its as plain as the nose on my face that peace wi them is not possible till theyre driven across the keithat bein a defensible boundary  so they say that peace is proclaimed said stephen orpin to a pretty young woman who had recently put it out of his power to talk of his bachelor home at salem  jessie mctavish had taken pity on him at last  indeed replied jessie with a halfdisappointed look then i suppose youll be going off again on your long journeys into the interior and leaving me to pine here in solitude  that depends returned orpin on how you treat me  perhaps i may manage to find my work nearer home than i did in days gone by  at all events ill not go into kafirland just now for its likely to remain in an unsettled state for many a day  it has been a sad and useless war and has cost us a heavy price  think jessie of the lives lost fortyfour of our people murdered during the invasion and eightyfour killed and thirty wounded during the war  people will say that is nothing to speak of compared with losses in other wars but i dont care for comparisons i think only of the numbers of our people and of the hundreds of wretched kafirs who have been cut off in their prime and sent to meet their judge  but there has been one trophy of the war at which i look with rejoicing 15000 fingoes rescued from slavery is something to be thankful for  god can bring good out of evil  it may be that he will give me employment in that direction ere long  these various remarks good reader were uttered some months after the events recorded in the last chapter for the death of the great chief of kafirland did not immediately terminate the war  on the contrary the treaty of peace entered into with kreli hintzas son and successor was scouted by the confederate chiefs tyali macomo etcetera who remained still unsubdued in the annexed territory and both there and within the old frontier continued to commit murders and widespread depredations  it was not until the kafirs had been hunted by our troops into the most impregnable of their woody fortresses and fairly brought to bay that the chiefs sent messengers to solicit peace  it was granted  a treaty of peace was entered into by which the kafirs gave up all right to the country conquered and consented to hold their lands under tenure from the british sovereign  it was signed at fort wilshire in september  thereafter sir benjamin durban laid down with great wisdom and ability plans for the occupation and defence of the annexed territory so as to form a real obstruction to future raids by the lawless nativesplans which if carried out would no doubt have prevented future wars and on the strength of which the farmers began to return to their desolated farms and commence rebuilding and restocking with indomitable resolution  others accepted offers of land in the new territory and a few of the dutch farmers hoping for better times and still trusting to british wisdom for protection were prevailed on to remain in the colony at a time when many of their kindred were moving off in despair of being either protected understood or fairly represented  among these still trusting ones was conrad marais  strongly urged by hans and considine he consented to begin life anew in the old home and went vigorously to work with his stout sons  but he had barely begun to get the place into something like order when a shell was sent into the colony which created almost as much dismay as if it had been the precursor of another kafir invasion  conrad was seated in a friends house in somerset when the said shell exploded  it came in the form of a newspaper paragraph  he looked surprised on reading the first line or two then a dark frown settled on his face which as he read on became pale while his compressed lips twitched with suppressed passion  finishing the paragraph he crushed the newspaper up in his hand and thrusting it into his pocket hastened to the stable where he saddled his horse  leaping on its back as if he had been a youth of twenty he drove the spur into its flanks and galloped away at full speedaway over the dusty road leading from somerset to the hills away over the ridge that separates it from the level country beyond and away over the brown karroo until at last covered with dust and flecked with foam he drew up at his own door and burst in upon the family  they were concluding their evening meal  read that he cried flinging down the paper throwing himself into a chair and bringing his fist down on the table with a crash that set cups and glasses dancing  there he added pointing to the paragraph as hans took up the paperthat despatch from lord glenelgthe british colonial secretaryat the top of the column  read it aloud boy  hans read as follows  in the conduct which was pursued towards the kafir nation by the colonists and the public authorities of the colony through a long series of years the kafirs had ample justification of the late war they had to resent and endeavour justly though impotently to avenge a series of encroachments they had a perfect right to hazard the experiment however hopeless of extorting by force that redress which they could not expect otherwise to obtain and the claim of sovereignty over the new province must be renounced  it rests upon a conquest resulting from a war in which as far as i am at present enabled to judge the original justice is on the side of the conquered not of the victorious party  mark that cried conrad starting to his feet when hans had finished and speaking loud as if he were addressing the assembled colony instead of the amazed members of his own familymark that the claim of sovereignty over the new province must be renounced  so it seems that the kafirs are not only to be patted on the back for having acted the part of cattlelifters for years but are to be invited back to their old haunts to begin the work over again and necessitate another war  he stopped abruptly as if to check words that ought not to be uttered there was a momentary silence in the group as they looked at each other it was broken by conrad saying to his youngest son in a voice of forced calmness  go lad get me a fresh horse  i will rouse the dutchafrican farmers all over the colony  the land is too hot to hold us  we cannot hope to find rest under the union jack  we can sympathise strongly with the violent indignation of the honest dutchman for in good truth not only he and his kindred but all the people of the colony were most unjustly blamed and unfairly treated by the government of that day  nevertheless conrad was wrong about the union jack  the wisest of plans are open to the insidious entrance of error  the fairest flag may be stained by unworthy bearers with occasional prostitution  a secretary of state is not the british nation nor is he even at all times a true representative of british feeling  many a deed of folly and sometimes of darkness has unhappily been perpetrated under the protection of the union jack but that does not alter the great historical fact that truth justice fairplay and freedom have flourished longer and better under its ample folds than under any other flag that flies on the face of the whole earth  but conrad marais was not in a position to consider this just then  the boy who is writhing under the lash of a temporarily insane father is not in a position to reflect that in the main his father is or means to be just kind loving and true  conrad bolted a hasty supper mounted the fresh steed and galloped away to rouse his kindred  and he proved nearly as good as his word  he roused many of them to join him in his intended expatriation and many more did not need rousing  some had brooded over their wrongs until they began to smoulder and when they were told that the unprovoked raid of the kafir thieves was deemed justifiable by the government which ought to have protected their frontier but had left them to protect themselves the fire burst into a flame and the great exodus began in earnest  thus a second time did conrad and his family with many others take to the wilderness  on this occasion the party included hans and charlie considine with their families  there was still wanting however that last straw which renders a burden intolerable  it was laid on at the time when slavery was abolished  the abolition act was carried into effect on the 1st december 1834 at which time the accursed system of slavery was virtually brought to an end in the colony though the slaves were not finally freed from all control till 1838  but the glory of this noble work was sullied not a little by the unjust manner in which during these four years the details relative to the payment of compensation to slaveowners were carried out  we cannot afford space here to go into these details suffice it to say that as one of the consequences many families in the colony were ruined and a powerful impulse was given to the exodus which had already begun  the leading dutchafrican families in oliphants hock gamtoos river along the fish river and somerset sold their farmsin many cases at heavy loss or for merely nominal sums crossed the border and bade a final adieu to the land of their fathers these were followed by other bands among whom were men of wealth and education from graaffreinet uitenhage and albany until a mighty host had hived off into the far north  through many a month of toil and trouble did this host pass while traversing the land of the savage in scattered bands  many a sad reverse befell them  some were attacked and cut off some defended themselves with heroism and passed on defying the kafirs to arrest their progress until at last they reached the distant lands on which their hearts were setand there they settled down to plough and sow to reap and hunt and build but always with arms at hand for the savage was ever on the watch to take them at a disadvantage or unawares  thus were laid the foundations of the colony of natal the orange free state and the transvaal republic    note 1  the war of 18846 cost the treasury 800000 pounds and the colonists lost in houses stock etcetera 288625 pounds    chapter twenty nine  the last  with peace came prosperity  this was not indeed very obvious at first for it took a long time to reconcile the unfortunates of the eastern provinces to their heavy losses and a still longer time to teach them to forget  nevertheless from this time forward the march of the settlers of 1820 commercially intellectually and religiously became steady regular and rapid  no doubt they suffered one or two grievous checks as years rolled on again and again they had to fight the kafir savage and drive him back into his native jungles and each time they had more trouble in doing so than before because the kafir was an apt pupil and learned to substitute the gun for the assagai but he did not learn to substitute enlightened vigour for blind passion therefore the white man beat him as before  he did more than that  he sought to disarm the savage and to a large extent succeeded  he disarmed him of ignorance by such means as the lovedale missionary institution near alice the institution near healdtown and other seminariesas well as by mission stations of french dutch reformed wesleyan english and scotch churches scattered all over kafirland he taught the savage that the fear of the lord is the beginning of wisdom and that industry is the highroad to prosperity  some of the black men accepted these truths others rejected them  precisely the same may be said of white men all over the world  those who accepted became profitable to themselves and the community  those who rejected continued slaves to themselves and a nuisance to everybody  again we remark that the same may be said of white men everywhere  white unbelievers continued to pronounce the red kafir an irreclaimable savage fit for nothing but coercion and the lash  black unbelievers continued to curse the white man as being unworthy of any better fate than being driven into the sea and between the two missionaries and christians both black and white had a hard time of it but they did not give in for though greatly disheartened at times they remembered that they were soldiers of the cross and as such were bound to endure hardness  moreover missionaries and christians of all colours and kinds doubtless remembered their own sins and errors  being imperfect men they had in some casesthrough prejudice and ignorance but never through designhelped the enemy a little or if they did not remember these errors and aims they were pretty vigorously reminded of them by white opponents and no doubt the thought of this humbled them to some extent and enabled them to bow more readily to chastisement  then they braced themselves anew for the gospelfightthe only warfare on earth that is certain to result in blessing to both the victors and the vanquished  if any of the missionaries held with lord glenelg in his unwise reversal of the good sir benjamin durbans kafir policy they must have had the veil removed from their eyes when that nobleman himself confessed his error with a candour that said much for his heart reversed his own decrees and fell back upon that very plan which at first he had condemned in such ungenerous terms  his recantation could not however recall the thousands of dutchafrican farmers whom he helped to expatriate  perhaps it was well that it should be so for good came out of this evilnamely the reclamation of vast tracts of the most beautiful and fertile regions of the earth from the dominion of darkness and cruelty  but what of those whose fortunes we have been following during this period of peace and prosperity  some of them remained in the colony helped on these blessings and enjoyed them  others casting in their lot with the wanderers fought the battles and helped to lay the foundations of the new colonies  first charlie considine  that fortunate manhaving come into the possession of a considerable sum of money through the uncle who had turned out so much better than he should be and having become possessed of a huge family of sons and daughters through that gertie whom he styled the sugar of his existencesettled in natal along with his friends hans and conrad marais  when that fertile and warm region was taken possession of by the british he refused to hive off with the marais and continued to labour there in the interests of truth mercy and justice to the end of his days  junkie brook with that vigour of character which had asserted itself on the squally day of his nativity joined frank dobson and john skyd in a hunting expedition beyond the great orange river and when the orange free state was set up by the emigrant dutchmen he and his friends established there a branch of the flourishing house of dobson skyd and company  being on the spot when south africa was electrified by the discovery in 186667 of the diamond fields of that region they sent their sons whose name was legion to dig and soon became diamond merchants of the first water so that when junkie visited his aged parents on the zuurveldwhich he often didhe usually appeared with his pockets full of precious stones  ive found a diamond this time nurse he said on the occasion of one of these visits which is as bigohasas an ostrichegg  see here it is and he laid on the table a diamond which if not quite as big as the egg of the giant bird was large enough to enable him with what he had previously earned to retire comfortably from the business in favour of his eldest son  the sudden acquisition of riches in this way was by no means uncommon at that time for the fields were amazingly prolific and having been discovered at a crisis of commercial depression were the means not only of retrieving the fortunes of south africa but of advancing her to a condition of hitherto unparalleled prosperity  mrs scholtzby that time grown unreasonably fateyed the diamond with a look of amused contempt she evidently did not believe in it  patting the hand of her former charge she looked up in his laughing face and said with a shake of her head  ah  junkie i always said you was a wonderful child  sitting on a bench in front of the houseno longer domestics but smoking their pipes there as friends of the family who had raised themselves to a state of comparative affluencegeorge dally and scholtz now aged men commented on the same diamond  itll make his fortune said george  zee boy vas always lucky remarked scholtz zince i began to varm for myself i have not zeen so big a stone  ah  scholtz returned his friend the hotel business has done very well for me an i dont complain but if i was young again id sell off and have a slap at the fields  zat vould only prove you vas von fool said scholtz quietly  i believe it would returned george  in regard to the scotch party at glen lynden we have to record that they continued to persevere and prosper  wool became one of the staple articles of colonial commerce and the hills of the baviaans river sent a large contingent of that article to the flourishing seaport of the eastern provinces  of course the people multiplied and the sturdy sons of the south african highlands did credit to their sires both in the matter of warring with the kafir and farming on the hills  sandy black stuck to his farm with the perseverance of a true scot and held his own through thick and thin  he married a wife also and when in later years the native blacks made a sudden descent on his homestead they were repulsed by a swarm of white blacks assisted by an army of mctavishes and chased over the hills with a degree of energy that caused them almost to look blue  andrew rivers being a man of progressive and independent mind cast about him in a state of uncertainty for some years devoting himself chiefly to hunting until the value of ostrich feathers had induced farsighted men to domesticate the giant bird and take to farming ostrichesincubating them by artificial as well as natural means  then rivers became an ostrichfarmer  he was joined in this enterprise by jerry goldboy and the two ultimately bought a farm on the karroo and settled down  rivers had a turn for engineering and set himself to form a huge dam to collect rain near his dwelling  from this reservoir he drew forth constant supplies not only to water flocks and herds but to create a garden in the karroo which soon glowed with golden fruit  in this he set a good example which has been followed with great success by many men of enterprise in those regions and there is no doubt we think that if such dams were multiplied artesian wells sunk and railways run into the karroos those fine though comparatively barren regions of south africa would soon begin to blossom like the rose  thus what between ostrich feathers wool horses cattle and enterprise rivers and goldboy made themselves comfortable  like other men of sense they married  thereafter the garden had to be considerably enlarged for the golden fruit created by the streams which had been collected and stored by rivers proved quite inadequate to the supply of those oceans of babies and swarms of goldboys that flooded the karroo and filled its solitudes with shouts and yells that would have done credit to the wildest tribe of reddest kafirs in the land  some of these descendants becoming men of energy with roving dispositions like their sires travelled into the far north and west and helped to draw forth the copper ore and to open the mines of great namaqualandthus aiding in the development of south africas inexhaustible treasurehouse while others of them especially the sons of jerry went into the regions of the transvaal republic and there proved themselves goldboys in very truth by successfully working the now celebrated goldfields of that region  stephen orpin did not give up trade but he prosecuted it with less and less vigour as time went on and at last merely continued it as a means of enabling him to prosecute the great object of his life the preaching of the gospel not merely to those whom men style par excellence the heathen but to every one who was willing to listen to the good news redemption from sin  ah there was great fervour in stephen orpins tones when he said as he often didmen and women i do not come here to make you good which in the estimation of more than one half of the socalled christian world means goody  my desire is to open your eyes to see jesus the saviour from sin  who among youexcept the youngdoes not know the power of sin our inability to restrain bad and vicious habits our passionate desire to do what we know is wrong our frequent falling from courses that we know to be right  it is not that hell frightens us it is not that heaven fails to attract us these ideas trouble us littletoo little  it is present misery that torments  we long and desire to have but cannot obtain we fight and strive but do not succeed or it may be we do succeed and discover success to be failure for we are disappointed and then feel a tendency towards apathetic indifference  if however our consciences be awakened then the torment takes another form  we are tempted powerfully and cannot resist  we cannot subdue our passions we cannot restrain our tempers  no wonder  has not god said greater is he who ruleth his own spirit than he who taketh a city  the greatest conqueror is not so great as he who conquers himself  what then  is there no deliverance from sin  yes there is  sin shall not have dominion over you are the words of him who also said come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden and i will give you rest  stephen orpin cried a sturdy sinner in whose ears these words were preached do you know all that to be true  can you speak from experience of this deliverance this rest  yes cried stephen starting up with a sudden impulse i do know itpartly by some deliverances that have been wrought for me partly from some degree of rest attained to and much very much from the firm assurance i have that but for gods forbearing and restraining mercy i should have been a lost soul long long ago  man wherein i have failed in obtaining deliverance and rest it has been owing to my sin not to failure in the lords faithfulness  but stephen did not travel so far or so long as had been his wont in days gone by  a wife and family in the village of salem exercised an attractive influence fastening him as it were to a fixed point and converting his former erratic orbit into a circle which with centripetal force was always drawing nearer to its centre  in the course of his early wanderings orpin managed to search out ruyter the hottentot robber and so influenced him as to induce him to give up his lawless career and return to the colony  ruyter drew with him abdul jemalee booby the bushman and one or two others who settled down to peaceful occupations  the malay in particularslavery being by that time abolishedreturned to capetown and there found his amiable wife and loving children ready to receive him with open arms  it is true the wife was somewhat aged like himself and his children were grown upsome of them even marriedbut these little matters weighed nothing in his mind compared with the great glorious fact that he was reunited to them in a land where he might call his body his own  if jemalee had been a man of much observation he might have noted that many important changes had taken place in capetown and its surroundings during his long absence  a new south african college had been erected a library which might now stand in the front rank of the worlds libraries had been collected the freedom of the press had been largely taken advantage of and education generally was being prosecuted with a degree of rigour that argued well for the future of the colony especially in stellenbosch wellington and neighbouring places  but abdul jemalee was not a man of observation  he did not care a straw for these things and although we should like much to enlarge on them as well as on other topics we must hold our handfor the new and eastern not the old and western provinces of south africa claim our undivided attention in this tale  there is no necessary antagonism however between these twoeast and west  circumstances and men have at present thrown a few apples of discord into them just as was the case with england and scotland of old with the north and south in the united states of late but doubtless these apples and every other source of discord will be removed in the course of time and south africa will ere long become a united whole with a united religious and commercial people under one flag animated by one desirethe advancement of truth and righteousness among themselves as well as among surrounding savagesand extending in one grand sweep of unbroken fertility from the cape of good hope to the equator  the end
