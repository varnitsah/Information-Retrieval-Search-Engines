retraced my steps and taken my place once more amongst the throng of people who stood about in the entresol exchanging greetings and waiting for their carriages a backward glance as i had been about to turn into the place de lopera had arrested my somewhat hurried departure the night was young and where else was such a sight to be seen besides was it not amongst some such throng as this that the end of my search might come  i took up my place just inside close to one of the pillars and with an unlit cigarette still in my mouth watched the flying chausseurs the medley of vehicles outside the soft flow of women in their white opera cloaks and jewels who with their escorts came streaming down the stairs and out of the great building to enter the waiting carriages and motorcars drawn up in the privileged space within the enclosure or stretching right down into the boulevard i stood there watching them drive off one by one i was borne a little nearer to the door by the rush of people and i was able in most cases to hear the directions of the men as they followed their womankind into the waiting vehicles in nearly every case their destination was one of the famous restaurants music begets hunger in most capitals and the cafes of paris are never so full as after a great night at the opera tonight there had been a wonderful performance the flow of people down the stairs seemed interminable young women and oldsleepylooking beauties of the southern type whose dark eyes seemed half closed with a languor partly passionate partly of pride women of the truer french typebrilliant smiling vivacious mostly pale seldom goodlooking always attractive a few germans a fair sprinkling of englishwomen and a larger proportion still of americans whose women were the best dressed of the whole company i was not sorry that i had returned it was worth watching this endless stream of varying types  towards the end there came out two people who were becoming almost familiar figures to me the man was one of those whose nationality was not so easily surmised he was tall and thin with irongray hair complexion so sallow as to be almost yellow black moustache and imperial handsome in his way distinguished indescribable by his side was a girl who had the air of wearing her first long skirt whose hair was arranged in somewhat juvenile fashion and whose dark eyes were still glowing with the joy of the music her figure though very slim was delightful and she walked as though her feet touched the clouds her laugh which i heard distinctly as she brushed by me only a few feet away was like music of all the people who had passed me or whom i had come across during my fortnights stay in paris there was no one half so attractive the girl was absolutely charming the man remarkable not only in himself but for a certain air of repressed emotion which while it robbed his features of the dignity of repose was still in a way fascinating they entered a waiting motorcar splendidly appointed and i heard the man tell the tall liveried footman to drive to the ritz i leaned forward a little eagerly as they went i watched the car glide off and disappear watched it until it was out of sight and afterwards even watched the spot where it had vanished then with a little sigh i turned back once more into the great hall there seemed to be no one left now of any interest the women had become ordinary the men impossible with a little sigh i too aimlessly descended the steps and stood for a moment uncertain which way to turn  monsieur is looking for a light a quiet voice said in my ear  i turned and found myself confronted by a frenchman who had also just issued from the building and was himself lighting a cigarette he was cleanshaven and pale so pale that his complexion was almost olive he had soft curiouslooking eyes he was of medium height dark correctly dressed according to the fashion of his country although his tie was black and his studs of unusual size something about his face struck me from the first as familiar but for the moment i could not recall having seen him before  thank you very much i answered accepting the match which he offered  the night was clear and breathlessly still the full yellow moon was shining in an absolutely cloudless sky the matchan english wax one by the wayburned without a flicker i lit my cigarette and turning around found my companion still standing by my side  monsieur does not do me the honor to recollect me he remarked with a faint smile  i looked at him steadfastly  i am sorry i said your face is perfectly familiar to me and yetno by jove i have it i broke off with a little laugh its louis isnt it from the milan  monsieurs memory has soon returned he answered smiling i have been chief maitre dhotel in the cafe there for some years the last time i had the honor of serving monsieur there was only a few weeks ago  i remembered him perfectly now i remembered even the occasion of my last visit to the cafe louis with upraised hat seemed as though he would have passed on but curiously enough i felt a desire to continue the conversation i had not as yet admitted the fact even to myself but i was bored weary of my search weary to death of my own company and the company of my own acquaintances i was reluctant to let this little man go  you visit paris often i asked  but naturally monsieur louis answered accepting my unspoken invitation by keeping pace with me as we strolled towards the boulevard once every six weeks i come over here i go to the ritz paillards the cafe de paristo the others also it is an affair of business of course one must learn how the frenchman eats and what he eats that one may teach the art  but you are a frenchman yourself louis i remarked  but monsieur he answered i live in london voila tout one cannot write menus there for long and succeed one needs inspiration  and you find it here i asked  louis shrugged his shoulders  paris monsieur he answered is my home it is always a pleasure to me to see smiling faces to see men and women who walk as though every footstep were taking them nearer to happiness have you never noticed monsieur he continued the difference they do not plod here as do your english people there is a buoyancy in their footsteps a mirth in their laughter an expectancy in the way they look around as though adventures were everywhere i cannot understand it but one feels it directly one sets foot in paris  i noddeda little bitterly perhaps  it is temperament i answered we may envy but we cannot acquire it  it seems strange to see monsieur alone here louis remarked in london it is always so different monsieur has so many acquaintances  i was silent for a moment  i am here in search of some one i told louis it isnt a very pleasant mission and the memory of it is always with me  a search louis repeated thoughtfully paris is a large place monsieur  on the contrary i answered it is small enough if a man will but play the game a man who knows his paris must be in one of halfadozen places some time during the day  it is true louis admitted yet monsieur has not been successful  it has been because some one has warned the man of whom i am in search i declared  there are worse places he remarked in which one might be forced to spend ones time  in theory excellent louis i said in practice i am afraid i cannot agree with you so far i declared gloomily my pilgrimage has been an utter failure i cannot meet i cannot hear of the man who i know was flaunting it before the world three weeks ago  louis shrugged his shoulders  monsieur can do no more than seek he remarked for the rest one may leave many burdens behind in the train at the gare du nord  i shook my head  one cannot acquire gayety by only watching other people who are gay i declared paris is not for those who have anxieties louis if ever i were suffering from melancholia for instance i should choose some other place for a visit  louis laughed softly  ah monsieur he answered you could not choose better there is no place so gay as this no place so full of distractions  i shrugged my shoulders  it is your native city i reminded him  that goes for nothing louis answered where i live there always i make my native city i have lived in vienna and berlin budapest and palermo florence and london it is not an affair of the place yet of all these if one seeks it there is most distraction to be found here monsieur does not agree with me he added glancing into my face there is one thing more which i would tell him perhaps it is the explanation paris the very home of happiness and gayety is also the loneliest and the saddest city in the world for those who go alone  there is truth in what you say louis i admitted  the very fact he continued slowly that all the world amuses itself all the world is gay here makes the solitude of the unfortunate who has no companion a thing more triste more keenly to be felt monsieur is alone  i am alone i admitted except for the companions of chance whom one meets everywhere  we had been walking for some time slowly side by side and we came now to a standstill louis held up his hand and called a taximeter  monsieur goes somewhere to sup without a doubt he remarked  i remained upon the pavement  really i dont know i answered undecidedly there is a great deal of truth in what you have been saying a man alone here especially at night seems to be looked upon as a sort of pariah women laugh at him men pity him it is only the englishman they think who would do so foolish a thing  louis hesitated there was a peculiar smile at the corners of his lips which i did not quite understand  if monsieur would honor me he said apologetically i am going tonight to visit one or perhaps two of the smallest restaurants up in the montmartre they are by way of being fashionable now and they tell me that there is an homard speciale with a new sauce which must be tasted at the abbaye  all the apology in louis tone was wasted it troubled me not in the least that my companion should be a maitre dhotel i did not hesitate for a second  ill come with pleasure louis i said on condition that i am host it is very good of you to take pity upon me we will take this taximeter shall we  louis bowed once more i fancied that there was something in his face which i did not altogether understand  it is an honor monsieur he said we will start then with the abbaye     chapter ii  a cafe in paris   the paris taximeters are good and our progress was rapid we passed through the crowded streets where the women spread themselves out like beautiful butterflies where the electric lights were deadened by the brilliance of the moon where men bent double over the handles of their bicycles shot hither and thither with great paper lanterns alight in front of them we passed into the quieter streets though even here the wayfarers whom we met were obviously bent on pleasure up the hill till at last we pulled up at one of the bestknown restaurants in the locality here louis was welcomed as a prince the manager with many exclamations and gesticulations shook hands with him like a longlost brother the maitres dhotel all came crowding up for a word of greeting a table in the best part of the room which was marked reserve was immediately made ready champagne already in its pail of ice was by our side almost before we had taken our places  i had been here a few nights before alone and had found the place uninspiring enough tonight except that louis told me the names of many of the people and that the supper was the best meal which i had eaten in paris i was very little more amused the nigger the spanish dancinggirl with her rolling eyes the english musichall singer with her unmistakable lancashire accent went through the same performance the gowns of the women were wonderfulmore wonderful still their hats their gold purses the costly trifles which they carried a woman by our side sat looking into a tiny pocketmirror of gold studded with emeralds powdering her face the while with a powderpuff to match in the centre of which were more emeralds large and beautifully cut louis noticed my scrutiny  the wealth of france he whispered in my ear is spent upon its women what the englishman spends at his club or on his sports the frenchman spends upon his womankind even the bourgeoisie who hold their money with clenched fists like that he gesticulated striking the table for their women they spend spend freely they do all this and the great thing which they ask in return is that they are amused after all monsieur he continued they are logical what a man wants most in life in the intervals between his work is amusement it is amusement that keeps him young keeps him in health it is his womankind who provide that amusement  and if one does not happen to be married to a frenchwoman  louis nodded sympathetically  monsieur is feeling like that he said as he sipped his wine thoughtfully yes it is very plain yet monsieur is not always sad i have seen him often at my restaurant the guest or the host of many pleasant parties there is a change since those days a change indeed i noticed it when i ventured to address monsieur on the steps of the opera house  i remained gloomily silent it was one thing to avail myself of the society of a very popular little maitre dhotel holiday making in his own capital and quite another to take him even a few steps into my confidence so i said nothing but my eyes which travelled around the room were weary  after all louis continued helping himself to a cigarette what is there in a place like this to amuse we are not americans or tourists the montmartre is finished the novelists and the storytellers have killed it the women come here because they love to show their jewelry to flirt with the men the men come because their womankind desire it and because it is their habit but for the rest there is nothing the true parisian may come here perhaps once or twice a yearno more for the man of the worldsuch as you and i monsieurthese places do not exist  i glanced at my companion a little curiously there was something in his manner distinctly puzzling with his lips he was smiling approval at the little danseuse who was pirouetting near our table but it seemed to me that his mind was busy with other thoughts suddenly he turned his head toward mine  monsieur must remember he said quietly that a place like this is as the froth on our champagne it is all show it exists and it passes away this very restaurant may be unknown in a years timea beer palace for the germans a den of absinthe and fiery brandy for the cochers it is for the tourists for the happy ladies of the world that such a place exists for those who need other thingsother things exist  go on louis i said quietly you have something in your mind what is it  he shrugged his shoulders  i think he said slowly that i could take monsieur somewhere where he would be more entertained there is nothing to do there nothing to see little music but it is a placeit has an atmosphere it is different i cannot explain monsieur would understand if he were there  then for heavens sake let us pay our bill and go i exclaimed we have both had enough of this at any rate  louis did not immediately reply i turned aroundwe were sitting side by sidewondering at his lack of response what i saw startled me the mans whole expression had changed his mouth had come together with a new firmness a frown which i had never seen before had darkened his forehead his eyes had become little points of light i realized then perhaps for the first time their peculiar colora sort of green tinged with gray he presented the appearance of a man of intelligence and acumen who is thinking deeply over some matter of vital importance  well what is it louis i asked are you repenting of your offer already dont you want to take me to this other place  it is not that monsieur louis answered softly only i was wondering if i had been a little rash  rash i repeated  louis nodded his head slowly but he paused for several moments before speaking  i was only wondering said he whether after all it would amuse you there is nothing to be seen not so much as here afterwards perhaps you might regretyou might think that i had done wrong in not telling you certain things about the place which must remain secret  we will risk that i answered rising let me come with you and i will judge for myself  louis followed my example but i fancied that i still detected a slight unwillingness in his movements my request for the bill had been met with a smile and a polite shake of the head louis whispered in my ear that we were the guests of the managementthat it would not be correct to offer the money for our entertainment so i was forced to content myself with tipping the headwaiter and the vestiaire the chausseur who opened the door and the tall commissionnaire who welcomed us upon the pavement and whistled for a petite voiture  where to messieurs the man asked as the carriage drew up  even then louis hesitated he was sitting on the side of the carriage nearest to the pavement and he rose to his feet as the question was asked it seemed to me that he almost whispered the address into the ear of the coachman at any rate i heard nothing of it the man nodded and turned eastward  bon soir messieurs the commissionnaire called out with his hat in his hand  bon soir i answered with my eyes fixed upon the flaring lights of the boulevard towards which we had turned     chapter iii  delora   i found louis during that short drive most unaccountably silent several times i made casual remarks once or twice i tried to learn from him what sort of a place this was to which we were bound he answered me only in monosyllables i was conscious all the time of a certain subtle but unmistakable change in his manner up to the moment of his suggesting this expedition he had remained the suave perfectly mannered superior servant accepted into equality for a time by one of his clients and very careful not to presume in any way upon his position it is not snobbish to say this because it was the truth louis was chief maitre dhotel at one of the best restaurants in london i was an exofficer in a cavalry regiment brother of the earl of welmington with a moderate income and a more than moderate idea of how to spend it louis was servant and i was master it had pleased me to make a companion of him for a short time and his manner had been a perfect acknowledgment of our relative positions and now it seemed to me that there was a change louis had become more like a man less like a waiter there was a strength in his face which i had not previously observed a darkening anxiety which puzzled me he treated my few remarks with scant courtesy he was obviously thinking about something else it seemed as though for some inexplicable reason he had already repented of his suggestion  look here louis i said you seem a little bothered about taking me to this place perhaps they do not care about strangers there i am not at all keen really and i am afraid i am not fit company for anybody better drop me here and go on by yourself i can amuse myself all right at some of these little outoftheway places until i feel inclined to go home  louis turned and looked at me for a moment i thought that he was going to accept my offer he opened his mouth but said nothing he looked away into the darkness once more and then back into my face by this time i knew that he had made up his mind he was more like himself again  monsieur rotherby he said if i have hesitated at all it was for your sake you are a gentleman of great position afterwards you might feel sorry to think that you had been in such a place or in such company  i patted him on the shoulder reassuringly  my dear louis said i you need have no such fears about me i am a little of an adventurer a little of a bohemian there is no one else who has a claim upon my life and i do as i please cant you tell me a little more about this mysterious cafe  there is so little to tell louis said of one thing i can assure youyou will be disappointed there is no music no dancing the interest is only in the people who go there and their lives it may be he continued thoughtfully that you will not find them much different from all the others  but there is a difference louis i asked  wait he answered you shall see  the cab pulled up in front of a very ordinarylooking cafe in a side street leading from one of the boulevards louis dismissed the man and looked for a moment or two up and down the pavement his caution appeared to be quite needless for the thoroughfare was none too well lit and it was almost empty then he entered the cafe motioning me to follow him  dont look around too much he whispered there are many people here who do not care to be spied upon  my first glance into the place was disappointing i was beginning to lose faith in louis after all it seemed to me that the end of our adventure would be ordinary enough that i should find myself in one of those places which the touting guides of the boulevard speak of in bated breath which one needs to be very young indeed to find interesting even for a moment the ground floor of the cafe through which we passed was like a thousand others in different parts of paris the floor was sanded the people were of the lower ordersroughlooking men drinking beer or sipping cordials women from whom one instinctively looked away and whose shrill laughter was devoid of a single note of music it was all very flat very uninteresting but louis led the way through a swing door to a staircase and then pushing his way through some curtains along a short passage to another door against which he softly knocked with his knuckles it was opened at once and a commissionnaire stood gazing stolidly out at us a commissionnaire in the usual sort of uniform but one of the most powerfullooking men whom i had ever seen in my life  there are no tables monsieur in the restaurant he said at once there is no place at all  louis looked at him steadily for a moment it seemed to me that although i was unable to discern anything of the sort some sign must have passed between them at any rate without any protest or speech of any sort from louis the commissionnaire saluted and stood back  but your friend monsieur he asked  it will be arranged louis answered in a low tone we shall speak to monsieur carvin  we were in a dark sort of entresol and at that moment a further door was opened and one caught the gleam of lights and the babel of voices a man came out of the room and walked rapidly toward us he was of middle height and dressed in ordinary morning clothes wearing a black tie with a diamond pin his lips were thick he had a slight tawny moustache and a cast in one eye he held out both his hands to louis  dear louis he exclaimed it is good to see you  louis drew him to one side and they talked for a few moments in a rapid undertone more than once the manager of the restaurant for such i imagined him to be glanced towards me and i was fairly certain that i formed the subject of their conversation when it was finished louis beckoned and we all three turned towards the door together louis in the centre  this he said to me is monsieur carvin the manager of the cafe des deux epingles he has been explaining to me how difficult it is to find even a corner in his restaurant but there will be a small table for us  monsieur carvin bowed  for any friend of louis he said one would do much but indeed monsieur people seem to find my little restaurant interesting and it is alas so very small  we entered the room almost as he spoke it was larger than i had expected to find it and the style of its decorations and general appearance were absolutely different from the cafe below the coloring was a little sombre for a french restaurant and the illuminations a little less vivid the walls however were panelled with what seemed to be a sort of dark mahogany and on the ceiling was painted a great allegorical picture the nature of which i could not at first surmise the guests of whom the room was almost full were all welldressed and apparently of the smart world the tourist element was lacking there were a few men there in morning clothes but these were dressed with the rigid exactness of the frenchman who often from choice affects this style of toilet from the first i felt that the place possessed an atmosphere i could not describe it but quite apart from louis few words concerning it i knew that it had a clientele of its own and that within its four walls were gathered together people who were in some way different from the butterfly crowd who haunt the night cafes in paris monsieur carvin himself led us to a small table against the wall and not far inside the room the vestiaire relieved us of our coats and hats a suave maitre dhotel bent over us with suggestions for supper and an attendant sommelier waited by his side monsieur carvin waved them away  the gentlemen have probably supped he remarked a bottle of the pommery gout anglais and some biscuits is that right louis  we both hastened to express our approval monsieur carvin was called by some one at the other end of the room and hurried away louis turned to me there was a curious expression in his eyes  you are disappointed he asked you see nothing here different it is all the same to you  not in the least i answered for one thing it seems strange to find a restaurant de luxe up here when below there is only a cafe of the worst are they of the same management  up here he said come the masters and down there the servants look around at these people monsieur look around carefully tell me whether you do not see something different here from the other places  i followed louis advice i looked around at the people with an interest which grew rather than abated and for which i could not at first account soon however i began to realize that although this was at first appearance merely a crowd of fashionably dressed men and women yet they differed from the ordinary restaurant crowd in that there was something a little out of the common in the faces of nearly every one of them the loiterers through life seemed absent these people were relaxing freely enoughlaughing talking and making lovebut behind it all there seemed a note of seriousness an intentness in their faces which seemed to speak of a career of things to be done in the future or something accomplished in the past the woman who sat at the opposite table to metall with yellow hair and face as pale as alabasterwas a striking personality anywhere her blue eyes were deepset and she seemed to have made no effort to conceal the dark rings underneath which only increased their luminosity a magnificent string of turquoises hung from her bare neck a curious star shone in her hair her dress was of the newest mode her voice languid but elegant had in it that hidden quality which makes it one of a womans most attractive gifts by her side was a great blackmoustached giant a palefaced man with little puffs of flesh underneath his eyes whose dress was a little too perfect and his jewelry a little too obvious  tell me i asked who is that man  louis leaned towards me and his voice sunk to the merest whisper  that monsieur said he is one of the most important persons in the room he is the man whom they call the uncrowned king he was a saddler once by profession look at him now  how has he made his money i asked  louis smileda queer little contraction of his thin lips  it is not wise he said to ask that question of any whom you meet here henri bartot was one of the wildest youths in paris it was he who started the first band of thieves from which developed the present hoard of apaches  and now i asked  he is their unrecognized unspokenof leader louis whispered the man who offends him tonight would be lucky to find himself alive tomorrow  i looked across the room curiously there was not a single redeeming feature in the mans face except perhaps the suggestion of brute passionate force which still lingered about his thick straight lips and heavy jaw the woman by his side seemed incomprehensible i saw now that she had eyes of turquoise blue and a complexion almost waxenlike she lifted her arms and i saw that they too were covered with bracelets of lightblue stones louis following my eyes touched me on the arm  dont look at her he said warningly she belongs to himbartot it is not safe to flirt with her even at this distance  i laughed softly and sipped my wine  louis i said it is time you got back to london you are living here in too imaginative an atmosphere  i speak the truth monsieur he answered grimly she tooshe is not safe she finds pleasure in making fools of men the suffering which comes to them appeals to her vanity there was a young englishman once he sent a note to hernot here but at the cafe de parisat luncheon time one morning he was to have left paris the next day he did not leave he has never been heard of since  there was no doubt that louis himself at any rate believed what he was saying i looked away from the young lady a little reluctantly as though she understood louis warning her lips parted for a moment in a faint contemptuous smile she leaned over and touched the man bartot on the shoulder and whispered something in his ear when i next looked in their direction i found his eyes fixed upon mine in a steady malignant stare  monsieur will remember louis whispered in my ear softly that i am responsible for his coming here  of course i answered reassuringly i have not the slightest wish to run up against any of these people i will not look at them any more she knew what she was doing though louis when she hung blue stones about her with eyes like that eh  she is beautiful louis admitted there are very many who admire her but after all what is the use one has little pleasure of the things which one may not touch  we were silent for several minutes suddenly my fingers gripped louis arm had i been blind all this time that they had escaped my notice then i saw that they were sitting at an extra table which had been hastily arranged and i knew that they could have only just arrived  tell me louis i demanded eagerly who are those two at the small round table on the leftthe two who seem to have just come ina man and a girl  louis turned his head and i saw his lips come togethersaw the quick change in his face from indifference to seriousness for some reason or other my interest in these two seemed to be a matter of some import to him  why does monsieur ask he said  the idlest curiosity i assured him i know nothing about them except that they are distinctive and one cannot fail of course to admire the young lady  you have seen them often louis asked in a low tone  i told you louis i answered that my mission in paris is of the nature of a search for ten days i have haunted all the places where one goesthe race course the bois the armenonville and pre catelan the rue de la paix the theatres i have seen them nearly every day tonight they were at the opera  you know nothing of them beyond that louis persisted  nothing whatever i declared i am not a boulevarder louis i continued slowly and in england you know it is not the custom to stare at women as these frenchmen seem to do with impunity but i must confess that i have watched that girl  you find her attractive murmured louis  i find her delightful i assented only she seems scarcely old enough to be about in such places as these  the man louis said slowly is a brazilian his name is delora  does he live in paris i asked  by no means louis answered he is a very rich coffeeplanter and has immense estates somewhere in his own country he comes over here every year to sell his produce on the london market i believe that he is on his way there now  and the girl i asked  she is his niece louis answered she has been brought up in france at a convent somewhere in the south i believe i think i heard that this time she was to return to brazil with her uncle  i wonder i asked if she is going to london with him  probably louis answered and if monsieur continues to patronize me he continued he will certainly see more of them for monsieur delora is a client who is always faithful to me  notwithstanding its somewhat subdued air there was all the time going on around us a cheerful murmur of conversation the popping of corks the laughter of women the hurrying to and fro of waitersall the pleasant disturbance of an ordinary restaurant at the most festive hour of the night but there came just at this moment a curious interruption an interruption curious not only on its own account but on account of the effect which it produced from somewhere in the centre of the room there commenced ringing softly at first and afterwards with a greater volume a gong something like the siren of a motorcar but much softer and more musical instantly a dead silence seemed to fall upon the place conversation was broken off laughter was checked even the waiters stood still in their places the eyes of every one seemed turned towards the door one or two of the men rose and in the faces of these was manifest a sudden expression in which was present more or less of absolute terror bartot for a moment shrank back in his chair as though he had been struck only to recover himself the next second and the lady with the turquoises bent over and whispered in his ear one person only left his placea young man who had been sitting at a table at the other end of the room with one of the gayest parties at the very first note of alarm he had sprung to his feet a few seconds later with swift silent movements and face as pale as a ghost he had vanished into the little service room from which the waiters issued and returned with his disappearance the curious spell which seemed to have fallen upon these other people passed away the waiters resumed their tasks the room was once more hilariously gay upon the threshold a newcomer was standing a tall man in correct morning dress with a short gray beard and a tiny red ribbon in his buttonhole he stood there smiling slightlyan unobtrusive entrance such as might have befitted any habitue of the place yet all the time his eyes were travelling restlessly up and down the room as he stood there one could fancy there was not a face into which he did not look during those few minutes     chapter iv  dangerous play   i leaned towards louis but he anticipated my question his hand had caught my wrist and was pinning it down to the table  wait he mutteredwait you perceive that we are drinking wine of the vintage of 98 i will tell you of my trip to the vineyards do not look at that man as though his appearance was anything remarkable you are not an habitue here and he will take notice of you  as one who speaks upon the subject most interesting to him louis with the gestures and swift nervous diction of his race talked to me of the vineyards and the cellars of the famous champagne house whose wine we were drinking i did my best to listen intelligently but every moment i found my eyes straying towards this new arrival now deep in apparently pleasant conversation with monsieur carvin  the newcomer had the air of one who has looked in to smile around at his acquaintances and pass on he accepted a cigarette from carvin but he did not sit down and i saw him smile a polite refusal as a small table was pointed out to him he strolled a little into the place and he bowed pleasantly to several with whom he seemed to be acquainted amongst whom was the man bartot he waved his hand to others further down the room his circle of acquaintances indeed seemed unlimited then with a long handshake and some parting jest he took leave of monsieur carvin and disappeared somehow or other one seemed to feel the breath of relief which went shivering through the room as he departed louis answered then my unspoken question  that he said is a very great man his name is monsieur myers  the head of the police i exclaimed  louis nodded  the most famous he said whom france has ever possessed monsieur myers is absolutely marvellous he declared the man has geniusgenius as well as executive ability it is a terrible war that goes on between him and the haute ecole of crime in this country  tell me louis i asked is monsieur myers visit here tonight professional  monsieur has observation louis answered why not  you mean i asked that there are criminalspeople under suspicion  i mean louis interrupted that in this room at the present moment are some of the most famous criminals in the world  a question half framed died away upon my lips louis however divined it  you were about to ask he said how i obtained my entry here monsieur one had better not ask it is one thing to be a thief it is quite another to see something of the wonderful life which those live who are at war with society  i looked around the room once more again i realized the difference between this gathering of welldressed men and women and any similar gathering which i had seen in paris the faces of all somehow lacked that tiredness of expression which seems to be the heritage of those who drink the cup of pleasure without spice simply because the hand of fate presses it to their lips these people had found something else were they not after all a little to be envied they must know what it was to feel the throb of life to test the true flavor of its luxuries when there was no certainty of the morrow i felt the fascination felt it almost in my blood as i looked around  you could not specify i suppose i said to louis  how could monsieur ask it he replied a little reproachfully you will be one of the only people who do not belong who have been admitted here and you will notice he continued that i have asked for no pledgei rely simply upon the honor of monsieur  i nodded  there is crime and crime louis said i i have never been able to believe myself that it is the same thing to rob the widow and the millionaire i know that i must not ask you any questions i continued but the girl with delorathe man whom you call delorashe at least is innocent of any knowledge of these things  louis smiled  monsieur is susceptible he remarked i cannot answer that question mademoiselle is a stranger she is but a child  and monsieur delora himself i asked he comes here when he chooses he is not merely a sightseer  no louis repeated he is not merely a sightseer  a privileged person i remarked  he is a wonderful man louis answered calmly he has travelled all over the world he knows a little of every capital of every side of lifeperhaps he added of the underneath side  his niece is very beautiful i remarked looking at her thoughtfully it seems almost a shame does it not to bring her into such a place as this  louis smiled  if she were going to stay in parisyes he said if she is really going to brazil it matters little what she does a parisian of course would never bring his womankind here  she is very beautiful i remarked yes i agree with you louis it is no place for girls of her age  louis smiled  monsieur may make her acquaintance some day he remarked monsieur delora is on his way to england  she is a safer person to admire i remarked than the lady opposite  much louis answered emphatically monsieur has already he whispered been a little indiscreet the lady of the turquoises has spoken once or twice to bartot and looked this way i feel sure that it was of you she spoke see how she continually looks over the top of her fan at this table monsieur would do well to take no notice  i laughed i was thirty years old and the love of adventure was always in my blood for the first time for many days the weariness seemed to have passed away my heart was beating i was ready for any enterprise  do not be afraid louis i said i shall come to no harm if mademoiselle looks at me it is not gallant to look away  louis face was puckered up with anxiety he saw too what i had seen bartot had walked to the other end of the room to speak to some friends the girl had taken a gold and jewelled pencil from the mass of costly trifles which lay with her purse upon the table and was writing on a piece of paper which the waiter had brought i could see her delicately manicured fingers the blue veins at the back of her hands as she wrote slowly and apparently without hesitation both louis and myself watched the writing of that note as though fate itself were guiding the pencil  it is for you louis whispered in my ear take no notice it would be madness even to look at her  louis i exclaimed protestingly  i mean what i say monsieur louis declared leaning toward me and speaking in a low earnest whisper the cafe below the streets throughout this region are peopled by his creatures in an hour he could lead an army which would defy the whole of the gendarmes in paris this quarter of the city is his absolutely to do with what he wills do you believe that you would have a chance if he thought that she had looked twice at youshesusettethe only woman who has ever led him i tell you that he is mad with love and jealousy for her the whole world knows of it  my dear louis i said you know me only in london where i come and sit in your restaurant and eat and drink there to you i am simply like all those others who come to you day by dayidlers and pleasure seekers let me assure you louis that there are other things in my life just now i should welcome anything in the world which meant adventure which could teach me to forget  but monsieur need not seek the suicide louis said there are hundreds of adventures to be had without that  i shrugged my shoulders  if mademoiselle should send me the note i said surely it would not be gallant of me to refuse to accept it  there are other ways of seeking adventures louis said than by ending ones days in the seine  the girl by this time had finished her note and rolled it up she looked behind her to the other end of the room where only bartots broad back was visible then she raised her eyes to mineturquoise blue as the color of her gownand very faintly but very deliberately she smiled i was not in the least in love with her the affair to me was simply interesting because it promised a moments distraction but nevertheless as she smiled i felt my heart beat faster and i reached a little eagerly forward as though for the note she called a waiter to her side i watched her whisper to him i watched his expressionanxious and perturbed at first doubtful even after her reassuring words he looked down the room to where bartot was standing it seemed to me even then that he ventured to protest but mademoiselle frowned and spoke to him sharply he caught up a wine list and came to our table once more before he spoke he looked behind to where bartots back was still turned  for monsieur he whispered setting the wine list upon the table and under it the note  i nodded and he hastened away at that moment bartot turned and came down the room as he approached he looked at me once more as though for some reason or other he was more than ordinarily interested in my presence it may have been my fancy but i thought also that he looked at the wine card stretched out before me  be careful louis whispered be careful and for gods sake destroy that note  i laughed and as bartot was compelled to turn his back to me to regain his seat this time at the table with his companion i raised my glass looking her full in the face and drank then i slipped the note from underneath the wine card into my pocket she made the slightest of signs but i understood i was not to read it until i was alone  go outside louis whispered to me read your letter and get rid of it  i obeyed him a watchful waiter pulled the table away and i walked out into the anteroom here with a freshly lit cigarette in my mouth i unclenched my fingers and looked at the few words written very faintly in long delicate characters across the torn sheet of paper      monsieur is in bad company it would be well for him to lunch     tomorrow at the cafe de paris and to ask for leon  that was all i tore it into small pieces and returned to my seat altogether puzzled it seemed to me that louis watched me with an incomprehensible anxiety as i resumed my place by his side  if monsieur is ready he suggested perhaps we had better go  i rose to my feet reluctantly  as you will louis i said  but the time for our departure had not yet come     chapter v  satisfaction   during the whole of the time people had been coming and going from the restaurant not perhaps in a continual stream but still at fairly regular intervals it seemed to me who had watched them all with interest that scarcely a person had entered who was not worthy of observation i saw faces it is true which i had seen before at the fashionable haunts of paris upon the polo ground at longchamps or in the bois yet somehow it seemed to me that they came to this place as different beings there was a tense look in their faces a look almost of apprehension as they entered and passed outas of people who have found their way a little further into life than their associates louis was right there was something different about the place something at which i could only dimly guess which at that time i did not understand only i realized that i watched always with a little thrill of interest whenever the hurrying forward of monsieur carvin indicated the arrival of a new visitor  we had already risen to go and the vestiaire was on his way towards us bearing my hat and coat when monsieur carvin who had hurried out a moment before reappeared ushering in a new arrival the events that followed have always seemed a little confused to me my first thought was that this was indeed a nightmare into which i had wandered the slight unreality which had hung like a cloud over the whole of the evening the strangeness of my being there with such a companion the curious atmosphere of the place which so far had completely puzzled methese things may all have served to heighten the illusion yet it seemed to me then that dreaming or waking this thing with which i was confronted was the last impossibility i suppose that i must have stared at him like some wild creature for the conversation around us suddenly stopped standing upon the threshold looking around him with the happy air of an habitue i saw this man to whom i owed my presence in paris this man concerning whom i had sworn that if ever i should meet him face to face my hand should be upon his throat i remember nothing of my progress but i know that i stood before him before he was conscious even of my presence i addressed him by name i believe that even my voice was not upraised  tapilow i said  he turned sharply towards me i saw him suddenly stiffen and i saw his right hand dart as though by instinct to his trousers pocket but i was too quick for him the blood was surging into my ears nothing in the whole room was visible to me but that pale handsome face with the thin lips and dark full eyes i saw those eyes contract as though my hand upon his throat were indeed the touch of death i shook him until his collar broke away and his shirtfront flew open shook him until from his limp body there seemed no longer any shadow of resistance then i flung him a little away from me watching all the time though to see that his hand did not move towards that pocket  tapilow i cried defend yourself you coward do you want me to strangle you where you stand  he came for me then with the frenzy of a man who is in a desperate strait he was as strong as i and he had the advantage in height for a moment i was borne back he struck me heavily upon the face and i made no attempt to defend myself i waited my time when it came i dealt him such a blow that he reeled away and before he could recover i took him by the back of his neck and flung him from me across the table which our struggle had already half upset he lay there a shapeless mass surrounded by broken glass streaming wine a little heap of flowers from the overturned vase then the hubbub of the room was suddenly stilled a dozen hands were laid upon me  for gods sake monsieur i heard louis cry  monsieur carvin led me away i looked back once more at the prostrate figure and then followed him  this is not my fault i said calmly he knew quite well that it was bound to happen i told him that wherever we next met whether it was in a street or a drawingroom or any place whatsoever upon the face of the earth i would deal out his punishment with my own hands even though it should spell death perhaps i continued you would like to send for the police you can have my card if you like  we do not send for the police here monsieur carvin said hoarsely louis will take you away at once where do you stay  at the ritz i answered  keep quiet tomorrow he exclaimed louis will come to you this way  i shrugged my shoulders at that moment it mattered little to me whether i paid the penalty for what had happened or not i even looked back for a last time into the restaurant i saw the strained eager faces of the people bent forward to watch me some of the men had left their seats and come out into the body of the hall to get a better view the man delora was among them the girl was leaning forward in her place with her fingers upon the table and her dark eyes riveted with horrible intensity upon the fallen figure i saw mademoisellethe turquoisecovered friend of bartot she too was leaning forward but her eyes ignored the man upon the floor and were seeking to meet mine there was something unreal about the whole scene something which i was never able afterwards to focus absolutely in my mind as a whole although disjointed parts of it were always present in my thoughts but i know that as i looked back she rose a little to her feet and leaned over the table and heedless of bartot who was now by her side she waved her hand almost as though in approbation i was within a few feet of her upon the threshold of the door and i heard her words spoken perhaps to her companion  it is so that men should deal with their enemies  a moment later louis and i were driving through the streets toward my hotel it was already light and we passed a great train of market wagons coming in from the country along the boulevard into which we turned was sprinkled a curious medley of wastrels of the night and men and women on their way to work it had been raining a little time before but as we turned to descend the hill a weak sunshine flickered out from behind the clouds  it is later than i thought i remarked calmly  it is halfpast five oclock answered louis  he accompanied me all the way to the hotel he asked for no explanation nor did i volunteer any as we drove into the place vendome however he leaned towards me  monsieur is aware he said that he has run a great risk tonight  very likely i answered but louis there are some things which one is forced to do whatever the risk may be this was one of them  you have courage louis whispered let me tell you this there were men there tonight men on every side of you to whom courage is as the breath of life they have seen a man whom nobody loved treated as he probably deserved let me tell you that there is no place in the world where you could have struck so safely as tonight remain in the hotel tomorrow until you hear from some of us i may not promise too much but i thinki believethat we can save you  at that moment louis words meant little to me i was still under the spell of those few wonderful moments still mad with the joy of having taken the vengeance for which every nerve in my body had craved it was not until afterwards that their practical import came home to me     chapter vi  an informal tribunal   i was awakened about midday by the valet de chambre who informed me that a gentleman was waiting below to see mea gentleman who had given the name of monsieur louis i ordered him to prepare my bath and bring my coffee when louis was shown upstairs i was seated on the edge of my bed in my dressinggown smoking my first cigarette  louis had the appearance of a man who had not slept as for myself i had never opened my eyes from the moment when my head had touched the pillow i had no nerves and i had done nothing which i regretted i fancy therefore that my general appearance and reception of him somewhat astonished my early visitor he seemed indeed to take my nonchalance almost as an affront and he proceeded at once to try and disturb it  monsieur was expecting perhaps another sort of visitor he asked  i shook my head  i really hadnt thought about it i said after what you told me last night i have been feeling quite comfortable  do you know that it is doubtful whether monsieur tapilow will live louis asked  it was the just payment of a just debt i answered  the law he objected does not permit such adjustments  the law i answered can do what it pleases with me  louis regarded me steadily for a moment or two and i fancied that there was something of that admiration in his gaze which a cautious man sometimes feels for the foolhardy  monsieur has slept well he asked  excellently i answered  he glanced at the watch which he had taken from his waistcoat pocket  in twenty minutes he announced we must be at the cafe normandy  i raised my eyebrows  indeed i said dryly i dont exactly follow you  louis shrugged his shoulders  monsieur he said it is no time this for the choice of words there is a man who lies very near to death up there in the cafe des deux epingles and it must be decided within the next few hours what is to be done with him  i am not sure that i understand louis i said lighting a cigarette  you will understand at the cafe normandy in half an hours time louis answered in the meanwhile have you a servant if not summon the valet de chambre you must dress quickly it is important this  i will dress in ten minutes i replied but i must shave before i go out that will take me another ten in the meantime perhaps you will kindly tell me what it all means  what it all means louis repeated with upraised hands is it not clear have you forgotten what happened only a few hours ago it rests with one or two people as to whether you shall be given up to the police for what you did last nightdoes monsieur understand thatthe police  to tell you the truth louis i answered i never dreamed of escaping from them it did not seem possible  in which case louis asked slowly  i pointed to the revolver upon my mantelpiece  we all i remarked make the mistake of overestimating the actual importance of life  louis shivered a little i noticed both then and afterwards that he was never comfortable in the presence of firearms  a last resource of course i said but one should always be prepared  in this city louis said it is not as in london in london there are no corners which are not swept bare by your police in london by this time you would have been sitting in a prison cell  that i remarked is doubtless true so much the more fortunate for me that i should have met monsieur tapilow in paris and not in london but will you tell me louis why you want me to go with you to the cafe normandy and how you think it will help me  it would take too long louis answered we will talk in the carriage perhaps you must not delay nownot one moment  i humored him by hastening my preparations and we left the place together a few minutes later there were many things which i desired to ask him with regard to the events of last night and the place to which he had taken me but as though by mutual consent neither of us spoke of these things when we were already however about half way towards the famous restaurant which was our destination i could not keep silence any longer  louis i said tell me about this little excursion of ours who are these men whom we are going to meet  he turned towards me the last few hours seemed to have brought us into a greater intimacy he addressed me by name and his manner although it was still respectful enough was somehow altered  captain rotherby he said you do not seem to appreciate the position in which you stand you are young and life is hot in your veins and yet today as you sit there your liberty is forfeitperhaps even if tapilow should die your life have you ever heard any stories i wonder he added leaning a little toward me about french prisons  are you trying to frighten me louis i asked  no he answered but i want you to realize that you are in a very serious position  i know that i answered dont think louis i continued that what i did last night was the result of a rash impulse i had sworn since a certain day in the autumn of last year that the first time i came face to face with that man whether it was in the daytime or the nighttime in a friends house or on the street i would punish him well i have kept my word i had to i have had my fill of vengeance he can go through the rest of his life so far as i am concerned unharmed but what i did i was bound to do and i am ready to face the consequences if necessary  louis nodded sympathetically  monsieur said he you have but to talk like that to convince the men whom you will meet in a few moments that you had a real grievance against tapilow and all may yet be well  who are these men i asked is it a police court to which you are taking me  monsieur louis answered there are things which i cannot any longer conceal from you i myself believe me am merely an outsider i am as you know a hardworking man with a responsible position and a family to support but here in paris i come on to the fringe of a circle of life with which i have no direct connection and yet whose happenings sometimes touch upon the lives of my friends and intimates it is a circle of life into which is drawn much that is splendid much that is brilliant but monsieur it is life outside the law life which does as it thinks fit which lives its own way and recognizes no laws save its own interests  i nodded  go on louis please i said tell me for example who these men are whom i am going to meet  they are men louis answered who have great influence in that world of which i spoke the law cannot touch them or if it could it would not they wield a power greater than the power which drives the wheels of government in this country if they hear your story and they think well you will go free even though the man tapilow should die  you believe this louis i asked curiously  i am sure of it he answered  it was not for me to dispute what he said i merely shrugged my shoulders yet as a matter of fact i was expecting every moment to find the hand of a gendarme upon my shoulder i expected it as the carriage stopped before the restaurant and we crossed the pavement i expected it even when two men who were sitting in the anteroom of the restaurant rose up to meet us louis standing between performed an introduction  monsieur decresson and monsieur grisson he said stretching out his hand permit me to make you acquainted with monsieur le capitaine rotherby a retired officer in the english army and brother of the earl of welmington  the two men bowed politely and held out their hands they were both typical welldressed goodlooking frenchmen apparently of the upper class monsieur decresson had a narrow black beard a military moustache a high forehead pale complexion and thoughtful eyes monsieur grisson was shorter with lightercolored hair something of a fop in his attire and certainly more genial in his manner  it is a pleasure they both declared to have the honor of meeting monsieur le capitaine  the usual inanities followed then monsieur decresson pointed with his hand into the restaurant  if monsieur will do us the honor to join us he said we will take luncheon afterwards he continued we can talk over our coffee and liqueurs it would be well for us to become better acquainted  i saw no reason to object i was in fact exceedingly hungry we lunched at a corner table in the famous restaurant and i am bound to admit that we lunched exceedingly well during the progress of the meal our conversation was absolutely general all the events of the previous night were carefully ignored when at last however we sat over our coffee and liqueurs monsieur decresson after a moments pause turned his melancholy gray eyes on me  capitaine rotherby he said my friend and i represent a little group of people who have some interest in the place where we met last night we are deputed to ask you to explain if you can your conductyour attack which it seemed to us was absolutely unprovoked upon an habitue of the place and an associate of our own  there is only one explanation which i can make i answered slowly i went there as louis will tell you absolutely a stranger and absolutely by chance chance decreed that i should meet face to face the one man in the world against whom i bear a grudge the one man whom i had sworn to punish whenever and wherever i might meet him  monsieur decresson bowed  there are situations he admitted which can only be dealt with in that manner do not think me personal or inquisitive i beg of you buti ask in your own interestswhat had you against this man tapilow  monsieur decresson i said i will answer you frankly the man whom i punished last night i punished because i have proved him to be guilty of conduct unbecoming to a gentleman i punished him because he broke the one social law which in my country at any rate may not be transgressed with impunity  what you are saying now monsieur grisson interrupted amounts to an accusation tapilow is known to us these things must be spoken of seriously you speak upon your honor as an english soldier and a gentleman  messieurs i answered turning to both of them it is agreed i speak to you as i would speak to the judge before whom i should stand if i had murdered this man and i tell you both upon my honor that the treatment which he received from me he merited he borrowed my money and my brothers money he accepted the hospitality of my brothers house the friendship of his friends in return he robbed him of the woman whom he loved  the quarrel monsieur decresson said softly seems then to have been anothers  messieurs i answered my brother is an invalid for life the quarrel therefore was mine  decresson and his companion exchanged glances i leaned back in my chair the three of them talked together earnestly for several minutes in an undertone then louis with a little sigh of relief rose to his feet and came over to my side  it is finished he declared monsieur decresson and monsieur grisson are of one mind in this matter the man tapilows punishment was deserved  i looked from one to the other of them in wonder  but i do not understand i exclaimed you mean to say then that even if tapilow himself should wish it  monsieur decresson smiled grimly  what happens in the cafe des deux epingles he said happens outside the world without special permission it would not be possible for monsieur tapilow to speak to the police of this assault buy your figaro every evening he continued and soon you will read in the meantime i recommend you monsieur not to stay too long in paris  they took leave of me with some solemnity on the pavement outside the restaurant but monsieur decresson before stepping into his automobile drew me a little on one side  capitaine rotherby he said you have been dealt with today as a very privileged person you were brought to the cafe des deux epingles a stranger almost a guest and your behavior there might very well have been resented by us  if i have not said much i answered please do not believe me any the less grateful  let that go monsieur decresson said coldly only i would remind you of this you are a young man but your experience has doubtless told you that in this world one does not often go out of ones way to serve a stranger for no purpose at all there is a chance that the time may come when we shall ask you perhaps through louis here perhaps through some other person to repay in some measure your debt if that time should come i trust that you will not prove ungrateful  i think i answered confidently that there is no fear of that  monsieur decresson touched louis on the shoulder and motioned him to enter the automobile which was waiting with many bows and solemn salutes the great car swung off and left me there alone i watched it until it disappeared and then turning in the opposite direction started to walk toward the ritz curiously enough it never occurred to me to doubt for a moment the assurance which had been given me i had no longer the slightest fear of arrest  on the way i passed the cafe de paris then i suddenly remembered that strange little note from the girl with the turquoises i never stopped to consider whether or not i was doing a wise thing i opened the swing doors and passed into the restaurant it was almost empty except for a few people who had sat late over their luncheon i called leon to me  leon i said you remember me i am captain rotherby  he held up his hand  it is enough monsieur he declared if monsieur would be so good  he drew me a little on one side  mademoiselle still waits he said in an undertone if monsieur will ascend  upstairs i asked  leon bowed and smiled  mademoiselle is in one of the smaller rooms he said will monsieur follow me  why certainly i answered     chapter vii  a double assignation   i followed leon upstairs to the region of smaller apartments at the door of one of these he knocked and a feminine voice at once bade us enter  mademoiselle was sitting upon a lounge smoking a cigarette on the table before her stood an empty coffeecup and an empty liqueurglass she looked at me with a little grimace  at last she exclaimed  it is the gentleman whom mademoiselle was expecting leon asked discreetly  certainly she answered you may go leon  we were alone she gave me her fingers which i raised to my lips  mademoiselle i said i owe you a thousand apologies i can assure you however that i have come at the earliest possible moment  she motioned me to sit down upon the lounge by her side  monsieur had a more interesting engagement perhaps she murmured  impossible i answered  now i had come here with no idea whatever of making love to this young lady my chief interest in her was because she too was an habitue of this mysterious cafe and because from the first i felt that she had some other than the obvious reason for sending me that little note nevertheless it was for me to conceal these things and i did not hesitate to take her hand in mine as we sat side by side she did not draw it away and she did not encourage me  monsieur she said do not i beg of you be rash it was foolish of me perhaps to meet you here we can talk for a few minutes and afterwards perhaps we may meet again but i am frightened all the time  monsieur bartot i asked  she nodded  he is very very jealous she answered  you go with him every night to the restaurant in the place danjou i asked  i go there very often she answered monsieur unless i am mistaken is a stranger there  i nodded  last night i told her i was there for the first time  you came she said toying with her empty liqueurglass with louis  that is so i admitted  louis brings no one there without a purpose she remarked  you know louis then i asked  she raised her eyebrows  all the world knows louis she continued a smoothertongued rascal never breathed  louis i murmured would be flattered  louis knows himself she continued and he knows that others know him when i saw monsieur with him i was sorry  you are very kind i said to take so much interest  she looked at me for the first time with some spice of coquetry in her eyes  i think that i show my interest she murmured in meeting monsieur here tell me she continued why were you there with louis  a chance affair i answered i met him coming out of the opera i was bored and we went together to the montmartre there i think that i was more bored still it was louis who proposed a visit to the cafe des deux epingles  did you know she asked that you would meet that manthe man with whom you quarrelled  i shook my head  i had no idea of it i answered  she leaned just a little towards me  monsieur she said if you seek adventures over here do not seek them with louis he knows no friends he thinks of nothing but of himself he is a very dangerous companion there are others whom it would be better for monsieur to make companions of  mademoiselle i answered looking into her eyes these things are not so interesting you sent me last night a little note when may i see you once more in that wonderful blue gown and take you myself to the theatre to supperwhere you will  she shot a glance at me from under her eyelids the blind was not drawn and the weak sunlight played upon her features she was overpowdered and overrouged made up like all the smart women of her world but her features were still good and her eyes delightful  ah monsieur she said but that would be doubly imprudent it is not surely well for monsieur to be seen too much in paris today he was badly hurt that poor monsieur tapilow  mademoiselle i assured her there are times when the risk counts for nothing  are all englishmen so gallant she murmured  mademoiselle i answered with the same inducement yes  monsieur has learned how to flatter she remarked  it is an accomplishment which i never mastered i declared  she sighed all the time i knew quite well that she carried on this little war of words impatiently there were other things of which she desired to speak  tell me monsieur she said what had he done to you this man tapilow  i shook my head  you must forgive me i said that is between him and me  and monsieur louis she murmured  louis knew nothing about it i declared  she seemed perplexed she had evidently made up her mind that louis had taken me there with the object of meeting tapilow and for some reason the truth was interesting to her  it was a quarrel about a woman of course she murmuredthe friend of monsieur or perhaps a relation i am jealous tell me then that it was a relation  mademoiselle i answered gravely i cannot discuss with you the cause of the quarrel between that man and myself forgive me if i remind you that it is a very painful subject forgive me if i remind you too i added taking her other hand in mine for a moment that when i saw you scribble those few lines and send them across to me and when i read what you said and came here it was not to answer questions about any other person  she raised her eyes to mine they were curiously and wonderfully blue then she shook her head and withdrew her hands sighing  but monsieur she said since then many things have happened you must not show yourself about in paris it is better for you to go back to england  i am quite safe here i declared  then it has been arranged she exclaimed quickly louis is after all monsieurs friend he has perhaps seen  we will not talk of these things i begged i would rather  she started and drew a little away glancing nervously toward the door  i am terrified she said monsieur must come to my apartments one afternoon where we can talk without fear there is one more question though she continued rapidly louis looked often at us tell me did he say anything to you about monsieur bartot and myself  nothing i answered except that monsieur bartot held a somewhat unique position in a certain corner of paris and that he was a person whom it was not well to offend  no more she asked  no more i answered  i saw him point us out to you she remarked  i asked him to show me the most beautiful woman in the room i answered  she shook her head  you are too much of a courtier for an englishman she said you do not mean what you say  even an englishman i answered can find words when he is sufficiently moved  i made a feint again to hold her hands but she drew away  when are you going back to england she asked abruptly  tomorrow i think i answered if i am still free  free she repeated scornfully if you are protected who is there who will dare to touch you monsieur decresson has all the police dancing to his bidding and if that were not sufficient monsieur bartot could rescue you even from prison no you are safe enough monsieur even if you remain here it is louis eh who is anxious for you to return to england  my time was nearly up anyhow i told her it is not until this moment that i have felt inclined to stay  nevertheless she murmured monsieur goes to london tomorrow is it permitted to ask  anything i murmured  if monsieur goes alone  i fear so i answered unless mademoiselle  she laid her fingers upon my lips  monsieur does not know the elderly gentleman and the very beautiful girl who sat opposite him last night she askedmonsieur delora and his niece  somehow i felt convinced the moment that the question had left her lips that her whole interest in me was centred upon my reply she concealed her impatience very well but i realized that for some reason or other i was sitting there by her side solely that i might answer that question  i heard their names last night for the first time i declared it was louis who told me about them  she looked at me for several moments as though anxious to be sure that i had spoken the truth  mademoiselle i said reproachfully let us leave these topics i am not interested in the deloras or louis or monsieur bartot last night is finished and tomorrow i leave let us talk for a few moments of ourselves  she held up her finger suddenly  listen she exclaimed in a voice of terror  footsteps had halted outside the door she ran to the window and looked down in the street below was standing an automobile with yellow wheels i was looking over her shoulder and she clutched my arm  it is hebartot she cried he is here at the private entrance some one has told him that i am here mon dieu it is he outside now  it was bad acting and i laughed  mademoiselle i said if monsieur bartot is your lover be thankful that you have nothing with which to reproach yourself  i rang the bell she looked at me for a moment with eyes filled with a genuine fear obviously she did not understand my attitude from my trousers pocket i drew a little revolver whose settings and mechanism i carefully examined there was a loud knock at the door and the sound of voices outside monsieur bartot entered in a frockcoat too small for him and a tie too large when he saw us he fell back with a theatrical start  susette he exclaimed susette and you sir he added turning to me  he slammed the door and stood with his back to it  what the devil is the meaning of this he asked looking from one to the other of us  i shrugged my shoulders  you had better ask mademoiselle i answered  she is i believe an acquaintance of yours as for me  my name is bartot sir he cried fiercely  an excellent name i answered but unknown to me i do not yet understand by what right you intrude into a private room here  he laughed hardly  intrude he cried one does not call it that intrude when i find you two together eh  i turned to the girl who with her handkerchief dabbed to her eyes was still affecting a perfect frenzy of fear  has this person any claims upon you i asked he seems to me to be an exceedingly disagreeable fellow  bartots face grew purple his cheeks seemed to distend and his eyes grow smaller it was no longer necessary for him to play a part he was becoming angry indeed  monsieur he said i remember you now it was you who tried to flirt with this lady last night in the cafe des deux epingles you have not even the excuse of ignorance all the world knows that i have claims upon this lady  i bowed  claims i answered which i can assure you i am not in a position to dispute  how is it then he asked fiercely that i find you two strangers last night together today here  i altered one of the cartridges in my revolver and let it go with a snap bartot took a quick step backwards  it is a long story i said softly and i doubt whether it would interest you monsieur bartot still if you are really curious mademoiselle will satisfy you later  i saw a look pass between the two and i no longer had any doubt whatever i knew that they were in collusion that i had been brought here to be pumped by mademoiselle  monsieur bartot said you are apparently armed and you can leave this room if you will but i warn you that you will not leave paris so easily  the situation was quite plain to me however little flattering it might be to my vanity i should not have been in the least surprised if monsieur bartot had held out his hands begged my pardon and ordered a bottle of wine  be reasonable monsieur i begged it is open to every one surely to admire mademoiselle for the rest i have been here only a few moments so far as i am concerned i added glancing at the table mademoiselle has lunched alone  if i could believe that bartot muttered with a look of coming friendship in his eyes  mademoiselle will assure you i continued  then what are you doing here he asked  i raised my eyebrows  i was not aware i said that this was a private restaurant  but these are private rooms he answered still if it was a mistakei trust mademoiselle always  she held out her hands to him with a theatrical gesture  henri she cried you could not doubt me it is impossible  you are right he answered quickly i was too hasty  i smiled upon them both  mademoiselle i said i am sorry that our pleasant little conversation has been interrupted believe me though to be always your devoted slave  i opened the door monsieur bartot turned towards me i am convinced that he was about to offer me his hand and to call for that bottle of wine i felt however that flight was safest i went out and closed the door  the bill monsieur a waiter called after me as i descended the stairs  i gave him five francs for a pour boire  monsieur there will pay i told him pointing towards the room     chapter viii  louis insists   i arrived at the ritz to find louis walking impatiently up and down the stoneflagged pavement outside the entrance he came up to me eagerly as i approached  i have been waiting for you for more than an hour he exclaimed  i looked at him in some surprise i had not yet grown accustomed to hear him speak in such a tone  did i say that i was coming straight back i asked  of course not he answered after you left though i had some trouble with monsieur grisson there is a chance that we may have to move tapilow to a hospital and he is just one of those fools who talk monsieur grisson insists upon it that you leave paris by the four oclock train this afternoon  i shook my head  i could not catch it i declared it is halfpast three now  on the other hand you can and you must louis answered i took the liberty of telephoning in your name and ordering the valet to pack your clothes your luggage is in the hall there and that automobile is waiting to take you to the gare du nord  i opened my mouth to protest but louis manner underwent a further change  captain rotherby he said it is i and my friends who save you perhaps from a considerable inconvenience forgive me if i remind you of this but it is not fitting that you should argue with us on this matter  louis was right for more reasons than he knew of it was well that i should leave paris  are you coming with me i asked  i am crossing by the night boat louis answered i have not quite finished the work for which i came over i have some things to buy  i smiled  upon my word i said i had forgotten your profession  i went back into the hotel and paid my bill louis drove with me to the station and saw to the registration of my luggage afterwards he found my reserved seat in which i arranged my rug and books then i turned and walked down the corridor with him  i trust he said that monsieur will have a pleasant journey and pleasant companions  i glanced into the coupe which we were just passing it seemed curious that even as the wish left his lips i should find myself looking into the dark eyes of the girl whose face had been so often in my thoughts during the last few days opposite her was the graybearded man delora already apparently immersed in a novel every seat in the compartment was laden with their small belongingsdressingbags pillows a large jewelcase books papers flowers and a box of chocolates i turned to louis  again i remarked we meet friends what a small place the world is  we stepped down on to the platform louis for some reason seemed slightly nervous he glanced up at the clock and watched the few late arrivals with an interest which was almost intense  monsieur he said a little abruptly there is a question which i should like to ask you before you leave  there are a good many i should like to ask you louis i answered but they will keep go ahead  i should like to know louis said where you spent the hour which passed between your leaving the cafe normandy and arriving at the ritz  i hesitated for a moment after all i had no reason to keep my movements secret it was better indeed to avoid complications so far as possible  you shall know if you like louis i said i kept my appointment with the young lady of the turquoises  louis pale face seemed suddenly strained  it was my fault he muttered i should not have left you you do not understand how those affairs are here in paris if bartot knew  bartot did know i interrupted  louis face was a study  bartot came in while i was talking to mademoiselle i said  there was a scene louis inquired breathlessly bartot threatened monsieur perhaps there were blows  nothing of the sort i answered bartot blustered a little and mademoiselle wrung her hands but they played their parts badly between you and me louis i have a sort of an idea that bartots coming was not altogether accidental  it was a trap louis murmured softly but why  i shook my head  louis i said i am the wrong sort of man to be even a temporary dweller in this nest of intrigue i do not understand it at all i do not understand any of you i only know that i owe you and those other gentlemen a very considerable debt and i have been solemnly warned against you by the young lady whom i met at the cafe de paris i have been assured that association with you is the first step toward my undoing monsieur bartot for all his bluster seemed very anxious to be friendly  it was the girl louis exclaimed bartot was too big a fool to understand  i sighed  i fear that i am in the same position as monsieur bartot i said i do not understand  there was a warning cry i had only just time to swing myself on to the slowly moving train louis ran for a moment by the side  those people are harmless he said they merely wished if they could to make use of you mademoiselle has tied other fools to her chariot wheels before now that bartot may grow fat but monsieur  i leaned over to catch his words  if monsieur or mademoiselle delora should address you he said you need have no fear they are not of the same order as bartot and susette  i will remember i answered waving my farewells  i regained my compartment which i was annoyed to find had filled up till mine was the only vacant seat i had not had time to buy any papers or magazines but after all i had enough to interest me in my thoughts of tapilow i scarcely thought at all he and i had met and i had kept my oath so far as i was concerned that was the end i had not even any fears for my own safety as regards this matter my interview with decresson and his friend had had a curiously convincing effect upon me i felt that i had been tried for my crime and acquitted in the most orthodox fashion for me the curtain had fallen upon that tragedy it was the other things which occupied my mind i seemed to have found my way into a maze to have become mixed up in certain affairs in a most mysterious and inexplicable way what was the meaning of that place to which louis had introduced me was it some sort of secret organizationan organization which assumed to itself at any rate the power to circumvent the police and bartot too had he really the power which louis had declared him to possess if so why had he baited a clumsy trap for me and permitted me to walk out of it untouched what did they want from me these people the thought was utterly confusing i could find absolutely no explanation then again another puzzle remained i remembered louis desire almost command that i should return to london by this particular train had he any reason for it was it connected in any way i wondered with the presence of this man and girl in the next compartment it seemed feasible even if inexplicable  i rose and strolled down the corridor looking in at the coupe where these two people sat with all the banal impertinence of the curious traveller the girl met my eyes once and afterwards simply ignored me the man never looked up from his magazine i passed and repassed three or four times the effect was always the same at last i resumed my seat at any rate they showed no pressing desire to make my acquaintance  at boulogne i descended at once into the saloon and made a hasty meal when i came up on deck in the harbor i found that the chair which i had engaged was lashed close to the open door of a private cabin and in the door of that cabin standing within a few feet of me was the niece of monsieur delora i racked my brains for something to say she gave me no encouragement whatever at last i descended to a banality  we shall have rather a rough crossing i am afraid i said touching my cap  she looked at me as though surprised that i should have ventured to address her she did not take the trouble to be annoyed she answered me indeed with civility but in a manner which certainly did not encourage me to attempt any further conversation there was a moments pause then she turned away and spoke to some one behind her in the cabin a moment or two later the door was closed and i was left alone after that it seemed ridiculous to imagine that there was any special significance to be attached to the fact that we were fellow passengers  the crossing was a rough one and i saw nothing more of either delora or the girl i had very little hand baggage and i was one of the first to reach the train where i made myself comfortable in the corner seat of a carriage towards the rear end the inspector whom i knew very well locked my door and until the last moment it seemed as though i should have the compartment to myself the train indeed was on the point of starting and i had almost given up looking out for my fellow passengers when they came hurrying up along the platform i saw them glancing into the windows of every carriage in the hope of finding a seat two porters carried their small baggage an obsequious guard followed in the rear just as they were opposite to the carriage in which i was sitting the whistle blew  plenty of room higher up the inspector exclaimed take your seats please  we will get in here the girl answeredthat is to say unless it is a reserved carriage please to open the door at once  the inspector hesitated remembering the tip which i had given him but he had no alternative the guard produced his key and opened the door it was not until that moment that the girl recognized me she stepped back and the look which she threw in my direction was certainly not flattering  can you find us another carriage she asked the guard imperiously  quite impossible miss the man answered you must get in here or be left behind  they had barely time to take their seats as my place was next to the window i felt bound to help the porter hand in the small packages the man delora who was wrapped up in a fur coat and who looked ghastly ill thanked me courteously enough but the girl ignored my assistance they took the two corner seats at the further end of the carriage delora immediately composed himself to sleep  it was a wretched crossing he said to the girlthe most miserable crossing i have ever had and these trainsso small so uncomfortable  she shrugged her shoulders  when one travels she said i suppose that one must put up with inconveniences of all sorts  i knew very well that the last part of her sentence not only had reference to me but was intended for my hearing i affected however to be absorbed in the magazine which i was reading and under cover of which i was able to make a close observation of the man who was sitting on the same side as myself he had put up his feet and closed his eyes but he had evidently suffered badly from seasickness for his face remained almost deathly white and he shivered now and then as though with cold he had lost the wellgroomed air which had distinguished him in paris his features were haggard and worn and he looked at least ten years older his clothes were excellently made and the fur coat which he had wrapped around himself was magnificent for the rest he seemed tired outa man utterly wearied of life before we had reached the town station he was asleep  the train rushed on into the darkness and after a time i ventured to glance toward the girl she too was leaning back in her place but her face was turned a little away from me towards the window through which she was gazing with the obvious intentness of one whose thoughts are far away i had all my life been used to observing closely people of either sex who interested me and i found now as i had found during those various accidental meetings in paris that the study of this young woman afforded me a peculiar pleasure apart from her more personal fascination she was faultlessly dressed she wore a black tailormade suit perhaps a little shorter than is usual for travelling in england patent shoeslong and narrowand black silk stockings her hat was a small toque and her veil one of those for which frenchwomen are famousvery large but not in the least disfiguring this however she had raised for the present and i was able to study the firm but fine profile of her features to notice the delicacy of her chin her small wellshaped ears her eyebrowsblack and silky her eyes themselves were hidden from me but their color had been the first thing which had attracted me they were of a blue so deep that sometimes they seemed as black as her eyebrows themselves it was only when she smiled or came into a strong light that they seemed suddenly to flash almost to violet her figure was slimshe was indeed little more than a girlbut very shapely and elegant she could scarcely be called tall but there was something in her carriage which seemed to exaggerate her height the very poise of her head indicated a somewhat contemptuous indifference to the people amongst whom she moved  i had kept my scrutiny under control prepared for any sudden movement on the part of the girl but after all she was too quick for me she turned from the window with a perfectly natural movement and yet so swiftly that our eyes met before i could look away she leaned a little forward in her place and her forehead darkened  perhaps sir she said you will be good enough to tell me the meaning of your persistent impertinence     chapter ix  a travelling acquaintance   her words were so unexpected that for a moment or two i was speechless on the whole i scarcely felt that i deserved the cold contempt of her voice or the angry flash in her eyes  i am afraid i dont understand you i said if you refer to the fact that i was watching you with some interest at that moment i suppose i must plead guilty on the other hand i object altogether to the term impertinence  and why do you object she asked looking at me steadily and beating with her little hand the armrest by her side if your behavior is not impertinence pray what is it we meet at the opera you look it is not enough for you that you look once but you look twice three times you come out on to the pavement to hear the address which my uncle gives the chauffeur we go to a restaurant for supper where only the few are admitted you are content to be brought by a waiter but you are there you travel to england by the same trainyou walk up and down past my compartment you presume to address me upon the boat you give a fee to the guard that he should put us in your carriage yet you object to the term impertinence  i do i answered most strongly i consider your use of the word absolutely uncalled for  she looked across at the sleeping man he was breathing heavily and was evidently quite unconscious of our conversation  your standard of manners is i am afraid a peculiar one she said in paris one is used always to be stared at englishmen i was told behaved better  she took up a magazine and turned away with a shrug of the shoulders i leaned a little further forward in my place and lowered my voice so as not to disturb the sleeping man  you are really unjust to me i said i will plead guilty to noticing you at the opera house but i did so as i would have done any welldressed young woman who formed a part of the show there so far as regards my visit to the cafe des deux epingles i went at the suggestion of louis whom i met by accident and who is the maitre dhotel at my favorite restaurant i had no idea that you were going to be there on the contrary i distinctly heard your companion tell your chauffeur to drive to the ritz i came on this train by accident and although it is true that i spoke to you as i might have done to any other travelling companion i deny that there was anything in the least impertinent either in what i said or how i said it so far as regards your coming into this carriage i added i feed the guard to keep it to myself and although i will not say that your presence is unwelcome it is certainly unsought for  she was silent for a moment watching me all the time intently my words seemed to have given her food for thought  listen she said leaning forward do you mean to say that that was your first visit to the cafe des deux epingles  absolutely my first visit i answered i met louis by accident that night he knew that i was bored and he took me there  you met him at the opera and you asked him who we were she remarked  that is quite true i admitted but i scarcely see that there was anything impertinent in that afterwards we spoke together for a little time i told him that i was alone in paris and bored it was because i was alone that we went out together  her forehead was wrinkled with perplexity her eyes seemed always to be seeking mine as though anxious to learn whether i were indeed speaking the truth  i do not understand at all she said you mean to tell me then that you know nothing of louis except as a maitre dhotel that you were a chance visitor to paris this week  absolutely i answered  suddenly a thought seemed to occur to her she drew away from me in her eyes i seemed to see reflected the tragedy of those few moments in the cafe des deux epingles  how can i believe you she exclaimed remember that i saw you strike that man it was horrible i have never seen anything like it you were like a wild animal they tell me that he was very badly hurt is it true  i believe so i answered i am afraid that i hope so  and you she continued go free you have not even the air of one who flies for his life yet you tell me that you are not one of thosethose  those what i asked eagerly  those who frequent the cafe des deux epingles she said slowlythose who take advantage of the peculiar protection which some of those behind the scenes there are able to extend to their friends  i shook my head  i know nothing of the place beyond that brief visit i answered i know nothing of louis except as a maitre dhotel in my favorite restaurant i know nothing of the people who frequent the cafe des deux epingles except those i saw there that night you i added were one of them i can assure you that when i went with louis to that place i had not the slightest idea that i should meet the person whom i did meet  what is your name she asked abruptly  i handed her my card she read it with a perplexed face the man opposite to her moved uneasily in his sleep she crumpled the card up in her hands and remained for a few moments apparently deep in thought  you are an englishman she asked after a short pause  decidedly i answered  i have not known many englishmen she said slowly i have lived in the country near bordeaux and in paris most of my days it is very certain though that i have never seen an englishman like you i was looking into your eyes when that man came into the room i saw you rise to strike him  she shuddered i leaned across towards her  listen i said i do not wish you to think me worse than i am you sympathize with that man whom i struck down you look upon me as a sort of wouldbe assassin you need not i tell you upon my honor that if ever a man in this world deserved death he deserved it  from you she asked  from me i answered firmly it was not perhaps a personal matter but i have a brotherlisten mademoiselle i continued he is a cripple he was thrown from his horsehe was master of hounds in those daysand he has never been able to walk since he was married to a woman whom he loved a poor girl whom he had made wealthy and to whom he had given a great position she loved him and she was content after his accident to give her life to him then that man came the man whom you saw me punish i tell you that this was no chance affair i went on he set himself deliberately to win her heart how far he succeeded i do not know i can only tell you that she left my brothers home with him the man was his guest at the timewas his guest from the beginning of the affair  the girls eyes blazed even in that dim light i could see the dark blue fire in them  you did well she said for that i have no more to say one who wrongs the helpless should be punished but i do not understand this she added i do not understand why those people at the cafe des deux epingles should shield you when you are not one of themwhen you have no knowledge of any of them save the very slightest they are not philanthropists those people some day or other you will have to pay the price  i shrugged my shoulders  i have never refused to pay my just debts i said if any one of them comes to me with a definite request which i can grant you may be very sure that i shall grant it  you are not already their servant then she asked you are sure quite sure of that  in what way i asked  you look honest she said perhaps you are perhaps i have doubted you without a cause but i will ask you this question has it been suggested to you by any of them that you should watch usmy uncle and me  on my honor no i answered earnestly  she was evidently puzzled little by little the animosity seemed to have died away from her face she looked at the sleeping man thoughtfully and then once more at me  tell me she saiddo not think please that i am inquisitive but i should like to believe that you are not one of those whom we need fearis louis indeed an ordinary acquaintance of yours  he is scarcely that i answered he is simply the maitre dhotel at a restaurant i frequent i had never in my life seen him before except in his restaurant when he spoke to me at the opera i did not for some time recognize him  she appeared to be convinced but still a little bewildered she was silent  dont you think i said after a short pause that it is almost my turn now to ask a few questions  she seemed surprised  why not she asked  tell me you are not english i said and you are not french yet you speak english so well  she smiled  my father was a frenchman and my mother a spaniard she answered i was born in south america but i came to europe when very young and have lived in france always my peopleshe looked towards the sleeping man as though to include himare all coffee planters  you are going to stay long in london i asked  my uncle sells his years crops there she answered when he has finished his business we move on  will you tell me then i asked why you too were at the cafe des deux epingles you admit that it is the resort of people of mysterious habits what place had you there  she looked away from me for a moment my question seemed to disconcert her perhaps by reason of its directness  well she said my uncle has lived for many years in paris he knows it as well as the parisians themselves he has always had a taste for adventure and i fancy that he has friends who are interested in the place at any rate i have been there with him two or three times and he is always welcome  from what i have heard i remarked i should imagine that you and i are the only people who have been allowed to go there without qualifications  she glanced as though by accident at the sleeping man opposite then as though conscious of what she had done a spot of color burned in her cheeks since the anger which had first inspired her to speech had died away her manner had been a little shy i realized more and more that she must be quite young  perhaps she answered i do not understand the place or its habitues i only know that while one is there one must be careful  tell me i asked what are you going to do in london while your uncle looks after his business  amuse myself as best i can i suppose she answered carelessly there are always the shops and the theatres in the evening  where are you going to stay i inquired  at the milan i think she answered  somehow her answer to my question struck me as ominous to the milan of course where louis was all the time predominant the girl might be innocent enough of all wrongdoing or knowledge of wrongdoing but could one think the same of her uncle i glanced at him instinctively in sleep his features were by no means prepossessing  i may come across you then i ventured  she smiled at me it was wonderful what a difference the smile made in her face to me she seemed at that moment radiantly beautiful  it would be very pleasant she said i know no one in london i expect to be alone a great deal you live in london she asked  as much there as anywhere i answered i have never settled down since i sent in my papers  why did you do that she asked  i was badly knocked about at ladysmith i answered and i could not get round in time i havent altogether finished soldiering though i added at least i hope not  but where do you call your home then she asked timidly  i am not one of those fortunate persons who possess one i answered i spend a great deal of time in norfolk with my brother and i have just a couple of rooms in town  the train had slackened speed all around us was a widespreading arc of yellow lights the clearness had gone from the atmosphere the little current of air which came in through the halfopen window was already murky and depressing  it is london she asked  we shall be there in ten minutes i answered looking out  she leaned over and waked her uncle he sat up drowsily  we shall be there in ten minutes she said  so soon he answered do you know on which side we arrive sir he asked me  on your side i answered  he rose to his feet and commenced to wrap a scarf around his neck  you will be smothered the girl remarked  i am cold he answered in a low tone i am always cold after i have crossed the channel besides it is the damp air you too will find it so in london felicia you must be careful  already he was peering out of the window into the darkness i could not help wondering whether it was seasickness alone which was responsible for his haggard features for that grim look of covert fear which seemed to have settled around his mouth and eyes to me he seemed like a man who is about to face the unknown and who fears  the train began to slacken pace we drew into the station i noticed that a man was standing by himself at this remote end of the platform and that as we passed he seemed to look intently into our carriage  can i be of any service to you i asked the girl as i collected my small belongings i suppose though that your uncle is used to the journey  she glanced towards the man opposite he turned to me and i found his appearance almost terrifying he seemed to be suffering from more than physical sickness  i thank you sir he said rapidly you could if you would be of immense service  i should be delighted i answered tell me in what way  i am exceedingly ill the man said with a groan i suffer from heart attacks and the crossing has altogether upset me if you could remain with my niece while our luggage is examined and send her afterwards to the milan hotel you would do a real favor to a sick man i could myself take a hansom there without waiting for a moment and get to bed nothing else will do me any good  i glanced across at the girl she was watching her uncle with distressed face  if you will allow me i said it will give me very great pleasure to look after you i am going to the milan myself and i too have luggage to be examined  it is very kind of you she said hesitatingly dont you think though she added turning to her uncle that i had better go with you we could send a servant for the luggage afterwards  no no he objected impatiently i shall call at the chemists i shall get something that will put me right quickly  it is settled then i declared  apparently delora thought so the train had scarcely come to a standstill but already he had descended avoiding the platform he crossed straight on to the roadway and was lost amidst the tangle of cabs i turned to the girl affecting not to notice his extraordinary haste  we will have our small things put into an omnibus i said there will be plenty of time afterwards to come back and look for our registered luggage  you are very kind she murmured absently  her eyes were still watching the spot where her companion had disappeared     chapter x  delora disappears   i was fortunate enough to find a disengaged omnibus and filled it with our rugs and smaller belongings then we made our way slowly back to the little space prepared for the reception of the heavier baggage and around which a barrier had already been erected there was a slight nervousness in my companions manner which made conversation difficult i too could not help feeling that the situation was a difficult one for her  i am afraid i remarked that you are worried about your uncle is his health really bad or is this just a temporary attack i thought he looked well enough in the train on the other side  he suffers sometimes she answered but i do not think it is anything really serious  he will be all right by the time we get to the hotel i declared  very likely she answered for myself i think that i always feel a little nervous when i arrive at a strange place i have never been here before you know and i could not help wondering for a moment what would become of me if my uncle were really taken ill everyone says that london is so big and cold and heartless  you would have nothing to fear i assured her you forget too that your uncle has friends here  we leaned over the barrier and watched the luggage being handed out of the vans and thrown on to the low wooden platforms by my side a dark young man with sallow features and pince nez was apparently passing his time in the same manner my companion who was restless all the time glanced at him frequently or i should scarcely have noticed his existence in dress and appearance he resembled very much the ordinary valet in private service except for his eyeglasses and that his face lacked the smooth pastiness of the class for some reason or other my companion seemed to take a dislike to him  come she said to me we will move over to the other side i think we shall get in quicker  i followed her lead and i saw her glance back over her shoulder at the young man who seemed unaware even of her departure  i do hate being listened to she said even when one is talking about nothing in particular  who was listening to us i asked  the young man next to you she answered i could see him look up in that horrid stealthy way from under his eyelids  i laughed  you are a very observant person i remarked  she drew a little closer to me somehow or other i found the sense of her near presence a delightful thing all her garment seemed imbued with a faint perfume as though of violets  i think that i have only become so quite lately she said perhaps it is because i have lived such a quiet life and now things are so different my uncle has been so mysterious especially during the last few days and i suppose it has made me suspicious wherever we go i always seem to fancy that some one is watching us besides i am sure that that young man was a south american and i hate south americans  i fancy i said that the attention he bestowed upon us was due to a more obvious cause  please do not talk like that she begged i do not wish for compliments from you i have been told always that englishmen are so truthful one has compliments from frenchmen from spaniards and from south americans they fall like froth from their lips and one knows all the time that it means nothing and less than nothing it is such a pity  why a pity i asked more for the sake of keeping her talking than anything certainly it is a picturesque habit of speech  she shrugged her shoulders  i do not like it she said quietly by degrees one comes to believe nothing that any man says even when he is in earnest remember capitaine rotherby i hope that i shall never hear a compliment from you  i will be careful i promised her but you must remember that there is sometimes a very fine distinction i may be driven to say something which sounds quite nice because it is the truth  she laughed at me with her eyes a habit of hers which from the first i had admired for the moment she seemed to have forgotten her anxieties  you are worse than these others she murmured i believeno i am quite sure that you are more dangerous come they are ready for us  the barriers were thrown open and a little stream of people entered the enclosed space my companions trunks were all together and easily found the officer bent over chalk in hand and asked a few courteous questions at that moment i became aware that the young man in eyeglasses was standing once more by my side her trunks were promptly marked and i directed the porter to take them to our omnibus then we moved on a little to where my things were the young man sauntered behind us and stopped to light a cigarette my companions fingers fell upon my arm  he is everywhere she murmured what does he want  i turned round sharply and caught him in the act of inspecting my labels i was beginning now to lose my temper  may i ask i said standing in his way to what we owethis young lady and iyour interest in us and our concerns  he stared at me blankly  i do not understand you sir he said  i was foolish enough to lose my temper a policeman was standing within a few feet of us and i appealed to him  this person annoys us i said pointing him out by following us everywhere we go the young lady is carrying a jewelcase and i have papers of some importance myself will you kindly ask him to move on or ascertain whether he is a bona fide traveller  the young man smiled faintly the policeman answered me civilly but i knew at once that i had made a mistake  this gentleman is well known to us sir he said i do not think you will find him causing you any trouble  i hope at any rate i said turning away that we have seen the last of him  apparently we hadfor the moment at any rate i claimed my own belongings and had them sent down to the omnibus then i handed my companion in and was on the point of joining her when i saw walking along the platform within a few feet of us the policeman to whom i had appealed i turned back to him  i wonder i said drawing him a little on one side if you would care to earn a sovereign without committing a breach of duty  he looked at me stolidly apparently he thought that silence was wisest  you said that that young man who followed us about here was well known to you i said who is he  it is not my place to tell you sir the man answered and passed on  i stepped into the bus and we drove off as we turned out of the station i caught a last glimpse of our shadower he was standing close to the main exit with his hands behind him looking up to the sky as though anxious to discover whether it were still raining he looked into our bus as it clattered by and my companion who caught sight of him leaned back in her seat  i am sure she declared firmly that that is a detective  i was equally certain of it but i only laughed  if he is i said it is certainly not you who needs to be anxious there can be no question as to whom he is watching you must remember that although those mysterious people up at the place danjou may be powerful in their way they would have to be very clever indeed to protect me absolutely it is pretty well known over here that i had threatened to kill tapilow wherever i met him  she looked at me for a moment doubtfully and then she shook her head  it is not you whom they are watching she said  who then i asked  my uncle and me she answered  i looked at her curiously  tell me i said why you think that your uncle is a man of position and has legitimate business here why should he be watched by detectives  she shook her head  i suppose it is because we are foreigners she said but ever since my uncle fetched me from bordeaux we seem to have been watched by some one wherever we go  you will not suffer much from that sort of thing over here i remarked cheerfully england is not a policeridden country like germany or even france  i know she answered and yet i have told you before how i feel about arriving in england there seems something unfriendly in the very atmosphere something which depresses me which makes me feel as though there were evil times coming  i laughed reassuringly  you are giving way to fancies i said i am sure that london is doing its best for you see the rain is all over we have even continental weather to welcome you look at the moon for london too i added the streets seem almost gay  she leaned out of the window a full moon was shining in a cloudless sky the theatres were just over the pavements were thronged with men and women and the streets were blocked with carriages and hansoms on their way to the various restaurants at the entrance to the milan our omnibus was stopped for several moments whilst motors and carriages of all descriptions with their load of men and women in evening clothes passed slowly by and turned in at the courtyard we found ourselves at last at the doors of the hotel and i received the usual welcome from my friend the hallporter  back again once more you see ashley i remarked i have brought miss delora on from the station her uncle is here already we came over by the same train  the reception clerk stepped forward and smilingly acknowledged my greeting he bowed also to my companion  we are very pleased to see you miss delora he said we were expecting you and mr delora tonight  my uncle came on at once from the station she said he was not feeling very well  the clerk bowed but seemed a little puzzled  will you tell me where i can find mr delora she asked  mr delora has not yet arrived madam the clerk answered  she looked at him for a moment speechless  not arrived i interrupted surely you must be mistaken dean he left charing cross half an hour before us  the clerk shook his head  i am quite sure captain rotherby he said that mr delora has not been here to claim his rooms he may have entered the hotel from the other side and be in the smokingroom or the american bar but he has not been here  there was a couch close by and my companion sat down i could see that she had turned very white  send a pageboy round the hotel i told the hallporter to inquire if mr delora is in any of the rooms if i might make the suggestion i continued turning towards her i would go upstairs at once you may find after all that mr dean has made a mistake and that your uncle is there  why yes she declared jumping up i will go at once do you mindwill you come with me  with pleasure i answered  i paused for a moment to give some instructions about my own luggage then i stepped into the lift with the clerk and her  your uncle i hope is not seriously indisposed miss delora he asked  oh no she answered he found the crossing very rough and he is not very strong but i do not think that he is really ill  it is a year since we last had the pleasure the clerk continued  she nodded  my uncle was over then she remarked for me this is the first time i have never been in england before  the lift stopped  what floor are we on the girl asked  the fifth the clerk answered we have quite comfortable rooms for you and the aspect that your uncle desired  we passed along the corridor and he opened the door which led into a small hall and on into a sittingroom the clerk opened up all the rooms  you will see as i told you before miss delora he said that there is no one here your uncles rooms open out from the right the bathroom is to the left there and beyond are your apartments  she peered into each of the rooms they were indeed empty  the apartments are very nice she said but i do not understand what has become of my uncle  he will be up in a few minutes without a doubt the clerk remarked is there anything more that i can do for you madam shall i send the chambermaid or the waiter to you  not yet she answered i must wait for my uncle will you leave word below that he is to please come up directly he arrives  certainly madam the clerk answered turning towards the door  i should have followed him from the room but she stopped me  please dont go she said i am very foolish i know but i am afraid  i will stay of course i answered sitting down by her side upon the couch but let me assure you that there is nothing whatever to fear your uncle may have had a slight cab accident or he may have met with a friend and stopped to talk for a few minutes in either case he will be here directly london you know is not the city of mysteries that paris is there is very little indeed that can happen to a man between charing cross station and the milan hotel  she leaned forward a little and buried her face in her hands  please dont i begged indeed i mean what i say there is no cause to be anxious your uncle spoke of stopping at a chemists they may be making up his prescription a hundred trivial things may have happened to keep him  you do not know she murmured     chapter xi  through the telephone   there was no doubt about it that delora had disappeared i followed the reception clerk downstairs myself within the space of a few minutes and made the most careful inquiries in every part of the hotel it did not take me very long to ascertain beyond the shadow of a doubt that he was not upon the premises nor had he yet been seen by any one connected with the place i even walked to the corner of the courtyard and looked aimlessly up and down the strand within those few hundred yards which lay between where i was standing and charing cross something had happened which had prevented his reaching the hotel it may have been the slightest of accidents it might be something more serious or it might even be i was forced to reflect that he had never intended coming presently i returned to the suite of rooms upon the fifth floor to make my report to miss delora i found her calmer than i had expected but her face fell when i was forced to confess that i had heard no news  i am sorry i said but there is no doubt that up to the present at any rate your uncle has not been here i am quite sure though i added that there is no cause for alarm a hundred slight accidents might have happened to detain him for half an hour or so  she glanced at the clock  it is more than that she said softly  tell me i asked would you like me to communicate with the police they are in touch with the hospitals and if any misfortune has happened to your unclewhich after all is scarcely likelywe should hear of it directly  she shook her head vigorously the idea for some reason seemed to displease her  no she said why should we appeal to the police what have they to do with my uncle i am quite sure that he would not wish that  i presume i said that nothing of this sort has ever happened beforei mean that he has not left you without warning  not under the same circumstances she admitted and yet he has a very queer way of absenting himself every now and then  for long i asked  it depends she answered never for any length of time though  after all i remarked you cannot have seen such a great deal of him he lives in south america does he not and you have never been out of france  it is true she murmured  i noticed i continued thoughtfully that he seemed disturbed as we neared london  she drew out the pins from her hat and with a little gesture of relief threw it upon the table  please sit down for a minute she said i want to think  she leaned forward upon the couch her head buried in her hands i felt that she desired silence so i said nothing several moments passed then there came a sudden and unexpected interruption the bell of the telephone instrument which stood between us upon the table commenced to ring her hands fell from before her face she looked across at me with parted lips and wideopen eyes i made a movement towards the instrument but she checked me  stop she said wait a moment let me think  she had risen to her feet we stood looking at one another across the table between us was the telephone instrument and the bell which had just rung out its summons  are you not going to answer it i asked  i am afraid she answered i do not know what has come over me i am afraid take up the receiver tell me who it is who speaks  you are sure that you wish it i asked  at once she insisted they will have gone away  the bell rang again i took the receiver into my hands  who is there i asked  is that the apartment of mr delora was the reply  yes i said  i wish to speak to miss felicia delora the voice said  who are you i asked  it does not matter was the answer be so good as to tell her to come to the telephonemiss felicia delora  i held the receiver away from me and turned to her  some one wishes to speak to you i said  who is it she asked  the person gave no name i answered  did you recognize the voice she asked  i hesitated  i was not sure i said it was like your uncles  she took the instrument into her hand what passed between her and the person at the other end i had of course no means of telling all i know was that she said at short intervalsyes no yes i promise then she laid the instrument down and looked at me  the mystery is solved she said my uncle has met some friends and stayed with them for a little time to discuss a matter of business i am sorry to have been so troublesome to you my anxieties of course are at an end now  i bowed and moved toward the door  if there is anything else that i can do i said  i shall ask you she answered looking at me earnestly i shall indeed  my number is 128 i said i am two floors above you please do not forget to make use of me if you need a friend  i shall not forget she answered softly  then as though moved by a sudden impulse she held out her handa small white hand with rather long fingers manicured to a perfection unusual in this country she wore only one ring in which was set a magnificent uncut emerald i held her fingers for a moment and raised them to my lips  i shall be always at your service i answered quietly however muchor however little you may care to tell me goodnight  i went to my rooms and washed afterwards i descended and ordered some supper in the cafe  louis is not back yet i remarked to the waiter who attended to me  not yet monsieur the man answered we expect him some time tomorrow monsieur is also from paris  i nodded and did not pursue the subject on my way back to my rooms half an hour later i stopped to speak for a few minutes with the hallporter  mr delora has not arrived yet sir he remarked  no i answered i dare say there has been some slight mistake i fancy that he has telephoned to his niece  the hallporter looked a little puzzled  it is rather a curious thing sir he said but there seem to be a good many people who are wanting to see mr delora we have had at least a dozen inquiries for him during the last few days and all from people who refuse to leave their names  i nodded  business friends perhaps i remarked mr delora comes over to keep friends with his connections here i suppose  the hallporter coughed discreetly but mysteriously  no doubt sir he remarked  i went on my way to my rooms not caring to pursue the conversation yet i felt that there was something beneath it all ashley knew or guessed something which he would have told me with very little encouragement over a final cigarette i tried to think the matter out here were these people remarkable for nothing except the obviously foreign appearance of the man and the good taste and beauty of the girl i had seen them at every fashionable haunt in paris and finally at a restaurant which louis had frankly admitted to be the meetingplace of people whose careers were by no means above suspicion i had crossed with them to england and if their presence on the train were not the cause for louis insisting upon my hurried departure from paris it at any rate afforded him gratification to think that i might perhaps make their acquaintance during the whole of the journey neither of them had made the slightest overture towards me that we had come together at all was without doubt accidental i did not for a moment doubt the girls first attitude of irritation towards me it was just as certain that her uncle had shown no desire whatever to make my acquaintance i remembered his curious agitation as we had reached london his muttered excuse of seasickness and his somewhat extraordinary conduct in leaving his niece alone with mea perfect strangerwhile he hurried off to the hotel at which he had never arrived presumably if that was indeed he who had spoken to the girl upon the telephone she understood more about the matter than i did he may have given her some explanation which accounted for his absence if so he had obviously desired it to remain a secret what was the nature of this mystery of what was it that he was afraid who was this young man who after his departure had taken so much interest in his niece and myself at charing cross was it some one whom he had desired to evadea detective perhaps or an informer the riddle was not easy to solve commonsense told me that my wisest course was to fulfil my original intention and take the first train on the morrow to my brothers house in norfolk on the other hand inclination strongly prompted me to stay where i was to see this thing through to see more of felicia delora i was thirty years old free and unencumbered a moderately impressionable bachelor of moderate means until the time when the shadow of this tragedy had come into my life which had found its culmination in the little restaurant of the place danjou things had moved smoothly enough with me i had had the average number of flirtations many pleasant friendships yet i asked myself now whether there was any one in the past who had ever moved me in the same way as this girl who was still almost a perfect stranger to me i hated the man her uncle i hated the circumstances under which i had seen her i hated the mystery by which they were surrounded it was absolutely maddening for me to reflect that two floors below she was spending the night either with some mysterious and secret knowledge or in real distress as to her uncles fate after all i told myself a little bitterly i was a fool i was old enough to know better the man himself was an adventurerthere could be no doubt about it how was it possible that she could be altogether ignorant of his character  then just as i was half undressed there came a soft knock at my door i rose to my feet and stood for a moment undecided for some time my own personal danger seemed to have slipped out of my memory now it came back with a sudden terrible rush perhaps the man tapilow was dead if so this was the end  i went out into the little hall and opened the door the corridors outside were dimly lit but there was no mistaking the two men who stood there waiting for me one was obviously a police inspector and the man by his side although he wore plain clothes could scarcely be anything but a detective     chapter xii  felicia delora   i looked at the two men and they returned my gaze with interest  are you captain rotherby sir the inspector asked  i nodded  that is my name i said  we shall be glad to have a few words with you sir he declared  you had better come inside i answered and led the way into my sittingroom  we have been sent for the inspector continued to inquire into the disappearance of mr delorathe gentleman who was expected to have arrived at this hotel this evening he added referring to his notes  to me who with a natural egotism had been thinking of my own affairs and had been expecting nothing less than arrest this declaration of the object of their visit had its consolations  we understand the inspector continued that you travelled with mr delora and his niece from folkestone to charing cross  that is quite true i answered the guard put them in my carriage  did you converse with them during the journey sir  the man was asleep all the way i answered he never even opened his eyes till we were practically in london  you talked perhaps with the young lady the man inquired  if i did i answered serenely it seems to me that it was my business  the police inspector was imperturbable  when was the last time you saw this mr delora he asked  at charing cross station i answered he left the carriage directly the train stopped and went to get a hansom he had been seasick coming over and was anxious to get to the hotel very quickly  leaving his niece alone the man asked  leaving her in my care i answered we were all coming to the same hotel and the young lady and i had been in conversation for some time  he asked you then to take care of her the man inquired  the request as he made it i answered was a perfectly natural one by the bye i continued who sent for you  we were advised of mr deloras disappearance by the proprietor of the hotel the inspector answered  how do you know that it is a disappearance at all i asked mr delora may have met some friends he is not obliged to come here in other words if he chooses to disappear he surely has a perfect right to are you acting upon miss deloras instructions  no the inspector answered miss delora has not moved in the matter  then i consider i declared that your action is premature and i have nothing to say  the inspector was temporarily nonplussed my view of the situation was perfectly reasonable and my assumption that there was some other reason for their visit was not without truth the man in the plain clothes who had been listening intently but as yet had not spoken intervened  captain rotherby he said i am a detective from scotland yardin fact i am the head of one of the departments we know you quite well to be a young gentleman of family and above suspicion we feel sure therefore that we can rely upon you to help us in any course we may take which is likely to lead to the detection of crime or criminals  up to a certain point i assented you are perfectly right  there are circumstances connected with these people the deloras uncle and niece the detective continued which require investigation  i am sorry i answered but i cannot at present answer any more questions except with miss deloras permission  you can tell me this captain rotherby the detective asked looking at me keenly do you know whether miss delora has been in communication with her uncle since she reached the hotel  i have no idea i answered  there is a telephone in her room the detective continued without removing his eyes from my face we understand from the hallporter that a message was received by her soon after her arrival  very likely i answered i should suggest that you go and interview miss delora she will probably tell you all about it  they were both silent i felt quite certain that they had already done so at that moment my own telephone bell rang the two men exchanged quick glances i took up the receiver  is that capitaine rotherby  i recognized the voice at once it was miss delora speaking  yes i answered  i thought i should like to let you know she continued that i am no longer in the least anxious about my uncle he is always doing eccentric things and i am sure that he will turn uplater tonight perhaps or at any rate tomorrow i do not wish any inquiries made about him it would only annoy him very much when he came to hear of it  i am very glad to hear you say so miss delora i answered to tell you the truth there are some men here at present who are asking me questions i have told them however that you are the only person to whom they should apply  her voice when she answered me showed some signs of agitation  i have not asked the help of the police she declared and i do not need it they would have come to my rooms but i refused to receive them  i quite agree with you miss delora i answered good night  good night capitaine rotherby she said softly i laid down the receiver  you have probably overheard my conversation i said to the inspector after that i can only wish you good night  he moved at once to the door in stolid discontented fashion the detective however lingered  captain rotherby he said i cannot blame you for your decision i think however it is only fair to warn you that you will probably find yourself better off in the long run if you do not mix yourself up in this affair  indeed i answered  there are wheels within wheels the man continued i have no charge to make against mr delora i have no charge to make against any one but i think that so far as you are concerned you would be well advised to remember that these are merely travelling companions and that even the most accomplished man of the world is often deceived in such good night sir  they left me then without another word i heard their footsteps die away along the corridor the ring of the lift bell the clatter of its ascent and descent then i undressed and went to bed  i awoke the next morning rather late dressed and shaved in my rooms and descended to the cafe for breakfast the waiter who usually served me came hurrying up with a welcoming smile  monsieur louis he announced returned early this morning  he is not here now i asked looking around the room  the waiter smiled deprecatingly  but for the early breakfast no sir he said monsieur louis will come at one oclock perhapsperhaps not until dinnertime he will be here today though  i unfolded my paper and looked through the list of accidents there was nothing which could possibly have applied to mr delora i waited until eleven oclock and then sent up my name to miss delora a reply came back almost at oncemiss delora had gone out an hour ago and had left no word as to the time of her return once more i was puzzled why should she go out unless she had received some news she had told me that she had no friends in london it was scarcely likely that she would go out on any casual expedition in her present state of uncertainty i made my way to the managers office whom i knew very well and with whom i had often had a few minutes talk he received me with his usual courtesy and gave me a handful of cigarettes to try i lit one and seated myself in his easychair  mr helmsley i said you know that i am not as a rule a curious person and i should not like to ask you any questions which you thought improper ones but you have some guests staying here in whom i am somewhat interested  mr helmsley nodded and by his genial silence invited me to proceed  i mean mr delora and his niece i continued  the smile faded from the managers face  the gentleman who did not arrive last night he remarked  i nodded  i travelled up with them i said from folkestone and certainly mr deloras behavior was a little peculiar as we neared london he seemed nervous and anxious to quit the train at the earliest possible moment i brought his niece on here as you know found that he had not arrived and i understand that up to the present nothing has been heard of him  it is quite true mr helmsley admitted thoughtfully the matter was reported to me last night and very soon afterwards an inspector from scotland yard called i gave him all the information i could naturally but on reference to the young lady she declined to consider the matter seriously at all her uncle she said had probably met some friends or had made a call upon the way under the circumstances there was nothing else to do but to drop the matter so far as any direct inquiries were concerned  i nodded  but the man himself i asked what do you know of him  i have always understood mr helmsley said slowly that he was a gentleman from south america who had large coffee plantations and who came over every year to sell his produce he has stayed at the hotel about this time for the last four years he has always engaged a good suite of rooms has paid his accounts promptlyi really do not know anything more about him  has his niece accompanied him always i asked  never before mr helmsley answeredat least not to my recollection  you do not know what part of south america he comes from i asked  i have no idea mr helmsley declared his letters are always forwarded to an agent  so practically you can tell me nothing i said rising  nothing at all i fear mr helmsley answered i shall make it a point of calling upon the young lady within an hour or so to inquire again about her uncle  the young lady has gone out i remarked i have just sent my own name up  mr helmsley raised his eyebrows he too was surprised  then she has probably heard something he remarked  perhaps i answered by the bye i understand that louis is back  he came by the night train mr helmsley answered i scarcely expected him so soon you will probably see him in the cafe at luncheontime  i took my leave of the manager and returned to my own side of the hotel  if miss delora should come in i said to the hallporter on my way to the lift please let me know i shall be in my room writing letters  miss delora came in just after you crossed the courtyard sir the man answered she is in her room now  alone i asked  i believe that she came in with a gentleman sir shall i ring up and ask for her  i hesitated for a moment i was recalling to myself her statement that she had no friends in london whatsoever  yes i answered send up my name and say that i should like to see her  the man went to the telephone and emerged from the box a moment later  miss delora would be much obliged he said if you would kindly go to her room in a quarter of an hour  i nodded and turned away for the lift the cigarette between my lips was suddenly tasteless i was experiencing a new sensation and distinctly an unpleasant one with it was coupled an intense curiosity to know the identity of the man who was even now with felicia     chapter xiii  louis maitre dhotel   i measured out that quarter of an hour into minutes and almost into seconds then i knocked at the door of the sittingroom and was bidden enter by felicia delora herself she was alone but she was dressed for the street and was apparently just leaving the hotel again her clothes were of fashionable make and cut with the most delightful simplicity her toilette was that of the ideal frenchwoman who goes out for a mornings shopping and may possibly lunch in the bois she was still very pale however and the dark lines under her eyes seemed to speak of a sleepless night i fancied that she welcomed me a little shyly she dropped her veil almost at once and she did not ask me to sit down  i hope that you have some news this morning of your uncle miss delora i asked  she shook her head  i have not heardanything of importance she answered  i am sorry i said i am afraid that you must be getting very anxious  she bent over the button of her glove  yes she admitted i am very anxious i am very anxious indeed i scarcely know what to do  tell me then i said why do you not let me go with you to the police and have some inquiries made if you prefer it we could go to a private detective i really think that something ought to be done  she shook her head  i dare not she said simply  dare not i repeated  because when he returns she explained he would be so very very angry with me he is a very eccentric manmy uncle he does strange things and he allows no one to question his actions  but he has no right i declared hotly to leave you like this in a strange hotel without even a maid without a word of farewell or explanation the thing is preposterous  she had finished buttoning her gloves and looked up at me with a queer little smile at the corner of her lips and her hands behind her  capitaine rotherby she said there are so many things which it seems hard to understand i myself am very unhappy and perplexed but i do know what my uncle would wish me to do he would wish me to remain quite quiet and to wait  i was silent for a few moments it was difficult to reason with her  you have been out this morning i said a little abruptly  i have been out she admitted i do not think capitaine rotherby that i must tell you where i have been but i went to the one place where i thought that i might have news of him  you brought back with you a companion  no not a companion she interposed gently you must not think that capitaine rotherby he was just a person whowho had to come you are not cross with me she asked lifting her eyes a little timidly to mine that there are some things which i do not tell you  no i am not cross i answered slowly only if you felt it possible i added to give me your entire confidence it seems to me that it would be better i will ask you to believe i continued that i am not merely a curious person i amwell more than a little interested  she held out both her hands and raised her eyes to mine through the filmy lace of her veil i could see that they were very soft almost as though tears were gathering there  oh i do believe you capitaine rotherby she said and i would be very very happy if i could tell you now all the things which trouble me all the things which i do not understand but i may not i may notjust now  whenever you choose i answered i shall be ready to hear whenever you need my services they are yours  you do trust me a little then she asked quickly  implicitly i answered  you do not mind she continued that i tell you once more that i am going out and that i must go out alone  why no i answered if you do not need me there is an end of it  you are very good to me she said perhaps this afternoon if you have a few minutes to spare we might talk eh  at any time you say i answered  at four oclock then she said you will come here and sit with me for a little time perhaps this evening if you have nothing to do she asked  i have nothing to do i interrupted promptly  i do not know how i shall feel she said about going out but i would like to see you anyhow  i shall come i promised her some time within the next few days i must go down to norfolk  to norfolk she interrupted quickly is that far away  only a few hours i answered  you will stay there she exclaimed  i shook my head  i think not i answered i think i shall come back directly i have seen my brother  she lifted her eyes to mine  why she whispered  in case i can be of service to you i answered  you are so very good so very kind she said earnestly and to think that when i first saw you i believedbut that does not matter she wound up quickly please come to the lift with me and ring the bell i lose my way in these passages  i watched her step into the lift her skirts a little raised she herself to my mind the perfection of feminine grace from the tips of her patent shoes to the black feathers in her hat she waved her hand to me as the lift shot down and i turned away  at exactly halfpast one i went down to the cafe for lunch the room was fairly full but almost the first person i saw was louis suave and courteous conducting a party of guests to their places i took my seat at my accustomed table and watched him for a few moments as he moved about what a waiter he must have been i thought his movements were swift and noiseless his eyes seemed like points of electricity alive to the smallest fault on the part of his subordinates the slightest frown on the faces of his patrons there was scarcely a person lunching there who did not feel that he himself was receiving some part of louis personal attention one saw him in the distance suggesting with his easy smile a suitable luncheon to some bashful youth or found him a moment or two later comparing reminiscences of some wonderful sauce with a bon viveur an habitue of the place such a man i thought was wasted as a maitre dhotel he had the gifts of a diplomatist the presence and inspiration of a genius  i had imagined that my entrance into the room was unnoticed but i found him suddenly bowing before my table  the plat du jour he remarked is excellent monsieur should try it after a few days of french cookery he continued a simple english dish is sometimes an agreeable relief  thank you louis i answered tell me what has become of mr delora  my sudden attack was foiled with the consummate ease of a masterif indeed the man was not genuine  mr delora he repeated is he not staying herehe and his niece i have been looking for them to come into luncheon  his niece is here i answered mr delora never arrived  louis then did a thing which i have never seen him do before or afterwardshe dropped something which he was carrying it was only a wine carte and he stooped and picked it up at once with a word of graceful apology but i noticed that when he once more stood erect the exercise of stooping so far from having brought any flush into his face seemed to have driven from it every atom of color  you mean that mr delora went elsewhere monsieur he asked  i shook my head  they travelled up from folkestone i said in my carriage at charing cross mr delora who had been suffering he said from seasickness and who was certainly very nervous and ill at ease jumped out before the train had altogether stopped and hurried off to get a hansom to come on here it had been arranged that i should bring his niece and follow him when we arrived he had not come he has not been here since i have just left his niece and she assured me that she had no idea where he was  louis stood quite still  it is a most singular occurrence he said  it is the strangest thing i have ever heard of in my life i answered  monsieur is very much interested doubtless louis said thoughtfully he travelled with themhe expressed i believe an admiration for the young lady doubtless he is very much interested  so much so louis i answered that i intend to do everything i can to solve the mystery of deloras disappearance i am an idle man and it will amuse me  louis shook his head  ah he said it is not always safe to meddle in the affairs of other people there are wheels within wheels the disappearance of mr delora may not be altogether so accidental as it seems  you mean i exclaimed hastily  but nothing monsieur louis answered with a little shrug of the shoulders i spoke quite generally a man disappears and every one in the world immediately talks of foul play of murderof many such things but after all is that quite reasonable most often the man who disappears disappears of his own accorddisappears either from fear of things that may happen to him or because he himself has some purpose to serve  you mean to suggest then louis i said that the disappearance of mr delora is a voluntary one  once more louis shrugged his shoulders  who can tell monsieur he answered i suggest nothing i spoke only as one might speak hearing of this case one moment monsieur  he darted away to welcome some newcomers ushered them to their table suggested their lunch passed up and down the room stopping here and there to bow to a patron to examine the dishes standing ready to be served to correct some fault of service it seemed to me as i watched him that he did a hundred things before he returned yet in a very few moments he was standing once more before my table examining with a complacent air the service of my luncheon  monsieur will find the petits carots excellent he declared my friend henry he tries to serve this dish but it is not the same thing no always the vegetables must be served in the country where they are grown monsieur will drink something  a pint of moselle i ordered i dare not order whiskey and soda before you louis  he made a little grimace  it is as monsieur wishes he declared but it is a drink without finessea crude drink for a man of monsieurs tastes it shall be the moselle no 197 he added turning to the waiter do not forget the number 197 he added turning to me is an absolutely light winefor luncheon delicious  we were alone once more louis bent smiling over my table  monsieur is much interested he said in the disappearance of an acquaintance a passing travelling companion but he does not ask of affairs which concern him more gravely  of tapilow i exclaimed quickly  louis nodded  tapilow is in an hospital and he will live louis declared slowly but all his life he will limp and all his life he will carry a scar from his forehead to his mouth  i nodded meditatively  it is perhaps i answered a more complete punishment  i fancied that in louis green eyes there shot for a moment a gleam of something like admiration  monsieur has courage he murmured  why not i answered we all of us have a certain amount of philosophy you know louis it was inevitable that when that man and i met i should try to kill him i had no weapon that night i simply took him into my hands but there you know the rest if he had died i might have had to pay the penalty it was a risk but you see i had to take it the thing was inevitable the wrong that he had done some one who is very dear to me was too terrible too hideous for him to be allowed to go unpunished  when he recovers louis remarked thoughtfully monsieur will have an enemy  a great man louis once declared i reminded him that ones enemies were the salt of ones life ones friends sometimes weary ones enemies give always a zest to existence  again louis was summoned away i ate my lunch and sipped my wine louis was right it was excellent yet likely enough to be overlooked by the casual visitor for it was of exceedingly moderate price  so tapilow was not likely to die so much the better perhaps the time might have come in my life when the whole of that tragedy lay further back in the shadows and when the thought that i had killed a man however much he had deserved it might chill me i understood from louis very reticence that i had nothing now to fear from the law so far as regards tapilow himself i had no fear it was not likely that he would ever raise his hand against me  i dismissed the subject from my thoughts it was just then i remembered that after all i had not gathered from louis a single shred of information on the subject in which i was most interested i almost smiled when i remembered how admirably he had contrived to elude my curiosity the only thing which i gathered from his manner was that mr deloras disappearance was unexpected by him never mind the end was not yet i ordered coffee and a liqueur and laid my cigarette case upon the table i would wait until louis chose to come to me once more there were certain things which i intended to ask him point blank     chapter xiv  louis explains   louis returned of his own accord before long  monsieur has been well served he asked genially  excellently louis i answered so far as the mere question of food goes you have not however managed to satisfy my curiosity  monsieur he asked interrogatively  concerning the deloras i answered  louis shrugged his shoulders  but what should i know he asked mr delora he has come here last year and the year before he has stayed for a month or so he understands what he eats that is all mademoiselle comes for the first time i know her not at all  what do you think of his disappearance louis i asked  what should i think of it monsieur i know nothing  mr delora i am told i continued is a coffee planter in south america  i too louis admitted have heard so much  how came he to have the entree to the cafe des deux epingles i asked  louis smiled  i myself he remarked am but a rare visitor there how should i tell  louis said i why not be honest with me i am certainly not a person to be afraid of i am very largely in your hands over the tapilow affair and as you know i have seen too much of the world to consider trifles i do not believe that mr delora came to london to sell his crop of coffee i do not believe that you are ignorant of his affairs i do not believe that his disappearance is so much a mystery to you as it is to the rest of ussay to me and to mademoiselle his niece  louis face was like the face of a sphinx he made no protestations he denied nothing he waited simply to see where i was leading him  i am not sure louis i said that i do not believe that you had some object in taking me to the cafe des deux epingles that night be honest with me i can be a friend i have influence here and there and as i think you know i love adventures tell me what you know of this affair tell me if you had any motive in taking me to the cafe des deux epingles that night  louis looked around the room with keen watchful eyes without abandoning his attitude of graceful attention to what i was saying he seemed in those few moments to be absorbing every detail of the progress of the affairs in the restaurant itself the arrangement of the service at some tables a little way off seemed to annoy him he frowned and called one of his subordinates speaking in a rapid undertone to him and with many gestures the man hurried away to obey his instructions and louis turned to me  monsieur said he there are many times when it is not wise or politic to tell the truth there are many times therefore when i have to speak falsehoods but i will confess that i do not like it always i would prefer the truth if it were possible when i saw you at the opera in paris i thought of you only as one of my best and most valued patrons it was only as we stood there talking that another idea came into my head i acted upon it there was a reason why i took you to the cafe des deux epingles  go on louis i said go on  i took you there louis continued because i knew that some time during the night tapilow would come already i knew what would happen if you two met  you wished it to happen then i exclaimed  louis bowed  monsieur he said i did wish it to happen the person of whom we have spoken is no friend of mine or of my friends he had entered into a scheme with certain of them and it was known that he meant to play them false he deserved punishment and i was content that he should meet it at your hands  is that all louis i asked  not all monsieur he continued i said to myself that if monsieur quarrels with his enemy and trouble comes of it it will be ii and my friendswho can assist monsieur monsieur will owe us something for this and the time may comethe time indeed may be very close at handwhen the services of monsieur might be useful  come louis i said this is better now i am beginning to understand go on a little further if you please i acknowledge your claim upon me what can i do  monsieur likes excitement louis murmured  indeed i do i answered fervently  louis hesitated  if there were some plot against this man delora he said to prevent his carrying out some undertaking monsieur would help to frustrate it  with all my heart i answered there is only one thing i would ask what is mr deloras undertakingto sell his coffee  louis inimitable smile spread over his face  ah he said monsieur is pleased to be facetious  then i knew that i was on the point of learning a little at any rate of the truth  mr delora has other schemes louis said slowly  so i imagined i answered  i saw louis half turn his head there was no change in his tone nor in his expression naturally therefore his words sounded a little strangely  my conversation with monsieur for the moment is finished he said there is some one quite close who would give a great deal to overhear it follows therefore that one says nothing if monsieur will grant me a quarter of an hour at any time in his room after four oclock  at halfpast four louis i answered  louis gave a final little twist to my tablecloth and departed with a bow i saw then that at the table next to mine hidden from me for the moment by louis himself was seated the man who had stood by our side at charing cross  after luncheon i took a taxicab called on my tailor looked in at the club and bought some cigarettes the whole of london seemed covered with dust sheets to smell of paint my club was in the hands of furbishers my tobacconist was in his houseboat on the thames i met only one or two acquaintances who seemed so sorry for themselves that their depression was only heightened by recognizing me the streets were given over to a strangely clad crowd of pilgrims from other landsamerican women with short coats pince nez and baedekers dragging along their mankind in neat suits and outrageous hats one seemed to recognize nothing familiar even in the shopwindows i was glad enough to get back to the milan especially so as in the lift i came upon felicia she started a little at seeing me and seemed a little nervous when the lift stopped at her floor i got out too  let me walk with you to your room i said it is nearly four oclock  if you please she answered i wanted to speak to you capitaine rotherby there was something i forgot to say before i went out this morning  i sighed  there is always a good deal that i forget to say when i am with you i answered  she smiled  you too she exclaimed you are beginning to say the foolish things but never mind we do not joke now i speak seriously louislouis is back eh  certainly i answered he was in the cafe at luncheon time  capitaine rotherby she said as we passed into her room together louis is a very strange person i think that he has some idea in his head about you just now will you promise me thisthat you will be careful  careful i repeated i dont quite understand but ill promise all the same  she took hold of the lapels of my coat as though to pull me down a little towards her i felt my heart beat quickly for the deep blue light was in her eyes  ah capitaine rotherby she said you do not understand this man louishe is not only what he seems i think that he took you to the cafe des deux epingles that night with a purpose he thinks perhaps that you are in his power eh because you did fight with the other man and hurt him badly and louis knows  please go on i said  i want you to be careful she said if he asks you to do anything for him be sure that it is something which you ought to dowhich you may do honorably you see capitaine rotherby she went on louis and his friends are not men like you they are more subtlethey have perhaps more brainbut i do not think that they are honest louis may try to frighten you into becoming like them he may try very many inducements she went on looking up at me you must not listen you must promise me that you will not listen  i promise with all my heart i answered that neither louis nor any one else in the world shall make me do anything which i feel to be dishonorable  louis is very crafty she whispered he may make a thing seem as though it were all right when it is not you understand  yes i understand i answered but tell me how did you get to know so much about louis  it does not matterthat she answered a little impatiently i have heard of louis from others i know the sort of man he is i think that he will make some proposal to you will you be careful  i promise i answered may i see you again today remember i pleaded that i am staying here only for your sake i ought to have gone to norfolk this afternoon  she drew a little sigh  i wonder she said half to herself i think perhapsyes we will dine together monsieur you and i she said you must take me somewhere where it is quite quietwhere no one will see us  not down in the cafe then i asked smiling  she held up her hands in horror  but no she declared if it is possible let us get away somewhere without louis knowing  it can be arranged i assured her may i come in and see you later on and you shall tell me where to meet you  she thought for a minute  at seven oclock she answered please go away now i have a dressmaker coming to see me  i turned away but i had scarcely gone half a dozen paces before she called me back  capitaine rotherby she said there is something to tell you  i waited expectantly  yes i murmured  she avoided meeting my eyes  you need not trouble any further about my uncle she said he has returned  returned i exclaimed when  a very short time ago she answered he is very unwell it will not be possible for any one to see him for a short time but he has returned  i am very glad indeed i assured her  her face showed no signs of exultation or relief i could not help being puzzled at her demeanor she gave me no further explanation  there was a ring at the door and she motioned me away  the dressmaker she exclaimed  i went upstairs to my rooms to wait for louis     chapter xv  a dangerous impersonation   louis appeared as ever punctual to the moment he carried a menu card in his hand he had the air of having come to take my orders for some projected feast i closed the door of the outer hall and the door of my sittingroom  now louis i said we are not only alone but we are secure from interruption tell me exactly what it is that you have in your mind  louis declined the chair to which i waved him he leaned slightly back against the table facing me  captain rotherby he said i have sometimes thought that men like yourself of spirit who have seen something of the world must find it very wearisome to settle down to lead the life of an english farmer gentleman  i am not proposing to do anything of the sort i answered  louis nodded  for you he said perhaps it would be impossible but tell me then what is there that you care to do i will tell you you will give half your time to sport the rest of the time you will eat and drink and grow fat you will go to marienbad and carlsbad and you will begin to wonder about your digestion find yourself growing baldyou will realize that nothing in the world ages a man so much as lack of excitement  i grant you everything louis i said what excitement have you to offer me  three nights ago louis said i saw you myself take a man into your hands with the intention of killing him you broke the law  i did i admitted and i would do it again  would you break the law in other ways louis asked  under similar circumstances yes i answered  listen monsieur louis continued it is our pleasure to save you from the unpleasant consequences which would certainly have befallen you in any other place than the cafe des deux epingles after yourshall we say misunderstandingwith james tapilow  i admit my indebtedness louis i answered  will you do something to repay it louis asked raising his eyes to mine  you will have to tell me what it is first i said  it is concerned with the disappearance of mr delora louis said  but mr delora has returned i exclaimed his niece told me so herself he has returned but he is very unwellconfined to his room i believe  it is the story which has been agreed upon louis answered we were obliged to protect ourselves against the police and the newspaper people but nevertheless it is not the truth mr delora has not returned  does mademoiselle know that i asked quickly  she does not louis admitted she has been told exactly what she told youthat her uncle had returned but that he was ill and must be kept quiet for a little time it was necessary that she should believe his room occupied for reasons which you will understand later she shall be told the truth very soon  i was conscious of a distinct sense of relief the thought that she might have told me a falsehood had given me a sudden stab  where is mr delora then i asked  that we can guess louis said we want you to go to him  very well louis i said i am perfectly agreeable only you must tell me who this mr delora is why he is in hiding and who you mean when you say we  monsieur louis said if it rested with me alone i would tell you all these things i would give you our confidence freely because we are a little company who trust freely when we are sure the others however do not know you as i know you and i have the right to divulge only certain things to you mr delora has come to this country on a mission of peculiar danger he has a secret in his possession which is of immense value and there are others who are not our friends who know of it mr delora had a signal at charing cross that there was danger in taking up his residence here that is why he slipped away quietly and is lying now in hiding if monsieur indeed desires an adventure i could propose one to him  go ahead louis i said  let it be understood that mr delora has returnedas i have already told you he has not returned the door of his room is locked and no one is permitted to enter it is believed that tonight an attempt will be made to force a way into that room and to rob its occupant  the room is empty you say there is no one there i interrupted  precisely monsieur louis said but if some one were there who was strong and brave it might be possible to teach a lesson to those who have played us false and who have planned evil things if that some one were you captain rotherby we should considermonsieur decresson and the others would considerthat your debt to them was paid  i whistled softly to myself i began to see louis idea i was to enter somehow or other the room in which mr delora was supposed to be to remain there concealed and to await this attack which for some reason or other they were expecting and then as the possibilities connected with such an event spread themselves out before me my sense of humor suddenly asserted itself and to louis amazement i laughed in his face i came back from this world of fanciful figures of mysterious robberies of attempted assassinations to the world of everyday things it was louisthe maitre dhotel the man who had ordered my plat du jour and selected my mosellewho spoke of these things so calmly in my own sittingroom with a menu card in his hand and a moroccobound wine list sticking out of his breast pocket i was not in any imaginary city but in londoncity of tragedies indeed but tragedies of a homelier sort it was not possible that such things could be happening here in an atmosphere which through familiarity had become almost commonplace was i to believe that louis my favorite maitre dhotel my fellow schemer in many luncheon and dinner parties my authority upon vintages my gastronomic good angel was one of a band of conspirators who played with life and death as though they had been the balls of a juggler was i to believe that there existed even in this very hotel which for years had been my home the seeds of these real tragical happenings which sometimes though only half disclosed blaze out upon the world as a revelation of the great underground world of crime i found it almost impossible to take louis seriously i could not focus my thoughts  louis i said is this a great joke or are you talking to me in sober serious earnest  i am talking in earnest monsieur louis said slowly i have not exaggerated or spoken a word to you which is not the truth  let me understand this thing a little more clearly i said what has ferdinand delora done that he need fear a murderous assault what has he done to make enemies is he a criminal or are those who seek him criminals  he carries with him louis said slowly a secret which will produce a great fortune there are others who think that they have a right to share in it it is those others who are his enemies it is those others who hope to attain by force what they could gain by no other means  a sudden inspiration prompted my next question  was tapilow one of those i demanded  louis nodded gravely  monsieur tapilow was one of those who claimed a share but he was not willing to run the smallest risk he assented  and for that reason i remarked he is well out of the way i understand there is one more question louis and it is one which you must answer me truthfully you can imagine what it is when i tell you that it concerns mademoiselle  mademoiselle is innocent of the knowledge of any of these things louis declared earnestly she is a very charming and a very beautiful young lady but if ever a young lady needed friends she does  why is she here at all i demanded why was she not left behind in paris if there is no part for her to play in this little comedy it seems to me that she would have been much better out of the way  captain rotherby louis said there was a reason and some day you will understand itwhy it was necessary that she should come to london with her uncle i can tell you no more you must not ask me any more  i looked into louis impenetrable face i could learn nothing there his words had left me partly unconvinced somehow i felt that the only time he had spoken the entire truth was when he had spoken of felicia yet it was certainly true that i owed these people something and i had no wish to shrink from paying my debt  tell me i said if i take deloras place tonight and if your scheme is successful does that free him will he be able to come back will it be for the benefit of mademoiselle  but most certainly louis answered earnestly it is not an organization against which we fight it is one or two desperate men who believe themselves robbed once they are out of the way delora can walk the streets a free man there would be nothing he added to prevent your seeking his friendship or the friendship of his niece  very well i agreed i will spend the night in mr deloras rooms i shall leave it to you to make all the arrangements  louis looked at me with a curious expression in his face  you understand monsieur he said slowly that there may be danger  naturally i understand i said if it comes to a fight i shall be prepared and i have had a little experience  however well armed you may be louis said there will be a risk our enemies are swift and silent one of them at any rate is an accomplished criminal they are too clever for us unaided i could take mademoiselle delora to scotland yard today and i could tell them what we fear they might patrol the hotel with the police and even then you would wake in the night and find some one by your bedside  by the bye louis i said why all this mystery according to you delora is an honest man why dont you go to the police  louis shook his head  we are not free to do that he said delora is honest but it is a great secret which he controls and the only chance of using it successfully is to keep it a secret from the whole world  how am i to be introduced into the room louis i asked  that he answered will be easy there are two lifts as you knowone from the smokingroom and one from the entrance hall the number of mr deloras apartment is 157 here by the bye monsieur is a key  i took it and put it in my waistcoat pocket  you will ascend by the lift from the smokingroom to the top floor louis continued you can then descend by the other lift to the fifth floor and walk boldly into the sittingroom the door on the right will be mr deloras bedroom and of that there will be after midnight a key upon the mantelpiece in the sittingroom  but miss delora i asked what of her the sittingroom connects also with her apartments  mademoiselle will be told something of this during the evening louis answered it will be better she will have retired and be locked in her room long before it will be necessary for you to ascend  very well i said but now for the practical side of it if anything really happens what is to be my excuse for occupying those apartments tonight  i will provide you with a sufficient one later on louis promised you will dine downstairs  possibly i answered  in which case we can have a little conversation louis remarked  louis i said what sort of an affair is this really in which i am mixing myself up am i one of a gang of magnificent criminals a political conspirator or a fool  louis smiled  monsieur he said i found you very weary of life i will put you in the way of finding excitement monsieur should ask no more than that there are many men of his temperament who would give years of their life for the chance  he left me with his usual polite bow i strolled after him down the corridor a moment or so later but i just missed the lift in which he descended looking down i saw that it had stopped at the fifth floor it seemed as though louis had gone to visit number 157     chapter xvi  two of a trade   i smoked two pipes one after the other in a vain attempt to draw out some definite sequence of facts from the tangled web of happenings into which i seemed to have strayed i came to the conclusion that fate which had bestowed on me a physique of more than ordinary size a sound constitution and muscles which had filled my study with various kinds of trophies had not been equally generous in her dispensation of brains try as i would i could make nothing of the situation in which i found myself the most reasonable thing seemed to be to conclude that louis was one of a gang of thieves that i was about to become their accomplice and that felicia was simply the delilah with whom these people had summoned me to their aid such a conclusion however was not flattering nor did it please me in any way directly i allowed myself to think of felicia i believed in her there were none of the arts of the adventuress about her methods her glances or her words she did not for instance in the least resemble the young lady with the turquoises who had also been good enough to take an interest in me i gave the whole thing up at last perhaps by the morrow i should know moreif indeed i thought a little grimly i knew anything i could not help feeling that this little enterprise to which i had committed myself might turn out to be a serious affair even louis had not tried to minimize the risks i felt however that if it led me to any better understanding of the situation i could welcome whatever danger it involved  a little before six oclock i turned to look at the weather which had been threatening all day meaning to take a stroll the rain however was coming down in sheets so i descended instead to the little smokingroom thinking that i might find there some one whom i knew i had already ensconced myself in an easychair and ordered a whiskey and soda when i became conscious that the very person with whom my thoughts were occupied was in the room and within a few feet of me  felicia was sitting on a couch and by her side a man whom i recognized at once it was the companion of my lady of the turquoises apparently they had not noticed my entrance they continued for several moments to be unaware of it felicia was paler than ever she seemed to be struggling as she sat there to conceal her fear and aversion for the man who leaned toward her talking in rapid french with many gesticulations he was badly dressed in a travelling suit of french cut with a waistcoat buttoned almost to the chin a floppy black tie hung down over the lapels of his coat his black moustache which seemed to have suffered from the crossing was drooping and gave to his mouth a particularly sinister expression he had a neck of unusual size and the fat ran in ridges to the back of his scalp worked up by his collar as he moved his head rapidly with every sentence he seemed altogether unable to sit still or control himself his bootsbrown tops with narrow patent vampsbeat a tattoo upon the floor no wonder that felicia shrunk into the corner of her lounge i felt that it was impossible for me to sit and watch them any longer i rose to my feet  felicia saw me firstthen her companion felicias first expression to my intense joy was one of relief her companion on the other hand darted towards me a perfectly murderous glance i advanced toward them and felicia half rose  capitaine rotherby she said oh i am very glad to see you this man here who sits by my sidehe does not speak one word of english listen i beg go and find some one in the cafeyou know whom i mean i will not mention his name go and find him and bring him here tell him that bartot is here and is terrifying me that he threatens all the time please bring him  i will go at once i answered  i bowed and turned away of bartot i took no notice though he rose at once and seemed about to address me i hurried into the cafe but it was a slack hour and there were no signs of louis  can you tell me where to find louis i asked one of the waiters  the man glanced at the clock and shrugged his shoulders  perhaps in his office he said but monsieur louis often goes out for an hour about this time  where is his office i asked  the man led me into the service room and turned to the left he knocked at a closed door and i heard a sleepy voice say  come in  i entered and found louis in a tiny little sittingroom curled up on a sofa in his hand was a pocketbook and a pencil he appeared to have been making memoranda he sprang to his feet as i entered  monsieur he exclaimed putting away the pocketbook and rising to his feet  sorry to disturb you louis i said miss delora is in the little smokingroom and bartot is therejust arrived i suppose from paris he is terrifying her she sent me to fetch you  i saw louis lips curl into something which i can only describe as a snarl after that moment i never even partially trusted him again he looked like a wild animal one of those who creep through the hidden places and love to spring upon their prey unseen  so he muttered i come monsieur i come  he followed me out and into the restaurant as he passed along his features composed themselves he bent courteously toward me he even opened the door of the little smokingroom and insisted that i should precede him i stood on one side then while he went up to the pair i heard felicia give a little murmur of relief bartot turned round fiercely the two faced one another and it seemed to me that unutterable things passed between them they were like wild animals indeedlouis silent composed serene yet with a jaguarlike glare in his eyes his body poised as though to spring or defend himself as circumstances might dictate bartot who had risen to his feet was like a clumsy but powerful beast showing his fierce primitivism through the disguise of clothes and his falsely human form to me those few seconds were absolutely thrilling there was another man in the room who continued writing as though nothing were happening a couple of strangers passed through on their way to the bar and seemed to see nothing except the meeting of louisthe maitre dhotelwith a possible client felicia had let fall her veil so that her terror was no longer written in her face she had separated herself now from bartot and with an involuntary movement i came over to her side then the tension was suddenly broken it was louis who showed his teeth but it was with the razoredge of civility  monsieur bartot is very welcome he said speaking in french monsieur bartot has promised so often to make this visit and has always disappointed us  bartot was no match for this sort of thing his few muttered words at first were scarcely coherent louis bent towards him always with the same attitude of polite attention  if there is anything i can do he said softly monsieur has already without doubt selected his rooms it will give us great pleasure to see him in the cafe this evening  bartot commenced to talk but his voice was almost inaudible it was so thick with passion  i come to know what it means it is not for pleasure that i come to this villainous country i come to know what the game is i will be told mademoiselle hereshe tells me that her uncle has been lost and now that he is ill she will not let me see him  louis shrugged his shoulders  alas he said that i know is quite impossible monsieur delora was taken ill on the voyage over this gentleman he added turning to me will bear me out when i say this he is now in bed and a doctor is with him i am sorry but it would not be possible to have him disturbed  then i wait bartot declared folding his arms i wait till monsieur recovers  why not louis asked it is what we most desire we will do our best to make monsieur comfortable here  i felt felicias fingers press my arm i glanced towards her and she made a motion toward the door we moved off unnoticed and i rang the bell for the lift  oh capitaine rotherby she exclaimed once more you have come to my help i was so frightened at that man he did speak to me so angrily and he did not believe anything i told him indeed it is true that my uncle is ill you do not disbelieve that do you capitaine rotherby  the lift arrived a little opportunely for me then it stopped at the fifth floor  we must walk softly she said my uncle is asleep and the doctor says that he must not be wakened  you are going to have dinner with me i asked  i think so she answered yes i think so let us go somewhere a long way off take me somewhere quiet capitaine rotherby where i shall not see any one i know  i will i promised her put on a highnecked gown and a hat i will take you where there is plenty of music but few people we will get a quiet table and talk indeed i continued there are several things which i want to say to you miss delora  and i she murmured it will be delightful but step gently monsieur he must not be awakened  she pointed to that closed door and i looked steadfastly into her eyes it was not possible that she was acting i was convinced that she believed that her uncle was really in the next room  i call for you here i whispered at halfpast seven  i shall be ready she answered quite ready you must not be late or i shall be impatient oh she added with a little impulsive gesture i am beginning to hate this place i begin to long to escape from it forever i look forward so much to going awaythe further the better capitaine rotherby i shall be ready when you come goodbye     chapter xvii  a very special dinner   at seven oclock that evening i passed through the cafe on my way to the american bar there was already a good sprinkling of early diners there and louis was busy as usual directly he saw me however he came forward with his usual suave bow  the table in the lefthand corner he said is engaged for monsieur i have also taken the liberty of commanding a little dinner  but i am not dining here louis i protested  louis expression was one of honest surprise  monsieur is serious he inquired it is only a short time ago that i was talking with mademoiselle delora and she told me that she was dining with you here  i am dining with miss delora i answered but i certainly did not understand that it was to be here  louis smiled  perhaps he remarked mademoiselle had for the moment the idea of going away for dinner if so believe me she has changed her mind monsieur will see when he calls for her  i passed on thoughtfully there was something about this which i scarcely understood it seemed almost as though louis had but to direct and every one obeyed was i too becoming one of his myrmidons was i too to dine at his cafe because he had spoken the word  i made my way to number 157 precisely at halfpast seven felicia was waiting for me and for a moment i forgot to ask any questionsforgot everything except the pleasure of looking at her she wore a black lace gownbeautifully cut and modelled to perfection to reveal the delicate outline of her figurea rope of pearls and a large hat and veil arranged as only those can arrange them who have learnt how to dress in paris she looked at me a little anxiously  you like me she asked i will do  you are charming i answered you take my breath away indeed mademoiselle i have never dined with any one so charming  she dropped me a little curtsey then her face clouded over  there is something i have to ask she said looking at me ruefully do you mind if we dine downstairs  louis has already told me that it is your wish i answered  she picked up the train of her gown i fancied that she turned away in order that i should not see her face  he was so disappointed she murmured and he has been so kind i did not like to disappoint him  how is your uncle i asked  i have not yet been allowed to see him she answered but they tell me that he is better if he has a good night tonight tomorrow morning i may go to him  i certainly hope that he will have a good night i remarked shall we go down  if you are ready she answered there you shall carry my purse and handkerchief while i put on my gloves to put them on is foolish is it not when one does not leave the place still one must do these things  your purse is heavy i remarked swinging it on my finger  i carry always with me much money she answered it is my uncles idea some day i tell him one of us will be robbed he has always one or two hundred pounds in his pocket i have there fifty or sixty pounds it is foolish you think  i do i answered it rather seems like asking people to rob you  ah well they do not know she answered stepping into the lift i am hungry capitaine rotherby i have eaten so little today  louis has chosen the dinner himself i remarked so we shall probably find it everything that it should be  we found our way to the table which had been reserved for us escorted by one of louis subordinates louis himself was busy in the distance arranging the seating of a small dinnerparty he came up to us directly however the waiter was serving us with caviare  i hope you will enjoy very much your dinner he said bowing i have taken special pains with everything two dinners tonight i have ordered with my own lips from the chef one is yours and the other the dinner of our friend monsieur bartot  he pointed to a table a little distance away where monsieur bartot was already dining his back was towards usbroad and ugly with its rolls of fat flesh around the neck almost concealing the low collar  some day i remarked our friend monsieur bartot will suffer from apoplexy  it would not be surprising louis answered he is looking very flushed tonight the chef has prepared for him a wonderful dinner they say that he is never satisfied we shall see tonight  i looked away with a little gesture of disgust louis was summoned elsewhere a fact for which i was duly grateful  tell me miss delora i said how long have you known louis  oh for a very long time she answered a little evasively he is wonderful they all say there is no one quite like him a rich man has built a great restaurant in new york and he offered him his own price if he would go and manage it but monsieur louis said no he loves the continent he loves london he will not go so far away  monsieur louis has perhaps too other ties here i remarked dryly  she looked at me across the table meaningly  ah she said louishe does interest himself in many things he and my uncle always have had much to say to one another what it is all about i do not know but i heard my uncle say once that louis very soon would be as rich as he himself  tell me how long you thought of staying in london i asked  it is not sure she answered my uncles business may be settled in a few hours or it may take him weeks  the selling of his coffee i asked dryly  but certainly she answered  and from here you go to where i asked  back to paris she answered and then alas to south america it is to be buried  you have lived long in paris i asked  since i came there first to boardingschool she answered a little child i was with my hair in pigtails and frocks to my knees i have learned to think somehow that paris is my home what i have heard of south america i do not love i wish very much that my uncle would stay here  there is no chance of that i suppose i asked  i think not she answered in south america he is a very important man they speak of him one day as president  had you any idea i asked that he had enemies over here  she shook her head  it is not that she said we will not talk of it just now it is not that he has enemies but he has very very important business to arrange and there are some who do not think as he thinks about it shall we talk about something else capitaine rotherby tell me about your friends or relations and where you live i would like so much to know everything  i am afraid there is not much to tell i answered you see i am what is called over here a younger son i have a brother who owns the house in which i was born and all that sort of thing and i have had to go out into the world and look for my fortune so far i continued i cant say that i have been very successful  you are poor then she asked timidly  i am not rich i answered still on the whole i suppose for a bachelor i am comfortably off then my brother has no sons and his health is always delicate i do not count on that of course but i might have to succeed him  tell me his name she asked  lord welmington i answeredthe earl of welmington he is called  and you would be that she asked naively if he died  i should i answered but i should be very sorry to think that there was any chance of it i am going to find something to do very soon probably at one of the embassies on the continent the army at home with no chance of a war is dull work  you play games and shoot of course she asked like all your countrymen  i am afraid i do i admitted i have wasted a good deal of time the last few years i have made up my mind definitely now though that i will get something to do ralphthats my brotherwants me to stand for parliament for the division of norfolk where we live and has offered to pay all my expenses but i am afraid i do not fancy myself as a politician  i would come and hear you speak she murmured  thank you i answered but i have other accomplishments at which i shine more i would rather  i broke off in the middle of my sentence attracted by a sudden little exclamation from my companion there was the sound of a heavy fall close at hand i sprang to my feet  by jove its bartot i exclaimed  the man was leaning half across the table his arms stretched out in an unnatural fashionthe wine which he had overturned streaming on to the floor his face was flushed and blotchy his eyes were closed he was groaning quite audibly and gasping  empoisonne he muttered empoisonne  poisoned i repeated what does the fellow mean  i stopped short a sudden realization of what he did mean assailed me he was desperately ill there was no doubt about that the word which he had uttered seemed likely to be his last for some time to come they formed a sort of stretcher and carried him from the room felicia was sitting back in her chair white to the lips i was feeling a little queer myself i called louis who had been superintending the mans removal  louis i whispered in his ear there were two dinners which you prepared yourself tonight  louis smiled very quietly  you need have no anxiety monsieur he assured meno anxiety at all     chapter xviii  contrasts   we sat out in the foyer and took our coffee i did not suggest a visit to any place of entertainment as i knew it was better for felicia to retire early in order that i might pass through the sittingroom to her uncles room unheard the orchestra was playing delightful music the rooms were thronged with a gay and fashionable crowd nevertheless my companions spirits which had been high enough during dinner now seemed to fail her more than once during the momentary silence i saw the absent look come into her eyessaw her shiver as though she were recalling the little tragedy of a few minutes ago i had hitherto avoided mentioning it but i tried now to make light of the matter  i spoke to louis coming out i remarked the man bartot has only had a slight stroke with a neck like that i wonder he has not had it before  she found no consolation in my words she only shook her head sadly  you do not understand she said it is part of the game so it goes on capitaine rotherby she said looking at me with her sad eyes so it will go on to the end  come i said you must not get morbid  morbid she repeated it is not that it is because i know  do you believe then i asked that bartot was poisoned  she looked at me as though in surprise her eyes were like the eyes of a child  i know it she answered simply there is not any question about it at all  i listened to the music for several moments in silence once or twice i stole a glance at her notwithstanding a certain perfection of outline and a toilette which removed her wholly from any suggestion of immaturity there was yet something childish in the pale drawn facein the eyes with their look of fear my heart was full of sympathy for her such adventures as this one into which i seemed to have stumbled were well enough for men she at any rate was wholly out of place in her present position i had wild dreams at that moment the wine and the music and the absolute trustfulness with which she seemed for the moment to have committed herself to my keeping fired my blood i had thoughts of taking her hand in mine of bidding her leave the hotel that night that minute with meof taking her away into the country into some quiet place where we could be married and where none of these things which terrified her could throw their shadows across her life yet barely had the thought come to me before i realized how impossible it all was i too was an adventurer if i were not actually in the power of these men it was to them that i owed my liberty my own spirits began to fall it was a queer maze this into which i had been drawn  the music changed its note even as we sat there its languorous passionate rhythm passed away to be succeeded by the quicker cleaner notes of some old martial music it came to me like a cold douche i remembered that i had beenwas stilla soldier i remembered that my word was pledged to certain undertakings and that after all i was fighting on her side the momentary depression passed away i found myself able to talk more lightly until something of the old gayety came back to her also  tell me she said as at last we rose to vacate our placesyou spoke the other day of going down into the country  i am not leaving london just yet i said decidedly  if i had indeed made some great sacrifice i should have been rewarded by the brilliant look which she flashed up at me her eyes for a moment were absolutely the color of violets i heard people whisper as we passed by we said very little more to one another i left her at the lift and she gave me both her hands with a little impulsive gesture which i had already learned to look for then one of those inexplicable moods seemed to take possession of her as the lift shot away from me i saw that her eyes were full of tears  i made my way back to the cafe it was now almost deserted all but one or two very late diners had gone and the tables were being prepared for supper louis however was still there sitting at the desk by the side of the cashier and apparently making calculations he came forward when he saw me enter and we met by chance just as one of the undermanagers of the hotel passed by  what can i do for you this evening captain rotherby he asked with his usual bow a table for supper perhaps  i want some coffee i asked i want you to see that it is strong and well made  louis turned and gave an order to a waiter i sat down and he stood by my side  mademoiselle has gone to her room he asked  five minutes ago i answered  in an hour he said it will be safe for monsieur to go to mr deloras room you need not pass through the sittingroom at all there is a door into the bedroom connecting with the corridor if mademoiselle hears anything she will think that it is the doctor  i shall be quite ready i answered there are only one or two things i want to ask you one is this what explanation is to be given of my occupying that room if there is a row  there will not be a row louis answered coolly if monsieur is hurt i shall see to it that he is conveyed to his own apartment if any one who attacks him or tries to search the apartment should be hurt by monsieur i shall see too that they are removed quietly these things are easy enough the service through the night is almost abandoned monsieur may not know it but on the floor on which he sleeps there is not a single servant  supposing i ring my bell i asked  if it were answered at all louis said it would be by the lift man  on the whole i remarked it seems to me that the residential side of the hotel is admirably suited to the nocturnal adjustment of small differences  louis smiled  there has never been any trouble sir he said you see he added pointing to the clock it is now ten oclock in one hour monsieur should be there i have ordered whiskey and soda to be put in the room  shall i see anything of you louis i asked  it is not possible monsieur he answered i must be here until halfpast twelve or one oclock to attend to my supper guests  i leaned back in my chair and laughed silently it seemed to me a strange thing to speak so calmly of the service of the restaurant while upstairs i was to lie quiet my senses strained all the time and the chances of life and death dependent perhaps on the quickness of my right arm or some chance inspiration i saw the usual throng come strolling ini myself had often been one of themactresses who had not time to make a toilette for the restaurant proper actors managers agents performers from all the hundreds of pleasure houses which london boasts americans who had not troubled to dress frenchwomen who objected to the order prohibiting their appearance in hats elsewherea heterogeneous lighthearted crowd not afraid to laugh to make jokes certain to outstay their time supping frugally or au prince according to the caprice of the moment and upstairs i saw myself waiting in a darkened room for what i felt a thrill of something which i had felt just before the final assault upon ladysmith when we had drunk our last whiskey and soda thrown away our cigarettes and it had been possible to wonder for a moment whether ever again our lips would hold another only this was a very different matter i might be ending my days for all i knew on behalf of a gang of swindlers  louis i said it would make me much more comfortable if you could be a little more candid you might tell me in plain words what these men want from delora how am i to know that he is not the thief and these others are seeking only their own  louis was silent for a moment he glanced carelessly around the room to assure himself that there were no listeners  i can tell you no more sir he said for if i told you more i should tell you lies i will only remind you that you owe us a debt which i am asking you to pay and that it is the uncle of mademoiselle whose place you are taking  i am not in the least convinced i said that i am aiding the uncle of mademoiselle in allowing myself to be attacked in his place  as for that louis answered you shall be assured tomorrow and if you will there is another adventure still to be undertaken you shall go to see mr delora and be thanked with his own lips  there is some sense in that louis i allowed lighting another cigarette but i warn you i shall make him tell me the truth  louis smiled inscrutably  why not monsieur he said  tell me this at any rate louis i asked what is it that you hope for from this evening you believe that some one will break in with the idea of robbing or else murdering mr delora they will find me there instead what is it you hopethat they will kill me or that i shall kill them or what  that is a very reasonable question louis admitted i will answer it in the first place i would have them know that they have not all the wits on their side and if they plot we too can counterplot in the second place i wish you to see the man or the men face to face who make this attempt and be prepared if necessary to recognize them hereafter and in the third place there is one man to whom if he should himself make the attempt i should be very glad indeed if harm came of it  thank you louis i said i am not proposing to do murder if i can help it  one must defend ones self louis said  naturally i answered up to a certain point you have nothing more to tell me then  nothing sir louis answered calmly i wish you once more bonne fortune  i nodded and left the cafe of the hallporter i made an inquiry as to the man who had had a fit in the cafe earlier in the evening  the doctor has been to see him twice sir the man told me it was a sort of apoplectic stroke brought on by something which he had eaten  will he recover i asked  the doctor says it is serious the man answered but that with careful nursing he will pull round we have just sent a telegram to a lady in paris to come over  i smiled as i rang the bell for the lift so i might see my lady of the turquoises again     chapter xix  wheels within wheels   arrived in my room i changed my dresscoat for a smokingjacket and my patent shoes for loose slippers then i suddenly discovered that i had no cigarettes i glanced at the clock it was only halfpast ten i had still half an hour to spare  i locked up my room and descended by the lift to the entrance hall my friend the hallporter was standing behind his counter doing nothing  i wish you would send a boy into the cafe i said and ask louis to send me a box of my cigarettes  with pleasure sir the man answered by the bye he added louis is not there himself but i suppose any of the others would know the sort you smoke sir  not there i answered glancing at the clock ah i suppose it is a little early for him  he will not be there at all this evening the porter answered the second maitre dhotel was here a few minutes ago and told me so himself  not there at all i repeated do you mean to say that louis has a night off  certainly sir the man answered he has just gone out in his morning clothes  for a moment i was so surprised that i said nothing only a few minutes ago louis had gone out of his way to tell me that he would be on duty that night in the cafe all the time it was obviously a lie he would not have deceived me without a reason what was it i walked to the door and back again the hallporter watched me a little curiously  did you wish for monsieur louis particularly he said or shall i send to antoine for the cigarettes  i pulled myself together  send to antoine by all means i answered he knows what i want  i took up an evening paper and glanced at the news somehow or other i was conscious although i had had no exercise of feeling unusually sleepy when the boy returned with the cigarettes i thrust the box into my pocket unopened then i went to the smokingroom on my way upstairs and drank a stiff brandy and soda of one of the junior waiters whom i met i asked a question  do you know if monsieur louis will be here tonight i asked  no sir he answered he has just left  very well i answered you need not mention my inquiry  i gave the boy halfacrown and ascended once more to my room i was feeling a little more awake but incomprehensible though it might seem i began to have a curious idea concerning the coffee with which louis had served me i even rememberedor thought that i rememberedsome curious taste about it yet what object could louis have in drugging me just as i was on the point of entering into an enterprise on his behalf  i had a spiritlamp in my room and i made myself rapidly a cup of strong tea even after i had drunk it i still felt the remains of the drowsy feeling hanging around me it was now ten minutes to eleven and i opened my wardrobe to find the only weapon with which i proposed to arm myselfa heavily loaded malacca cane which had more than once done me good service to my surprise it was not in its accustomed corner i was perfectly certain that i had seen it since my return from paris and i proceeded to make a thoroughly methodical search i left scarcely an inch of space in my rooms undisturbed at last i was forced to come to the conclusion that the stick had gone either the valet or some one else must have borrowed it  it was eleven oclock by the time i had concluded my search and there was no time for me to make any further inquiries i locked up my rooms and descended to the fifth floor the corridor was empty and with the key which louis had given me i opened the door of mr deloras bedroom without difficulty the room was in darkness but the electriclight knob was against the wall i turned it on quickly there was neither any one in the room nor any evidence of it having been recently occupied t satisfied with my first inspection i looked into the wardrobe and lifted the curtains of the bed very soon i was assured that there was no one in hiding i sat down on the edge of the bed and began to consider how to pass the time for the next hour or so the whiskey and soda set out upon the table attracted my attention i went over to it struck by a sudden thought first i poured out a little of the whiskey it smelt harmless enough i tried it upon my tongue there was no distinctive flavor then i looked at the sodawater syphon the top was screwed up tightly enough and it easily came undone with the application of a little force i examined the screw i felt certain at once for some reason or other that it had been tampered with recently i poured a little of the sodawater into a glass it was quite flat and when i tasted it it had a peculiar flavor something seemed to have been added to it which destroyed altogether its buoyancy i screwed on the top again and whistled softly to myself the whiskey and soda had been placed there by louis he had even gone so far as to call my particular attention to it the coffee which i had drunk a little before had also been prepared by louis he was evidently taking no chances it was his intention that i should be asleep when the intruder whoever he might be should enter the room after all it seemed that i was in for something a little more complicated in the way of adventures than i had imagined i examined the lock of the door by which i had entered it worked easily and there was also a bolt on the inside the door was by its side which led into the sittingroom i also examined it and i saw with satisfaction that there was at the top a narrow glass transept which i carefully opened the sittingroom was in darkness so felicia had evidently retired for the night i sat down to wait  the time dragged on slowly enough as it might well have done under the circumstances i was waiting for somethingi had not the least idea what or in what form it would arrive i heard the quarters chime one after the other until one oclock then at last i heard the sound of a key in the outer door of the suite i had already poured half the syphon of soda and a fair quantity of the whiskey out of the window i now threw myself upon the bed closed my eyes and did my best to simulate a heavy sleep the person who entered the apartments came up the little outer passage until he reached the door leading into my room i heard that softly opened then there was a pause broken only by my heavy breathing some one was in the room and it was some one who had learned the art of absolute noiselessness i heard no footstepsnot even a mans breathing suddenly there was the click of the electric light and although i still heard nothing i felt that some one had approached a little way towards the bed i dared not open my eyes but in a restless movement which i felt i might safely make i raised my hand to shield me and caught a momentary glimpse of the person who was standing between me and the door as i expected it was louis he held the sodawater syphon in his hand as though measuring its contents i believe that he afterwards came and stood over me i dared not open my eyes again for i was none too good an actor and i feared that he might not be deceived the quantity of whiskey and soda however which i had apparently drunk must have satisfied him for he only stayed altogether about a minute in the room then he passed out into the sittingroom closing the door behind him and without noticing the open transept i lay quite still expecting that before long he would return there were no signs of his coming however though through the transept i could see that the light in the sittingroom had been turned on i rose softly from the bed and bolted both doors if louis were to make up his mind to return it was better after all for him to discover that i had been deceiving him than to have him come upon me unawares  from the top of a chair i was easily able to see through the transept into the sittingroom at my first glance i thought that it was empty then however i saw louis come in from the outer hall as though from the door of felicias room he came into the centre of the sittingroom and stood there waiting he was in dark morning clothes and there was no sign of that charming expression which his patrons found so attractive his brows were contracted his mouth seemed screwed together his peculiarcolored eyes shone like gimlets he seemed to be waiting impatientlywaiting for what once he moved a little and glanced expectantly toward the open door of the sittingroom for the first time a horrible fear gripped me i could scarcely stand in my place with both hands i held the cornice my heart began to thump against my ribs if it should be true then all of a sudden a little cry came to my lips which heaven knows how i stifled my eyes were suddenly hot there was a mist before them i could see nothing nothing save felicia who had entered the room in a dressingjacket with her hair still down her back it was nothing to me at that moment that her eyes were round with fear that she came as one comes who obeys the call of her master i was so furious with anger that i had hard work to battle with the impulse which prompted me to throw open the door and confront them both  louis is this wise she murmured  there are times he answered softly when one has to dare everything listen felicia  yes she murmured  in a short time you will hear a soft knocking on the outside door take no notice i shall open it it will be some one to see your uncle we shall talk in this sittingroom i hope that nothing will happen but if you hear the sound of blows or voices take no notice remain in your room till everything is quiet presently if all is well i shall knock three times on your door i may need your help  very well she answered and if you do not knock  he handed her a slip of paper  you have a telephone in your room he said ring up the number you will find there and simply repeat the words which i have written  is that all she asked  that is all  louis she saidthen she pointed in my directionmay i not go in just for one minute  no he answered it is not wise  it seems unkind she said to keep away from him all this time if he is ill  i did not know that you had so much affection for him louis remarked  why not she answered he was always kind to me in his way  there was a moments pause then she spoke again and her voice had in it a note of sharp inquiry  louis whose stick is that she demanded  i raised myself a little higher upon the table close to where louis was standing was a thick malacca cane which i recognized at once  mine louis answered shortly  are you sure she asked  whose did you suppose that it was he demanded  capitaine rotherby was carrying one just like it she declared i noticed it in the railway carriage  they are common enough louis answered this one at any rate is mine hush  they both for a moment seemed to be listening intently then louis pointed to the door  go back to your room he said in a low whisper go back at once and turn your key  she stole away when she was no longer in the room i could see more clearlyi could take account of other things distinctly i could hear now the soft knocking upon the outer door     chapter xx  a terrible night   louis disappeared from the room for the moment i heard the outer door softly opened and closed then he came back into the sittingroom followed by the man who had stood by our side at charing cross station the latter looked around the room quickly and seemed disappointed to find it empty  i understood that mr delora was here he said  mr delora is in his bedroom louis answered he is here and perfectly willing to see you but it is against the doctors orders and my instructions were that i was to warn you not to excite him you must speak slowly and you may have to repeat anything which you wish him to understand  who are you the newcomer asked  i am mr deloras servant louis answered  the newcomer looked a little puzzled  surely i have seen you before somewhere he exclaimed  it is very possible louis answered i am also a waiter in the cafe below but i come from south america and mr delora when he is over is always kind to me i spend most of my time now that he is ill up here looking after him  the newcomer shook his head thoughtfully  what is your name he asked  louis was the quiet answer  then my friend louis the newcomer said understand me plainly i am not here to be bamboozled or to give you an opportunity for exercising any ability you may possess in the art of lying i am here to see delora and if he is here see him i will and must if he is not here well it will come later there is no roof nor any walls in london which will enclose that man and keep him from me  mr delora has no desire to hide himself from any one louis answered calmly  that is a statement which i may be permitted to doubt the visitor answered is that the door of his sleeping chamber if so i am going in  he pointed to the door through the transept of which i was looking into the sittingroom louis moved on one side  that is mr deloras room he said softly perhaps you had better let me be sure that he is awake  you need not trouble the other answered if he is asleep i shall wake him if he is awake he will know very well that there is no escaping me  he turned away from louis his hand was already outstretched toward the handle of my door then i saw louis snatch the malacca cane from its place and swing it behind his body he was already poised for the blowa blow which would have killed any man breathingwhen i sprang to the ground and flung open the door  look out i cried  the newcomer sprang on one side louis disturbed by my cry lost his nerve and the blow fell upon a small side table smashing it through and sending splinters flying into the air both men looked at me in the blankest of amazement i came out into the sittingroom  you coward i said to louis  he shrank back against the wall he still held the stick in his hand but he showed not a sign of fight the other man stood with clenched fists as though about to spring upon him but i stepped between them  in the first place i said to the newcomer you had better look into that room you will see that mr delora is not there i can assure you from my own knowledge that he has never been there when you have finished come back and tell me what you want with him  louis was still staring at me in amazement the idea that i had discovered his attempt to make a catspaw of me was dawning upon him slowly but knowing nothing of the transept he could not account for my unexpected appearance for once at any rate he had lost his nerve i could see that he was shaking with fear  come louis i said put my stick down and talk like a man if you can  the stick fell from his fingers he had scarcely strength enough left to hold it then the man who had been examining deloras room came back and stepped past louis up to me  i do not know why you are here sir he said you may be mixed up in this affair or you may not be but if you are let me warn you that you are on the wrong side you saw his attempt he added pointing to louis i am going to wring the life out of him he deserves it  no i answered holding him back we will have no violence here louis has a little account to settle with me yet  he has a more serious one with me the other muttered  settle it when and where you will i said but not here as for me i have no longer any interest in or concern with any of you i came into this thing by accident and tonight i go out of it you sir must leave the hotel at once i do not know your name or anything about you it is not my concern if you have anything to say to louis choose another time  he looked at me curiously i could see that with every nerve in his body he was longing to spring upon louis  you seem to be a masterful person sir he said why should i obey you  because i saved your life for one thing i answered and because i will allow no violence in this room for another and if you need a third reason i added because i have the advantage of you in strength you need not be afraid of my further interference i continued i shall leave london tomorrow and i hope that i may never see one of you again now will you go  yes i will go he said let me tell you this sir he added as he neared the door your decision is a wise one if you knew whose cause you had been aiding whose tool you had very nearly become i think that your manner would be a little more apologetic  i have your word sir that you will leave the hotel i asked  at once the other answered  we heard him close the outer door and depart then i turned to louis  louis i said so this is your adventure this is the way you proposed to make use of me you got me into that room and drugged me i was to lie there while you murdered that man with my weapon then you would creep away and in the morning there was i and the dead man i was to be the toolthe girl there the lure it was well worked out louis but it was a cowards plan and a cowards trick  i reached out my hand and took him by the collar i felt as though i were grasping some unclean insect from whom the sting might shoot out at any moment  have you anything to say i asked  you do not understand he said in a low tone i did not mean to put this thing upon you i meant perhaps to disable that man who has just left if you knew his history and mine you would not wonder at it but i meant to see that he was safely removed  then why did you bring me down into that room i asked under a false pretence why did you use that murderous cane of mine for your crime why did you insist upon it that i should be seen dining with the girlgod knows who she iswho is in that room  i can explain everything louis said i am confused i cannot help ityou came so unexpectedly  unexpectedly indeed i answered because i poured your whiskey and soda out of the window and because i took an antidote to your coffee  you speak of things which i do not understand louis declared  oh tell me no more lies i exclaimed listen you see i have you by the collar and i have my cane now i am going to beat you till every bone in your body aches till you will not be able to crawl about until you tell me the real history of these things for every lieif i know it to be a liei shall strike you tell me who that man delora is tell me who the girl is posing as his niece who meets you here after midnight tell me the name of that man who has just left us tell me how you are all bound together and what your quarrel is and tell me where delora is now  i have no strength he gasped you are too rough let me sit down quietly i must think  no i answered speak speak now  i raised the stick as though to strike him then i saw a sudden change in his face i looked toward the door almost as i did so i heard the faint flutter of moving draperies felicia stood there looking in upon us her hands uplifted her face full of terror  it is capitaine rotherby she cried tell me then what has happened capitaine rotherby  she came a little toward us but i think that she read in my face something of what i was feeling for she stopped suddenly and her lips quivered  what has happened she demanded will neither of you tell me is my uncle worse has any oneany one tried to do him an injury  nothing is the matter i answered except that we have come to an end of this tissue of lies and plots and counterplots there is no uncle of yours in that room nor ever has been the man who was to have been murdered here has gone and for the rest i saw you here with louis and i heard your conversation less than an hour ago  you saw us she gasped  from the transept there i answered pointing towards it i was brought into that room to personate your uncle to receive an attack which was meant for hima very clever scheme i was drugged and was to have lain there to cover this fellows crime but there i dont suppose that i need tell you any of these things i added brutally  she looked at me with horror  you do not believe she gasped  oh i believe nothing i answerednothing at all every word i have been told by both of you is a lie your lives are lies god knows why i should ever have believed otherwise i said looking at her  let me go louis pleaded and you shall hear the truth  i shall be more likely to feel the knife you have in your pocket i answered contemptuously for i had seen his left hand struggling downward for the last few moments oh ill let you go i have no interest in any of youno interest in your cursed conspiracy whatever it may be keep your story i dont care to hear it lie there and talk to your accomplice  i sent him reeling across the room till he fell in the corner then i walked out closing the sittingroom door behind meout into the corridor and up the stairs into my own room then i locked and bolted my own door and looked at my watch it was a quarter to three i took a bradshaw from my bookcase packed a few clothes myself set an alarm clock for seven oclock in the morning and turned into bed i told myself that i would not think i told myself that there was no such person in the world as felicia that she had never lived that she was only part of this nightmare from which i was freeing myself i told myself that i would go to sleep and i stayed awake until daylight all the time there was only one thought in my brain     chapter xxi  a change of plans   at a few minutes past nine on the following morning i was standing outside the front door of the court watching the piling of my luggage on to a fourwheel cab the hallporter stood by my side superintending the efforts of his myrmidons  you had better send my letters on i told him i am going down into norfolk for several weeksperhaps longer  very good sir he answered by the bye he added turning away this mornings letters have just arrived there was one for you i think  he handed it to me and i tore it open as i stepped on to the pavement it was written from feltham court norfolk and dated the previous day      my dear austen      i send you a hurried line in case you should be thinking of coming     down here i have decided to come up to london for a few weeks     and have lent the court to lady mary with the exception of the     shooting which is reserved for you if you are in town do look     me up at claridges      ever yours      ralph  i was on the point of having the cab unloaded and reconsidering my plans suddenly however like an inspiration there flashed into my mind the thought that it would not perhaps be such a very bad thing if under the circumstances i kept my altered plans to myself so i stuffed the letter into my pocket and stepped into the fourwheeler  you understand ashley i said send everything on to feltham courtcards letters or anything  perfectly sir the man answered i hope you will have a pleasant time sir  tell the cabman liverpool street i ordered and got in  we rolled out of the courtyard and i drove all the way to liverpool street as though to catch my train arrived there however i deposited my luggage in the cloakroom and drove back to claridges in a hansom i found that my brother was installed in a suite of rooms there and his servant who came into the sittingroom to me at once told me that he believed they were up for at least a month  his lordship has nearly finished dressing sir he added he will be in in a few minutes  i took up the morning paper but found nothing of interest there then my brother came in leaning heavily on two sticks and moving slowly he was not more than ten years older than i was but the shock of his accident and subsequent sufferings had aged him terribly his hair had gone prematurely gray and his face was deeply lined i stepped forward and took him by the hand  my dear ralph i said this is really firstclass the last time i saw you you scarcely expected to be out of your bathchair in six months  i am getting on austen he answered thanks i am getting on i will sit in that easychair for a few minutes thanks then we will have some breakfast  i was starting for feltham this morning i told him when i got your letter  when did you get back from paris he asked  three or four days ago i answered  he raised his eyebrows  i know that i ought to have come at once i said but there were several things in london i found it hard to get away  well he said  i met tapilow face to face at a little french cafe i told him they tell me that he will recover but he is maimed and scarred for life  my brother showed no excitementscarcely even any interest in my information his face however had darkened  i am glad that you did not kill him outright he said tell me are you likely to get into any trouble for this  no i assured him the affair happened in a very dubious sort of place i dont think i shall hear anything more about it unless from tapilow himself  ralph nodded  we will close the chapter he said  you have no news  none he interrupted me shortly we will close the chapter  so i spoke to him no more on his own affairs his servant brought in the letters and papers poked the fire and announced that breakfast was ready  you will have something austen he asked  i have only had a continental breakfast i answered i dare say i can manage to eat something  i have a letter from dicky he remarked later on asks me to be civil if i can to some people who have been remarkably kind to him out in brazil they have an estate there  i nodded  dicky doing all right i asked  seems to be ralph answered  dicky was our younger brother and rather a wanderer  what is the name of the people who are coming over i asked  some odd name ralph answereddelora i think  ralph had drawn the times towards him and he did not notice my start i sat looking at him in blank amazement  ralph i said presently  my brother looked up  have you got dickys letter on you i asked  he passed it over to me i skimmed through the first part until i came to the sentence which interested me      i have been out staying at an awfully fine estate here right on     the pampas it belongs to some people called delora one of the     brothers is just off to europe on some government business and     will be in london for a few days with his niece i expect he is     going to stay at the milan hotel and it would be awfully good of     you if you would look him up or drop him a line they really have     been very kind to me out here  i pushed the letter back to ralph  have you done anything yet i asked about this  ralph shook his head  i thought you would not mind calling for me he remarked i would like to be civil to any one who has done anything for dicky if he shoots you might take him down to the court marys there of course but that would not matter there is the whole of the bachelor wing at your disposal  i nodded  i will look after it for you i said you can leave it in my hands it is rather an odd thing but i believe that i have met this man in paris  my brother was not much interested i was glad of the excuse to bury myself in the pages of the daily telegraph here at last then was something definite the man delora was not a fraud he was everything that he professed to bea wealthy man without a doubt i suddenly began to see things differently what a coward i had been to think of running away after all there might be some explanation even of that meeting between the girl and louis  we finished our breakfast and my brother hobbled over to the window for several minutes he remained there looking out upon the street with the aimless air of a man who scarcely knows what to do with his day  what are you thinking of doing austen he asked me  i had no plans i answered some part of the day i thought i would look up these peoplethe deloras  ralph nodded and turned to his servant  goreham he said i will have the motor in an hour come and dine with me will you austen he said turning to me i dont suppose you will go down to feltham for a day or two  i will come with pleasure i answered where are you going to motor to  ralph answered a little vaguely he had some calls to make and he was not altogether sure i left him in a few minutes and descended to the street i turned westward and walked for some little distance when suddenly i was attracted by the sight of a familiar figure issuing from the door of a large gray stone house we came face to face upon the pavement it was the man whose life i had probably saved only a few hours ago  he lifted his hat and his dark eyes sought mine interrogatively  you were not by chance on the way to call upon me he asked  i shook my head  not only i answered was i ignorant of where you lived but i do not even know your name  both matters he remarked quietly are unimportant  i glanced at the house from which he had issued  it would seem i remarked that you have diplomatic connections  why not he answered indeed he continued thoughtfully i do not see captain rotherby why my name should remain a secret to you  he drew a card from his pocket and handed it to me i read it with illconcealed curiosity      mr alfonse lamartine      brazilian legation      12 porchester square  you are a south american i asked quickly  by birth he answered i have lived chiefly in paris and here in london  you knew mr delora at brazil then i asked  i know the family quite well he answered they are very influential people i have told you my name captain rotherby he continued because i see no reason why we two should not be frank with one another i am of necessity interested in the movements and doings of mr delora and his niece you he continued appear to have been drawn a little way into the mesh of intrigue by which they are surrounded  i drew my arm through his we were walking now side by side  look here i said you were quite right in what you said there is no reason why we should have secrets from one another tell me about these people and why on earth they have any connections at all with persons of the class of louis and those others  my companion spread out his hand he stopped short on the pavement and gesticulated violently  it is you who ask me these things he exclaimed yet it is from you i hoped to obtain information i know nothingabsolutely nothing simply my instructions were to meet mr delora on his arrival in london to show him every possible civility and to assist him in any purpose where my help would be useful i go to meet himhe has disappeared i haunt his roomshe has not returned his niece knows nothing i try to force my way into his rooms and my life is attempted  wait a moment i said you spoke of instructions from whom do you receive them  from my government he answered a little shortly mr delora has some private business of importance here in england in which they are interested  do you know anything of his niece i asked  nothing whatever the young man answered except that she seems a very charming young lady and will i believe inherit a great fortune  do you know of any enemies that he might have i asked for instance is this business of his connected with any affairs which might bring him into touch with such people as louis and his associates  i will be frank with you the young man said i do not know what his business was neither curiously enough does my chief my instructions simply were to meet him and to see him day by day you yourself can judge how well i have succeeded  have you been to the police i asked  i have not lamartine answered we have written out to brazil explaining the circumstances and asking for a cablegram in reply by the bye he continued a little diffidently did it strike you last night that miss delora must have been associated with that blackguard louis in his little attempt upon me  i do not believe anything of the sort i answered shortly  the young man smiled cynically  it is perhaps natural he answered  you are not seriously suggesting i asked that a young lady in the position of miss delora would descend to scheming with a headwaiter  captain rotherby my companion said i do not know anything i do not understand anything i only know that the delora business has puzzled mehas puzzled my chief we have important communications for mr delora and he cannot be found  it is not possible i declared for a man to disappear in london  a man may disappear anywhere lamartine said dryly when such people as louis are interested in him however we do no good by comparing notes when we neither of us know anything if i should gain any information of mr deloras whereabouts  i gave him my card quickly  we will exchange our news i assured him it is a promise  he bowed and left me with a little farewell wave of the hand     chapter xxii  a formal call   i changed my mind about calling at the milan that morning but toward five oclock in the afternoon i presented myself there and gave the hallporter my card to send up to miss delora he received me with some surprise but i explained that i had been obliged to postpone my visit into the country  miss delora has asked twice about you this morning sir he announced i gave her your country address  quite right i answered by the bye is mr delora visible yet  not yet sir the man answered rather a curious thing about his return sir he added not a soul has even seen him yet  i nodded but made no remark presently the boy who had taken my card up returned  miss delora would be glad if you would step upstairs sir he announced  i followed him into the lift and up to number 157 felicia was there alone she rose from the couch as i entered and waited until the door had closed behind the disappearing page then she held out her hands and there was something in her eyes which i could not resist i was suddenly ashamed of all my suspicions  so you have come back she said softly that is very kind of you capitaine rotherby i have been lonelyvery lonely indeed  i have come back i answered taking her hands into mine and holding them for a moment  i am nervous all the time and afraid she continued standing close by my side and looking up only think of it capitaine rotherbyit is this journey to london to which i have been looking forward for so many many years and now that it has come i am miserable  your uncle i asked  they told me what was not true she exclaimed he is not back i am here all alone he does not come to me and he will not let me go to him but you will sit down capitaine rotherby she added you are not in a hurry you are not going away again  not just yet at any rate i admitted do you know that after all this is a very small world i have come to pay you a formal call on behalf of my brother who is an invalid  her eyes grew round with surprise  but i do not understand she said  i told her of my brothers letter from south america she listened with interest which seemed mingled with anxiety  it is very strange she said when i had finishedvery delightful too of course she added hurriedly tell me is it my uncle maurice or my uncle ferdinand of whom your brother spoke most in his letter  he did not mention the christian names of either i told her he simply said that one of the mr deloras and his niece were coming to london and he begged us to do all we could to make their visit pleasant do you know i continued that as i came along i had an idea  yes she exclaimed  why shouldnt you come down into the country i said to my aunts she will send you a telegram at once if i tell her to and we could all stay together down at felthammy brothers house in norfolk you are out of place here you are not enjoying yourself and you are worried to death beside which i added more slowly you are mixed up with people with whom you should have nothing whatever to do  if only i could she murmured if only i could  why not i said mr delora comes here with an introduction which precludes my criticising his friends or his connections however strange they may be but it is very certain that you ought not to be left here alone to rely upon the advice of a headwaiter to be practically at the beck and call of men of whose existence you should be unconscious i want you to make up your mind and come away with me  a little flush of color stole into her cheeks and her eyes danced with excitement  i do no good here she exclaimed why not you too capitaine rotherbyyou would come  i would take you there i answered and i would do my best my very best to keep you entertained  i shall ask she exclaimed tonight i shall ask  ask whom i inquired louis  she shook her head  my uncle she answered  you will not see him i exclaimed  he will telephone she answered he has promised  i reached over towards her and took her hands into mine  felicia i said boldly i am your friend the letter i have told you of should prove that i am only anxious for your good tell me what reason your uncle can have for behaving in this extraordinary way for allowing himself to be associated even for a moment with such people as louis and his friends  everything that it had made me so happy to see in her face died away she was once more wan and anxious  i cannot tell you she saidi cannot because i dare not i have promised only remember this my uncle has lived in paris for so many years  but i thought that he had just come from south america i interrupted  yes but before that she explained breathlesslybefore that he loves the mysterious he likes to be associated with strange people and i do believe too she continued that he has business just now which must be kept secret for the sake of other people oh i know it must all seem so strange to you wont you believe capitaine rotherby that i am grateful for your kindness and that i would tell you if i could  i must i answered with a sigh i must believe what you tell me listen then i shall wait until you hear from your uncle  have you come back to your rooms she asked timidly  i shall do so i announced but i hope that it will be only for the night tomorrow if all goes well we may be on our way to norfolk  there was a knock at the door she started and looked at me a little uneasily almost immediately the door was pushed open it was louis who entered bearing a menu card he addressed me with a little air of surprise i was at once certain that he had known of my visit and had come to see what it might mean  monsieur has returned very soon he remarked bowing pleasantly  my journey was not a long one louis i answered what have you brought that thing for i continued pointing to the menu card do you want an order for dinner miss delora is dining elsewhere with me  my tone was purposely aggressive louis manners however remained perfection  miss delora has engaged a table in the cafe he said i have come myself to suggest a little dinner i trust she will not disappoint us  she looked at me pathetically there was something which i could not understand in her face only i knew that whatever she might ask me i was prepared to grant  will you not stay and dine here with me she said louis will give us a very good dinner and afterwards i shall have my message and i shall know whether i may go or not  the humor of the idea appealed to me there was suddenly something fantastic unbelievable in the events of last night  with pleasure i answered  louis bowed and for a moment or two seemed entirely engrossed in the few additions he was making to the menu he carried then he handed it to me with a little bow  there monsieur he said i think that you will find that excellent  i have no doubt that we shall louis i answered i will only ask you to remember one thing  and that monsieur he asked  i dine with mademoiselle i said and our appetites are identical  louis smiled there were times when i suspected him of a sense of humor  monsieur has not the thick neck of bartot he murmured as he withdrew     chapter xxiii  felicia   it seemed to me that felicia that night was in her most charming mood she wore a dress of some soft white material and a large black hat under which her facea little paler even than usualwore almost a pathetic aspect her fingers touched my arm as we entered the restaurant together she seemed in a way to have lost some of her selfcontrolthe exclusiveness with which she had surrounded herselfand to have become at once more natural and more girlish i noticed that she chose a seat with her back to the room and i understood her reason even before she told me  i think she said that tonight it would be pleasant to forget that there is any one here who disturbs me i think it would be pleasant to remember only that this great holiday of mine which i have looked forward to so long has really begun  you have looked forward to coming to london so much i asked  yes she answered i have lived a very quiet life capitaine rotherby after the sisters had finished with meand i stayed at the school longer than any of the othersi went straight to the house of a friend of my uncles where i had only a dame de compagnie my unclehe was so long coming and the life was very dull but always he wrote to me some day i will take you to london even when we were in paris together he would tell me that  tell me i asked what is your uncles christian name  i have three uncles she said after a moments hesitationmaurice ferdinand and nicholas nicholas lives all the time in south america maurice and ferdinand are often in paris  and the uncle with whom you are now i asked  i seemed to have been unfortunate in my choice of a conversation her eyes had grown larger the quivering of her lips was almost pitiful  i am a clumsy ass i interrupted quickly i am asking you questions which you do not wish to answer a little later on perhaps you will tell me everything of your own accord but tonight i shall ask you nothing we will remember only that the holiday has begun  she drew a little sigh of relief  you are so kind she murmured so very kind indeed i do not want to think of these things which i do not understand and which only puzzle me all the time we will let them alone is it not so we will let them alone and talk about foolish things or you shall tell me about london and the countrytell me what we will do indeed i may go down to your home in norfolk  i think you will like it there i said it is too stuffy for london these months my brothers house is not far from the sea there is a great park which stretches down to some marshes and beyond that the sands  can one bathe she asked breathlessly  of course i answered there is a private beach and when we have people in the house at this time of the year we always have the motorcar ready to take them down and back that is for those who bathe early later on it is only a pleasant walk then you can learn games if you likegolf and tennis cricket and croquet  i should be so stupid she said with a little regretful sigh in france they did not teach me those things i can play tennis a little but oh so badly and in england she continued you think so much of your games tell me capitaine rotherby will you think me very stupid in the country if i can do nothing but swim a little and play tennis very badly  rather not i answered there is the motor you know i could take you for some delightful drives we should find plenty to do i am sure and i promise you that if only you will be as amiable as you are here i shall not find any fault  you will like to have me there she asked  her question came with the simplicity of a child she laughed softly with pleasure when i leaned over the table and whispered to her  better than anything else in the world  i am not sure capitaine rotherby she said looking at me out of her great eyes whether you are behaving nicely  if i am not i declared it is your fault you should not look so charming  she laughed softly  and you should not make such speeches to a poor little foreign girl she said who knows so little of your london ways  louis stood suddenly before us we felt his presence like a cold shadow the laughter died away from her eyes and i found it difficult enough to address him civilly  monsieur is well served he asked everything all right eh  everything is very good as usual louis i answered the only thing that is amiss you cannot alter  for example he asked  the atmosphere i answered it is no weather for london  monsieur is right he admitted he is thinking of departing for the country soon  it depends a little upon mademoiselle i answered  louis shook his head very slowly he had the air of a man who discusses something with infinite regret  it would be very delightful indeed he said if it were possible for mademoiselle to go into norfolk to your brothers house it would be very good for mademoiselle but i am not surei fear that her uncle  how the mischief did you know anything about it i asked in amazement  louis smiledthat subtle halfconcealed smile which seemed scarcely to part his lips  why should not mademoiselle have told me he asked  but i have not she declared suddenly i have not seen louis since you were here this afternoon capitaine rotherby  louis extended his hands  it is true he admitted it is not from mademoiselle that i had the news but there one cannot tell things may alter at any moment it may be very pleasant for monsieur delora that his niece is able to accept this charming invitation  so you have been in communication with mr delora louis i asked  naturally louis answered he told me of mademoiselles request he told me that he had promised to reply at ten oclock this evening  perhaps you can tell us i remarked what that reply will be  louis face remained absolutely expressionless he only shook his head  mr delora is his own master he said it may suit him to be without mademoiselle or it may not pardon monsieur  louis was gone but he had left his shadow behind  he does not think she murmured that i may come  felicia i said  but i did not say that you might call me felicia she interrupted  then do say so i begged  for this evening then she assented  for this evening then felicia i continued i do not wish to worry you by talking about certain things but do you not think yourself that your uncle is very inconsiderate to leave you here alone on your first visit to londonnot to come near the place or provide you with any means of amusement why should he hesitate to let you come to us  we will not talk of it she begged a little nervously i must do as he wishes we will hope that he says yes will we not  he must say yes i declared if he doesnt ill find out where he is somehow and go and talk to him  she shook her head  he is very much engaged she said he would not like you to find him out nor would he have any time to talk to you  selling his coffee i could not help saying  tonight capitaine rotherby she answered softly we do not talk of those things tell me what else we shall do down at your brothers house  we shall go for long walks i told her there are beautiful gardens therea rose garden more than a hundred years old and at the end of it a footpath which leads through a pine plantation and then down to the sea marshes we can sit and watch the sea and talk and when you find it dull we will fill the house with young people and play games and dancedance by moonlight if you like or we can go fishing i continued there is a small yacht there and a couple of sailingboats  she listened as though afraid of losing a single word  tell me i asked have you been lonely all your life child  all my life she answered and somehow or other her voice seemed to me full of tears so that i was almost surprised to find her eyes dry yes i have always been lonely she murmured my uncle has been kind to me but he has always some great scheme on hand and madame mullershe would be kind if she knew how i think but she is as though she were made of wood she has no sympathy she does not understand  i wonder i said reflectively what made your uncle bring you here  it was a promise she said hurriedlya promise of long ago you yourself must know that your letter from your brother in south america said mr delora and his niece  it is true i admitted but why he should want to bring you and then neglect you like thisbut i forgot i interrupted we must not talk so tell me you have been often to the theatre in paris  very seldom she answered and i love it so much madame muller and i go sometimes but where we live is some distance from paris and it is difficult to get home afterwards especially for us two alone my uncle takes us sometimes but he is generally so occupied  he is often in paris then i asked  she started a little  yes she said hurriedly he is often there of course but please do not forgettonight we do not talk about my uncle we talk about ourselves may i ask you something  certainly i answered  if my uncle says nothat i may not comedo you go away altogether then tomorrow  no i answered i do not i shall not leave you alone here so long as you stay i shall remain in london  she drew a little breath and with a quick impetuous movement her hand stole across the table and pressed mine  it is so good of you she murmured  i am afraid that it is selfishness felicia i answered i should not care to go away and leave you here i am beginning to find i added that the pleasures in life which do not include you count for very little  you will turn my head she declared with a delightful little laugh  it is the truth i assured her  i am quite sure now she murmured that my great holiday has commenced     chapter xxiv  a tantalizing glimpse   felicia laid down the receiver and looked at me there was scarcely any need for words her disappointment was written into her white face  you are not to come i said  i am notto come she repeated after all my holiday is not yet  will you tell me i asked where i can find your uncle  she shook her head  you must not ask me such a thing she declared  remember i said that i have really called to make his acquaintance as a matter of courtesy on behalf of my brother what excuse do you give me for his absence tell me what it is that you are supposed to say in such a case  simply that he is away for a few days engaged in the most important business she answered he will rejoin me here directly it is settled  and in the meantime i said thoughtfully you are left in a strange hotel without friends without a chaperon absolutely unprotected and with only a headwaiter in your confidence felicia there is something very wrong here i am not sure i continued that it is not my duty to run away with you  she clasped her hands  delightful she murmured but i mustnt think of it she added with a sudden gravity nor must you talk to me like that what my uncle says is best to be done he knows and understands if he has had to leave me here alone it is because it is necessary  you have a great deal of faith in him i remarked  he has always been kind to me she answered and i know that the business upon which he is engaged just now is hazardous and difficult there are men who do not wish it to go through and they watch for him if they knew his whereabouts they would try to stop him  felicia do you know what that business is i asked  i have some idea of it she answered  her answer puzzled me if felicia really had any idea as to the nature of it and was content to play the part she was playing it certainly could not be anything of an illicit nature yet everything else which had come under my notice pointed to deloras being associated with a criminal undertaking i paced the room deep in thought felicia all the time was watching me anxiously  you are not going to leave me she asked very softly  i came to a standstill before her  no felicia i said i am not going to leave you but i want to tell you this i am going to try and find out for myself the things which you will not tell me no you must not try to stop me i said anticipating the words which indeed had trembled upon her lips it must be either that or farewell felicia i cannot remain here and do absolutely nothing i want to find your uncle and to have some sort of an explanation from him and i mean to do it  she shook her head  there are others who are trying to find him she said but i do not think that they will succeed the young man who was here the other night for instance  if i fail i fail i answered at any rate i shall be doing something i must go back to my brothers tonight felicia because i have promised to stay with him in a day or two i shall return to my rooms here and i shall do my best to find out the meaning of your uncles mysterious movements it may seem impertinent to you to interfere in anybody elses concerns i cannot help it it is for your sake the present position is impossible  you are not staying here tonight she asked  tonight no i answered i will let you know directly i return  there is one thing else capitaine rotherby could you promise it to me i wonder  i will try i answered  do not quarrel any more if you can help it she begged with louis  her question forced a laugh from my lips quarrel with louis indeed what more could i do in that direction then i frowned in temporary annoyance i hated to hear her speak of him as a person to be considered  louis is a venomous little person i said but i certainly should not quarrel with him more than i can help i am unfortunately in his debt or i should have dealt with him before now  i glanced at the clock and jumped up it was very much later than i had thought she gave me her hands a little wistfully  i do not like to think of you here alone i said i wish that i could persuade you to engage a maid  she shook her head  my uncle would not allow it she said simply he says that servants are always prying into ones concerns good night capitaine rotherby thank you so much for taking me out this evening after all i cannot help feeling that it has been rather like the beginning of this holiday  i held her hands tightly in mine  when it really begins i answered i shall try and make it a little more interesting  i declined a taxicab and turned to walk back to my brothers hotel certainly in the problem of these two people who had come so curiously into my life there was very much to give me matter for thought i believed in the girl and trusted her more than that i did not dare to ask myself i should have believed in her even if her uncle were proved to be a criminal of the most dangerous type but none the less i could not help realizing that her present position was a singularly unfortunate one to be alone in a big hotel without maid or chaperon herself caught up in this web of mystery which louis and those others seemed to have woven around her was in itself undesirable and unnatural whatever was transpiring i was quite certain that her share in it was a passive one she had been told to be silent and she was silent nothing would ever make me believe that she was a party to any wrongdoing and yet the more i thought of delora the less i trusted him at charing cross station for instance his had not been the anxiety of a man intrusted with a difficult mission his agitation had been due to fearfear abject and absolute i had seen the symptoms more than once in my life and there was no mistaking them i told myself that no man could be so shaken who was engaged in honest dealings even now he was in hidingit could not be called anything elseand the one person with whom i had come in touch who was searching for him was without a doubt on the side of law and justice with at least some settled position behind him deloras deportment was more the deportment of a fugitive from justice than of a man in the confidence of his government  walking a little carelessly i took a turn too far northward and found myself in one of the streets leading out of shaftesbury avenue i was on the point of taking a passage which would lead me more in my proper direction when my attention was attracted by a large motorcar standing outside one of the small foreign restaurants which abound in this district i was always interested in cars but i noticed this one more particularly from the fact of its utter incompatibility with its surroundings it was one of the handsomest cars i had ever seena sixty to eighty horsepower daimlerfitted up inside with the utmost luxury the panels were plain and the chauffeur who sat motionless in his place wore dark livery and was apparently a foreigner i slackened my pace to glance for a moment at the nonskidding device on the back tire and as i passed on i saw the door of the little restaurant open and a tall commissionnaire hurried out he held open the door of the car and stood at attention two men issued from the restaurant and crossed the pavement i turned deliberately round to watch themvulgar curiosity perhaps but a curiosity which i never regretted the first mantall and powerfulwore the splendid dress and black silk cap of a chinese of high rank the man who followed him was delora i knew him in a second although he wore a white silk scarf around his neck concealing the lower part of his face and a silk hat pushed down almost over his eyes i saw his little nervous glance up and down the street i saw him push past the commissionnaire as though in a hurry to gain the semiobscurity of the car i stopped short upon the pavement motionless for one brief and fatal moment then i turned back and hastened to the side of the car i knocked at the window  delora i said i must speak to you  the car had begun to move i wrenched at the handle but i found it held on the inside with a grip which even i could not move i looked into the broad expressionless face of the chinaman who leaning forward completely shielded the person of the man with whom i sought to speak  one moment i called out i must speak with mr delora i have a message for him  the car was going faster now i tried to jump on to the step but the first time i missed it then the window was suddenly let down the chinamans arm flashed out and struck me on the chest so that i was forced to relinquish my grasp of the handle i reeled back preserving my balance only by a desperate effort before i could start in pursuit the car had turned into the more crowded thoroughfare and when i reached the spot where it had disappeared a few seconds later it was lost amongst the stream of vehicles  i went back to the restaurant it was like a hundred others of its classstuffy smelly reminiscent of the poorer business quarters of a foreign city a waiter in a greasy dresssuit flicked some crumbs from a vacant table and motioned me to sit down i ordered a fin champagne and put halfacrown into his hand  tell me i said five minutes ago a chinaman and another man were here  the man laid the halfcrown down on the table his manner had undergone a complete change  perhaps so sir he answered we have been busy tonight i noticed nobody  i called the proprietor to mea little palefaced man with a black moustache who had been hovering in the background he hastened to my side smiling and bowing this time i did not ask him a direct question  i am interested in the restaurants of this quarter i said some one has told me that your dinner is marvellous  he smiled a little suspiciously the word was perhaps unfortunate  i am bringing some friends to try it very soon i said  the waiter brought my fin champagne i drank it and ordered a cigar  you have all sorts of people here i remarked i noticed a chinamanhe was very much like the chinese ambassador by the byeleaving as i came in  the proprietor extended his hands  we have people of every class monsieur he assured me one comes and tells his friends and they come and so on i believe that there was a chinese gentleman here tonight one does not notice we were busy  i paid my bill and departed the commissionnaire pushed open the door whistle in hand he looked at me a little curiously without doubt he had watched my attempt to speak to delora i drew a halfsovereign from my pocket  tell me i said do you want to earn that  he was a german with a large pasty face and a yellow moustache his eyes were small and they seemed to contract with greed as they looked upon the coin  sir he answered with a bow  who was the chinese gentleman with the splendid motorcar i asked  the man spread out his hands  who can tell he said he dined here tonight in a private room  a private room well that was something at any rate  you do not know his name or where he comes from i asked  the man shook his head glancing nervously towards the interior of the restaurant  the other gentleman i asked  i do not know his name sir the man declared with emphasis he has been here once or twice but always alone  i put the halfsovereign in my pocket and drew out a sovereign the man stretched out an eager hand which he suddenly dropped he pointed down the street the swing door of the restaurant remained closed but over the soiled white curtain i also could see the face of the proprietor peering out  it is the second turn to the left the man said to me  and if you want that sovereign made into five i said carelessly my name is captain rotherby and i am going from here to claridges hotel  i walked down the street and left him looking after me at the corner i glanced around the proprietor and the commissionnaire were talking together on the pavement     chapter xxv  private and diplomatic   the following evening i dined alone with my brother who was for him in an unusually cheerful frame of mind he talked with more interest of life and his share in it than he had doneto me at any ratesince the tragedy which had deprived him of a home toward the end of dinner i asked him a question  ralph i said how could i meet the chinese ambassador here  he stared at me for a moment  why at any of the diplomatic receptions i suppose he said seeing that i was in earnest he is rather a pal of freddys why dont you ring up and ask him  i will the moment after dinner i answered  why this sudden interest in orientalism ralph asked curiously  curiously enough it is apropos of these deloras i answered i called today but only found the girl in the man i saw later with a chinaman whom i believe to be the ambassador  what is the girl like my brother asked  charming i answered i am writing aunt mary to invite her down to feltham the difficulty seems to be to get hold of delora  so youve written aunt mary eh ralph remarked looking up at me austen i believe youre gone on the girl  i believe i am i admitted equably so would you be if you saw her  ralph half closed his eyes for a moment it was a clumsy speech of mine  seriously austen he continued a few moments later have you ever thought of marrying  equally seriously ralph i answered not until i met felicia delora  felicia delora my brother repeated its a pretty name at any rate i suppose i must go and see her myself  wait for a day or two ralph i begged she is a little upset just now her uncle seems to be neglecting her for some precious scheme of his  i wonder if by any chance you are in earnest austen my brother asked  i should not be surprised i admitted  its an interesting subject you know ralph continued gravely considering my accident and other things which we need not allude to i think we may take it for granted that theres no chance of my ever having an heir its our duty to look ahead a little you know austen there isnt any manner of doubt that some time between now and the next ten years you will have to take up my place i only hope you wont make such a hash of it  dont talk rubbish ralph i answered  it isnt rubbish he said firmly you go and talk to my doctor if you dont believe me however i hadnt meant to say anything about this tonight your mentioning the girl put it into my head i want you of course to know that i am not forgetful of my responsibilities your two thousand a year may do you very well as a bachelor but you are heir apparent to the title now and if you should think of marrying the fakenham estates are yours and the house they bring in between six and seven thousand a year i thinknever less  its very good of you ralph i began  its nothing of the sort he answered its your rightful position the fakenham estates have been held by the heir apparent for generations tell me a little about this miss delora  ill bring her to see you presently ralph i answered  you are in earnest then he remarked with a smile  i believe so i answered  he looked at me once more searchingly  there is something on your mind austen he saidsomething bothering you i believe it is about these deloras too is there something about them which you cant understand eh  there is ralph i admitted you saw what dicky said they are people of consequence in their own country at any rate yet over here the man seems to behave like a hunted criminal  dicky also said ralph remarked that the man was intrusted with some business over here for his government nasty underhand lot those republics of the southern hemisphere i dare say he is driven to be a bit mysterious to carry the thing through  i shall know more about it soon i hope i answered ill go and ring freddy up if you dont mind now  ralph nodded  im off to my room at any rate old chap he said groves is going abroad for a months holiday and he has brought some papers for me to look through see you some time tomorrow  i made my way into the little sittingroom which belonged to the suite of rooms my brother had placed at my disposal there i rang up lord frederic maynard my first cousin and a junior member of the government the butler told me that lord frederic was dining but would doubtless speak to me for a moment in a minute or two i heard his familiar voice  freddy i said i want to meet the chinese ambassador  eleven till one tonight here he answered what the devil do you want with him  do you mean that he is coming to your house tonight i asked  exactly freddy answered weve a political reception semidiplomatic i saw our old friend only yesterday and he reminded me that he was coming  youre a brick freddy i answered ill be round  you have not answered my question he reminded me  ill tell you later i answered and rang off  i was at maynard house very soon after eleven and after chatting for a little while with my hostess i hung around near the entrance watching the arrivals about midnight his excellency the chinese ambassador was announced and i felt a little thrill of exultation i was right the tall powerfullooking man whom i saw bowing over my cousins hand was indeed the person whom i had seen with delora a few hours ago i ran freddy to ground and presently i found myself also bowing before his excellency he regarded me through his hornrimmed spectacles with a benign and pleasant expression i had been in the east and i talked for a few moments upon the subjects which i thought would interest him  your excellency i dare say is well acquainted with london i remarked apropos of something he said  i know your great city only indifferently he answered i am always anxious to take the opportunity of seeing more of it  last evening for instance i remarked your excellency was i think exploring a very interesting neighborhood  last evening he repeated let me think no not last evening captain rotherby i was giving a little dinner at my own house  i looked at him for a moment in silence there was nothing to be learned from his expression  i thought i said that i saw your excellency in a street near shaftesbury avenue leaving a small foreign restaurantthe cafe universel your excellency was with a man named delora  very slowly the ambassador shook his head  not me he said not me i did dine with the younger members of the legation in langham place what name did you say  a man named delora i repeated  once more the ambassador shook his head slowly and thoughtfully  delora he repeated the name is unknown to me there are many others of my race in london now he continued the costume perhaps makes one seem like another to those who look and pass by  i bowed very low it was the most magnificently told lie to which i had ever listened in my life his excellency smiled at me graciously as i made my adieux and passed on despite my disappointment i felt that i was now becoming profoundly interested in my quest the evidence too was all in favor of delora it seemed indeed as though this undertaking in which he was involved might after all be connected with other things than crime     chapter xxvi  nearly   it was past one oclock in the morning when i returned to the hotel yet the porter who admitted me pointed toward the figure of a man who stood waiting in the dimly lit hall  there is a person here who has been waiting to see you for some hours sir he said his name is fritz  to see me i repeated  the man came a step forward and saluted i recognized him at once it was the commissionnaire at the cafe universel  it is quite right i told the porter you had better come up to my rooms i added turning to fritz  i led the way to the lift and on to my sittingroom there i turned up the electric lights and threw myself into an easychair  well fritz said i i hope that you have brought me some news  i have lost my job sir the man answered a little sullenly  how much was it worth to you i asked  it was worth nearly two pounds a week with tips he declared speaking with a strong foreign accent  then i take you into my service at two pounds ten a week from tonight i said the engagement will not be a long one but you may find it lucrative  the man fingered his hat and looked at me stolidly  i am not a valet sir he replied  if you were i should not employ you i answered you can make yourself very useful to me in another direction if you care to  i am very willing sir the man declaredvery willing indeed i have a wife and children and i cannot afford to be out of employment  come then i said the long and short of it is this i want to discover the whereabouts of the man who was with the chinaman at your restaurant last evening  the man looked at me with something like surprise in his face  you do not know that he said  i do not i admitted your business will be to find out  and what do i get the man asked if i do discover the staying place of that gentleman  a tenpound note i answered down on the nail  a slow smile suffused fritzs face  i will tell you now he said you have the ten pounds so  i have it ready i answered rising to my feet come on fritz you are a brave fellow and i promise you it shall not end at ten pounds  you are serious fritz persisted this is not a joke  not in the least i assured him why should you think so  the smile on the mans face broadened  because he said that gentlemanhe is staying here in this very hotel  for a moment i was silent the thing seemed impossible  how on earth do you know that fritz i asked  i will tell you fritz answered there was a night not long ago when he did come to the restaurant with the chinese gentleman they talked for a long time and then i was sent for into the private room where they were taking dinner the gentleman he wrote a note and he gave it to me he said you will take a hansom cab and you will drive to claridges hotel you will give this to the cashier and he will hand you a small parcel which you will bring here i told him that i could not leave my post but he had already seen the proprietor so i came to this very hotel with that note and i did take back to the restaurant a small parcel wrapped in brown paper  fritz i said sit down in that easychair and help yourself to whiskey and soda i am sorry that i have not beer but you must do the best you can with our own national drink take a cigar too make yourself quite comfortable i am going downstairs to the reception office if i find that what you have told me is true there will be two fivepound notes in my hand for you when i come back  so fritz declared accepting my hospitality with calm satisfaction  i descended into the hall of the hotel and made my way to the reception office the one clerk on duty was reading a novel which he promptly laid aside at my approach it occurred to me that my task perhaps might not prove so easy as delora would scarcely be staying here under his own name  i wanted to ask you i said if you have a gentleman here named delora  the man shook his head  there is no one of that name in the hotel sir he answered  i scarcely expected that there would be i remarked the fact is the gentleman whom i want to find and whom i know is or was staying here is using another name which i have not heard you know who i am  certainly captain rotherby the man replied you are lord welmingtons brother  you will understand then i said that if i ask questions which seem to you impertinent i do so because the matter is important and not from any idle curiosity  quite so sir the man answered i shall be pleased to tell you anything i can  this gentleman of whom i am in search then i answered he would have arrived probably last wednesday evening from the continent i do not know what name he would give but it would probably not be the name of delora he is rather tall pale thin and of distinctly foreign appearance he has black eyes black imperial and looks like a south american which by the bye i think he is does that description help you to recognize him  i think so sir the man answered do you happen to know whether by any chance he would be a friend of the chinese ambassador  i should think it very likely i answered he is staying here then  he was staying here until a few hours ago sir the man answered he came in about ten oclock and went at once to his rooms sent for his bill and left the hotel in a great hurry i remember the circumstance particularly because he had said nothing about his going and from the manner of his return and his hasty departure it is quite clear that he had not expected to leave so soon himself  i was a little staggered it seemed hard luck to have so nearly succeeded in my search only to have failed at the last moment it was maddening too to think that for all these hours i had been in the same hotel as the man whom i so greatly desired to find  tell me did he leave any address i asked  none whatever sir the man answered our junior clerk here asked him where he would wish letters to be forwarded and he replied that there would not be any i think he said that he was leaving for abroad almost at once but would call before he sailed in case there were any letters or messages for him  tell me under what name he stayed here i asked  mr vanderpoel the man told me  he was quite alone i suppose i asked  absolutely the man answered he had a few callers at different times but he spent most of his time in his rooms if you are particularly anxious to discover his whereabouts the clerk continued the night porter who would have started him off is still on duty  i should like very much to speak to him i said  the clerk touched a bell and the porter came in from outside  you remember mr vanderpoel leaving this evening the clerk asked  certainly sir the man answered he went at about eleven oclock  did he go in a cab the clerk asked  in a fourwheeler sir the porter answered  do you remember what address he gave  the porter looked dubious for a moment  i dont absolutely remember sir he said but i know that it was one of the big railway stations  the clerk turned to me  is there anything else you would like to ask he inquired  i shook my head  no thanks i answered i am afraid there is nothing more to be learned  the porter went back to his duties and i bade the clerk good night up in my room fritz was waiting anxiously  you were right and wrong i announced mr delora has been staying here and left tonight  he has gone fritz exclaimed  he left at eleven oclock i answered he saw me and i suppose he knew that i was looking for him heres half your money anyhow i continued giving him a fivepound note the next thing to do is to find out where he has gone to i think you could help here fritz  what must i do the man asked  first of all i said go to the big railway hotels and try and find out from one of the portersyou germans all stick togetherwhether any one arrived in a fourwheel cab at between eleven and twelve this evening whose description coincides with that of mr delora i reckon that will take you most of tomorrow when you have finished come to me at the milan court and let me know how you have got on  so the man remarked rising from his seat tomorrow morning i will do that they will tell me these fellows i know many of them  good night fritz then i said good luck     chapter xxvii  war   early on the following morning i moved back to my rooms in the milan court curiously enough i entered the building with a sense of depression for which i could not account i went first to my own rooms and glanced at my letters there was nothing there of importance in other words there was nothing from felicia i descended to the fifth floor and knocked at the door of her room as i stood there waiting i was absolutely certain that somehow or other a change had occurred in the situation that the freeness of my intercourse with felicia was about to be interfered with i was not in the least surprised when the door was at last cautiously opened and a woman who was a perfect stranger to me stood on the threshold with the handle of the door still in her hand  i should like to see miss delora i said my name is captain rotherby  the woman shook her head she was apparently french and of the middleclass she was dressed in black her eyes and eyebrows were black she had even the shadow of a moustache upon her upper lip to me her appearance was singularly forbidding  miss delora cannot see you she answered with a strong foreign accent  will you be so good as to inquire if that is so i answered i have an appointment with miss delora for this morning and a motorcar waiting to take her out  miss delora cannot receive you answered the woman almost as though she had not heard and closed the door in my face  there was nothing left for me but to go down and interview my friend the hallporter i commenced my inquiries with the usual question  any news of mr delora ashley i asked  none at all sir the man replied a companion has arrived for miss delora  so i have discovered for myself i answered do you know anything about her ashley  the man shook his head  she arrived here yesterday afternoon he said with a trunk she went straight up to miss deloras room and i have not seen them apart since  do they come down to the cafe i asked  so far sir the man answered they have had everything served in their sittingroom  i went back to my room and rang up number 157 the voice which answered me was the voice of the woman who had denied me admission to the room  i wish to speak to miss delora i said  miss delora is engaged was the abrupt answer  nonsense i answered i insist upon speaking to her tell her that it is captain rotherby and she will come to the telephone  there was a little whirr but no answer the person at the other end had rung off by this time i was getting angry in five minutes time i rang up again the same voice answered me  look here i said if you do not let me speak to miss delora i shall ring up every five minutes during the day  monsieur can do as he pleases was the answer i shall lay the receiver upon the table it will not be possible to get connected  do if you like i answered but how about when mr delora rings you up  the woman muttered something which i did not catch a moment afterwards however her voice grew clear  that is not your business she said sharply  i tried to continue the conversation but in vain nothing came from the other end but silence i busied myself for a time glancing at a few unimportant letters and afterwards descended to lunch in the cafe i fancied for a moment that louis selfpossession was less perfect than usual he certainly showed some surprise when he saw me and he came to my table with a little less alacrity  louis i said i shall order my lunch from some one else not from you  monsieur has lost confidence he asked  not in your judgment louis i answered  louis looked me straight in the eyes it was not a practice which he often indulged in  captain rotherby he said you should be on our side it would not be necessary then to interfere with any of your plans  he looked at me meaningly and i understood  it is you louis i presume whom i have to thank for the lady upstairs i remarked  louis shrugged his shoulders  why do you seek the man delora he asked what concern is it of yours if you persist the consequences are inevitable  if you will take the trouble to convince me louis i said  louis interrupted me it was unlike him his little gesture showed that he was very nearly angry  monsieur he said sometimes you fail to realize that at a word from us the hand of the gendarme is upon your shoulder we would make use of your aid gladly but it must be on our termsnot yours  state them louis i said  we will tell you the truth louis answered slowly you shall understand the whole business you shall understand why delora is forced to lie hidden here in london what it is that he is aiming at when you know everything you can be an ally if you will on the other hand if you disapprove you swear upon your honor as a gentlemanan english gentlemanthat no word of the knowledge which you have gained shall pass your lips  louis i said i will have my lunch and think about this  louis departed with his customary smile and bow i ordered something cold from the sideboard within sight and a bottle of wine which was opened before me there scarcely remained any doubt in my mind now but that some part of deloras business at any rate in this country was criminal louis manner his emphatic stipulation made it a matter of certainty again i found myself confronted by the torturing thought that if this were so felicia could scarcely be altogether innocent once when louis passed me i stopped him  louis i said let me ask you this presuming things remain as they are and i act independently do you intend to prevent my seeing miss delora  it is nothing to do with me louis lied it is the wish of her uncle  thank you i answered i wanted to know  i finished my luncheon louis saw me preparing to depart and came up to me my table was set in a somewhat obscure corner and we were practically alone  i will ask you a question louis i said there is no reason why you should not answer it there are laws from a legal point of view and laws from a moral point from the former i realize that i am at this moment a criminalpossibly as you say in your power let that pass what i want you to tell me is thisthe undertaking in which mr delora is now engaged is it from a legal point of view a criminal one or is it merely a matter needing secrecy from other reasons  louis stood thoughtfully silent for some few moments  monsieur he said at last i will not hide the truth from you according to the law in this country mr delora is engaged in a conspiracy  political i asked  no louis answered a conspiracy which is to make him and all others who are concerned in it wealthy for life  but the deloras are already rich i remarked  our friend louis said has speculated he has lost large sums besides he loves adventures what shall you answer captain rotherby  it is war louis i said you should know that if i have to pay the penalty for taking the law into my hands over the man tapilow i am ready to answer at any time as for you and delora and the others of you whoever they may be it will be war with you also if you will i intend for the sake of the little girl upstairs to solve all this mystery to take her away from it if i can  louis eyes had narrowed the look in his face was almost enough to make one afraid  it is a pity he said even if you had chosen to remain neutral  i should not do that unless i could see as much of miss delora as i chose i interrupted  if that were arranged louis said slowlymind i make no promisesbut i say if that were arranged would it be understood between us that you stopped your search for mr delora and abandoned all your inquiries  no louis i answered unless i were convinced that miss delora herself was implicated in these things then you could all go to the devil for anything i cared  your interest louis murmured is in the young lady then  absolutely and entirely i answered notwithstanding what you have told me and what i have surmised the fact that you stood by me in paris would be sufficient to make me shrug my shoulders and pass on i am no policeman and i would leave the work of exposing delora to those whose business it is but you see i have an idea of my own louis i believe that miss delora is innocent of any knowledge of wrongdoing that i remain here is for her sake if i try to discover what is going on it is also for her sake  monsieur has sentiment louis remarked showing his teeth  too much by far louis i answered never mind we all have our weak spots some day or other somebody may even put their finger upon yours louis  he smiled  why not monsieur he said     chapter xxviii  check   in my rooms a surprise awaited me felicia was there walking nervously up and down my little sittingroom she stopped short as i entered and came swiftly towards me in the joy of seeing her so unexpectedly i would have taken her into my arms but she shrank back  felicia i exclaimed how did you come here  madame muller went down for lunch felicia answered i said that i had a headache and stole up here on the chance of seeing you  they are making a prisoner of you i exclaimed  it is your fault she answered  i looked at her in surprise her face was stained with tears her voice shook with nervousness  you have been making secret inquiries about my uncle she said you have been seen talking to those who wish him ill  how do you know this felicia i asked calmly  oh i know she answered they have told me  who i asked who has told you  never mind she answered wringing her hands i know it is enough capitaine rotherby i have come to ask you something  please go on i said  i want you to go away i do not wish you to interest yourself any more in me or in any of us  do you mean that felicia i asked  i mean it she answered my uncle has a great mission to carry out here you are making it more difficult for him  felicia i said i do not trust your uncle i do not believe in his great mission i think that you yourself are deceived  she held her head up her eyes flashed angrily  as to that she said i am the best judge if my uncle is an adventurer i am his niece i am one with him please understand that it seems to me that you are working against him thinking that you are helping me that is a mistake  felicia i said give me a little more of your confidence and the rest will be easy  what is it that you wish to know she asked  for one thing i answered tell me when your uncle left south america and when he arrived in paris  he had been in paris ten days when you saw us first she said after a moments hesitation  and are you sure that he came to you from south america i demanded  certainly she answered  to me i said slowly he seems to have the manners of a parisian two months ago i lunched at henrys with some old friends can you tell me felicia that he was not in paris then  of course not she answered shivering a little  then he has a wonderful double i declared  what is this that is in your mind about him she asked  i believe i answered that he is personating some one or rather i have believed it i believe that he is personating some one else and is afraid of being recognized by those who know  will it satisfy you she said slowly if i tell you upon my honor capitaine rotherby that he is indeed my uncle  i should believe you felicia i answered i should then feel disposed to give the whole affair up as insoluble  that is just what i want you to do she said now listen i tell you this upon my honor he is my uncle and his name is truly delora  then why does he leave you here alone and skulk about from hidingplace to hidingplace like a criminal i asked  it is not your business to ask those questions she answered i have told you the truth will you do as i ask or not  i hesitated for a moment she was driving me back into a corner  felicia i said i must do as you ask me if you tell me to go away i will go away but do you think it is quite kind to leave me so mystified for instance i added slowly on the night when that beast louis planned to knock that young brazilian on the head and leave me to bear the brunt of it he was up here talking to you alone as though you were equals  it is my uncle who makes use of louis she said  im hanged if i can see how he can make use of a fellow like that if his business is an honest one i answered  it is not for you to understand she answered you are not a policeman you are not concerned in these things  i am concerned in you i answered passionately felicia you drive me almost wild when you talk like this you know very well that it is not curiosity which has made me set my teeth and swear that i will discover the truth of these things it is because i see you implicated in them because i believe in you felicia because i love you  she was in my arms for one long delicious moment then she tore herself away  you mean it austen she whispered  i mean it i answered solemnly felicia i think you know that i mean it  then you must be patient she said for just a little time you must wait until my uncle has finished his business it will take a very short time now then you may come and call again and remind us of your brother you will understand everything then and i believe that you will be still willing to ask us down to your country home  and if i am felicia i asked  we shall come she murmured you know that goodbye austen i must fly if madame muller finds that i have left the room i shall be a prisoner for a week  i opened the door even then i would have kept her if only for a moment but just as i bent down we heard the sound of footsteps outside and she hurried away i sat down and lit a cigarette so it was over then my little attempt at espionage my word was pledged i could do no more  i walked round to claridges later in the evening and saw my brother  ralph i said if your offer of the shooting is still good i think i will take a few men down to feltham  do austen he answered old heggs will be ever so pleased it seems a shame not to have a gun upon the place i shall come down myself later on what about those people the deloras  the uncle is away i answered and the girl cannot very well come by herself perhaps we may see something of them later on  ralph looked at me a little curiously but he made no remark  you wont be lonely up here alone i asked  he shook his head  i have plenty to do he answered i shall probably be down myself before the end of the month whom shall you ask  i made a list of a few of the men whom i knew and who i believed were still in town but when i sat down to write to them i felt curiously reluctant to commit myself to staying at feltham even if i were not to interfere even if i were to stand aside while the game was being played i could not believe that the scheming of louis and the acquiescence of felicia went for the same thing and i had an uncomfortable but a very persistent conviction to the effect that she was being deceived everything from her point of view seemed reasonable enough what she had told me even seemed almost to preclude the fear of any wrongdoing yet i could not escape from the conviction of it some way or other there was trouble brewing either between delora and louis or delora and the arbiters of right and wrong in the end i wrote to no one i determined to go down alone to shoot zealously from early in the morning till late at night but to have no houseparty at felthamto invite a few of the neighbors and to be free myself to depart for london any time at a moments notice it would come somehow or other i felt sure of it i should receive a summons from her and i must be prepared at any moment to come to her aid  i went into the club after i had left claridges and stayed playing bridge till unusually late it was early in the morning when i reached the milan and the hotel had that dimly lit somewhat sepulchral appearance which seems to possess a large building at that hour in the morning as i stood for a moment inside the main doors four men stepped out of the lift on my right carrying a long wooden chest they slunk away into the shadows on tiptoe i watched them curiously  what is that i asked the reception clerk who was on duty  he shrugged his shoulders  it was a man who died here the day before yesterday he whispered in my ear  died here i repeated why are they taking his coffin down at such an hour  it is always done the man assured me in hotels such as this where all is life and gayety our clients do not care to be reminded of such an ugly thing as death half the people on that floor would have left if they had known that the dead body of a man has been lying there we keep these things very secret the coffin has been taken to the undertakers the funeral will be from there  who is the man i asked had he been ill long  the clerk shook his head  he was a frenchman he said bartot was his name he had an apoplectic stroke in the cafe one day last week and since then complications set in  i turned away with a little shiver it was not pleasant to reflect uponthis mans death     chapter xxix  an unsatisfactory interview   before i was up the next morning i was informed that fritz was waiting outside the door of my room i had him shown in and he stood respectfully by my bedside  sir he said i have once more discovered mr delora  fritz i answered you are a genius tell me where he is  he is at a small private hotel in bloomsbury fritz declared it is really a boardinghouse frequented by australians and colonials the number is 17 and the street is montague street  i sat up in bed  this is very interesting i said  fritz coughed  i trusted that you would find it so sir he admitted  i thought for several moments then i sprang out of bed  fritz i said our engagement comes to an end this morning i am going to pay you for two months service  i went to my drawer and counted out some notes which fritz pocketed with a smile of contentment  i am obliged to give up my interest in this affair i said so i cannot find any more work for you but that money will enable you to take a little holiday and i have no doubt that you will soon succeed in obtaining another situation  fritz made me a magnificent bow  i am greatly obliged to you sir he announced i shall take another situation at once holidaysthey will come later in life at my age and with a family one must work but your generosity sir he wound up with another bow i shall never forget  i dressed and walked to the address which fritz had given me as i stood on the doorstep with the bell handle still in my hand the door was suddenly opened it was delora himself who appeared he shrank away from me as though i were something poisonous i laid my hand on his shoulder firmly determined that this time there should be no escape  mr delora i said i want a few words with you can i have them now  i am busy he answered at any other time  no other time will do i answered it is only a few words i need say but those few words must be spoken  he led the way reluctantly into a sittingroom there were red plush chairs set at regular intervals against the wall and a table in the middle covered by papersmostly out of date delora closed the door and turned toward me sternly  captain rotherby he said i am quite aware that there are certain people in london who are very much interested in me and my doings their interests and mine clash and it is only natural that they should plot against me but where the devil you come in i cannot tell tell me what you mean by playing the spy upon me what business is it of yours  you misunderstand the situation sir i answered more than ten days ago you left me in charge of your niece at charing cross while you drove on according to your own statement to the milan hotel you never went to that hotel you never apparently meant to you have never been near it since you have left your niece in the centre of what seems to be a very nest of intrigue i have the right to ask you for an explanation of these things this morning i have a special right because today i have promised to go away into the country and to take no further interest in your doings  let us suppose delora said dryly that it is already tomorrow morning  no i answered there is something which i mean to say to you you need not be alarmed the few words i have to say to you are not questions i do not want to understand your secretsto penetrate the mystery which surrounds you and your doings i will not ask you a single question i will not even ask you why you left your niece in such a fit of terror and have never yet dared to show your face at the milan  a child would understand these things delora exclaimed the milan hotel is one of the most public spots in london it is open to any one who cares to cross the threshold it is the last place in the world likely to be a suitable home for a man like myself who is in touch with great affairs  then why did you choose to go there i asked  it was not my choice at all delora answered besides it was not until i arrived in london that i understood exactly the nature of the intrigues against me  at least i protested you should never have brought your niece with you frankly your concerns dont interest me a snap of the fingers it is of your niece only that i think you have no right to leave her alone in such anxiety  nor can i see sir delora answered that you have any better right to reproach me with it still if it will shorten this discussion i admit that if i had known how much trouble there was ahead of me i should not have brought her i simply disliked having to disappoint her it was a longstanding promise  let that go i answered i have told you that i have handed in my commission i have nothing more to do with you or your schemes whatever they may be but i came here to find you and to tell you this one thing felicia says that you are her uncle she scouts the idea of your being an impostor she speaks of you as tenderly and affectionately as a girl well could that is all very well yet in the face of it i am here to impress this upon you i love your niece mr delorasome day or other i mean to make her my wifeand i will not have her dragged into anything which is either disreputable or against the law  has my niece encouraged you delora asked calmly  not in the least i answered she has been kind enough to give me to understand that she cares a little and there the matter ends nothing more could be said between us in this state of uncertainty but i came here for this one purpose i came to tell you that if by any chance felicia should be mistaken if you play her false in any way if you seek to embroil her in your schemes or to do anything by means of which she could suffer i shall first of all shake the life out of your body and then i shall go to scotland yard and tell them how much i know  about mr tapilow also delora asked with a sneer  do you think i am afraid to take the punishment for my own follies i asked indignantly if i believed that i would go and give myself up tomorrow louis can give me away if he will or you i dont care a snap of the fingers but what i want you to understand is this felicia is i presume your niece i should have been inclined to have doubted it but i cannot disbelieve her own word i think myself that it is brutal to have brought such a child here and to have left her alone  she is not alone delora interrupted stiffly she has a companion  who arrived yesterday i continued she has spent some very bad days alone i can promise you that  i have telephoned delora said twice a daysometimes oftener  i laughed ironically  for your own sake or hers i wonder i said anyhow we can leave that alone what i want you to understand is this that if there is indeed anything illegal or criminal in your secret doings over here you must take care that felicia is safely provided for if things should go against you she is not to be left there to be the butt of a great criminal action if i find that you or any of your friends are making use of her in any way whatever i swear that you shall suffer for it  delora smiled at me grimly he seemed in his few dry words to have revealed something of his stronger and less nervous self  you terrify me he said yet i think that we must go on pretty well as we are even if my niece has been fortunate enough to enlist your sympathies on her behalf never mind who i am or what my business is in this country young man it is not your affair you should have enough to think about yourself in this country of easy extradition my niece can look after herself so can i we do not need your aid or welcome your interference  you insinuate i declared indignantly that your niece is one of your helpers i do not believe it  helpers in what he asked with upraised eyebrows  god knows i exclaimed a little impatiently what you do or what you try to do is not my business felicia is that is why i have warned you  am i to have the honor then delora asked with a curl of his thin lips  you are i interrupted if you call it an honor although to tell you frankly as things are at present i am not inclined to go about begging too many different peoples permission if it were not that my brother dicky has just written over from brazil to ask me to be civil to you and your niece you wouldnt have left this place so easily  your brother delora said looking at me uneasily say that again  certainly i answered my brother dicky who is now out in brazil and who has written to me about you you met him there of course i added he stayed with you atlet me see what is the name of your place i asked suddenly  menita delora answered without hesitation now you mention it of course i remember him if he has written you to be civil to us you can do it best by minding your own business in a fortnights time i shall be free to entertain or to be entertained at present i am on a secret mission and i do not wish my work to be interfered with  i moved toward the door  i have said all that i wish to say i remarked if i hear nothing from you i shall come back to london in fourteen days  you will find me with my niece delora said and we shall be happy to see you  i left him there feeling somehow or other that i had not had the best of our interview yet my position from the first was hopeless there was nothing for me to do but to keep my word to felicia and let things drift  i drove to the club on my way to the station where i had arranged for my baggage to be sent as i crossed pall mall i met lamartine he was standing on the pavement on the point of entering a motorcar on which was piled some luggage  so you too are leaving london i remarked stopping for a moment  he looked at me curiously  i am going to paris he said  a pleasure trip i asked  he shook his head  not entirely he said only this morning i made a somewhat surprising discovery  concerning our friend i asked  concerning our friend lamartine echoed  he seemed dubious for a moment whether to take me into his confidence  you have not found delora yet i asked  not yet he answered and you  i have seen him i admitted  are you disposed to tell me where lamartine asked softly  i shook my head  i have finished with the affair i told him i finish as i beganabsolutely bewildered i know nothing and understand nothing i am going down into the country to shoot pheasants  lamartine smiled  i he remarked entering the car am going after bigger game     chapter xxx  to newcastle by road   i found several of my brothers friends staying at feltham who were also well known to me and my aunt who was playing hostess had several women staying with her we spent the time very much after the fashion of an ordinary houseparty during the first week of october we shot until four oclock came home and played bridge until dinnertime bridge or billiards after dinner varied by a dance one night and some amateur theatricals on the fifth day a singular thing happened to me  the whole of the houseparty were invited to shoot with my uncle lord horington who lived about forty miles from us we left in two motorcars soon after breakfasttime and for the last few miles of the way we struck the great north road it was just after we had entered it that we came upon a huge travelling car covered with dust and with portmanteaus strapped upon the roof hung up by the side of the road our chauffeur slowed down to find out if we could be of any use and as the reply was scarcely intelligible we came to a full stop he dismounted to speak to the other chauffeur and i looked curiously at the two men who were leaning back in the luxurious seats inside the car for a moment i could not believe my eyes then i opened the door of my own car and stepped quickly into the road the two men who were sitting there and by whom i was as yet unobserved were delora and the chinese ambassador  i walked at once up to the window of their car and knocked at it delora leaned forward and recognized me at once his face for a moment seemed dark with anger he let down the sash  what does this mean he asked have you forgotten our bargain  i laughed a little shortly  my dear sir i said it is not i who have come to see you but you to see me i am within a few miles of my own estate on my way to shoot at a friends  he stared at me for a moment incredulously  do you mean to tell me he said in a low tone that you have not followed us from london  why i have not been in london or near it for five days i told him i slept last night within thirty miles from here and as i told you before am on my way to shoot with my uncle at the present moment  i know nothing of the geography of your country delora said shortly what you say may be correct his excellency and i are having a few days holiday  may i hope to have the pleasure of seeing you at feltham i inquired  i am afraid not delora answered if we had known that we should have been so near we might have arranged to pay you a visit as it is we are in a hurry to get on  how far north did you think of going i asked  we have not decided delora answered remember our bargain and ask no questions  but this is a holiday trip i reminded him surely i may be permitted to advise you about the picturesque spots in my own country  you can tell me at any rate what it is that has happened to our car delora answered neither his excellency nor i know anything about such matters  i walked round and talked to the two chauffeurs the accident it seemed was a trivial one and with the help of a special spanner with which we were supplied was already rectified i returned and explained matters to delora  have you come far this morning i asked  not far delora answered we are taking it easy  i looked at his tired face at the car thick with dust at the chinese ambassador already nodding in his corner and i smiled to myself it was very certain to me that they had run from london without stopping and i felt an intense curiosity as to their destination however i said no more to them i made my adieux to delora and bowed profoundly to the chinese ambassador who opened his eyes in time solemnly to return my farewell the chauffeur was already in his place and i stopped to speak to him i saw delora spring forward and whistle down the speakingtube but my question was already asked  how far north are you going i asked  to newcastle sir the man answered  he turned then to answer the whistle and i reentered my own car we started first but they passed us in a few minutes travelling at a great rate and with a cloud of dust behind them delora threw an evil glance at me from his place for once i had stolen a march upon him they had both been too ignorant of their route to keep their final destination concealed from the chauffeur and they certainly had not expected to meet any one on the way with whom he would be likely to talk but why to newcastle i asked myself that question so often during the morning that my shooting became purely a mechanical thing newcastlethe tyne coals and shipbuilding i could think of nothing else in connection with the place  late that evening i sat with a whiskey and soda and final cigar in the smokingroom the evening papers had just arrived brought by motorbicycle from norwich i found nothing to interest me in them but glancing down the columns my attention was attracted by some mention of brazil i looked to see what the paragraph might be it concerned some new battleships and was headed       largest battleships in the world      it is not generally known that there will be launched from the     works of messrs halliday  co on the tyne within the next three     or four weeks two of the most powerful battleships of the     dreadnought type which have yet been built   there followed some specifications in which i was not particularly interested an account of their armament and a final remark       one is tempted to ask how a country in the financial position of     brazil can possibly reconcile it with her ideas of national     economy to spend something like three millions in battleships     which there does not seem to be the slightest chance of her ever     being called upon to use   somehow or other this paragraph fascinated me i read it over and over again i could see no connection between it and the visit of delora to newcastle especially accompanied as he was by the chinese ambassador yet the more i thought of it the more i felt convinced that in some way the two were connected i put down the paper at last and called out of the room to a motoring friend  how far is it to newcastle from here jacky  jacky dalton a fairhaired young giant one of the keenest sportsmen whom i had ever met and whose mind and soul was now entirely dominated by the craze for motoring told me with only a few moments hesitation  between two hundred and two hundred and twenty miles austen he said and a magnificent road with my new napier i reckon that i could get there in six hours or less at night with this moon  i walked to the window across the park the outline of the trees and even the bracken stood out with extraordinary distinctness in the brilliant moonlight there was not a breath of air although every window in the house was open we were having a few days of record heat  jove what a gorgeous run it would be tonight dalton said with a little sigh looking out over my shoulder empty roads as light as day and a breeze like midsummer you dont want to go do you austen  will you take me i asked  like a shot he answered i only wish you were in earnest  but i am i declared if you dont mind missing the days shooting tomorrow id love to run up there its impossible to sleep with this heat  its a great idea dalton declared enthusiastically id love a day off from shooting  i turned to a younger cousin of mine who had just come in from the billiardroom  dick i said will you run things tomorrow if i go off motoring with dalton  of course i will he answered its only home shooting anyway id rather like a day off because of the cricket match in the afternoon  jacky im your man i declared  well have ferris in at once he declared bet you what you like hes ready to start in a quarter of an hour i always have her kept ready tuned right up  i rang the bell and sent for jackys chauffeur he appeared after a few minutes delaya short hardfaced young man who before jacky had engaged him had driven a racing car  ferris his master said we want to start for newcastle in half an hour  tonight sir the man asked  certainly dalton answered i shall drive some of the way myself everything is in order i suppose  everything sir the man answered you can start in ten minutes if you wish  any trouble about petrol i asked  we carry enough for the whole journey sir the man answered ill have the car round at the front sir in a few minutes  lets go up and change our clothes dalton said remember we are going to travel austen especially up the north road you will want some thickish tweeds and an overcoat although it seems so stifling here  i nodded  right jacky i answered ill be down in a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes at the most  in less than half an hour we were off it was only when the great car swung from the avenue into the country lane that jacky who was driving turned toward me  by the bye he asked what the devil are we going to newcastle for  i laughed  we are going to look at those new battleships jacky i answered  he stared at me  are you in earnest  partly i answered lets say we are going for the ride its worth it  dalton drew a long breath we were rushing now through the silent night with a delicious wind strong and cool blowing in our faces  by jove it is he assented     chapter xxxi  an interesting day   it was a little after seven oclock the next morning when we turned into the courtyard of the county hotel in newcastle immediately in front of us was the car in which we had seen delora on the previous afternoon the chauffeur was at work upon it and although he looked up at our entrance he paid no particular attention to us  i blew through the whistle to ferris  back out of the yard at once i said and go to another hotel  dalton looked at me in surprise  forgive my ordering your chauffeur about i said as we glided backwards into the street thats the car weve come up after and i dont want the people who travelled in it to know that we are on their heels  dalton whistled softly  so we are on a chase are we he asked you might tell me about it austen  i cant i answered its altogether too indefinite i shouldnt tell you anything which would sound like common sense except thisthat i am exceedingly curious for several reasons to know what those two men who came up in that car have to do in newcastle  who are they dalton asked  one is a rich brazilian named delora and the other the chinese ambassador i answered  the names seemed to convey nothing to my companion who merely nodded we had now arrived at the other hotel and the prospects of breakfast were already claiming our attention we sat down in the coffeeroom and attacked our bacon and eggs and coffee with zest  how long do you want to stay here dalton asked  i am not quite sure i answered look here jacky i continued supposing i wanted to stay all day and to go back tonight so that we got home to breakfast tomorrow morning would that be too long for you  that would do me splendidly dalton declared i have never been in this part of the world and i should like to look round we must be back for tomorrow morning you know because all those fellows are coming to shoot from horingtons  i nodded  we will make that the latest i said  jacky left me a few minutes later to visit the local garage without any clear idea as to what was best to be done i still felt that i was justified in making a few inquiries as to the cause of deloras presence in newcastle with that particular companion i went to the telephone therefore and rang up the county hotel i asked to speak to the manager who came at once to the instrument  i understand i said that the chinese ambassador has just arrived at your hotel would you be so kind as to ask him whether he would consent to be interviewed as to the reasons of his visit  i waited several minutes for a reply when it came it was at least emphatic the visit of the ambassador the manager told me was entirely a private one he was simply on a motor tour with a friend and they had called at newcastle as it was an interesting city which the ambassador had never seen he declined most firmly to have anything to do with any interviewer  the reply being exactly what i had expected i was not in the least disappointed  perhaps i said to the manager you can tell me how long he is staying  i have no idea sir the manager answered they have just ordered a carriage to make a call in the town  i thanked him and left the hotel at once on foot when i arrived near the county hotel a fourwheel cab was drawn up at the entrance from a safe distance i stood watching it and in a few minutes i saw the ambassador and delora come swiftly out of the hotel and step inside i waited till they had driven off and then crossed the road to where the hallporter was still standing on the pavement i put five shillings into his hand  i am a reporter i said can you tell me where the ambassador has gone to  he smiled and touched his hat  they are going to the offices of messrs halliday  co the great shipbuilders in corporation street he answered  i thanked him and walked slowly away i found plenty of material for thought but it seemed to me that there was nothing more which i could do nevertheless i walked along towards the address which the porter had given me and found as i had expected that the cab was standing empty outside opposite was a small publichouse i went in ordered a whiskey and soda and lit a cigarette then i sat down facing the window half an hour passed and then an hour it was one oclock before the two men reappeared they were accompanied by a third person whom i judged to be a member of the firm and who entered the cab with them on the pavement they were accosted by a young man in spectacles who look off his hat and said a few words to the ambassador the latter however shaking his head stepped into the cab the young man pushed forward once more but the cab drove off as soon as it had turned the corner i hurried out and addressed him  his excellency does not care to be spoken to i remarked  the reporterhis profession was quite obviousshook his head  i only wanted a word or two he said but he would not have anything to say to me  i wonder if he is going to look over any of the ships that are building i remarked  there is nothing much in the yards the young man said except the two brazilian battleships i dont think that hallidays are allowed to show any one over them unless they have a special permit from the brazilian government  i nodded  fine ships arent they i asked  the finest that have ever left the tyne the young man answered enthusiastically what a little country like brazil can possibly want with the most powerful warships in the world no one can guess are you on a london paper he asked me  i nodded  i have followed them all the way down here i said but they have not a word to say by the bye i added did you know that the gentleman with the chinese ambassador was a very prominent brazilian  the reporter whistled softly  i wonder what that means he said it sounds interesting somehow  come and have a drink i said  he accepted at once  what paper are you on he asked as we crossed the street  to be honest with you i replied i am not on a paper at all i am not even a reporter i am interested in the visit of these two men to newcastle for more serious reasons  the young man looked at me thoughtfully he slipped his arm through mine as though he intended never to let me go evidently he scented a story  i suppose he said you mean that you are a detective  no i answered scarcely that i can only tell you that it is my business to watch the movements of those two men  i could see from his manner that he believed me to be a government spy or something of the sort we ordered our drinks and then turned as though by common consent once more to the window a motorcar was drawn up in front of the place and an elderly man was descending hurriedly  hullo the reporter exclaimed thats mr halliday the head of the firm they must have telephoned for him he never comes down except on a thursday lets watch and see what happens  the shipbuilder entered his offices and was gone for about a quarter of an hour when he reappeared he was followed by two clerks one of whom was carrying a great padlocked portfolio under each arm and the other a huge roll of plans they entered the motorcar and drove off  come on i said finishing my drink hurriedly they are off to the county hotel  we took a hansom at the corner of the street and sure enough when we arrived at the hotel mr hallidays motorcar was waiting outside we went at once into the office where my companion was quite at home  whos with the chinaman he asked the manager who greeted him cordially  a whole crowd he answered first of all dickinsonhallidays managercame back with him and the old man himself has just arrived with a couple of clerks  whats the game do you suppose the reporter asked  the hotel manager shrugged his shoulders  were hoping it means orders he said we can do with them hallidays could put on another twelve hundred men and not be crowded and chinas about the most likely customer they could get hold of just now  which sittingroom are they in my friend asked  number 12 the manager answered i cant do anything for you though charlie he added id do anything i could but they have given special orders that no one is to interrupt them and they decline to be interviewed by or communicate with any strangers  i shall see the thing out nevertheless my friend announced  and i i answered lets have lunch together is there a smart boy in the place who could let us know directly any one leaves the sittingroom  the manager smiled  mr sinclair knows all about that sir he said pointing to my friend i have nothing to say about it of course  sinclair left the room for a minute or two when he came back he nodded confidentially  i have a boy watching the door he said the moment any one leaves we shall hear of it  we went into the restaurant and ordered lunch in about half an hour a small boy came hastily in and addressed sinclair  they have ordered luncheon up in the sittingroom sir he said i thought id better let you know  for how many sinclair asked quickly  for four sir he answered i fancy the two clerks are coming out the door opened once and they had their hats on  run along sinclair said and let us know again directly anything happens  the boy returned almost at once  the clerks have left he said the other four are going to lunch together  did the clerks take the plans with them i asked  not all the boy answered they left two portfolios behind  we finished our luncheon and returned to the bar it was more than two hours before anything else happened then the boy entered a little hurriedly  mr halliday has telephoned for his car and is just leaving sir he said the two gentlemen from london have just ordered theirs and i believe it looks as though mr dickinson were going with them he has telephoned for a bag from his house  i shook hands with my friend the reporter and we parted company i left the hotel quickly and returned to the kings arms where we were staying i was lucky enough to find jack just finishing lunch  i say old man i exclaimed i wish youd start for home at once  right away he answered well ring for ferris  the chauffeur came in and received his orders we got into our coats and walked out toward the front door suddenly i drew jacky back and stood behind a pillar a great touring car had turned the corner and was passing down the street in it were three menthe chinese ambassador delora and the man who had left the offices of messrs halliday with them  is that the road to london i asked the porter  it is the way into the main road sir he answeredtwo hundred and sixtyfive miles  they swung round the corner and disappeared our own car was just drawing up i turned to jacky  wed better wait a few minutes i said and tell your man not to overtake that car  jacky looked at me in surprise he was by no means a curious person but he was obviously puzzled  what a mysterious person you have become austen he said whats it all about  you will know some day i answered as we made ourselves comfortableperhaps before many hours are past     chapter xxxii  a proposal   we arrived at feltham at a few minutes past ten oclock having seen nothing of the car which had left newcastle a few minutes before ours several times we asked on the road and heard news of it but we could find no sign of it having stopped even for a moment apparently it had been driven without pause for rest or refreshment at top speed and we learned that two summonses would probably be issued against its owners jacky who was delighted with the whole expedition sat with his watch in his hands for the last few miles and made elaborate calculations as to our average speed the distance we had traversed and other matters interesting to the owner of a powerful car  we were greeted when we arrived with all sorts of inquiries as to our expedition but we declined to say a word until we had dined we had scarcely commenced our meal before the butler came hurrying in  his lordship is ringing up from london sir he said he wishes to speak to you particularly the telephone is through into the library  i made my way there and took up the receiver without any special interest ralph was fidgety these days and i had no doubt that he had something to say to me about the shooting his first words however riveted my attention  is that you austen he asked  i am here i answered how are you ralph  i am all right he said rather better than usual in fact where on earth have you been to all day i have rung up four times  i have been motoring with jacky i told him we have been for rather a long run have you been wanting me  yes he answered i have had a very curious cable from dicky which i cant understand i am sorry to bother you but i think you had better come up to town by the first train in the morning its something to do with these deloras  the devil it is i exclaimed ill come ralph i shall motor to norwich and catch the eight oclock could you give me an idea of what it is  i think id rather not over the telephone ralph declared after a moments hesitation  dont be an idiot i answered i am really very much interested  its a queer business ralph said but it will keep until tomorrow i shall send the car for you to liverpool street and you had better come straight to me  dicky is all right i hope i asked  dickys all right ralph answered what sort of sport are you having there  very fair i answered heggs sends you the figures every day i suppose  yes ralph answered you seem to have done very well at the birds till tomorrow austen  till tomorrow i replied good night old chap  goodnight  i put down the receiver and went back to my dinner more than ever puzzled ralphs summons i felt absolved me from any promise i might have made to delora and i was looking eagerly forward to the morrow when i should be once more in london what puzzled me however more even than dickys message was the extreme interest ralphs tone seemed to denote his voice sounded quite like his old self  jacky i said as we finished dinner will you lend me your car to take me into norwich tomorrow i have to catch the eight oclock train to town  ill lend it you with pleasure jacky said looking at me in amazement but what on earths up  nothing i answered simply ralph wants to see me he isnt particularly communicative himself but he is very anxious that i should go to town tomorrow somehow or other i have more confidence in your napier than in either of our cars when it comes to catching a train at that time in the morning  ill run you up to town if you like jacky declared in a burst of goodnature  it isnt necessary i answered i shall get up quicker by train and ralphs going to meet me at liverpool street thanks all the same  jacky lit a cigar  ill go out and tell ferris myself he said  once more jackys car did not fail me punctually at a quarter to eight we drove into norwich station yard i breakfasted on the train and reached liverpool street a few minutes after eleven i found ralphs big panhard there but ralph himself had not come  his lordship is expecting you at the hotel sir the chauffeur told me he would have come down himself but he was expecting a caller  in less than half an hour i was in my brothers sittingroom ralph greeted me cordially  austen he said i am not at all sure that i have not brought you up on rather a fools errand but you seemed rather mystified yourself about these deloras heres the cable from dicky what do you make of it must have cost him something extravagant young beggar  he passed it across to me i read it out aloud      delora here puzzled not hearing from brother     should be in london important business fears     something wrong all coded cables remain unanswered     inquire milan hotel if possible find     delora beg him cable at once in chaldean code  i read the cable through three times  may i take this ralph i said i will go round to the milan at once  certainly ralph answered i will leave the matter entirely in your hands it seems as though there were something queer about it  there is something queer going on ralph i assured him i have found out as much as that myself exactly what it means i cant fathom to tell you the truth it has been taking a lot of my time lately and i know very little more than when i started  its the young lady i suppose ralph remarked thoughtfully  i nodded  i am not over keen about interfering in other peoples concerns ralph i said you know that its the girl of course and i am afraid i am very much afraid that there is something wrong  anyhow ralph said it doesnt follow that the girls in it  i am jolly certain she isnt i said what bothers me of course is that i hate to think of her being mixed up with anything shady the deloras may be great people in their own country but ill swear that our friend here is a wrong un  i suppose you are sure ralph said thoughtfully that he is delorathat he is not an impostor i mean  i thought of that i answered but you see theres the girl shed know her own uncle wouldnt she and she told me that she had seen him on and off for years no he is delora right enough one cant tell i continued perhaps the whole things crooked perhaps the deloras who seem to dicky such charming people in their own country are a different sort of people on this side at any rate im off ralph with that cable ill look you up as soon as i have found out anything  ralph smiled  i dont believe he said you are sorry to have an excuse for having another turn at this affair  perhaps not i answered  take the car ralph called out after me you may find it useful  i drove first to the small hotel where i had last seen delora here however i was confronted with a certain difficulty the name of delora was quite unknown to the people i described him carefully however to the landlady and she appeared to recognize him  the gentleman you mean was i think a mr henriquois he left us the day before yesterday  you know where he went to i asked  she shook her head  he asked for a continental timetable she said but he gave no address nor did he tell any one of his intentions he was a gentleman that kept himself to himself she remarked looking at me a little curiously  i thanked the woman and departed delora was scarcely likely to have left behind any reliable details of his intentions at such a place i drove on to the milan and entered the court with a curious little thrill of interest the hallporter welcomed me with a smile  glad to see you back again captain rotherby he said have you any luggage  none i answered i am not sure whether i shall be staying  this mornings letters are in your room sir he announced  i nodded i was not particularly interested in my letters i drew ashley a little on one side  tell me i said is miss delora still here  she is still here sir ashley announced  the companion also i asked  yes sir he answered i am not sure whether they are in sir but they are still staying here  and mr delora i askedhas he ever turned up yet  not yet sir the young lady said that they were expecting him now every day  telephone up and see if miss delora is in ashley i asked  he disappeared for a moment into his office  no answer sir he announced presently i believe that they are out  almost as he spoke i saw through the windows of the hairdressers shop a familiar figure entering the hotel i left ashley hurriedly and in a moment i was face to face with felicia she gave a little cry when she saw me and it was a joy to me to realize that it was a cry of pleasure  capitaine rotherby she exclaimed you  she gave me her hands with an impetuous little movement i held them tightly in mine  i want to speak to you at once i said where can we go  madame is out for an hour she said we could go in the little smokingroom but have you forgotten your promise  never mind about that felicia i whispered something has happened i went first to see your uncle but i could not find him i must talk with you come  we walked together across the hall through the end of the cafe down which she threw one long anxious glance and entered the little smokingroom it was empty except for one man writing letters i led the way into the most remote corner and wheeled out an easychair  felicia i said if i can get a special license will you marry me tomorrow     chapter xxxiii  felicia hesitates   felicia looked at me for a moment with wideopen eyes then a little stream of color rushed into her cheeks her lips slowly parted and she laughed not altogether without embarrassment  capitaine rotherby she said you must not say such thingsso suddenly  last time we met i reminded her you called me austen  austen then if i must she said you know very well that you should not be here you are breaking a promise it is very very nice to see you she continued indeed i do feel that but i am afraid  i have sufficient reasons for breaking my promise dear i said taking her hand in mine i will explain them to you by and by in the meantime please answer my question  you are serious then she asked looking at me with wideopen eyes and lips which quivered a littlewhether with laughter or emotion i could not tell  i am serious i answered you want taking care of felicia and i am quite sure that i should be the best person in the world to do it  her eyes fell before mine she seemed to be studying the point of her long patent shoe as usual she was dressed delightfully in a light fawncolored tailormade gown and a large black hat nevertheless she seemed to me to be thinner and frailer than when i had first seen hertoo girlish almost for her fashionable clothes  do you think that you would take care of me she said softly i am afraid i am a very ignorant little person i do not know much about england or english ways and every one says that things are so different here  there is one thing i declared which is the same all the world over and that is that when two people care for one another the world becomes not such a very difficult place to live in felicia i wonder if you could not try and care a little for me  i do she murmured without looking up  enough i asked  she sighed suddenly she raised her eyes and i saw things there which amazed me they were no longer the eyes of a frightened child i was thrilled with the passion which seemed somehow or other to have been born in their deep blue depths  dear austen she said i think that i care quite enough but listen how can i say yes to you always my uncle has been kind in his way i know now that he is worried harassed to death afraid even of what may happen hour by hour i could not leave him he would think that i had lost faith that i had gone over to his enemies  felicia dear i said i do not wish to be the enemy of any one who is your friend indeed your uncle and his doings mean so little to me if they are honest i might be able to help him if he is engaged in transactions of which he is ashamed then it is time that you were taken away  i will never believe that she declared  felicia i said i will tell you why i have broken my promise and come to london i believe i told you that i had a brother out in brazil  yes she answereddicky you called him  he wrote you know and said that he had been staying with the deloras on their estate and he begged that i should call upon your uncle here now i have had a cable from him felicia there is something wrong you shall read the cable for yourself  i gave it to her she read it word by word then she read it again aloud very softly to herself and finally gave it back to me  i do not understand she whispered i do not know why my uncle has not communicated with his brother  i am beginning to believe felicia i said that i know more than you i tell you frankly i believe that your uncle has kept silence because he is not honestly carrying out the business on which he was sent to england tell me exactly will you when did he arrive from america  she shook her head  austen she said you know there were some things which i promised to keep silent about and this is one  at any rate i said half to myself he could not have been in paris more than three weeks i do not understand how in that three weeks he could have obtained such a hold upon you that you should come here and do his bidding blindly although you must know that some of the things he does are extraordinary and mysterious  she was obviously distressed  there is something she said of course which i am not telling yousomething which i promised to keep secret but austen she went on laying her fingers upon my coat sleeve let me tell you this i am getting more and more worried every day i understand nothing the explanations which i have had from my uncle grow more and more extraordinary why we are here why he is still in hiding why he lives in the shadow of such fear day by day i cannot imagine i am beginning to lose heart through the telephone last night i told him that i must see him he has half promised that i shall today or tomorrow i shall tell him austen that i must know more about the reasons for all this mystery or i will go back to madame quintaines i wrote to her soon after i came here when i was frightened and she told me that she would gladly have me back my uncles have always paid her a good deal of money she went on for taking care of me  i drew a long breath of relief  felicia i said you are talking like a dear sensible little woman but i added you have not answered my question  she looked away laughing  of course you are not in earnest she exclaimed  of course i am i persisted  you must know she said softly that i could not do a thing like that my uncle has always been so kind to me  but you have only seen him three weeks i interrupted before that he was in brazil  she was silent for several moments  well she said even if it were so he could be very kind to me couldnt he even if he was in brazil and i was in paris you see my father was the poor one of the family who died without any money at all yet i have always had everything in the world i want and when i come of age they are going to give me a great sum of money it is not that i think about she went on but they write to me always and they treat me as though i were their own daughter often they have said how they would love to have had me out in brazil i think that it is really their own kindness that they let me stay in paris  felicia i said tell me really how much you do know of your unclethe one who is with you now  she shook her head  no she said i cannot do that i made a promise and i must keep it but i will promise you this if you like if i find that it is not the truth which i have been told i will come to you if you want me  i held her hands tightly in mine  you are beginning to have doubts are you not i asked  oh i dont know she answered i dont know there are times when i am frightened austen i must go now  i looked at the clock it was almost two oclock  we couldnt have lunch together i suppose i asked  she shook her head laughing  i had lunch more than an hour ago she said and i have to meet madame at a dressmakers i must go really austen  cant i see you again dear  i will come into this room if i can about five she said dont come out with me now it is the luncheon time in the cafe and i am afraid of louis  she flitted away leaving behind a faint odor of violets shaken from the skirts she had lifted so daintily as she had hurried down the few steps i watched her out of sight then i opened the door myself and passed out into the cafe  louis for the first few minutes was not visible but one of the other maitres dhotel procured for me a table in a somewhat retired corner of the room my luncheon was already served before louis appeared before me for the second time his impassive countenance seemed to be disturbed  back in london captain rotherby he remarked with the ghost of his usual welcoming smile  back again louis i answered cheerfully  louis bent over my table  i thought he said that an english gentleman never broke his promise  nor does he louis i answered unless the circumstances under which it was given themselves change i came up from the country this morning  upon private business louis asked  no i answered upon the business in which you and mr delora are both interested did you know louis that i had a brother in brazil  what of it monsieur louis asked sharply  for once i had the best of matters louis was evidently in a highly nervous state from which i imagined that things connected with their undertaking whatever it might be had reached a critical stage there were lines underneath his eyes and he looked about him every now and then nervously  my brother i remarked first wrote to me to be sure and look up mr delora and to be civil to him i have done this to the best of my ability  louis frowned  go on he said  last night i continued speaking very deliberately my brother who is in london rang me up in norfolk he told me that he had just received a cable from dicky concerning mr delora it was at his earnest request that i came to london this morning by the bye louis i added i think that i should like some riz diane  louis looked for a moment as though he were about to consign my innocent desire for riz diane to the bottommost depths the effort with which he recovered himself was really magnificent he drew a long breath and bowed his acquiescence  by all means monsieur  he called to a waiter and was particular in his instructions as to my order then he turned back to me  monsieur he said you will tell me what was in that cable  i think not louis i answered you see i really cannot recognize you in this matter at all i must find mr delora at once it is important  but if he cannot be found louis asked quickly  then i think that the best thing i can do i continued after a moments pause is to call at the brazilian embassy  i had a feeling the feeling for a moment that notwithstanding the crowded room and louis attitude of polite attention my life was in danger there flashed something in his eyes indescribably venomous i seemed to see there his intense and passionate desire to sweep me from the face of the earth  of course i continued if i can find mr delora that is what i would really prefer there is a certain matter upon which i must have an explanation from him  monsieur will not have finished his luncheon for twenty minutes or so louis said calmly at the end of that time i will return  always glad to have a chat with you louis i declared  you will not leave he asked before i come back  not if you return in a reasonable time i answered  louis bowed and hurried off i saw him disappear for a moment into the service room when he came out into the restaurant he was once more discharging his duties moving about amongst his clients supervising suggesting bidding farewell to departing guests and welcoming new arrivals a very busy man louis for the cafe was crowded that day i wondered as i saw him pass backwards and forwards with that eternal and yet not displeasing smile upon his lips what lay at the back of his head concerning me     chapter xxxiv  an appointment with delora   my riz diane duly arrived but was served i noticed by a different waiter it looked very tempting and it was indeed a dish of which i was particularly fond but i realized that it had been specially ordered by louis and with a sigh i pushed it on one side i finished my luncheon with rolls and butter and took care to procure my coffee before louis returned  well i asked as he stopped once more before me what is it to be are you going to give me deloras address  that is not the trouble monsieur louis declared mr delora is away from london  i think you will find that he is back again louis i answered it was a very interesting trip to newcastle but it was soon over he arrived in london with his illustrious companion last night  this time i had really astonished louis he looked at me with a genuine expression of profound surprise  you are under the impression he said slowly that mr delora has been to newcastle  that is scarcely the way i look at it louis i answered you see i was in newcastle myself and saw him  i fancy that louis manner toward me from this time onward acquired a new respect but i recognized the fact that there was danger greater than ever before under his increasing suaveness  captain rotherby he said you were not meant to be an idle man you have gifts of which you should make use  in the meantime i said when can i see mr delora  this afternoon if you like louis answered here is his address  he scribbled a few words down on a piece of paper and passed it to me when i had received it i did not like it it was an outoftheway street in bermondsey in a quarter of which i was absolutely ignorant except by repute  couldnt we arrange dont you think louis i asked to have mr delora come up here  you could send down a note and ask him louis answered he is staying at that address under the name of hoffmeyer  i will write him a letter i decided signing my bill  you will let me know the result louis asked looking at me anxiously  certainly i answered  i rose to my feet but louis did not immediately stand aside  captain rotherby he said there is one thing i should like to ask you how did you know of mr deloras projected visit to newcastle  i smiled  why should i give away my methods louis i said you know very well that the movements of mr delora have become very interesting to me you and i are on opposite sides i certainly do not feel called upon to disclose my sources of information  i passed out of the restaurant and ascended to my own room there i drew a sheet of paper toward me and wrote      dear sir      i trust you will recognize the fact that although i am writing to     you from london and from the milan hotel i have not     intentionally broken the compact i made with you the fact is a     somewhat singular thing has occurred my brothermr richard     rotherbywhom you will doubtless remember and who speaks most     gratefully of your hospitality in brazil has sent me a cable on     behalf of your brothermr nicholas delora it seems that you     have not kept him acquainted with your doings here and that you     have failed to make use of a certain cipher that was agreed     upon he is therefore exceedingly anxious to know of your     doings and has begged me to see you at once and report will you     for that purpose be good enough to grant me a five minutes     interview      sincerely yours      austen rotherby  i sealed this letter and addressed it to the very obscure street in bermondsey which louis had designated then i procured a messenger boy and sent it off with instructions that the bearer must wait for an answer afterwards there was little for me to do but wait i tried to see felicia but i only succeeded in having the door of her rooms practically slammed in my face by madame muller i was too anxious for a reply to my letter to go round to the club so i simply hung about the place smoking and waiting when at last the messenger boy came back however it was only to report a certain amount of failure he had found the right address and delivered the note but the gentleman was out and not expected in till the evening after this i went round to my club leaving an order that any note or message was to be sent after me i cut into a rubber of bridge but i had scarcely finished my second game before a telegram was brought in for me sent on from the milan i tore it open it was from delora      have received your note will see you at this address ten oclock     this evening  i thrust the telegram into my waistcoat pocket and finished the rubber soon afterwards i cut out and took a hansom round to claridges hotel i found my brother in and expecting to hear from me  ralph i said i cant bring you any news just now if you must cable dicky you had better just cable that we are making inquiries i have an appointment to see delora at ten oclock tonight  where is he ralph asked with interest  the address he has sent me is some low street in bermondsey i answered it is absolutely impossible that he should have chosen such a place to stop in except as a hidingplace i dont like the look of it ralph  then dont go ralph said quickly there is no need for you to run into danger for nothing at all  i am not afraid of that i answered what really bothers me is that i am up against a problem which seems insoluble frankly i dont believe a snap of the fingers in delora no man however secret or important his business might be would descend to such subterfuges the only point in his favor is that this dodging about may be all due to political reasons i cannot understand his friendship with the chinese ambassador  cant you ralph answered i have been thinking over what you told me austen and i fancy perhaps i can give you a hint do you know that at the present moment the two most powerful battleships in the world are being built on the tyne for brazil  i know that i admitted go on  what does brazil want with battleships of that class my brother continued obviously they would be useless to her she could not man them it would be a severe strain to her finances even to put them into commission i am of opinion that the order to build them was given as a speculation by a few shrewd men in the brazilian government who foresaw unsettled times ahead and they are there to be disposed of to the highest european or asiatic bidder  i saw ralphs point at once  by jove i exclaimed you think then that delora is over here to arrange for the sale of them to some other governmentpresumably to china  why not ralph asked it is feasible and to some extent it explains a good deal of what has seemed to you so mysterious there could be no more possible purchaser of the battleships than china except perhaps russia and transactions of that sort are always attended with a large amount of secrecy  of course if you are on the right track i admitted everything is explained and delora is justified there is just one thing which i do not understand and that is why he should have associated with such a pack of thieves as the people at the cafe des deux epingles and why he should be forced to make an allyi had almost said accompliceof louis  well you cant understand everything all at once ralph answered at the same time if i were you i would try and see if the hint i have given you fits in with the rest of the puzzle  ill get the truth out of delora tonight i declared and ralph  well he asked  i have asked felicia delora to marry me i continued  ralph looked at me for a moment doubtfully  wouldnt it have been better to have had this matter cleared up first he asked  i couldnt help it i answered the child is all alone and it makes my heart ache to think what a poor little pawn she is in the game these men are playing id like to take her right away from it ralph but she is staunch she fancies that she is indebted to her uncle and she will obey his orders  you cant think any the worse of her for that ralph remarked  i dont i answered sighing but it makes the position a little difficult  come and see me tomorrow morning ralph said and tell me exactly what passes between you and delora we must cable dicky some time soon  i will i promised taking up my hat goodday ralph     chapter xxxv  a narrow escape   i felt that night an unusual desire to take all possible precautions before leaving the milan for bermondsey i wrote a letter explaining my visit and my suspicions and placed it in ashleys hands  look here ashley i said i am going off on an errand which i dont feel quite comfortable about between you and me it is connected with the disappearance of miss deloras uncle i feel that it is likely even probable that i shall get into trouble and i want you to promise me this if i am not back here by halfpast eleven i want you to take this letter which contains a full statement of everything to scotland yard either take it yourself i continued or send some one absolutely trustworthy with it  the man looked a little serious  very good sir he said ill attend to it at the same time if i might make the suggestion i should take a couple of plainclothes policemen with me its a pretty low part where you are going and one hears of queer doings nowadays  i am bound to go ashley i answered but i am not likely to come to much grief i have a revolver in my pocket and i have not studied boxing with baxter for nothing i dont fancy theres anything in bermondsey going to hurt me  i hope not sir ashley answered civilly at halfpast eleven if i do not hear from you i shall go myself to scotland yard  i nodded  and in the meantime i said a taxicab if you please  i drove to the address given me on the paper it was an odd halfforgotten street terminating in a culdesac and not far from the river the few houses it contained were larger than the majority of those in the neighborhood but were in a shocking state of repair the one at which i eventually stopped had a timber yard adjoining or rather attached to it i left the taxicab outside and made my somewhat uncertain way up to the front door only a few yards from me a great black dog was straining at his collar and barking furiously i was somewhat relieved when the door was opened immediately at my knock  is mr hoffmeyer staying here i asked  a little old man carrying a tallow candle stuck into a cheap candlestick nodded assent and closed the door after me i noticed without any particular pleasure that he also drew the bolts  what do you do that for i asked sharply i shall only be here a few minutes it is not worth while locking up  the man looked at me but said nothing he seemed to show neither any desire nor any ability for speech only as i repeated my question he nodded slowly as one who barely understands  mr hoffmeyer is in his room he said he will be glad to see you  i followed him along as miserable a passage as ever i saw in my life the walls were damp and the paper hung down here and there in long untidy patches the ceiling was barely whitewashed the stairs by which we passed were uncarpeted the whole place had a most dejected and weary appearance then he showed me into a small sittingroom in which one man sat writing at a table he looked up as i entered it was delora  well he said so this is how you keep your promise  something has happened since then i answered i have received a cable from my brother which we do not understand  a cable from your brother in brazil he asked slowly  yes i answered  delora turned slowly in his chair and rose to his feet he was tall and gaunt his face was lined he had somehow or other the appearance of a man who is driven to bay yet there was something splendid about the way he nerved himself to listen to me with indifference  what does he sayyour brother  the cable is inspired by nicholas delora i answered listen and i will read it to you  i read it to him word by word when i had finished he simply nodded  is that all he asked  that is all i answered you will see that what makes your brother anxious is that not only have you failed to keep your word so far as regards communicating with him but you have not made use of a certain private code arranged between you  the business upon which i am engaged delora said calmly is of great importance but i do not care to be rushing all the time to the telegraph office nicholas is a nervous person in a case like this he should be content to wait however since he has sought the interference of outsiders i will cable him tomorrow morning  very well i answered i can ask no more than that i shall go myself to the cable office and send my brother a message  what shall you tell him delora asked  i shall tell him that i have seen you i answered that you are well and that he will hear from you tomorrow morning  why cable at all delora asked surely tomorrow morning will be soon enough  from your point of view yes i said but there is one other thing which i am going to do i am going to say in my cable that if the news he receives from you tomorrow morning is not satisfactory i shall lay the matter before the brazilian legation here and i shall explain why  deloras eyes were like points of fire nevertheless his selfrestraint was admirable he contented himself indeed with a low bow  you will tell our friends there he said slowly that you have seen me that i amyou see i admit thatliving practically in hiding apart from my niece you will also perhaps inform them of various other little episodes with which owing to your unfortunate habit of looking into other peoples business you have become acquainted  naturally i answered  i think not delora said  there was an instants silence i looked at delora and wondered what he meant he looked at me as a man looks at his enemy  may i ask how you intend to prevent me i inquired  easily he answered with a slight sneer there are four men in this house who will obey my bidding there are also five modes of exit two of which lead into the river  i congratulate you i said upon the possession of such a unique lodginghouse  delora sighed  i can assure you he said that it is more expensive than the finest suite in the milan still what would you have when one has friends who are too curious one must receive them in a fitting lodging  you are a very brave man mr delora i said  indeed he answered dryly i should have thought that the bravery had lain in another direction  i shook my head  i i said am i fear a coward even when tonight i started out to keep my appointment with you i had fears i was so afraid i continued that i even went so far as to insure my safety  to insure your safety he repeated softly like a man who repeats words of whose significance he is not assured  i admit it i answered it was cowardly and i am sure unnecessary but i did it  his face darkened with anger  you have brought an escort with you perhaps he said you have the police outside  i shook my head  nothing so clumsy i answered there is just my taxicab which wont go away unless it is i who says to go and a little note i left with the hallporter of the milan to be opened in case i was not back in an hour and a half you see i continued apologetically my nerve has been a little shaken lately and i did not know the neighborhood  you are discretion itself delora said some day i will remember this as a joke against you have you been reading gaboriau my young friend or his english disciples this is your own citylondonthe most lawabiding place on gods earth  i know it i answered and yet a place is so much what the people who live in it may make it i must confess that your five exits two on to the river would have given me a little shiver if i had not known for certain that i had made my visit to you safe  delora tried to smile as a matter of fact i could see that the man was shaking with fury  you are a strange person captain rotherby he said if i had not seen you bear yourself as a man of courage i should have been tempted to congratulate your army upon its freedom from your active services you have no more to say to me  nothing more i answered  tomorrow morning at eleven oclock delora said you will be arrested for the attempted murder of stephen tapilow  it is exceedingly kind of you i answered to give me this warning i will make my arrangements accordingly  one thing delora said would change the course of fate  that one thing i remarked being that i should not send this cablegram  exactly delora answered in which case you will find your banking account the richer by ten thousand pounds  i looked at him steadfastly  what manner of a swindle is this i asked in which you louis poor bartot the chinese ambassador and heaven knows how many more are concerned  you are an ignorant person to use such words delora replied  tell me at least i begged whether your niece is implicated in this  why do you ask delora exclaimed  because i want to marry her i answered  do nothing until the day after tomorrow captain rotherby and you shall marry her and have a dowry of fifty thousand pounds besides what her uncle nicholas will leave her  you overwhelm me i answered turning toward the door  he made no movement to arrest my departure suddenly i turned towards him why should i not give him the benefit of this one chance  delora i said from the moment when you disappeared from charing cross i have had but one idea concerning you and that is that you are engaged in some nefarious if not criminal undertaking i believe so at this minute on the other hand there is of course the chance that you may be as you say engaged in carrying out some enterprise political or otherwise which necessitates these mysterious doings on your part i have no wish to be your enemy or to interfere in any legitimate operation if you care to take me into your confidence you will not find me unreasonable  delora bowed i caught the gleam of his white teeth underneath his black moustache i knew that he had made up his mind to fight  captain rotherby he said i am much obliged for your offer but i am not in need of allies send your cable as soon as you will you will only make a little mischief of which you will afterwards be ashamed  i shrugged my shoulders and turned away no one came to let me out but i undid the bolts myself and stepped into my taxicab with a little breath of relief somehow or other i felt as though i had escaped from a danger which i could not define and yet which i had felt with every breath i had drawn in that damp unwholesomelooking house     chapter xxxvi  an abortive attempt   immediately i arrived at my brothers hotel i rang up the hallporter of the milan and informed him of my whereabouts afterwards ralph and i between us concocted a cable to dicky for which i was thankful that i had not to pay i had now taken ralph into my entire confidence and i found that he took very much the same view of deloras behavior as i did this is what we said      have seen delora behavior very mysterious is living apart from     niece in secrecy seen several times with chinese ambassador     offered me large bribe refrain cabling you till thursday fear     something wrong  do you think that you could give me a bed here tonight ralph i asked  by all means old fellow my brother answered to tell you the truth i think you are better here than at the milan you can have the rooms you had the other night  i had had a tiring day and i dropped off to sleep almost as soon as my head touched the pillow i was awakened by the sound of the telephone bell close to my head i had no idea as to the time but from the silence everywhere i judged that i had been asleep for several hours i took up the receiver and held it to my ear  hullo i exclaimed  is that captain rotherby a familiar voice asked  yes i said thats ashley isnt it  yes sir the man answered i am on night duty here will you excuse my asking you sir if you have lent your room to any one  certainly not i replied why  its a very odd thing sir he continued a person arrived here with a small bag a little time ago and presented your cardsaid that you had given him permission to sleep in your room i let him go up but i didnt feel altogether comfortable about it so i took the liberty of ringing up claridges to see if you were there i thought that as you were here this evening you would have told us if you had proposed lending it  you are quite right ashley i declared i have lent the room to no one you had better go and see who it is at once shall i come round  i will ring you up again sir the man answered as soon as i have been upstairs  by the bye i asked he didnt look like a frenchman did he  i could not say so ashley replied i will ring you up in a few minutes i shall go up and inquire into this myself  i sat on the edge of the bed waiting in less than ten minutes the telephone bell rang again once more i heard ashleys voice  i am ringing up from your sittingroom sir he said there is no one here at all but the room has been opened so far as i can see nothing has been taken but a bottle of chloroform has been dropped and broken upon the floor in your bedroom and i have a strong idea that some one left the room by the other door as i entered the sittingroom  ill come along at once ashley i saidthat is as soon as i can get dressed  i was wondering sir was the quiet reply whether i would advise you to do so i did not like the look of the man who came and i am afraid he was not up to any good here he is somewhere in the hotel now  you say that nothing has been disturbed i asked  nothing at all sir it wasnt for robbery he came  i think i can guess what he wanted ashley said i perhaps you are right i wont come round till the morning  if anything fresh happens sir i will let you know the man said good night sir  good night ashley i answered  i got back into bed but i did not immediately fall off to sleep again there was no doubt at all that my visitor had come at the instigation of delora and that his object had been to prevent my sending that cable which was already on its way i got up and saw that my door was securely fastened i am ashamed to confess that at that moment i felt a tremor of fear i no longer had the slightest doubt that delora if not an impostor was engaged in some great criminal operation and felicia i thought of the matter in every way it was impossible that delora could be an impostor pure and simple felicia was content to travel with him she knew him for her uncle he must be her uncle unless she herself had deceived me i felt my blood run cold at the thought i flung it from me i would have no more of it felicia at least was above suspicion delora had perhaps been led into this enterprise whatever it might be by louis and his friends at any rate the morrow was likely to clear things up i was the more convinced of that when i remembered that it was one days grace only that delora had begged of me i went off to sleep again soon and only woke when my brothers servant called me for my bath at halfpast ten after a consultation with my brother i drove to the brazilian embassy i sent in my card and asked to see mr lamartine he came to me in a few minutes  captain rotherby he exclaimed holding out his hand you have some news  i am not sure whether you will call it news i answered i came to see you about this man delora  sit down lamartine said i only wish that you had given me all your confidence the other day  to tell you the truth i am not sure whether i have any to give now i answered there are just one or two facts which seem to me so peculiar that i decided to look you up  i am very glad indeed to see you captain rotherby lamartine said something is happening in connection with this person which i am afraid may lead to very serious trouble i know now more than i did when i hung around you and miss delora at charing cross station and in the course of the day i hope to know more  i should have washed my hands of the whole affair i told him before now but from the fact that i have received a cable from my brother who is in rio concerning these very people he had first of all in a letter asked me to be civil and to look them up his cable begged me on behalf of an elder brother out there to look after delora find out what he was doing and report i gathered that he was over here on some special mission as to the progress of which he should have made reports to his brother in brazil he has not done so nor has he used the private code agreed upon between those two  this is very interesting lamartine saidvery interesting indeed  i came to you i said because since the receipt of this cable i have convinced myself that delora is engaged in some sort of underground work the crisis of which must be very close at hand i found him last night in a miserable deserted sort of building down near the river in bermondsey he offered me ten thousand pounds not to reply to his brothers cable i think that he would have done his best to have detained me there but for the fact that i had taken precautions before i started  have you any idea lamartine asked what the nature of this underground business is  i cannot imagine i answered in some way it seems to me that it is connected with the chinese ambassador because i have seen them several times together that however is only surmise i can give you one more piece of information i added and that is that the chinese ambassador and delora have recently visited newcastle  lamartine smiled  i know everything except one thing he said and that we shall both of us know before the day is out our friend delora has played a great game even now i cannot tell you whether he has played to win or to lose since you have been so kind as to look me up captain rotherby he went on let us spend a little time together do me for instance the honor to lunch with me at the milan at one oclock  with louis i asked grimly  i do not think that louis will hurt us lamartine answered there is just a chance even that we may not find him on duty today  i will lunch with you with pleasure i said but there is one thing which i must do first  lamartine looked at me narrowly  you want to see miss delora he asked  it was foolish to be offended i admitted the fact  well he said it is natural miss delora is a very charming young lady and so far as i know she believes in her uncle at the same time i am not sure captain rotherby that the neighborhood of the milan is very safe for you just now  at this hour of the morning i said one should be able to protect ones self  it is true lamartine answered tell me captain rotherby at what hour did you send that cable last night  at midnight i answered  lamartine glanced at the clock  soon he said we shall have an official cable here and then things will be interesting shall we meet then at the milan  precisely i answered you dont feel inclined i added to be a little more candid with me my head has ached for a good many days over this business  a few hours longer wont hurt you lamartine answered laughing i can promise you that it will be worth waiting for     chapter xxxvii  delora returns   at a few minutes before twelve i entered the milan by the court entrance and received at once some astonishing news ashley who came out to meet me drew me at once upon one side with a little gesture of apology  mr delora has returned sir he said  for the moment i had forgotten the sensation which deloras nonarrival on that first evening had made and which had always left behind it a flavor of mystery i could see from ashleys face that he was puzzled  is mr delora with his niece i asked  they have moved into number 35 sir ashley told me mr delora complained very much of his rooms said they were too small and threatened to move to claridges number 35 is the best suite we have  i stood for a moment thinking ashley meanwhile had retreated to his place behind the counter i approached him slowly  ashley i said ring up and tell mr delora that i have called  ashley went at once to the telephone  dont be surprised i said if his reply isnt exactly polite i dont think he is very well pleased with me just now  i strolled away for a few minutes to look into the cafe where the waiters were preparing for luncheon there was no sign of louis when i returned ashley leaned forward to me from the other side of the desk  mr delora wishes you to step up sir he said  i was a little surprised but i moved promptly to the lift  on the third floor isnt it i asked  exactly sir ashley answered shall i send a page with you  i shook my head  i can find it all right i said  my knock at the door was answered by a darkfaced valet he ushered me into a large and very handsome sittingroom felicia and delora were standing talking together near the mantelpiece they both ceased at my entrance but i had an instinctive feeling that i had been the subject of their conversation felicia greeted me timidly there were signs of tears in her face and i felt that by some means or other this man had been able to reassert his influence over her delora himself was a changed being he was dressed with the almost painful exactness of the french man of fashion his slight black imperial was trimmed to a point his moustache upturned with a distinctly foreign air he wore a wonderful pin in his carefully arranged tie and a tiny piece of red ribbon in his buttonhole the manicurist whom i had met in the passage had evidently just left him for as i entered he was regarding his nails thoughtfully he did not offer me his hand he stared at me instead with a certain restrained insolence  i should be glad to know captain rotherby he said calmly to what i owe this intrusion  i am sorry that you look upon it in that light sir i answered my visit as a matter of fact was intended for your niece  she took a step towards me but deloras outstretched arm barred her progress  my niece is very much honored he answered but her friends and her acquaintances are mine you were so good as to render me some service on our arrival at charing cross a few days ago but you have since then presumed upon that service to an unwarrantable extent  i am sorry that you should think so i answered  i did not know delora continued that the young men of your country had time enough to spare to devote themselves to other peoples business in the way that you have done i came to this country upon a peculiar and complicated mission intrusted to me by my own government the chief condition of success was that it should be performed in secrecy you were only a chance acquaintance and how on earth you should have had the impertinence to associate yourself with my doings i cannot imagine but the fact remains that you made my task more difficult and in fact at one time seriously endangered its success not only that delora continued but you have chosen to ally yourself with those whose object it has been to wreck my undertaking yet with the full knowledge of these things you have had the supreme impudence to force your company upon my nieceeven i understand to pay her your addresses  the dowry of fifty thousand pounds i began  he stretched out his hand with a commanding air  we will not allude to that sir he declared i was forced to make an attempt to bribe you i admit but it was under very difficult circumstances as it is i am only thankful that you declined my offer i have arranged matters so that your cable shall do me no harm it has precipitated matters by twentyfour hours but that is no ones loss and my gain when i heard your name sent up i could scarcely believe my ears but since you are here since you have ventured to pay this call i wish to inform you on behalf of my niece and myself that we consider your further acquaintance undesirable in the extreme  the mans deportment was magnificent but for the fact that i had long ago lost all faith in him i should have felt without the shadow of a doubt that i had made a supreme fool of myself but as it was my faith was only shaken the hideous possibility that i had made a mistake was there like a shadow but i could not accept it as a certainty  mr delora i said from one point of view i am very glad to hear you speak like this if i have been mistaken in supposing that your extraordinary behavior in london  but what the devil has my extraordinary behavior got to do with you delora demanded with the first note of anger in his tone which he had shown  my interest was for your niece sir i answered  my niece does not require your protection or your interest delora answered it seems to me that you have chosen a queer way to return the hospitality which it was our pleasure to extend to your brother in brazil i have still a busy morning sir and i have seen you for this one reason only to have you clearly understand that wemy niece and ido not find your further acquaintance desirable  she made another little movement towards me and by doing so came into the light i saw that her eyes were red with weeping and notwithstanding an angry exclamation from delora she held out her hands to me  capitaine rotherby she said i believe i do indeed that you have acted out of kindness to me my uncle as you see is very angry what he has said has not been from my heart but from his yet as you know i must obey  i raised her fingers to my lips and i smiled into her face  felicia i said do not be afraid this is not the end  delora turned to the servant whom he had summoned  show this gentleman out francois he said coldly                                       lamartine was a few minutes late he drove up in a large motorcar with an elderly gentleman who remained inside and with whom he talked for a few minutes earnestly before he joined me  you forgive me he asked as he handed his hat and stick to an attendant the chief kept me talking he brought me down here himself  i nodded  it is of no consequence i said i have some news for you  nothing lamartine declared passing his arm through mine will surprise me  delora is here i said with his niece  lamartine stopped short  under his own name he asked do you mean that he has thrown off all disguise that he is here as maurice delora  i never knew his christian name i answered but he is here as delora right enough he has taken the largest suite in the court and for the last quarter of an hour he has been dressing me down in great shape  he is magnificent lamartine said softly if he can keep it up for twentyfour hours longer he who has been a beggar practically for ten years will be worth a great fortune  so that i remarked was the stake  a worthy one is it not so my friend lamartine declared  does he win i asked  heaven knows lamartine answered even now i cannot tell you unless something turns up i should say that it was very likely  we entered the cafe when louis saw us arrive together he stood for a moment motionless upon the floor his eyes seemed to question us with swift and fierce curiosity had we arrived together was this a chance meeting how much was either in the others confidence these things and many others he seemed to ask then he came slowly towards us a ray of sunshine streaming through the glass roof of the courtyard and reflected through the window lay across the floor of the cafe as louis passed over it i saw a change in the man always colorless his white cheeks were graven now with deep cobwebbed lines his eyes seemed to have receded into his head his manner lacked that touch of graceful and not unbecoming confidence which one had grown to admire  what can i do for you messieurs he asked with a little bow a table for twoyes this way  we followed him to a small table in the best part of the room  monsieur had good sport in the country he asked me  excellent louis i answered how are things in town  louis shrugged his shoulders and glanced around  as one sees he answered here we are fortunate here we are always always busy we turn people away all the time because we prefer to serve well our old customers  louis i said you are wonderful  what will the gentlemen eat louis asked  i looked at lamartine and lamartine looked at me the same thought was in the minds of both of us curiously enough we felt a certain delicacy in letting louis perceive our dilemma  those cold grouse look excellent lamartine said to me pointing to the sideboard  cold grouse are very good louis assented i will have one specially prepared and sent up  lamartine shook his head  bring over the dish there and let us look at them louis he said  louis obeyed him there was no alternative lamartine without hesitation coolly took one of the birds on to his own plate  our luncheon is arranged for louis he said let a waiter bring us a dish and carvingknife i like to carve myself at the table  but certainly louis assented and calling a waiter he glided away lamartine and i exchanged glances  i fancy we are pretty safe with this bird he remarked  absolutely i answered he never had the ghost of a chance to tamper with it the question of drinks is a little difficult i continued  and i am very thirsty lamartine said an unopened bottle of hock eh  i shook my head  no good i answered i am convinced that louis has a cellar of his own did you notice the fellow by the bye i went on he shows signs of the worry of this thing somehow or other i do not fancy that louis will be in this place a week from today  that may be lamartine answered but i must drink  there was a bottle of whiskey upon the table next to us from which its occupant had been helping himself he rose now to go and i seized the opportunity the moment he had left and before the waiter could clear the table i had secured the bottle  we wont risk sodawater i said whiskey and water is good enough  the one waiter whom i dislikeda creature of louis as i knew wellcame hurrying forward and endeavored to possess himself of the bottle  let me get you another bottle of whiskey sir he said  i shook my head  this one will do thank you i said  sodawater or perrier sir he asked  neither thank you i answered  the man moved away and i saw him in a corner talking to louis lamartine served the grouse and leaned across the table to me  captain rotherby he said i think i will tell you now why notwithstanding the risk of monsieur louis i asked you to lunch with me here at this restaurant but look see who comes  he laid his fingers upon my coatsleeve i turned my head felicia was sailing down the roomfelicia exquisitely dressed as usual walking with a soft rustle of lacedelightful alluring and in her wake delora himself tall wellgroomed aristocratic looking around him with mild but slightly bored interest louis was piloting them to a table the best in the place we watched them seat themselves delora through a hornrimmed eyeglass studied the menu felicia drawing off her gloves looked a little wearily out into the busy courtyard so they were sitting when the thing happened which lamartine i believe had expected but which for me was the most wonderful thing that had yet come to pass amongst this tangle of strange circumstances     chapter xxxviii  at bay   the entrance of these two persons into the room apart from its astonishing significance to us seemed to excite a certain amount of interest amongst the ordinary throng my lady of the turquoises wore a darkblue closely fitting gown which only a paris tailor could have cut a large and striking hat and a great bunch of red roses in the front of her dress but after all it was upon her companion not upon her that our regard was riveted he was dressed with the neat exactitude of a frenchman of fashion he wore a red ribbon in his buttonhole his white hair and moustaches were perfectly arranged he leaned heavily upon a stick and he had the appearance of a man prematurely aged as though by an illness or some great suffering his tone as he turned to his companion was courteous enough but querulous  my dear he said this place is full of draughts we must find a table over there by the palm  he pointed with his stick and it was just at this moment that louis rounding the corner from a distant part of the room came face to face with them once before during the last twentyfour hours i had been struck with the pallor of louis expression this time he stood quite still in the middle of the floor as though he had seen a ghost he was close to a pillar and i saw his hand suddenly go out to it as though in search of support his breath was coming quickly from where i sat i could see the little beads of sweat breaking out upon his forehead  monsieur he exclaimed  the newcomer turned to look at him for a moment he seemed puzzled it was as though some old memory were striving to reassert itself  my man he said to louis surely i know your face you have been here a long time havent you  ten years sir louis answered permit me  he gave them a table not far away from mine the memory of his face as he preceded them down the room never left me i glanced instinctively towards delora his back was turned towards the entrance of the restaurant and he had apparently seen nothing felicia on the contrary sat as though she were turned to stone i saw her lean over and whisper to her companion a little murmur of excitement broke from my companions lips  this he murmured is amazing the girl is a fool to bring him here she must know that louis is in it  who is the man i asked  lamartine looked at me with a curious expression in his dark eyes  do you mean to say that you cannot guess he asked  i shook my head  only that he must be some relation to delora i declared there has been no time though for his brother to get across from south america  lamartine smiled  you are dull he said but watch what is going to happen now i wonder  delora had risen to his feet he had the look of a man who has received a shock he brushed past some people who were taking their places at a table without remark or apology he passed my companion and myself without even i believe being conscious of our presence he walked straight to the table where the two newcomers sat i saw his hand fall upon the shoulder of the other man  ferdinand he said  the lady of the turquoises was leaning forward in her place as though to push delora away a few feet in the background louis was hovering  ferdinand i heard delora repeat what are you doing here who is this person you know that you are not well enough to travel  the older man looked at him with a slightly puzzled air there was a certain vacuity in his expression for which one found it hard to account  you he murmured as though perplexed why this is not paris maurice  louis had glided a little nearer to the table my lady of the turquoises half rose to her feet her blue eyes were fierce with anger she looked as though she would have struck delora  you shall not take him away she cried dont have anything to say to them she added bending downwards to her companion you are not safe with any one else except me  delora turned towards her with an angry exclamation  madame he said this gentleman is my relation and he is ill he is certainly not in a condition to be travelling about the country withwith you  her selfcontrol was beginning to evaporate she addressed him shrilly people at the surrounding tables were beginning to observe this unusual conversation  what then she cried is he not safer with me than you how about henrihenri who came over here because we had been deceived he and ipoor henri who died  this delora muttered is your revenge then  it is my revenge and i mean to have it she answered this afternoon you will see  louis advanced and bowed to the man who still sat at the table looking a little puzzled and with his eyes still fixed upon delora  monsieur he said shall i serve luncheon  there was an instants pause i fancied that i saw something pass between louis and delora the latter turned away with a little shrug of the shoulders  presently will be time he said we will speak together all three of us before you leave  the woman struck the table with the palm of her hand  there is nothing which you need say she exclaimed it is finished this fine scheme of yours see he is here himself this afternoon we go to warn those whom you would rob  once more that look flashed between louis and delora and this time there was borne in upon me the swift consciousness of what it might mean delora returned to his place opposite felicia i bent across the table to lamartine  lamartine i said there was a man who came here oncea companion of that womanbartot he came to make trouble with louis and he dined here once he dined nowhere else on earth  lamartine was suddenly grave  would louis dare he muttered  why not i answered see louis is watching us even now  lamartine half rose from his seat i pushed him back  no i said it is not for you it is i who will arrange this thing  i left my place and walked towards the table where the two were sitting i saw delora lay down his knife and fork and watch me with fixed intent gaze i saw louis lips twist into a snarl he glided to the table even as i did i held out my hand to the woman  you have not forgotten me i hope i asked i am very glad indeed to see you in london  she gave me her hand and smiled her most bewitching smile i turned and stared at louis he had no alternative but to fall back a pace or two  madame i said bending towards her it was here that bartot came and dined i have heard it whispered that it is not safe to eat here if you are not a friend of louis  for a moment she failed to grasp the significance of my words then the color died slowly out of her cheeks her face was like the face of an old woman fear had come suddenly and she was haggard  you mean that he would dare monsieur she said  it is easy i answered a dozen or more of these waiters are his creatures from what i have heard i gather that your visit here with this gentleman is for a purpose inimical to some scheme in which delora and louis are interested i warn you that if it is so you had better change your mind about lunching  we will go at once she answered you are very kind i came to confront louis and that other with me she declared nodding vigorously at her companion i came because i would have them understand who it was that had ruined their plans because they made use of meof bartot and meand threw us aside like gloves that were finished with but it was a foolish thing to do monsieur i see that and i thank you now for your warning  she gathered her things together for her departure and leaned across towards her companion what she said to him i do not know for i returned to my place  they will not eat i whispered to lamartine tell me who is the man  hush lamartine said look there  apparently angry words had been passing between felicia and delora she had risen to her feet notwithstanding his efforts to detain her swept past my table with scarcely a glance and made her way towards where the two latest arrivals were sitting she stooped down towards the man and talked to him earnestly for several moments all the time he looked at her with the puzzled halfvacant expression of a child who is confronted with something which it does not understand delora had risen to his feet and stood nervously clutching the serviette in his hand louis hurried up to him and they talked together for a moment  at all costs i heard louis say she must be fetched away they will not remain here to eat rotherby has warned them see how he is looking at her it is not safe  something more passed between them in a low tone delora glanced at his watch and then at the clock finally he crossed the room to where his niece was standing and laid his hand upon the mans shoulder  ferdinand he said i am glad to see that you are better come up to my rooms for a few minutes we must have a talk  at the sound of his voice something seemed to come back to the face of the older man he rose slowly to his feet i could see his white fingers trembling but i could see his eyes suddenly fill with a new and stronger light  you he exclaimed yes i am here to talk to you it had better be at once lead the way  i saw delora look towards the lady of the turquoises apparently he made some remark which i failed to overhear  this lady is my companion i heard the other say she has been very kind to mekinder i am afraid as a stranger than others have been on whom i should have relied she will accompany us she does not leave me  then the four of them turned towards the door lamartine jogged my shoulder and i too rose behind louis was hovering watching their departure with a nervous anxiety which he could not conceal lamartine and i went out close upon their heels  a new move louis i asked as i passed  the last monsieur louis answered with a bow     chapter xxxix  the unexpected   the entrance to the milan court was small and unimposing compared with the entrance to the hotel proper i reached it to find some confusion reigning a tall graybearded man was talking anxiously to the hallporter felicia standing a little apart was looking around with an air of bewilderment my lady of the turquoises was standing by the side of the lift with her arm drawn through her companions lamartine no sooner saw the face of the man who was in conversation with the hallporter than he sprang forward  your excellency he exclaimed  the ambassador turned quickly towards him  where is delora he asked  he was here but five seconds ago lamartine answered he must have left the door as you entered it  the man who was standing with my lady of the turquoises turned suddenly round  delora he exclaimed that is my name i am ferdinand delora my brother maurice was here a moment ago you are signor vanhallon are you not he continued you must remember me  the ambassador grasped him by the hand  my dear delora he said of course i do what has been the meaning of all this mystery  lamartine stepped quickly forward  cant you see what it all means he exclaimed ferdinand delora here arrives in paris on a secret mission to england there through some reason or through some causewho knowshe falls ill there comes to london maurice delora with some papers playing his part maurice delora was here a moment ago his game is up and he is evidently gone the one thing to be feared is that we are too late  the ambassador turned swiftly to the new delora who was looking from one to the other with the pained halfvacant expression of a child  delora he exclaimed how comes it that you have let your brother intervene did you not understand how secret your mission was to behow important  the man shook his head slowly  i am sorry he said i have been ill i know nothing there was an accident in paris i have no papers any longer maurice has them all  my lady of the turquoises plunged into the conversation  but it has been a wicked conspiracy she cried monsieur here she added clutching his arm was drugged and poisoned since then he has been like a child he was left to die but i found him i brought him here and meanwhile that wicked brother has been playing his partusing even his name  i went to felicia  felicia i said it is you who can clear this up the time has come when you must speak  felicia was standing with her hands clasped to her head looking from one to the other of the speakers as though she were trying in vain to follow the sense of what they said at my words she turned to me a little piteously she was beginning to understand but she had not realized the whole truth yet  the lady over there she said pointing to my lady of the turquoises has spoken the truth uncle ferdinand was ill when he arrived in paris he stayed with usthat is my uncle maurice and iin the rue dhauteville he seemed to get worse all the time and he was worried because of some business in london which he could not attend to then it was arranged that my uncle maurice should take his place and come over here only no one was to know that it was not ferdinand himself it was secret business for the brazilian government i do not know what it was about but it was very important  your uncle maurice then i said was the uncle who lived in pariswhom you knew best  she nodded  yes i have had to call him ferdinand over here it was hateful but they all said that it was necessary  a motor drew up outside the chinese ambassador stepped out with more haste than i had ever seen him use and by his side a man in dark clothes and silk hat who from the first i suspected to be a bank manager the brazilian minister welcomed them on the threshold  you are looking for delora he exclaimed  the chinese ambassador looked around at the little circle his face was emotionless yet he spoke with a haste which was unusual  it is true that i seek him he said this morning he has cashed a cheque for two hundred thousand pounds i do not understand there is a part of our bargain which he has not kept  a gleam of intelligence flitted into the face of the newly discovered delora he stepped forward  it is in order he said you have taken over from my brother who represents the brazilian government two new battleships  that is so his excellency answered but i want the indemnity of your ambassador  i cannot give it you the ambassador declared until i have received the money  where is delora some one asked  we looked around the same suspicion was in the minds of all of us delora had fled i drew my arm through felicias and led her to the lift  dear i said you must come upstairs with me  she clung to me a little hysterically  what do they mean she said it is not true that my uncle has been working for the government  it is true enough i answered the only point for doubt is what he has done with the money he received on their account your uncle ferdinand there was the person who was intrusted with the plans and commission for some reason or other your uncle maurice has carried it through and to tell you the truth i believe he has gone off with the money if you take my advice you will bring your uncle ferdinand upstairs and the lady who is with him if you like and let the others fight it out  she took my advice the new delora was exhausted and without any complete comprehension of what had taken place felicia busied herself attending to him then a sudden idea struck me i opened the door of the further bedchamber softly and stood face to face with delora there was a quick flash and i looked into the muzzle of a revolver delora was apparently preparing for flight he had changed his clothes and a small handbag ready packed was upon the bed  so its you you dd interfering englishman he said theres no one id sooner send to perdition  i stood quite still i could not exactly see what was best to be done for the mans hand was steady and i scarcely saw how i could escape if indeed he pressed the trigger  they are looking for you everywhere i said the sound of that revolver would fill your room  do you think i dont know it he answered do you think you would not have had a bullet through your forehead before now if i was not sure of it  put your revolver down and talk sense i said i am interested in no one except your niece  its a lie he answered its through you im in this hole  well heres a chance for you i said they are all of them down at the court entrance probably some of them are on their way up now turn to the left and take the other lift leave the hotel by the embankment entrance  and walk into a trap he snarled  upon my honor i know of none i answered it is exactly as i have said  i knew from his face that he had forgotten the other lift he snatched up his hat and disappeared i returned to the sittingroom and although i had made no promise the consciousness of my escape kept me silent as to having seen him felicia was sitting on the sofa talking to her uncle my lady of the turquoises with a triumphant smile upon her lips was occupying the easychair  felicia rose at once and drew me to the window  capitaine rotherby she said i fear that you will never forgive me nor believe meperhaps it does not matter so very muchbut you see i have seen no one but my uncle maurice since i was at school he used to visit me there he was always kind my uncle ferdinand there came as a stranger i knew nothing of him except that he was taken ill how he met with his illness no one told me then my uncle maurice came to me one night and said that his brother had come to europe on a wonderful secret mission and that now he was too ill to go on with it it must be carried through for the honor of the family he meant to call himself ferdinand delora and to come to england and do his best and i was to come with him and hold my peace and help him where it was possible i begin to understand now that somehow or other this poor ferdinand was illtreated and that my uncle maurice took his place meaning to steal the money he received but i did not know that indeed i did not know it she said sobbing  i passed my arm around her waist  felicia dear i said who would doubt it let them fight this matter out between them it is nothing to do with us you are here and you remain  she came a little closer into my arms with a sigh of content my lady of the turquoises laughed outright  you are infidele monsieur she exclaimed but there the poor child is young and she needs some one to look after her listen what is that  we all heard itthe sound of a shot in the corridor i kept felicia back for the moment but the others were already outside the waiter and the valet had rushed out of the service room a chambermaid with her apron over her head ran screaming along the corridor there in the middle delora lay flat on his back with his hands thrown out and a smoking revolver by his side  i did then what might seem to be a callous thing i left them all crowding around the body of the dead man i let even felicia be led back to her room by her companion i took the lift downstairs and i made my way into the cafe  where is louis i asked the first waiter i saw  he is away for a minute or two sir the man answered  almost as he spoke louis entered from the further end of the restaurant he did not see me and i noticed that his fingers were arranging his tie and that as he passed a mirror he glanced at his shirtfront when i came face to face with him he was breathing fast as though he had been running  louis i said five flights of stairs are trying at our time of life  he looked at me blankly and as one who does not comprehend  five flights of stairs monsieur he repeated  i nodded  i myself came down by the lift i said louis delora is lying in the corridor outside his rooms with a bullet through his forehead i am wondering whether he shot himself or whether  or whether what louis asked softly  i shrugged my shoulders  after all i said i suppose the truth will come out have you any idea i wonder where those two hundred thousand pounds are  i monsieurlouis held out his hands delora has had several hours to dispose of them if he had taken my advice he would have been flying to the south coast in his motor by now as to the money well it may be anywhere  it may louis i admitted  delora was a bungler louis said slowly the game was in his hands even the reappearance of his brother was not serious he was carrying out a perfectly legitimate transaction in which no one could interfere  excepting i remarked that he proposed to retain the proceeds of this sale of his  that would have been hard to prove if he had chosen to assert the contrary louis remarked vanhallon would have had little enough to say if the money had passed into his hands  and the chinese ambassador i remarked  his documents would have been good enough louis replied he has the ships he has value for his money there was no need for delora to have despaired his behavior during this last hour has been the behavior of a child monsieur will pardon me  louis glided away and i saw him smilingly escorting a party of late guests to their places i stood where i was and watched him to me the man was something amazing i firmly believed even at that moment that he had safely hidden part if not the whole of the proceeds of this gigantic scheme of fraud i believed too that his had been the hand which had killed delora and there he was within a few minutes of the time when the tragedy had happened waiting upon his guests consulted about the vintages of wines suggesting dishes upstairs delora lay with a little blue mark upon his temple it was the survival of the fittest this in crime as well as in the other things of life  i retraced my steps upstairs the chinese ambassador vanhallon and lamartine were deep in conversation in the dead mans sittingroom i was admitted to their confidence after a few minutes hesitation a draft for one hundred and sixty thousand pounds had been found upon the dead man but notes to the value of forty thousand pounds were missing they looked at me a little curiously as i entered and lamartine explained the situation to me  we were wondering about the young lady he said  then you need wonder no longer i said dryly i give my word for it that she is ignorant altogether of this scheme she believed that her uncle was honestly attempting to carry out the plans for which his brother came to europe and as for searching for the money amongst her belongings you might as well fly  where then vanhallon demanded has it gone to he has had so little time  i opened my lips and closed them after all i had gained my end and i had realized a little the folly of meddling with things which did not concern me so i held my peace i went and sat down by the side of my lady of the turquoises  tell me i said how did you find himand where has he been ill or what is it that is the matter  i moved my head towards where delora was sitting the placid childlike expression still remained with him the tragedy which had happened only a few yards away had left him unmoved  i heard all about him from henri she said the scheme originally was his then they tried to hurry things through without uswithout my man henri of whom they had made use henri came to london and he died here that much i know how much more there is to be told who can say but i said to myself i will be revenged i knew the hospital to which he had been takena private hospital from which few ever come out but i went there and i swore that i was his daughter i frightened them all for i knew that he had been drugged and poisoned till his brain had nearly given way they thought him harmless and they let him come with me i brought him to england i brought him here  and now i asked  now i must go back she answered but at least henri is avenged  she leaned towards me  tell whoever takes care of him she whispered in my ear that he cannot live long the doctors have assured me it is a matter of weeks  i walked with her to the door  it was an expensive journey for you i remarked  she laughed  henri did leave me everything she said i have no need of money if monsieur  she sighed and looked towards the door of felicias room then she fluttered away down the corridor and i slowly retraced my steps felicia came out in a few minutes and sat by her uncles side the others had all departed and we were left alone  dear i said this is no place for you any longer you must come with me and bring your uncle  she held out both her hands  wherever you say austen she murmured  a year afterwards i persuaded felicia to lunch at the milan she was no longer nervous for we were intensely curious to know if louis were still there  there is no doubt i reminded her that your uncle maurice received the sum of forty thousand pounds in notes when he was found shot there was in his pocketbook a draft to the amount of one hundred and sixty thousand pounds the notes had vanished i wonder where  i wonder she answered  a waiter whom i knew came up to greet us i asked him about louis he held out his hands  monsieur louis he declared had the great goodfortune a relative who died left him a great sum of money the hotel of benzoli in st james street was for sale and louis he has bought it he makes much money now  lucky louis i murmured how much was this legacy do you know  i have heard sir the man said bending down that it was as much as forty thousand pounds  so do the wicked flourish i murmured to felicia  monsieur will doubtless pay a visit to the cafe benzoli the man continued the cuisine is excellent and many of louis friends have followed him there  felicia and i exchanged smiling glances  somehow or other she murmured  i think the milan will be good enough for us i said decidedly   the end
