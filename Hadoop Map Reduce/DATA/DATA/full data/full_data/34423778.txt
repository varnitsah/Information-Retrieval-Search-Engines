34423778	the dwellingplace of light   by winston churchill   1917     chapter i  in this modern industrial civilization of which we are sometimes wont to boast a certain glacierlike process may be observed the bewildered the helplessand there are manyare torn from the parent rock crushed rolled smooth and left stranded in strange places thus was edward bumpus severed and rolled from the ancestral ledge from the firm granite of seemingly stable and lasting things into shifting shale surrounded by fragments of cliffs from distant lands he had never seen thus at five and fifty he found himself gatekeeper of the leviathan chippering mill in the city of hampton  that the polyglot smoky settlement sprawling on both sides of an historic river should be a part of his native new england seemed at times to be a hideous dream nor could he comprehend what had happened to him and to the world of order and standards and religious sanctions into which he had been born his had been a life of relinquishments for a long time he had clung to the institution he had been taught to believe was the rock of ages the congregational church finally to abandon it even that assuming a form fantastic and unreal as embodied in the edifice three blocks distant from fillmore street which he had attended for a brief time some ten years before after his arrival in hampton the building indeed was symbolic of a decadent and bewildered puritanism in its pathetic attempt to keep abreast with the age to compromise with anarchy merely achieving a nondescript medley of rounded knoblike towers covered with mulberrystained shingles and the minister was sensational and dramatic he looked like an actor he aroused in edward bumpus an inherent prejudice that condemned the stage half a block from this tabernacle stood a roman catholic church prosperous brazen serene flaunting an eternal permanence amidst the chaos which had succeeded permanence  there were to be sure other protestant churches where edward bumpus and his wife might have gone one in particular which he passed on his way to the mill with its terraced steeple and classic facade preserved all the outward semblance of the old order that once had seemed so enduring and secure he hesitated to join the decorous and dwindling congregationthe remains of a social stratum from which he had been pried loose andmore ironythis street called warren of arching elms and whitegabled houses was now the abiding place of those prosperous irish who had moved thither from the tenements and ruled the city  on just such a street in the once thriving new england village of dolton had edward been born in dolton bumpus was once a name of names rooted there since the seventeenth century and if you had cared to listen he would have told you in a dialect precise but colloquial the history of a family that by right of priority and service should have been destined to inherit the land but whose descendants were preserved to see it delivered to the alien the god of cotton mather and jonathan edwards had been tried in the balance and found wanting edward could never understand this or why the universe so long static and immutable had suddenly begun to move he had always been prudent but in spite of youthful advantages of an education so called from a sectarian college on a hill he had never been taught that while prudence may prosper in a static world it is a futile virtue in a dynamic one experience even had been powerless to impress this upon him for more than twenty years after leaving college he had clung to a clerkship in a dolton mercantile establishment before he felt justified in marrying hannah the daughter of elmer wench when the mercantile establishment amalgamated with a rivaland edwards services were no longer required during the succession of precarious places with decreasing salaries he had subsequently held a terrified sense of economic pressure had gradually crept over him presently growing strong enough after two girls had arrived to compel the abridgment of the familyit would be painful to record in detail the crackingoff process the slipping into shale the rolling the ending up in hampton where edward had now for some dozen years been keeper of one of the gates in the frowning brick wall bordering the canala position obtained for him by a compassionate but not too prudent childhood friend who had risen in life and knew the agent of the chippering mill mr claude ditmar thus had virtue failed to hold its own  one might have thought in all these years he had sat within the gates staring at the brick row of the companys boarding houses on the opposite bank of the canal that reflection might have brought a certain degree of enlightenment it was not so the fog of edwards bewilderment never cleared and the unformed question was ever clamouring for an answerhow had it happened jobs cry how had it happened to an honest and virtuous man the days of whose forebears had been long in the land which the lord their god had given them inherently american though lacking the saving quality of push that had been the making of men like ditmar he never ceased to regard with resentment and distrust the hordes of foreigners trooping between the pillars though he refrained from expressing these sentiments in public a bent broad shouldered silent man of that unmistakable physiognomy which in the seventeenth century almost wholly deserted the old england for the new the ancestral features were there the lipscovered by a grizzled moustache moulded for the precise formation that emphasizes such syllables as el the hooked nose and sallow cheeks the grizzled brows and grey eyes drawn down at the corners but for all its ancestral strength of feature it was a face from which will had been extracted and lacked the fire and fanaticism the indomitable hardness it should have proclaimed and which have been so characteristically embodied in mr st gaudenss statue of the puritan his clothes were slightly shabby but always neat  little as one might have guessed it however what may be called a certain transmuted enthusiasm was alive in him he had a hobby almost amounting to an obsession not uncommon amongst americans who have slipped downward in the social scale it was the bumpus family in america he collected documents about his ancestors and relations he wrote letters with a fine painful penmanship on a ruled block he bought at hartshornes drug store to distant bumpuses in kansas and illinois and michigan common descendants of ebenezer the original immigrant of dolton many of these western kinsmen answered not so the magisterial bumpus who lived in boston on the water side of beacon whom likewise he had ventured to addressto the indignation and disgust of his elder daughter janet  why are you so proud of ebenezer she demanded once scornfully  why arent we descended from him  how many generations  seven said edward promptly emphasizing the last syllable  janet was quick at figures she made a mental calculation  well youve got one hundred and twentyseven other ancestors of ebenezers time havent you  edward was a little surprised he had never thought of this but his ardour for ebenezer remained undampened genealogyhis ownhad become his religion and instead of going to church he spent his sunday mornings poring over papers of various degrees of discolouration making careful notes on the ruled block  this consciousness of his descent from good american stock that had somehow been deprived of its heritage while a grievance to him was also a comfort it had a compensating side in spite of the lack of sympathy of his daughters and his wife hannah bumpus took the situation more grimly she was a logical projection in a new environment of the religious fatalism of ancestors whose god was a god of vengeance she did not concern herself as to what all this vengeance was about life was a trap into which all mortals walked sooner or later and her particular trap had a treadmilla round of household duties she kept whirling with an energy that might have made their fortunes if she had been the head of the family it is bad to be a fatalist unless one has an incontrovertible belief in ones destinywhich hannah had not but she kept the little flat with its worn furniturewhich had known so many journeysas clean as a merchant ship of old salem and when it was scoured and dusted to her satisfaction she would sally forth to bonnaccossis grocery and provision store on the corner to do her bargaining in competition with the italian housewives of the neighborhood she was wont indeed to pause outside for a moment her quick eye encompassing the coloured prints of red and yellow jellies cast in rounded moulds decked with slices of orange the gaudy boxes of cereals and buckwheat flour the brookfield eggs in packages significant this modern package system of an era of flats with little storage space she took in at a glance the blue lettered placard announcing the current price of butterine and walked around to the other side of the store on holmes street where the beef and bacon hung where the sidewalk stands were filled in the autumn with cranberries apples cabbages and spinach  with little outer complaint she had adapted herself to the constantly lowering levels to which her husband had dropped and if she hoped that in fillmore street they had reached bottom she did not say so her unbetrayed regret was for the loss of what she would have called respectability and the giving up long ago in the little city which had been their home of the servant girl had been the first wrench until they came to hampton they had always lived in houses and her adaptation to a flat had been harda flat without a parlour hannah bumpus regarded a parlour as necessary to a respectable family as a wedding ring to a virtuous woman janet and lise would be growing up there would be young men and no place to see them save the sidewalks the fear that haunted her came true and she never was reconciled the two girls went to the public schools and afterwards inevitably to work and it seemed to be a part of her punishment for the sins of her forefathers that she had no more control over them than if they had been boarders while she looked on helplessly they did what they pleased janet whom she never understood was almost as much a source of apprehension as lise who became part and parcel of all hannah deemed reprehensible in this new america which she refused to recognize and acknowledge as her own country  to send them through the public schools had been a struggle hannah used to lie awake nights wondering what would happen if edward became sick it worried her that they never saved any money try as she would to cut the expenses down there was a limit of decency new england thrift hitherto justly celebrated was put to shame by that which the foreigners displayed and which would have delighted the souls of gentlemen of the manchester school every once in a while there rose up before her fabulous instances of this thrift of italians and jews who ignorant emigrants had entered the mills only a few years before they the bumpuses had come to hampton and were now independent property owners still rankling in hannahs memory was a day when lise had returned from school dark and mutinous with a tale of such a family one of the younger children was a classmate  they live on jordan street in a house and laura has roller skates i dont see why i cant  this was one of the occasions on which hannah had given vent to her indignation lise was fourteen her open rebellion was less annoying than janets silent reproach but at least she had something to take hold of  well lise she said shifting the saucepan to another part of the stove i guess if your father and i had put both you girls in the mills and crowded into one room and cooked in a corner and lived on onions and macaroni and put four boarders each in the other rooms i guess we could have had a house too we can start in right now if youre willing  but lise had only looked darker  i dont see why father cant make moneyother men do  isnt he working as hard as he can to send you to school and give you a chance  i dont want that kind of a chance theres sadie howard at schoolshe dont have to work she liked me before she found out where i lived  there was an element of selfishness in hannahs mania for keeping busy for doing all their housework and cooking herself she could not bear to have her daughters interfere perhaps she did not want to give herself time to think her affection for edward such as it was her loyalty to him was the logical result of a conviction ingrained in early youth that marriage was an indissoluble bond a point of views once having a religious sanction no less powerful now thatall unconsciouslyit had deteriorated into a superstition hannah being a fatalist was not religious the beliefs of other days when she had donned her best dress and gone to church on sundays had simply lapsed and lefthabits no new beliefs had taken their place  even after janet and lise had gone to work the household never seemed to gain that margin of safety for which hannah yearned always when they were on the verge of putting something by some untoward need or accident seemed to arise on purpose to swallow it up edward for instance had been forced to buy a new overcoat the linoleum on the diningroom floor must be renewed and lise had had a spell of sickness losing her position in a flower shop afterwards when she became a saleslady in the bagatelle that flamboyant department store in faber street she earned four dollars and a half a week two of these were supposed to go into the common fund but there were clothes to buy lise loved finery and hannah had not every week the heart to insist even when on an occasional saturday night the girl somewhat consciously and defiantly flung down the money on the diningroom table she pretended not to notice it but janet who was earning six dollars as a stenographer in the office of the chippering mill regularly gave half of hers  the girls could have made more money as operatives but strangely enough in the bumpus family social hopes were not yet extinct  sharply rudely the cold stillness of the winter mornings was broken by agitating waves of sound penetrating the souls of sleepers janet would stir her mind still lingering on some dream soon to fade into the inexpressible in which she had been near to the fulfilment of a hearts desire each morning as the clamour grew louder there was an interval of bewilderment of revulsion until the realization came of mill bells swinging in high cupolas above the riverone rousing another she could even distinguish the bells the deeptoned penetrating one belonged to the patuxent mill over on the west side while the arundel had a high ominous reverberation like a fire bell when at last the clangings had ceased she would lie listening to the overtones throbbing in the air high and low high and low lie shrinking awaiting the second summons that never failed to terrify the siren of the chippering millto her the cry of an insistent hungry monster demanding its daily food the symbol of a stern ugly and unrelenting necessity  beside her in the bed she could feel the soft body of her younger sister cuddling up to her in fright in such rare moments as this her heart melted towards lise and she would fling a protecting arm about her a sense of lises need of protection invaded her a sharp conviction like a pang that lise was destined to wander janet was never so conscious of the feeling as in this dark hour though it came to her at other times when they were not quarreling quarreling seemed to be the normal reaction between them  it was janet presently who would get up shivering close the window and light the gas revealing the room which the two girls shared together against the middle of one wall was the bed opposite this a traveldented walnut bureau with a marble top with an oval mirror into which were stuck numerous magazine portraits of the masculine and feminine talent adorning the american stage a preponderance of the music hall variety there were pictures of other artists whom the recondite would have recognized as movie stars amazing yet veridic stories of whose wealth lise read in the daily press all possessed limousinesan infallible proof to lise of the measure of artistic greatness between one of these movie millionaires and an exlegitimate lady who now found vaudeville profitable was wedged the likeness of a popular idol whose connection with the footlights would doubtless be contingent upon a triumphant acquittal at the hands of a jury of her countrymen and whose trial for murder in chicago was chronicled daily in thousands of newspapers and followed by lise with breathless interest and sympathy she was wont to stare at this lady while dressing and exclaimsay i hope they put it all over that district attorney  to such sentiments though deeply felt by her sister janet remained cold though she was as will be seen capable of enthusiasms lise was a truer daughter of her time and country in that she had the national contempt for law was imbued with the american heroworship of criminals that caused the bombardment of cora wellmans jail with candy fruit and flowers and impassioned letters janet recalled there had been others before mrs wellman caught within the meshes of the law who had incited in her sister a similar partisanship  it was lise who had given the note of ornamentation to the bedroom against the cheap faded lilac and gold wallpaper were tacked photoengravings that had taken the younger sisters fancy a young man and woman clad in scanty bathing suits seated side by side in a careening sail boatthe work of a popular illustrator whose manly and womanly types had become national ideals  there were other drawings if not all by the same hand at least by the same school one sketched in bold strokes of a dinner party in a stately neoclassic diningroom the table laden with flowers and silver the barethroated women with jewels a more critical eye than lises gazing upon this portrayal of the valhalla of success might have detected in the young men immaculate in evening dress a certain effort to feel at home to converse naturally which their square jaws and square shoulders belied this was no doubt the fault of the artists models who had failed to live up to the part at any rate the sight of these young gods of leisure the contemplation of the stolid butler and plush footmen in the background never failed to make lises heart beat faster  on the marble of the bureau amidst a litter of toilet articles and bought by lise for a quarter at the bagatelle bargain counter was an oval photograph frame from which the silver wash had begun to rub off and the band of purple velvet inside the metal had whitened the frame always contained the current object of lises affections though the exhibitsas janet saidwere subject to change without notice the adonis who now reigned had black hair cut in the prevailing hampton fashion very long in front and hanging down over his eyes like a scottish terriers very long behind too but ending suddenly shaved in a careful curve at the neck and around the ears it had almost the appearance of a japanese wig the manly beauty of mr max wylie was of the lanternjawed order and in his photograph he conveyed the astonished and pained air of one who has been suddenly seized by an invisible officer of the law from behind this effect one presently perceived was due to the high stiff collar the torture brand janet called it when she and her sister were engaged in one of their frequent controversies about life in general the obvious retort to this remark which lise never failed to make was that janet could boast of no beaux at all  it is only fair to add that the photograph scarcely did mr wylie justice in real life he did not wear the collar he was free and easy in his manners sure of his powers of conquest as lise observed he had made a homerun with her at slatterys riverside park sadie hartmann was sure sore when i tangoed off with him she would observe reminiscently  it was lises habit to slight her morning toilet to linger until the last minute in bed which she left in reluctant haste to stand before the bureau frantically combing out kinks of the brown hair falling over her shoulders before jamming it down across her forehead in the latest mode thus occupied she revealed a certain petulant beauty like the majority of shopgirls she was small but her figure was good her skin white her discontented mouth gave her the touch of piquancy apt to play havoc with the work of the world in winter breakfast was eaten by the light of a rococo metal lamp set in the centre of the table this was to save gas there was usually a rump steak and potatoes bread and creamery butterine and the inevitable new england doughnuts at six thirty the whistles screeched againa warning note the signal for edwards departure and presently after a brief respite the heavy bells once more began their clamour not to die down until ten minutes of seven when the last of the stragglers had hurried through the mill gates  the bumpus flat included the second floor of a small wooden house whose owner had once been evilly inspired to paint it a livid clayyellowas though insisting that ugliness were an essential attribute of domesticity a bay ran up the two stories and at the left were two narrow doorways one for each flat on the right the house was separated from its neighbour by a narrow interval giving but a precarious light to the two middle rooms the diningroom and kitchen the very unattractiveness of such a home however had certain compensations for janet after the effort of early rising had been surmounted felt a real relief in leaving it a relief too in leaving fillmore street every feature of which was indelibly fixed in her mind opposite was the blind brick face of a warehouse and next to that the converted dwelling house that held the shop of a bauer with the familiar replica of a green tencent trading stamp painted above it and the somewhat ironical announcementwhen boar frost whitened the pavementthat icecold soda was to be had within as well as cigars and tobacco fruit and candy then came a tenement under which two enterprising greeks by the name of pappasspelled papas lower downconducted a business called the gentleman a tailoring pressing and dyeing establishment janet could see the brilliantined black heads of the two proprietors bending over their boards and sometimes they would be lifted to smile at her as she passed the pappas brothers were evidently as happy in this drab environment as they had ever been on the sunny mountain slopes of hellas and janet sometimes wondered at this for she had gathered from her education in the charming public school that greece was beautiful  she was one of the unfortunate who love beauty who are condemned to dwell in exile unacquainted with what they love desire was incandescent within her breast desire for what it would have been some relief to know she could not like lise find joy and forgetfulness at dance halls at the movies at slatterys riverside park in summer in joy rides with the max wylies of hampton and beside the max wylies were afraid of her if at times she wished for wealth it was because wealth held the magic of emancipation from surroundings against which her soul revolted vividly idealized but unconfided was the memory of a seaside village the scene of one of the brief sojourns of her childhood where the air was fragrant with the breath of salt marshes where she recalled through the vines of a porch a shining glimpse of the sea at the end of a little street  next to pappas brothers was the grey wooden building of mule spinners hall that elite organization of skilled labour and underneath it the store of johnny tiernan its windows piled up with stoves and stovepipes sheet iron and cooking utensils mr tiernan like the greeks was happy too unlike the greeks he never appeared to be busy and yet he throve he was very proud of the business in which he had invested his savings but he seemed to have other affairs lying blithely on his mind affairs of moment to the community as the frequent presence of the huge policemen aldermen and other important looking persons bore witness he hailed by name italians greeks belgians syrians and french he hailed janet too with respectful cheerfulness taking off his hat he possessed the rare warm vitality that is irresistible a native of hampton still in his thirties his sharp little nose and twinkling blue eyes proclaimed the wisdom that is born and not made his stiff hair had a twist like the bristles in the cleaning rod of a gun  he gave janet the odd impression that he understood her and she did not understand herself  by the time she reached the common the winter sun as though red from exertion had begun to dispel the smoke and heavy morning mists she disliked winter the lumpy brown turf mildewed by the frost but one day she was moved by a quality hitherto unsuspected in the delicate tracery against the sky made by the slender branches of the great elms and maples she halted on the pavement her eyes raised heedless of passersby feeling within her a throb of the longing that could be so oddly and unexpectedly aroused  her way lay along faber street the main artery of hampton a wide strip of asphalt threaded with car tracks lined on both sides with incongruous edifices indicative of a rapid undiscriminating and artless prosperity there were long stretches of ten foot buildings so called on account of the single story their height deceptively enhanced by the superimposition of huge and gaudy signs one on top of another announcing the merits of stewarts amberine ale of cooleys oats the digestible breakfast food of graphophones and spring heeled shoes tobacco and naphtha soaps no we dont give trading stamps our products are worth all you pay these ten foot stores were the repositories of pianos automobiles hardware and millinery and interspersed amongst them were buildings of various heights the bagatelle where lise worked the wilmot hotel office buildings and an occasional relic of old hampton like that housing the banner here during those months when the sun made the asphalt soft on a scaffolding spanning the window of the store might be seen a perspiring young man in his shirt sleeves chalking up baseball scores for the benefit of a crowd below then came the funereal livercoloured longwindowed hinckley block 1872 and on the corner a modern glorified drugstore thrusting forth plate glass baystwo on faber street and three on stanleyfilled with cameras and candy hot water bags throat sprays catarrh and kidney cures calendars fountain pens stationery and handy alcohol lamps flanking the sidewalks symbolizing and completing the heterogeneous and bewildering effect of the street were long rows of heavy hemlock trunks unpainted and stripped of bark with crosstrees bearing webs of wires trolley cars rattled along banging their gongs trucks rumbled across the tracks automobiles uttered frenzied screeches behind startled pedestrians janet was always galvanized into alertness here faber street being no place to dream by night an endless procession moved up one sidewalk and down another staring hypnotically at the flashin and flashout electric signs that kept the breakfast foods and ales the safety razors soaps and soups incessantly in the minds of a fickle public  two blocks from faber street was the north canal with a granitepaved roadway between it and the monotonous row of company boarding houses even in bright weather janet felt a sense of oppression here on dark misty mornings the stern huge battlements of the mills lining the farther bank were menacing indeed bristling with projections towers and chimneys flanked by heavy walls had her experience included europe her imagination might have seized the medieval parallelthe arched bridges flung at intervals across the water lacking only chains to raise them in case of siege the place was always ominously suggestive of impending strife janets soul was a sensitive instrument but she suffered from an inability to find parallels and thus to translate her impressions intellectually her feeling about the mills was that they were at once fortress and prison and she a slave driven thither day after day by an allcompelling power as much a slave as those who trooped in through the gates in the winter dawn and wore down four times a day the oak treads of the circular tower stairs  the sound of the looms was like heavy rain hissing on the waters of the canal  the administrative offices of a giant mill such as the chippering in hampton are labyrinthine janet did not enter by the great gates her father kept but walked through an open courtyard into a vestibule where day and night a watchman stood she climbed ironshod stairs passed the doorway leading to the paymasters suite to catch a glimpse behind the grill of numerous young men settling down at those mysterious and complicated machines that kept so unerring a record in dollars and cents of the human labour of the operatives there were other suites for the superintendents for the purchasing agent and at the end of the corridor on the south side of the mill she entered the outer of the two rooms reserved for mr claude ditmar the agent and generalinchief himself of this vast establishment in this outer office behind the rail that ran the length of it janet worked from the window where her typewriter stood was a sheer drop of eighty feet or so to the river which ran here swiftly through a wide canon whose sides were formed by miles and miles of mills built on buttressed stone walls to retain the banks the prisonlike buildings on the farther shore were also of colossal size casting their shadows far out into the waters while in the distance up and down the stream could be seen the delicate web of the stanley and warren street bridges with trolley cars like toys gliding over them with insect pedestrians creeping along the footpaths  mr ditmars immediate staff consisted of mr price an elderly bachelor of tried efficiency whose peculiar genius lay in computation of a young mr caldwell who during the four years since he had left harvard had been learning the textile industry of miss ottway and janet miss ottway was the agents private stenographer a strongly built capable woman with immense reserves seemingly inexhaustible she had a deep masculine voice not unmusical the hint of a masculine moustache a masculine manner of taking to any job that came to hand nerves were things unknown to her she was granite janet tempered steel janet was the second stenographer and performed besides any odd tasks that might be assigned  there were in the various offices of the superintendents the paymaster and purchasing agent other young women stenographers whose companionship janet had she been differently organized might have found congenial but something in her refused to dissolve to their proffered friendship she had but one friendif eda rawle who worked in a bank and whom she had met at a lunch counter by accident may be called so as has been admirably said in another language one kisses the other offers a cheek janet offered the cheek all unconsciously she sought a relationship rarely to be found in banks and business offices would yield herself to none other the young women stenographers in the chippering mill respectable industrious girls were attracted by a certain indefinable quality but finding they made no progress in their advances presently desisted they were somewhat afraid of her as one of them remarked you always knew she was there miss lottie meyers who worked in the office of mr orcutt the superintendent across the hall experienced a brief infatuation that turned to hate she chewed gum incessantly janet found her cheap perfume insupportable miss meyers for her part declared that janet was queer and stuck up thought herself better than the rest of them lottie meyers was the leader of a group of four or five which gathered in the hallway at the end of the noon hour to enter animatedly into a discussion of waists hats and lingerie to ogle and exchange persiflages with the young men of the paymasters corps to giggle to relate sotto voce certain stories that ended invariably in hysterical laughter janet detested these conversations and the sex question subtly suggested if not openly dealt with to her was a mystery over which she did not dare to ponder terrible yet too sacred to be degraded her feelings concealed under an exterior of selfpossession deceptive to the casual observer sometimes became molten and she was frightened by a passion that made her tremblea passion by no means always consciously identified with men embodying all the fierce unexpressed and unsatisfied desires of her life  these emotions often suggested by some hint of beauty as of the sun glinting on the river on a bright blue day had a sudden way of possessing her and the longing they induced was pain longing for what for some unimagined existence where beauty dwelt and light where the ecstasy induced by these was neither moiled nor degraded where shame as now might not assail her why should she feel her body hot with shame her cheeks afire at such moments she would turn to the typewriter her fingers striking the keys with amazing rapidity with extraordinary accuracy and forceforce vaguely disturbing to mr claude ditmar as he entered the office one morning and involuntarily paused to watch her she was unaware of his gaze but her colour was like a crimson signal that flashed to him and was gone why had he never noticed her before all these months for more than a year perhapsshe had been in his office and he had not so much as looked at her twice the unguessed answer was that he had never surprised her in a vivid moment he had a flair for women though he had never encountered any possessing the higher values and it was characteristic of the plane of his mental processes that this one should remind him now of a dark lithe panther tensely strung capable of fierceness the pain of having her scratch him would be delectable  when he measured her it was to discover that she was not so little and the shouldercurve of her uplifted arms as her fingers played over the keys seemed to belie that apparent slimness and had he not been unacquainted with the subtleties of the french mind and language he might have classed her as a fausse maigre her head was small her hair like a dark blurred shadow clinging round it he wanted to examine her hair to see whether it would not betray at closer range an imperceptible wavebut not daring to linger he went into his office closed the door and sat down with a sensation akin to weakness somewhat appalled by his discovery considerably amazed at his previous stupidity he had thought of janetwhen she had entered his mind at allas unobtrusive demure now he recognized this demureness as repression her qualities needed illumination and he claude ditmar had seen them struck with fire he wondered whether any other man had been as fortunate  later in the morning quite casually he made inquiries of miss ottway who liked janet and was willing to do her a good turn  why shes a clever girl mr ditmar a good stenographer and conscientious in her work shes very quick too  yes ive noticed that ditmar replied who was quite willing to have it thought that his inquiry was concerned with janets aptitude for business  she keeps to herself and minds her own affairs you can see she comes of good stock miss ottway herself was proud of her new england blood her father you know is the gatekeeper down there hes been unfortunate  you dont sayi didnt connect her with him fine looking old man a friend of mine who recommended him told me hed seen better days     chapter ii  in spite of the surprising discovery in his office of a young woman of such a disquieting galvanic quality it must not be supposed that mr claude ditmar intended to infringe upon a fixed principle he had principles for him as for the patriarchs and householders of israel the seventh commandment was only relative yet hitherto he had held rigidly to that relativity laying down the sound doctrine that women and business would not mix or as he put it to his intimates no sensible man would fool with a girl in his office hence it may be implied that mr ditmars experiences with the opposite sex had been on a property basis he was one of those busy and successful persons who had never appreciated or acquired the art of quasiplatonic amenities whose idea of a good time was limited to discreet excursions with cronies likewise busy and successful persons who by reason of having married early and unwisely are strangers to the delights of that higher social intercourse chronicled in novels and the public prints if one may conveniently overlook the joys of a companionship of the soul it is quite as possible to have a taste in women as in champagne or cigars mr ditmar preferred blondes and he liked them rather stout a predilection that had led him into matrimony with a lady of this description a somewhat sticky candyeating lady with a mania for card parties who undoubtedly would have dyed her hair if she had lived he was not inconsolable but he had had enough of marriage to learn that it demands a somewhat exorbitant price for joys otherwise more reasonably to be obtained  he was left a widower with two children a girl of thirteen and a boy of twelve both somewhat large for their ages amy attended the only private institution for the instruction of her sex of which hampton could boast george continued at a public school the late mrs ditmar for some years before her demise had begun to give evidence of certain restless aspirations to which american ladies of her type and situation seem peculiarly liable and with a view to their ultimate realization she had inaugurated a jericholike campaign death had released ditmar from its increasing pressure for his wife had possessed that admirable substitute for character persistence had been expert in the use of importunity often an efficient weapon in the hands of the female economically dependent the daughter of a defunct cashier of the hampton national bank when she had married ditmar then one of the superintendents of the chippering and already a marked man she had deemed herself fortunate among women looking forward to a life of ease and idleness and candy in great abundancea dream temporarily shattered by the unforeseen discomfort of bringing two children into the world with an interval of scarcely a year between them her parents from an excess of native modesty having failed to enlighten her on this subject her feelings were those of outraged astonishment and she was quite determined not to repeat the experience a third time knowledge thus belatedly acquired for a while she abandoned herself to the satisfaction afforded by the ability to take a commanding position in hampton society gradually to become aware of the need of a more commodious residence in a certain kind of intuition she was rich her husband had meanwhile become agent of the chippering mill and she strongly suspected that his prudent reticence on the state of his finances was the best indication of an increasing prosperity he had indeed made money been given many opportunities for profitable investments but the argument for social preeminence did not appeal to him tears and reproaches recriminations when frequently applied succeeded better like many married men what he most desired was to be let alone but in some unaccountable way she had come to suspect that his preference for blondes was of a more liberal nature than at first in her innocence she had realized she was jealous too of his cronies in spite of the fact that these gentlemen when they met her treated her with an elaborate politeness and she accused him with entire justice of being more intimate with them than with her with whom he was united in holy bonds the inevitable result of these tactics was the modern mansion in the upper part of warren street known as the residential district built on a wide lot with a garage on one side to the rear with a cement driveway divided into squares and a wall of democratic height separating its lawn from the sidewalk the house may for the present be better imagined than described  a pious chronicler of a more orthodox age would doubtless have deemed it a judgment that cora ditmar survived but two years to enjoy the glories of the warren street house for a while her husband indulged in a foolish optimism only to learn that the habit of matrimonial blackmail once acquired is not easily shed scarcely had he settled down to the belief that by the gratification of her supreme desire he had achieved comparative peace than he began to suspect her native selfconfidence of cherishing visions of a career contemplating nothing less than the eventual abandonment of hampton itself as a field too limited for her social talents and his business ability and bank accountat which she was pleased to hint hampton suited ditmar his passion was the chippering mill and he was in process of steeling himself to resist whatever the costs this preposterous plan when he was mercifully released by death her intention of sending the children away to acquire a culture and finish hampton did not affordgeorge to silliston academy amy to a fashionable boarding schoolhe had not opposed yet he did not take the idea with sufficient seriousness to carry it out the children remained at home more or lessincreasingly lessin the charge of an elderly woman who acted as housekeeper  ditmar had miraculously regained his freedom and now when he made trips to new york and boston combining business with pleasure there were no questions asked no troublesome fictions to be composed more frequently he was in boston where he belonged to a large and comfortable club not too exacting in regard to membership and here he met his cronies and sometimes planned excursions with them automobile trips in summer to the white mountains or choice little resorts to spend sundays and holidays generally taking with them a case of champagne and several bags of golf sticks he was fond of shooting and belonged to a duck club on the cape where poker and bridge were not tabooed to his intimates he was known as dit nor is it surprising that his attitude toward women had become in general one of resentment matrimony he now regarded as unmitigated folly at five and forty he was a vital dominating dustcoloured man six feet and half an inch in height weighing a hundred and ninety pounds and thus a trifle fleshy when relaxed and in congenial company he looked rather boyish an aspect characteristic of many american business men of today  his head was large he wore his hair short his features also proclaimed him as belonging to a modern american type in that they were not clearcut but rather indefinable a bristling shortcropped moustache gave him a certain efficient military look which when introduced to strangers as colonel was apt to deceive them into thinking him an army officer the title he had once received as a member of the staff of the governor of the state and was a tribute to a gregariousness and political influence rather than to a genius for the art of war ex officio as the agent of the chippering mill and a man of substance to boot he was in politics hail fellow well met with and an individual to be taken into account by politicians from the governor and member of congress down he was efficient of course he had efficient hands and shrewd efficient eyes and the military impression was deepened by his manner of dealing with people his conversation being yea yea and nay naysave with his cronies and those of the other sex from whom he had something to gain his clothes always looked new of pronounced patterns and light colours set aside for him by an obsequious tailor in boston  if a human being in such an enviable position as that of agent of the chippering mill can be regarded as property it might be said that mr claude ditmar belonged to the chipperings of boston a family still owning a controlling interest in the company his loyalty to them and to the mill he so ably conducted was the great loyalty of his life for ditmar a chippering could do no wrong it had been the keen eye of mr stephen chippering that first had marked him questioned him recognized his ability and from the moment of that encounter his advance had been rapid when old stephen had been called to his fathers ditmars allegiance was automatically as it were transferred to the two sons george and worthington already members of the board of directors sometimes ditmar called on them at their homes which stood overlooking the waters of the charles river basin the attitude toward him of the chipperings and their wives was one of an interesting adjustment of feudalism to democracy they were fond of him grateful to him treating him with a frank camaraderie that had in it not the slightest touch of condescension but ditmar would have been the first to recognize that there were limits to the intimacy they did not for instanceno doubt out of considerationinvite him to their dinner parties or take him to their club which was not the same as that to which he himself belonged he felt no animus nor would he surprising though it may seem have changed places with the chipperings at an early age and quite unconsciously he had accepted property as the ruling power of the universe and when family was added thereto the combination was nothing less than divine  there were times especially during the long winters when life became almost unbearable for janet and she was seized by a desire to run away from fillmore street from the mills from hampton itself only she did not know where to go or how to get away she was convinced of the existence in the world of delightful spots where might be found congenial people with whom it would be a joy to talk fillmore street certainly did not contain any such the office was not so bad it is true that in the mornings as she entered west street the sight of the dark facade of the fortresslike structure emblematic of the captivity in which she passed her days rarely failed to arouse in her sensations of oppression and revolt but here at least she discovered an outlet for her energies she was often too busy to reflect and at odd moments she could find a certain solace and companionship in the river so intent so purposeful so beautiful so undisturbed by the inconcinnity the clatter and confusion of hampton as it flowed serenely under the bridges and between the mills toward the sea toward the sea  it was when at night she went back to fillmore streetwhen she thought of the monotony yes and the sordidness of home when she let herself in at the door and climbed the dark and narrow stairway that her feet grew leaden in spite of the fact that hannah was a good housekeeper and prided herself on cleanliness the tiny flat reeked with the smell of cooking and janet from the upper hall had a glimpse of a thin angular woman with a scrawny neck with scant grey hair tightly drawn into a knot in a gingham apron covering an old dress bending over the kitchen stove and occasionally despite a resentment that fate should have dealt thus inconsiderately with the family janet felt pity welling within her after supper when lise had departed with her best young man hannah would occasionally though grudgingly permit janet to help her with the dishes  you work all day you have a right to rest  but i dont want to rest janet would declare and rub the dishes the harder with the spirit underlying this protest hannah sympathized mother and daughter were alike in that both were inarticulate but janet had a secret contempt for hannahs uncomplaining stoicism she loved her mother in a way especially at certain timesthough she often wondered why she was unable to realize more fully the filial affection of tradition but in moments of softening such as these she was filled with rage at the thought of any woman endowed with energy permitting herself to be overtaken and overwhelmed by such a fate as hannahs divorce desertion anything she thought would have been betteranything but to be cheated out of life feeling the fires of rebellion burning hotly within herrebellion against environment and driving necessity she would glance at her mother and ask herself whether it were possible that hannah had ever known longings had ever been wrung by inexpressible desiresdesires in which the undiscovered spiritual was so alarmingly compounded with the undiscovered physical she would have died rather than speak to hannah of these unfulfilled experiences and the mere thought of confiding them to any person appalled her even if there existed some wonderful understanding being to whom she might be able thus to empty her soul the thought of the ecstasy of that kenosis was too troubling to be dwelt upon  she had tried reading with unfortunate resultsperhaps because no virgil had as yet appeared to guide her through the mysteries of that realm her schooling had failed to instil into her a discriminating taste for literature and when on occasions she had entered the public library opposite the common it had been to stare hopelessly at rows of books whose authors and titles offered no clue to their contents her few choices had not been happy they had failed to interest and thrill  of the bumpus family lise alone found refuge distraction and excitement in the vulgar modern world by which they were surrounded and of whose heedlessness and remorselessness they were the victims lise went out into it became a part of it returning only to sleep and eata tendency hannah found unaccountable and against which even her stoicism was not wholly proof scarce an evening went by without an expression of uneasiness from hannah  she didnt happen to mention where she was going did she janet hannah would query when she had finished her work and put on her spectacles to read the banner  to the movies i suppose janet would reply although well aware that her sister indulged in other distractions she thought it useless to add to hannahs disquietude and if she had little patience with lise she had less with the helpless attitude of her parents  well hannah would add i never can get used to her going out nights the way she does and with young men and women i dont know anything about i wasnt brought up that way but as long as shes got to work for a living i guess theres no help for it  and she would glance at edward it was obviously due to his inability adequately to cope with modern conditions that his daughters were forced to toil but this was the nearest she ever came to reproaching him if he heard he acquiesced humbly and in silence more often than not he was oblivious buried in the mazes of the bumpus family history his papers spread out on the red cloth of the diningroom table under the lamp sometimes in his simplicity and with the enthusiasm that demands listeners he would read aloud to them a letter recently received from a distant kinsman an alpheus bumpus let us say who had migrated to california in search of wealth and fame and who had found neither in spite of age and misfortunes the liberal attitude of these western members of the family was always a matter of perplexity to edward  he tells me theyre going to give women the ballotdoesnt appear to be much concerned about his own womenfolks going to the polls  why shouldnt they if they want to janet would exclaim though she had given little thought to the question  edward would mildly ignore this challenge  he has a house on what they call russian hill and he can watch the vessels as they come in from japan he would continue in his precise voice emphasizing admirably the last syllables of the words russian vessels and japan wouldnt you like to see the letter  to do hannah justice although she was quite incapable of sharing his passion she frequently feigned an interest took the letter presently handing it on to janet who in deciphering alpheuss trembling calligraphy pondered over his manifold woes alpheuss son who had had a good position in a sporting goods establishment on market street was sick and in danger of losing it the sons wife expecting an addition to the family the house on russian hill mortgaged alpheus a veteran of the civil war had been for many years preparing his reminiscences but the newspapers nowadays seemed to care nothing for matters of solid worth and so far had refused to publish them janet as she read reflected that these letters invariably had to relate tales of failures of disappointed hopes she wondered at her fathers perennial interest in failuresprovided they were those of his family and the next evening as he wrote painfully on his ruled paper she knew that he in turn was pouring out his soul to alpheus recounting with an emotion by no means unpleasurable to this sympathetic but remote relative the story of his own failure  if the city of hampton was emblematic of our modern world in which haphazardness has replaced order fillmore street may be likened to a back eddy of the muddy and troubled waters in which all sorts of flotsam and jetsam had collected or to find perhaps an even more striking illustration of the process that made hampton in general and fillmore street in particular one had only to take the trolley to glendale the italian settlement on the road leading to the old new england village of shrewsbury janet sometimes walked there alone or with her friend eda rawle disintegration itselfin a paradoxically pathetic attempt at reconstructionhad built glendale human hands italian hands nor surprising though it may seem were these descendants of the people of the renaissance in the least offended by their handiwork when the southern european migration had begun and real estate became valuable one by one the more decorous edifices of the old american order had been torn down and carried piecemeal by sons of italy to the bare hills of glendale there to enter into new combinations representing to an eye craving harmony the last word of a chaos of a mental indigestion of a colour scheme crying aloud to heaven for retribution standing alone and bare amidst its truck gardens hideous extreme though typical of the entire settlement composed of fragments ripped from onceappropriate settings is a house with a tiny body painted strawberryred with scrollwork shutters a tender green surmounting the structure and almost equalling it in size is a skyblue cupola once the white crown of the sutter mansion the pride of old hampton the walls of this dwelling were wrested from the sides of mackeys tavern while the shutters for many years adorned the parsonage of the old first church similarly in hampton and in fillmore street lived in enforced neighbourliness human fragments once having their places in crystallized communities where existence had been regarded as solved here there was but one orderif such it may be calledone relationship direct or indirect one necessity claiming them allthe mills  like the boards forming the walls of the shacks at glendale these human planks torn from an earlier social structure were likewise warped which is to say they were dominated by obsessions edwards was the bumpus family and chris auermann who lived in the flat below was convinced that the history of mankind is a deplorable record of havoc caused by women perhaps he was right but the conviction was none the less an obsession he came from a little village near wittenburg that has scarcely changed since luthers time like most residents of hampton who did not work in the mills he ministered to those who did or to those who sold merchandise to the workers cutting their hair in his barber shop on faber street  the bumpuses save lise clinging to a native individualism and pride preferred isolation to companionship with the other pieces of driftwood by which they were surrounded and with which the summer season compelled a certain enforced contact when the heat in the little diningroom grew unbearable they were driven to take refuge on the front steps shared in common with the household of the barber it is true that the barbers wife was a mild hausfrau who had little to say and that their lodgers two young germans who worked in the mills spent most of their evenings at a bowling club but auermann himself exhaling a strong odour of bay rum would arrive promptly at quarter past eight take off his coat and thus as it were stripped for action would turn upon the defenceless edward  vill you mention one great manyoost onewho is not greater if the vimmen leave him alone he would demand is it anthony the conqueror of egypt and the east i vill show you cleopatra und burns and napoleon the greatest man what ever livedvimmen again i tell you there is no elba no st helena if it is not for the vimmen und vat vill you say of goethe  poor edward could think of nothing to say of goethe  he is great i grant you chris would admit but vat is he if the vimmen leave him alone divine yoost that and he would proceed to cite endless examples of generals and statesmen whose wives or mistresses had been their bane futile edwards attempts to shift the conversation to the subject of his own obsession the german was by far the more aggressive he would have none of it perhaps if edward had been willing to concede that the bumpuses had been brought to their present lowly estate by the sinister agency of the fair sex chris might conditionally have accepted the theme hannah contemptuously waving a tattered palm leaf fan was silent but on one occasion janet took away the barbers breath by suddenly observingyou never seem to think of the women whose lives are ruined by men mr auermann  it was unheardof this invasion of a mans argument by a woman and by a young woman at that he glared at her through his spectacles took them off wiped them replaced them and glared at her again he did not like janet she was capable of what may be called a speaking silence and he had never been wholly unaware of her disapproval and ridicule perhaps he recognized in her instinctively the potential qualities of that emerging modern woman who to him was anathema  it is somethings i dont think about he said  he was a wizened little man with faienceblue eyes and sat habitually hunched up with his hands folded across his shins  nam fuit ante helenamas darwin quotes toward all the masculine residents of fillmore street save one the barbers attitude was one of unconcealed scorn for an inability to recognize female perfidy with johnny tiernan alone he refused to enter the lists when the popular proprietor of the tin shop came sauntering along the sidewalk with nose uptilted waving genial greetings to the various groups on the steps chris auermanns expression would suddenly change to one of fatuous playfulness  whats this i hear about giving the girls the vote chris johnny would innocently inquire winking at janet invariably running his hand through the wiry red hair that resumed its corkscrew twist as soon as he released it and chris would as invariably replyyou have the dandruffsyes you come to my shop i give you somethings  sometimes the barber in search of a more aggressive adversary than edward would pay visits when as likely as not another neighbour with profound convictions and a craving for proselytes would swoop down on the defenceless bumpuses joe shivers for instance who lived in one of the tenements above the cleaning and dyeing establishment kept by the pappas bros and known as the gentleman in the daytime mr shivers was a model of acquiescence in a system he would have designated as one of industrial feudalism his duty being to examine the rolls of cloth as they came from the looms of the arundel mill in case of imperfections handing them over to the women menders at night to borrow a vivid expression from lise he was batty in the belfry on the subject of socialism unlike the barber whom he could not abide for him the cleavage of the world was between labour and capital instead of man and woman his philosophy was stern and naturalistic the universethe origin of which he did not discussjust an accidental assemblage of capricious forces over which human intelligence was one day to triumph squatting on the lowest step his face upturned by the light of the arc sputtering above the street he looked like a yellow frog his eager eyes directed toward janet whom he suspected of intelligence  if there was a god a nice kind allpowerful god would he permit what happened in one of the loomrooms last week a polak girl gets her hair caught in the belt pfff he had a marvellously realistic gift when it came to horrors janet felt her hair coming out by the roots although she never went to church she did not like to think that no god existed of this mr shivers was very positive edward too listened uneasily hemmed and hawed making ineffectual attempts to combat mr shiverss socialism with a deeplyrooted native individualism that shivers declared as defunct as christianity  if it is possible for the workingman to rise under a capitalistic system why do you not rise then why do i not rise im as good as ditmar im better educated but were all slaves what right has a man to make you and me work for him just because he has capital  why the right of capital edward would reply  mr shivers with the manner of one dealing with an incurable romanticism and sentimentality would lift his hands in despair and in spite of the fact that janet detested him he sometimes exercised over her a paradoxical fascination suggesting as he did unexplored intellectual realms she despised her father for not being able to crush the little man edward would make pathetic attempts to capture the role shivers had appropriated to be the practical party himself to convict shivers of idealism socialism scandalized him outraged even more than atheism something within him he held sacred and he was greatly annoyed because he was unable adequately to express this feeling  you cant change human nature mr shivers edward would insist in his precise but ineffectual manner we all want property you would accept a fortune if it was offered to you and so should i americans will never become socialists  but look at me wasnt i born in meriden connecticut aint that yankee enough for you thus mr shivers sought blandly to confound him  a yankee shades of the pilgrim fathers of seven generations of bumpuses a yankee who used his hands in that way a yankee with a nose like that a yankee with a bald swathe down the middle of his crown and bunches of black motheaten hair on either side but edward too polite to descend to personalities was silent  in brief this very politeness of edwards which his ancestors would have scorned this consideration and lack of selfassertion made him the favourite prey of the many characters in fillmore street whose sanity had been disturbed by pressure from above in whose systems had lodged the germs of those exotic social doctrines floating so freely in the air of our modern industrial communities chester glenn remains for a passing mention a yankee of yankees this born on a new hampshire farm and to the ordinary traveller on the wigmore branch of the railroad just a goodnatured roundfaced tobaccochewing brakeman who would take a seat beside ladies of his acquaintance aid make himself agreeable until it was time to rise and bawl out in the approved manner of his profession the name of the next station fillmore street knew that the flat visored cap which his corporation compelled him to wear covered a brain into which had penetrated the maggot of the single tax when he encountered mr shivers or auermann the talk became coruscating  eda rawle janets solitary friend of these days must also be mentioned though the friendship was merely an episode in janets life their first meeting was at gradys quicklunch counter in faber street which they both frequented at one time and the fact that each had ordered a ham sandwich a cup of coffee and a confectionnew to gradysknown as a napoleon had led to conversation  eda of course was the aggressor she was irresistibly drawn she would not be repulsed a stenographer in the wessex national bank she boarded with a welsh family in spruce street matteroffact plodding commonplace resemblingas janet thoughta horse possessing indeed many of the noble qualities of that animal she might have been thought the last person in the world to discern and appreciate in janet the hidden elements of a mysterious fire in appearance miss rawle was of a type not infrequent in anglosaxon lands strikingly blonde with high malar bones white eyelashes and eyes of a metallic blue cheeks of an amazing elasticity that worked rather painfully as she talked or smiled drawing back inadequate lips revealing long white teeth and vivid gums it was the craving in her for romance janet assuaged edas was the love content to pour out that demands little she was capable of immolation janet was by no means ungrateful for the warmth of such affection though in moments conscious of a certain perplexity and sadness because she was able to give such a meagre return for the wealth of its offering  in other moments when the world seemed all disorder and chaosas mr shivers described itor when she felt within her like demons those inexpressible longings and desires leaping and straining pulling her almost irresistibly she knew not whither eda shone forth like a light in the darkness like the beacon of a refuge and a shelter eda had faith in her even when janet had lost faith in herself she went to eda in the same spirit that marguerite went to church though she janet more resembled faust beingsave in these hours of lowered vitalityof the forthfaring kind unable to confess the need that drove her she arrived in edas little bedroom to be taken into edas arms janet was immeasurably the stronger of the two but eda possessed the masculine trait of protectiveness the universe never bothered her she was one of those personscalled fortunateto whom the orthodox christian virtues come as naturally as sun or air passion when sanctified by matrimony was her ideal and now it was always in terms of janet she dreamed of it having read about it in volumes her friend would not touch and never having experienced deeply its discomforts sanctified or unsanctified janet regarded it with terror and whenever eda innocently broached the subject she recoiled once eda exclaimedwhen you do fall in love janet you must tell me all about it every word  janet blushed hotly and was silent in edas mind such an affair was a kind of glorified fireworks ending in a cluster of stars in janets a volcanic eruption to turn the world red such was the difference between them  their dissipations together consisted of sundaes at a drugstore or sometimes of movie shows at the star or the alhambra stereotyped on edas face during the legitimately tender passages of these dramas was an expression of rapture a smile made peculiarly infatuate by that vertical line in her cheeks that inadequacy of lip and preponderance of white teeth and red gums it irritated almost infuriated janet to whom it appeared as the logical reflection of what was passing on the screen she averted her glance from both staring into her lap filled with shame that the relation between the sexes should be thus exposed to public gaze parodied sentimentalized degraded there were however marvels to stir her strange landscapes cities seas and shipsonce a fire in the forest of a western reserve with gigantic tongues of orange flame leaping from tree to tree the movies brought the world to hampton the great world into which she longed to fare brought the world to her remote mountain hamlets from japan minarets and muezzins from the orient pyramids from egypt domes from moscow resembling gilded beets turned upside down grey houses of parliament by the thames the tower of london the palaces of potsdam the tai mahal strange lands indeed and stranger peoples booted russians in blouses naked equatorial savages tattooed and amazingly adorned soldiers and sailors presidents princes and emperors brought into such startling proximity one could easily imagine ones self exchanging the time of day incredible to janet how the audiences how even eda accepted with american complacency what were to her neverending miracles the yearning to see more to know more became acute like a pain but even as she sought to devour these scenes to drink in every detail with tantalizing swiftness they were whisked away they were peepholes in the walls of her prison and at night she often charmed herself to sleep with remembered visions of wide empty treeshaded terraces reserved for kings  but eda however complacent her interest in the scenes themselves was thrilled to the marrow by their effect on janet who was her medium emerging from the vestibule of the theatre janet seemed not to see the slushy street her eyes shone with a silver light like that of a mountain lake in a stormy sunset and they walked in silence until janet would exclaim  oh eda wouldnt you love to travel  thus eda rawle was brought in contact with values she herself was powerless to detect and which did not become values until they had passed through janet one educative reel they had seen had begun with scenes in a lumber camp high in the mountains of galicia where grow forests of the priceless pine that becomes after years of drying and seasoning the sounding board of the stradivarius and the harp even then it must respond to a player eda though failing to apply this poetic parallel when alone in her little room in the welsh boardinghouse often indulged in an ecstasy of speculation as to that man hidden in the mists of the future whose destiny it would be to awaken her friend hampton did not contain himof this she was sure and in her efforts to visualize him she had recourse to the movies seeking him amongst that brilliant company of personages who stood so haughtily or walked so indifferently across the ephemeral brightness of the screen  by virtue of these marvels of the movies hampton ugly and sordid hamptonactually began for janet to take on a romantic tinge were not the strange peoples of the earth flocking to hampton she saw them arriving at the station straight from ellis island bewildered ticketed like dumb animals the women draped in the soft exotic colours many of them were presently to exchange for the cheap and gaudy apparel of faber street she sought to summon up in her mind the glimpses she had had of the wonderful lands from which they had come to imagine their lives in that earlier environment sometimes she wandered alone or with eda through the various quarters of the city each quarter had a flavour of its own a synthetic flavour belonging neither to the old nor to the new yet partaking of both a difference in atmosphere to which janet was keenly sensitive in the german quarter to the north one felt a sort of ornamental bleaknessif the expression may be permitted the tenements here were clean and not too crowded the scrollwork on their superimposed porches like that decorating the turnverein and the stem lutheran church was eloquent of a teutonic inheritance the belgians were to the west beyond the baseball park and the car barns their grey houses scattered among new streets beside the scarred and frowning face of torreys hill almost under the hill itself which threatened to roll down on it and facing a bottomless muddy street was the quaint little building giving the note of foreign thrift of socialism and shrewdness of joie de vivre to the settlement the francobelgian cooperative store with its salle de reunion above and a stage for amateur theatricals standing in the mud outside janet would gaze through the tiny windows in the stucco wall at the baskets prepared for each household laid in neat rows beside the counter at the old man with the watery blue eyes and lacing of red in his withered cheeks who spoke no english whose duty it was to distribute the baskets to the women and children as they called  turning eastward again one came to dey street in the heart of hampton where hibernian hall stood alone and grim sole testimony of the departed hibernian glories of a district where the present irish rulers of the city had once lived and gossiped and fought in the days when the mill bells had roused the boardinghouse keepers at half past four of a winter morning beside the hall was a corner lot heaped high with hills of ashes and rubbish like the vomitings of some filthy volcano the unsightliness of which was half concealed by huge signs announcing the merits of chewing gums tobaccos and cereals but why had the departure of the irish the coming of the syrians made dey street dark narrow mysterious oriental changed the very aspect of its architecture was it the coffeehouses one of these in front of which janet liked to linger was set weirdly into an old new england cottage and had apparently fathomless depths in summer the whole front of it lay open to the street and here all day long beside the table where the charcoal squares were set to dry could be seen saffroncoloured armenians absorbed in a turkish game played on a backgammon board their gentleness and that of the loiterers looking on in strange contrast with their hawklike profiles and burning eyes behind this group in the half light of the middle interior could be discerned an american sodawater fountain of a bygone fashion on its marble counter oddly shaped bottles containing rose and violet syrups there was a bottleshaped stove and on the walls in gilt frames pictures evidently dating from the period in american art that flourished when franklin pierce was president and there was an array of marble topped tables extending far back into the shadows behind the fountain was a sort of cupboardsuggestive of the arabian nights which janet had never readfrom which occasionally the fat proprietor emerged bearing turkish coffee or long turkish pipes  when not thus occupied the proprietor carried a baby the street swarmed with babies and mothers nursed them on the doorsteps and in this teeming prolific street one could scarcely move without stepping on a fat almond eyed child though some indeed were wheeled wheeled in all sorts of queer contrivances by one another by fathers with ragged black moustaches and eagle noses who to the despair of mill superintendents had decided in the morning that three days wages would since to support their families for the week in the midst of the throng might be seen occasionally the stout and comfortable and not too immaculate figure of a shovel bearded syrian priest in a frock coat and squaretopped derby hat sailing along serenely heedless of the children who scattered out of his path  nearby was the quarter of the canadian french scarcely now to be called foreigners though still somewhat reminiscent of the cramped little towns in the northern wilderness of water and forest on one corner stood almost invariably a pharmacie francaise the signs were in french and the elders spoke the patois these despite the mill pallor retained in their faces in their eyes a suggestion of the outdoor look of their ancestors the coureurs des bois but the children spoke english and the young men as they played baseball in the street or in the corner lots might be heard shouting out derisively the cry of the section hands so familiar in mill cities doff you beggars you doff  occasionally the two girls strayed into that wide thoroughfare not far from the canal known by the classic name of hawthorne which the italians had appropriated to themselves this street too in spite of the telegraph poles flaunting crude arms in front of its windows in spite of the trolley running down its middle had acquired a character a unity all its own a warmth and picturesqueness that in the lingering light of summer evenings assumed an indefinable significance it was not italy but it was somethingsomething proclaimed in the ornate leaning lines of the pillared balconies of the yellow tenement on the second block in the stonevaulted entrance of the low house next door in fantastically coloured walls in curtained windows out of which leaned swarthy earringed women blocking the end of the street in stern contrast was the huge clarendon mill with its sinister brick pillars running up the six stories between the glass here likewise the sidewalks overflowed with children largeheaded with great lustrous eyes mute appealing the eyes of cattle unlike american children they never seemed to be playing among the groups of elders gathered for gossip were piratical calabrians in sombre clothes descended from greek ancestors once the terrors of the adriatic sea the women lingering in the doorways hemmed in by more children were for the most part squat and plump but once in a while janets glance was caught and held by a strange sharp beauty worthy of a cameo  opposite the clarendon mill on the corner of east street was a provision store with stands of fruit and vegetables encroaching on the pavement janets eye was attracted by a box of olives  oh eda she cried do you remember we saw them being pickedin the movies all those old trees on the side of a hill  why thats so said eda you never would have thought anythingd grow on those trees  the young italian who kept the store gave them a friendly grin  you lika the olives he asked putting some of the shining black fruit into their hands eda bit one dubiously with her long white teeth and giggled  dont they taste funny she exclaimed  goodvery good he asserted gravely and it was to janet he turned as though recognizing a discrimination not to be found in her companion she nodded affirmatively the strange taste of the fruit enhanced her sense of adventure she tried to imagine herself among the gatherers in the grove she glanced at the young man to perceive that he was tall and well formed with remarkably expressive eyes almost the colour of the olives themselves it surprised her that she liked him though he was an italian and a foreigner a certain debonnair dignity in him appealed to hera quality lacking in many of her own countrymen  and she wanted to talk to him about italyonly she did not know how to beginwhen a customer appeared an italian woman who conversed with him in soft liquid tones that moved her  sometimes on these walksespecially if the day were grey and sombrejanets sense of romance and adventure deepened became more poignant charged with presage these feelings vague and unaccountable she was utterly unable to confide to eda yet the very fear they inspired was fascinating a fear and a hope that some day in all this babel of peoples something would happen it was as though the conflicting soul of the city and her own soul were one     chapter iii  lise was the only member of the bumpus family who did not find uncongenial such distractions and companionships as were offered by the civilization that surrounded them the bagatelle she despised that was slaverybut slavery out of which she might any day be snatched like leila hawtrey by a prince charming who had made a success in life success to lise meant money although what some sentimental sociologists might call a victim of our civilization lise would not have changed it since it produced not only lise herself but also those fabulous financiers with yachts and motors and town and country houses she read about in the supplements of the sunday newspapers it contained her purgatory which she regarded in good conventional fashion as a mere temporary place of detention and likewise the heaven toward which she strained the dwellingplace of light in short her philosophy was that of the modern orthodox american tinged by a somewhat commercialized sunday school tradition of an earlier day and highly approved by the censors of the movies the peculiar kind of abstinence once euphemistically known as virtue particularly if it were combined with beauty never failed of its reward lise in this sense was indeed virtuous and her mirror told her she was beautiful almost anything could happen to such a lady any day she might be carried up into heaven by that modern chariot of fire the motor car driven by a celestial chauffeur  one mans meat being anothers poison lise absorbed from the movies an element by which her sister janet was repelled a popular production known as leila of hawtreys contained her creedhawtreys being a glittering metropolitan restaurant where men of the world are wont to gather and discuss the stock market and leila a beautiful blonde and orphaned waitress upon whom several of the fashionable frequenters had exercised seductive powers in vain they lay in wait for her at the side entrance followed her while one dissipated and desperate person married and said to move in the most exclusive circles sent her an offer of a yearly income in five figures the note being reproduced on the screen and leila pictured reading it in her frigid hallbedroom there are complications she is in debt and the proprietor of hawtreys has threatened to discharge her and in order that the magnitude of the temptation may be most effectively realized the vision appears of leila herself wrapped in furs stepping out of a limousine and into an elevator lifting her to an apartment containing silk curtains a canet bed a french maid and a pomeranian virtue totters but triumphs being reinforced by two more visions the first of these portrays leila prematurely old dragging herself along pavements under the metallic broadway lights accosting gentlemen in evening dress and the second reveals her in the country kneeling beside a dying mothers bed giving her promise to remain true to the christian teachings of her childhood  and virtue is rewarded lavishly as virtue should be in dollars and cents in stocks and bonds in pearls and diamonds popular fancy takes kindly to rough but honest westerners who have begun life in flannel shirts who have struck gold and come to new york with a fortune but despising effeteness such a one tanned by the mountain sun embarrassed in raiment supplied by a fifth avenue tailor takes a table one evening at hawtreys and of course falls desperately in love he means marriage from the first and his faith in leila is great enough to survive what appears to be an almost total eclipse of her virtue through the machinations of the influential villain and lured by the false pretence that one of her girl friends is ill she is enticed into a mysterious house of a sinister elegance and apparently irretrievably compromised the westerner follows forces his way through the portals engages the villain and vanquishes him leila becomes a bride we behold her at the end mistress of one of those magnificent stone mansions with grilled vestibules and negro butlers into whose sacred precincts we are occasionally in the movies somewhat breathlessly ushereda long way from hawtreys restaurant and a hallbedroom a long way too from the bagatelle and fillmore streetbut to lise a way not impossible nor even improbable  this work of art conveying the moral that virtue is an economic asset made a great impression on lise good old testament doctrine set forth in the book of job itself and leila pictured as holding out for a higher price and getting it encouraged lise to hold out also mr wiley in whose company she had seen this play and whose likeness filled the plush and silverplated frame on her bureau remained ironically ignorant of the fact that he had paid out his money to make definite an ambition an ideal hitherto nebulous in the mind of the lady whom he adored nor did lise enlighten him being gifted with a certain inscrutableness as a matter of fact it had never been her intention to accept him but now that she was able concretely to visualize her lochinvar of the future mr wheys lack of qualifications became the more apparent in the first place he had been born in lowell and had never been west of worcester in the second his salary was sixteen dollars a week it is true she had once fancied the scottish terrier style of haircut abruptly ending in the rounded line of the shaven neck but lochinvar had been closecropped mr wiley closecropped would have resembled a convict  mr wiley was in love there could be no doubt about that and if he had not always meant marriage he meant it now having reached a state where no folly seems preposterous the manner of their meeting had had just the adventurous and romantic touch that lise liked one of her favourite amusements in the intervals between steadies being to walk up and down faber street of an evening after supper arm in arm with two or three other young ladies all chewing gum wheeling into store windows and wheeling out again pretending the utmost indifference to melting glances cast in their direction an exciting sport though incomprehensible to masculine intelligence it was a principle with lise to pay no attention to any young man who was not presented those venturing to approach her with the ready formula havent we met before being instantly congealed she was strict as to etiquette but mr wiley it seemed could claim acquaintance with miss schuler one of the ladies to whose arm lises was linked and he had the further advantage of appearing in a large and seductive touring car painted green with an eagle poised above the hood and its name wizard in a handwriting rounded and bold written in nickel across the radiator he greeted miss schuler effusively but his eye was on lise from the first and it was she he took with him in the front seat indifferent to the giggling behind ever since then lise had had a motor at her disposal and on sundays they took long joy rides beyond the borders of the state but it must not be imagined that mr whey was the proprietor of the vehicle nor was he a chauffeurher american pride would not have permitted her to keep company with a chauffeur he was the demonstrator for the wizard something of a wizard himself as lise had to admit when they whizzed over the tarvia of the riverside boulevard at fifty or sixty miles an hour with the miner cut outa favourite diversion of mr wheys who did not feel he was going unless he was accompanied by a noise like that of a mitrailleuse in action lise experiencing a ravishing terror hung on to her hat with one hand and to mr wiley with the other her code permitting this permitting him also occasionally when they found themselves in tenebrous portions of slatterys riverside park to put his arm around her waist and kiss her so much did lises virtue allow and no more the result being that he existed in a tantalizing state of hope and excitement most detrimental to the nerves  he never lost howeverin public at least or before lises familythe fine careless jaunty air of the demonstrator of the freelance for whom seventy miles an hour has no terrors the automobile apparently like the ship sets a stamp upon its votaries no elizabethan buccaneer swooping down on defenceless coasts ever exceeded in audacity mr wileys invasion of quiet fillmore street he would draw up with an earsplitting screaming of brakes in front of the clayyellow house and sometimes the muffler as though unable to repress its approval of the performance would let out a belated pop that never failed to jar the innermost being of auermann who had been shot at or rather shot past by an italian and knew what it was he hated automobiles he hated mr wiley  vat you do he would demand glaring  and mr wiley would laugh insolently  you think i done it do you dutchiehuh  he would saunter past up the stairs and into the bumpus diningroom often before the family had finished their evening meal lise alone made him welcome albeit demurely but mr wiley not having sensibilities was proof against hannahs coldness and janets hostility with unerring instinct he singled out edward as his victim  hows mr bumpus this evening he would genially inquire  edward invariably assured mr wiley that he was well invariably took a drink of coffee to emphasize the fact as though the act of lifting his cup had in it some magic to ward off the contempt of his wife and elder daughter  well ive got it pretty straight that the arundels going to run nights starting next week lises suitor would continue  and to save his soul edward could not refrain from answering you dont say so he feigned interest in the information that the hampton ball team owing to an unsatisfactory season was to change managers next year mr wiley possessed the gift of gathering recondite bits of news he had confidence in his topics and in his manner of dealing with them and edward pretending to be entertained went so far in his politeness as to ask mr wiley if he had had supper  i dont care if i sample one of mis bumpuss doughnuts mr wiley would reply politely reaching out a large hand that gave evidence in spite of sapolio of an intimacy with grease cups and splash pans i guess theres nobody in this burg can make doughnuts to beat yours miss bumpus  if she had only known which doughnut he would take hannah sometimes thought she might have been capable of putting arsenic in it her icy silence did not detract from the delights of his gestation  occasionally somewhat to edwards alarm hannah demanded where are you taking lise this evening  mr wileys wisdom led him to be vague  oh just for a little spin up the boulevard maybe well pick up ella schuler and one or two other young ladies  hannah and janet knew very well he had no intention of doing this and hannah did not attempt to conceal her incredulity as a matter of fact lise sometimes did insist on a party  i want you should bring her back by ten oclock thats late enough for a girl who works to be out its late enough for any girl  sure mis bumpus wiley would respond easily  hannah chafed because she had no power to enforce this because mr wiley and lise understood she had no power lise went to put on her hat if she skimped her toilet in the morning she made up for it in the evening when she came home from the store and was often late for supper in the meantime while lise was in the bedroom adding these last touches edward would contemptibly continue the conversation fingering the evening banner as it lay in his lap while mr wiley helped himself boldly to another doughnut takingas janet observedelaborate precautions to spill none of the crumbs on a brown suit supposed to be the last creation in male attire behind a plate glass window in faber street belonging to a firm of custom tailors whose stores had invaded every important city in the country and who made clothes for college men only the week before mr wiley had seen this same suit artistically folded combined with a coloured shirt brown socks and tie and torture collarlures for the discriminating owing to certain expenses connected with lise he had been unable to acquire the shirt and the tie but he had bought the suit in the hope and belief that she would find him irresistible therein it pleased him too to be taken for a college man and on beholding in the mirror his broadened shoulders and diminished waist he was quite convinced his money had not been spent in vain that strange young ladiesto whom despite his infatuation for the younger miss bumpus he was not wholly indifferentwould mistake him for an undergraduate of harvardan imposition concerning which he had no scruples but lise though shaken had not capitulated  when she returned to the diningroom arrayed in her own finery demure triumphant and had carried off mr whey there would ensue an interval of silence broken only by the clattering together of the dishes hannah snatched up  i guess hes the kind of soninlaw would suit you she threw over her shoulder once to edward  why he inquired letting down his newspaper nervously  well you seem to favour him to make things as pleasant for him as you can  edward would grow warm with a sense of injustice the inference being that he was to blame for mr wiley if he had been a different kind of father another sort of suitor would be courting lise  i have to be civil he protested he pronounced that word civil exquisitely giving equal value to both syllables  civil hannah scoffed as she left the room and to janet who had followed her into the kitchen she added thats the trouble with your father hes always ben a little too civil edward bumpus is just as simple as a child hes afraid of offending folks feelings think of being polite to that whey in those two words hannah announced eloquently her utter condemnation of the demonstrator of the wizard it was characteristic of her however when she went back for another load of dishes and perceived that edward was only pretending to read his banner to attempt to ease her husbands feelings she thought it queer because she was still fond of edward bumpus after all he had brought on her  its lise she said as though speaking to janet she attracts em sometimes i just cant get used to it that shes my daughter i dont know who she takes after shes not like any of my kin nor any of the bumpuses  what can you do asked edward you cant order him out of the house its better for him to come here and you cant stop lise from going with himshes earning her own money  they had talked over the predicament before and always came to the same impasse in the privacy of the kitchen hannah paused suddenly in her energetic rubbing of a plate and with supreme courage uttered a question  janet do you calculate he means anything wrong  i dont know what he means janet replied unwilling to give mr wiley credit for anything but i know this that lise is too smart to let him take advantage of her  hannah ruminated cleverness as the modern substitute for feminine virtue did not appeal to her but she let it pass she was in no mood to quarrel with any quality that would ward off disgrace  i dont know what to make of liseshe dont appear to have any principles  if the wiley affair lasted longer than those preceding it this was because former suitors had not commanded automobiles when mr wiley lost his automobile he lost his luckif it may be called such one april evening after a stroll with eda janet reached home about nine oclock to find lise already in their room to remark upon the absence of mr wileys picture from the frame  im through with him lise declared briefly tugging at her hair  through with him janet repeated  lise paused in her labours and looked at her sister steadily i handed him the mitdo you get me  but why  why i was sick of himaint that enough and then he got mixed up with a glendale trolley and smashed his radiator and the wizard people sacked him i always told him he was too fly its lucky for him i wasnt in the car  its lucky for you said janet presently she inquired curiously arent you sorry  nix lise shook her head which was now bowed her face hidden by hair didnt i tell you i was sick of him but he sure was some spender she added as though in justice bound to give him his due  janet was shocked by the ruthlessness of it for lise appeared relieved almost gay she handed janet a box containing five peppermint creamsall that remained of mr wileys last gift  one morning in the late spring janet crossed the warren street bridge the upper of the two spiderlike structures to be seen from her office window spanning the river beside the great hampton dam the day dedicated to the memory of heroes fallen in the civil war the thirtieth of may was a legal holiday gradually janet had acquired a dread of holidays as opportunities never realized as intervals that should have been filled with unmitigated joys and yet were invariably wasted usually in walks with eda rawle today feeling an irresistible longing for freedom for beauty for adventure for quest and discovery of she knew not what she avoided eda and after gazing awhile at the sunlight dancing in the white mist below the falls she walked on southward until she had left behind her the last straggling houses of the city and found herself on a wide tarvia road that led ultimately to boston so read the sign  great maples heavy with leaves stood out against the soft blue of the sky and the sunlight poured over everything bathing the stone walls the thatches of the farmhouses extracting from the copses of stunted pine a pungent reviving perfume sometimes she stopped to rest on the pine needles and walked on again aimlessly following the road because it was the easiest way there were spring flowers in the farmhouse yards masses of lilacs whose purple she drank in eagerly the air which had just a tang of new england sharpness was filled with tender sounds the clucking of hens snatches of the songs of birds the rustling of maple leaves in the fitful breeze a chipmunk ran down an elm and stood staring at her with beady inquisitive eyes motionless save for his quivering tail and she put forth her hand shyly beseechingly as though he held the secret of life she craved but he darted away  she looked around her unceasingly at the sky at the trees at the flowers and ferns and fields at the vireos and thrushes the robins and tanagers gashing in and out amidst the foliage and she was filled with a strange yearning to expand and expand until she should become a part of all nature be absorbed into it cease to be herself never before had she known just that feeling that degree of ecstasy mingled with divine discontent occasionally intruding faintly upon the countryside peace she was aware of a distant humming sound that grew louder and louder until there shot roaring past her an automobile filled with noisy folk leaving behind it a suffocating cloud of dust even these intrusions reminders of the city she had left were powerless to destroy her mood and she began to skip like a schoolgirl pausing once in a while to look around her fearfully lest she was observed and it pleased her to think that she had escaped forever that she would never go back she cried aloud as she skipped i wont go back i wont go back keeping time with her feet until she was out of breath and almost intoxicated delirious casting herself down her heart beating wildly on a bank of ferns burying her face in them she had really stopped because a pebble had got into her shoe and as she took it out she looked at her bare heel and remarked ruefullythose twentyfive cent stockings arent worth buying  economic problems however were powerless to worry her today when the sun shone and the wind blew and the ferns washed by the rill running through the culvert under the road gave forth a delicious moist odour reminding her of the flower store where her sister lise had once been employed but at length she arose and after an hour or more of sauntering the farming landscape was left behind the crumbling stone fences were replaced by a wellkept retaining wall capped by a privet hedge through which between stone pillars a driveway entered and mounted the shaded slope turning and twisting until lost to view but afar standing on the distant crest through the tree trunks and foliage janet saw one end of the mansion to which it led and ventured timidly but eagerly in among the trees in the hope of satisfying her newborn curiosity try as she would she never could get any but disappointing and partial glimpses of a house which because of the mystery of its setting fired her imagination started her to wondering why it was that some were permitted to live in the midst of such beauty while she was condemned to spend her days in fillmore street and the prison of the mill she was not even allowed to look at it the thought was like a cloud across the sun  however when she had regained the tarvia road and walked a little way the shadow suddenly passed and she stood surprised the sight of a long common with its ancient trees in the fullness of glory dense maples sturdy oaks strong graceful elms that cast flickering lacy shadows across the road filled her with satisfaction with a sense of peace deepened by the awareness in the background ranged along the common on either side of stately dignified buildings each in an appropriate frame of foliage with the essence rather than the detail of all this her consciousness became steeped she was naturally ignorant of the great good fortune of silliston academy of having been spared with one or two exceptionsdonations during those artistically lean years of the nineteenth century when american architecture affected the gothic the mansard and the subsequent hybrid she knew this must be silliston the seat of that famous academy of which she had heard  the older school buildings and instructors houses most of them white or creamy yellow were native colonial with tall graceful chimneys and classic pillars and delicate balustrades eloquent at once of the racial inheritance of the republic and of a bygone individuality dignity and pride and the modern architect of whose work there was an abundance had graciously and intuitively held this earlier note and developed it he was an american but an american who had been trained the result was harmony life as it should proceed the new growing out of the old and no greater tribute can be paid to janet bumpus than that it pleased her struck and set exquisitely vibrating within her responsive chords for the first time in her adult life she stood in the presence of tradition of a tradition inherently if unconsciously the innermost reality of her being a tradition that miraculously was not dead since after all the years it had begun to put forth these vigorous shoots  what janet chiefly realized was the delicious contented sense of having come visually at least to the home for which she had longed but her humour was that of a child who has strayed to find its true dwelling place in a region of beauty hitherto unexplored and unexperienced tinged therefore with unreality with mysteryan effect enhanced by the chance stillness and emptiness of the place she wandered up and down the common whose vivid green was starred with golden dandelions and then spying the arched and shady vista of a lane entered it bent on new discoveries it led past one of the newer buildings the libraryas she read in a carved inscription over the doorplunged into shade again presently to emerge at a square farmhouse ancient and weathered with a great square chimney thrust out of the very middle of the ridgepolea landmark left by one of the earliest of sillistons settlers presiding over it embracing and protecting it was a splendid tree the place was evidently in process of reconstruction and repair the roof had been newly shingled new frames with oldfashioned tiny panes had been put in the windows a little garden was being laid out under the sheltering branches of the tree and between the lane and the garden half finished was a fence of an original and pleasing design consisting of pillars placed at intervals with upright pickets between the pickets sawed in curves making a line that drooped in the middle janet did not perceive the workman engaged in building this fence until the sound of his hammer attracted her attention his back was bent he was absorbed in his task  are there any stores near here she inquired  he straightened up why yes he replied come to think of it i have seen stores im sure i have  janet laughed his expression his manner of speech were so delightfully whimsical so in keeping with the spirit of her day and he seemed to accept her sudden appearance in the precise makebelieve humour she could have wished and yet she stood a little struck with timidity puzzled by the contradictions he presented of youth and age of shrewdness experience and candour of gentility and manual toil he must have been about thirtyfive he was hatless and his hair uncombed but not unkempt was greying at the temples his eyeswhich she noticed particularlywere keen yet kindly the irises delicately stencilled in a remarkable blue his speech was colloquial yet cultivated his workmans clothes belied his bearing  yes there are stores in the village he went on but isnt it a holiday or sundayperhapsor something of the kind  its decoration day she reminded him with deepening surprise  so it is and all the storekeepers have gone on picnics in their automobiles or else theyre playing golf nobodys working today  but youarent you working she inquired  working he repeated i suppose some people would call it work ii hadnt thought of it in that way  you meanyou like it janet was inspired to say  well yes he confessed i suppose i do  her cheeks dimpled if her wonder had increased her embarrassment had flown and he seemed suddenly an old acquaintance she had however profound doubts now of his being a carpenter  were you thinking of going shopping he asked and at the very ludicrousness of the notion she laughed again she discovered a keen relish for this kind of humour but it was new to her experience and she could not cope with it  only to buy some crackers or a sandwich she replied and blushed  oh he said down in the village on the corner where the cars stop is a restaurant its not as good as the parker house in boston i believe but they do have sandwiches yes and coffee at least they call it coffee  oh thank you she said  youd better wait till you try it he warned her  oh i dont mind i dont want much and she was impelled to add its such a beautiful day  its absurd to get hungry on such a dayabsurd he agreed  yes it is she laughed im not really hungry but i havent time to get back to hampton for dinner suddenly she grew hot at the thought that he might suspect her of hinting you see i live in hampton she went on hurriedly im a stenographer there in the chippering mill and i was just out for a walk andi came farther than i intended she had made it worse  but he said oh you came from hampton with an intonation of surprise of incredulity even that soothed and even amused while it did not deceive her not that the superior intelligence of which she had begun to suspect him had been put to any real test by the discovery of her home and she was quite sure her modest suit of blue serge and her 299 pongee blouse proclaimed her as a working girl of the mill city ive been to hampton he declared just as though it were four thousand miles away instead of four  but ive never been here before to silliston she responded in the same spirit and she added wistfully it must be nice to live in such a beautiful place as this  yes it is nice he agreed we have our troubles toobut its nice  she ventured a second appraising glance his head which he carried a little flung back his voice his easy and confident bearingall these contradicted the saw and the hammer the flannel shirt open at the neck the khaki trousers still bearing the price tag and curiosity beginning to get the better of her she was emboldened to pay a compliment to the fence if one had to work it must be a pleasure to work on things pleasing to the eyesuch was her inference  why im glad you like it he said heartily i was just hoping some one would come along here and admire it nowwhat colour would you paint it  are you a painter too  after a fashion im a sort of man of all worki thought of painting it white with the pillars green  i think that would be pretty she answered judicially after a moments thought what else can you do  he appeared to be pondering his accomplishments  well i can doctor trees he said pointing an efficient finger at the magnificent maple sheltering like a guardian deity the old farmhouse i put in those patches  theyre cement she exclaimed i never heard of putting cement in trees  they dont seem to mind  are the holes very deep  pretty deep  but i should think the tree would be dead  well you see the life of a tree is right under the bark if you can keep the outer covering intact the tree will live  why did you let the holes get so deep  ive just come here the house was like the tree the shingles all rotten but the beams were sound those beams were hewn out of the forest two hundred and fifty years ago  gracious said janet and how old is the tree  i should say about a hundred i suppose it wouldnt care to admit it  how do you know she inquired  oh im very intimate with trees i find out their secrets  its your house she exclaimed somewhat appalled by the discovery  yesyes it is he answered looking around at it and then in an indescribably comical manner down at his clothes his gesture his expression implied that her mistake was a most natural one  excuse me i thought she began blushing hotly yet wanting to laugh again  i dont blame youwhy shouldnt you he interrupted her i havent got used to it yet and there is something amusing aboutmy owning a house when the parlours finished ill have to wear a stiff collar i suppose in order to live up to it  her laughter broke forth and she tried to imagine him in a stiff collar but she was more perplexed than ever she stood balancing on one foot poised for departure  i ought to be going she said as though she had been paying him a formal visit  dont hurry he protested cordially why hurry back to hampton  i never want to go back she cried with a vehemence that caused him to contemplate her anew suddenly revealing the intense passionate quality which had so disturbed mr ditmar she stood transformed i hate it she declared its so ugly i never want to see it again  yes it is ugly he confessed since you admit it i dont mind saying so but its interesting in a way though his humorous moods had delighted her she felt subtly flattered because he had grown more serious  it is interesting she agreed she was almost impelled to tell him why in her excursions to the various quarters she had found hampton interesting but a shyness born of respect for the store of knowledge she divined in him restrained her she was curious to know what this man saw in hampton his opinion would be worth something unlike her neighbours in fillmore street he was not what her sister lise would call nutty he had an air of fine sanity of freedom of detachmentthough the word did not occur to her he betrayed no bitter sense of injustice and his beliefs were uncoloured by the obsession of a single panacea why do you think its interesting she demanded  well im always expecting to hear that its blown up it reminds me of nitroglycerine he added smiling  she repeated the word  an explosive you knowthey put it in dynamite they say a man once made it by accident and locked up his laboratory and ran homeand never went back  i know what you mean she cried her eyes alight with excitement all those foreigners ive felt it that something would happen some day it frightened me and yet i wished that something would happen only i never would have thought ofnitroglycerine  she was unaware of the added interest in his regard but he answered lightly enoughoh not only the foreigners human chemicalsyou cant play with human chemicals any more than you can play with real onesyouve got to know something about chemistry  this remark was beyond her depth  who is playing with them she asked  everybodyno one in particular nobody seems to know much about them yet he replied and seemed disinclined to pursue the subject a robin with a worm in its bill was hopping across the grass he whistled softly the bird stopped cocking its head and regarding them suddenly in conflict with her desire to remain indefinitely talking with this strange man janet felt an intense impulse to leave she could bear the conversation no longer she might burst into tearssuch was the extraordinary effect he had produced on her  i must goim ever so much obliged to you she said  drop in again he said as he took her trembling hand when she had walked a little way she looked back over her shoulder to see him leaning idly against the post gazing after her and waving his hammer in friendly fashion  for a while her feet fairly flew and her heart beat tumultuously keeping time with her racing thoughts she walked about the common seeing nothing paying no attention to the passersby who glanced at her curiously but at length as she grew calmer the needs of a youthful and vigorous body became imperative and realizing suddenly that she was tired and hungry sought and found the little restaurant in the village below she journeyed back to hampton pondering what this man had said to her speculating rather breathlessly whether he had been impelled to conversation by a natural kindness and courtesy or whether he really had discovered something in her worthy of addressing as he implied resentment burned in her breast she became suddenly blinded by tears she might never see him again and if only she were educated she might know him become his friend even in this desire she was not conventional and in the few moments of their contact he had developed rather than transformed what she meant by education she thought of it not as knowledge reeking of books and schools but as the acquirement of the freemasonry which he so evidently possessed existence on terms of understanding confidence and freedom with nature as having the world open up to one like a flower filled with colour and life she thought of the robin of the tree whose secrets he had learned of a mental range including even that medley of human beings amongst whom she lived and the fact that something of his meaning had eluded her grasp made her rebel all the more bitterly against the lack of a greater knowledge  often during the weeks that followed he dwelt in her mind as she sat at her desk and stared out across the river and several times that summer she started to walk to silliston but always she turned back perhaps she feared to break the charm of that memory     chapter iv  our american climate is notoriously capricious even as janet trudged homeward on that memorial day afternoon from her cinderellalike adventure in silliston the sun grew hot the air lost its tonic becoming moist and tepid white clouds with dark edges were piled up in the western sky the automobiles of the holiday makers swarmed ceaselessly over the tarvia valiantly as she strove to cling to her dream remorseless reality was at work dragging her back reclaiming her excitement and physical exercise drained her vitality her feet were sore sadness invaded her as she came in view of the ragged outline of the city she had left so joyfully in the morning summer that most depressing of seasons in an environment of drab houses and grey pavements was at hand listless householders and their families were already seeking refuge on front steps she passed on her way to fillmore street  it was about half past five when she arrived lise her waist removed was seated in a rocking chair at the window overlooking the littered yards and the backs of the tenements on rutger street and lise despite the heaviness of the air was dreaming of such delicate texture was the fabric of janets dreams that not only sordid reality but contact with other dreams of a different nature such as her sisters often sufficed to dissolve them she resented for instance the presence in the plush oval of mr eustace arlington the movie star whose likeness had replaced mr wileys and who had played the part of the western hero in leila of hawtreys with his burning eyes and sensual face betraying the puffiness that comes from overindulgence he was not janets ideal of a hero western or otherwise and now lise was holding a newspaper not the banner whose provinciality she scorned but a popular boston sheet to be had for a cent printed at ten in the morning and labelled three oclock edition with huge red headlines stretched across the top of the page          jury finds in miss nealys favor  as janet entered lise looked up and exclaimedsay that nealy girls won out  who is she janet inquired listlessly  you are from the country all right was her sisters rejoinder i would have bet there wasnt a reub in the state that wasnt wise to the ferris breach of promise case and here you blow in after the shows over and want to know who nelly nealy is if that doesnt beat the band  this woman sued a man named ferrisis that it  a man named ferris lise repeated with the air of being appalled by her sisters ignorance i guess you never heard of ferris eitherthe biggest copper man in boston he could buy hampton and never feel it and they say his house in brighton cost half a million dollars nelly nealy put her damages at one hundred and fifty thousand and stung him for seventy five i wish id been in court when that jury came back theres her picture  to janet especially in the mood of reaction in which she found herself that evening lises intense excitement passionate partisanship and approval of miss nealy were incomprehensible repellent however she took the sheet gazing at the image of the lady who recently an obscure stenographer had suddenly leaped into fame and become a headliner the envied of thousands of working girls all over new england miss nealy in spite of the glare of publicity she deplored had borne up admirably under the strain and evidently had been able to consume three meals a day and give some thought to her costumes her smile under the picture hat was coquettish if not bold the special article signed by a lady reporter whose sympathies were by no means concealed and whose talents were given free rein related how the whitehaired mother had wept tears of joy how miss nealy herself had been awhile too overcome to speak and then had recovered sufficiently to express her gratitude to the twelve gentlemen who had vindicated the honour of american womanhood mr ferris she reiterated was a brute never as long as she lived would she be able to forget how she had loved and believed in him and how when at length she unwillingly became convinces of his perfidy she had been prostrated unable to support her old mother she had not naturally yet decided how she would invest her fortune as for going on the stage that had been suggested but she had made no plans scores of women sympathizers had escorted her to a waiting automobile  janet impelled by the fascination akin to disgust read thus far and flinging the newspaper on the floor began to tidy herself for supper but presently when she heard lise sigh she could contain herself no longer  i dont see how you can read such stuff as that she exclaimed itsits horrible  horrible lise repeated  janet swung round from the washbasin her hands dripping  instead of getting seventy five thousand dollars she ought to be tarred and feathered shes nothing but a blackmailer  lise aroused from her visions demanded vehemently aint he a millionaire  what difference does that make janet retorted and you cant tell me she didnt know what she was up to all alongwith that face  id have sued him all right declared lise defiantly  then youd be a blackmailer too id sooner scrub floors id sooner starve than do such a thingtake money for my affections in the first place id have more pride and in the second place if i really loved a man seventy five thousand or seventy five million dollars wouldnt help me any where do you get such ideas decent people dont have them  janet turned to the basin again and began rubbing her face vigorouslyceasing for an instance to make sure of the identity of a sound reaching her ears despite the splashing of water lise was sobbing janet dried her face and hands arranged her hair and sat down on the windowsill the scorn and anger which had been so intense as completely to possess her melting into a pity and contempt not unmixed with bewilderment ordinarily lise was hard impervious to such reproaches holding her own in the passionate quarrels that occasionally took place between them yet there were times such as this when her resistance broke down unexpectedly and she lost all self control she rocked to and fro in the chair her shoulders bowed her face hidden in her hands janet reached out and touched her  dont be silly she began rather sharply just because i said it was a disgrace to have such ideas well it is  im not silly said lise im sick of that job at the bagatellesobtheres nothing in itim going to quiti wish to god i was dead standing on your feet all day till youre wore out for six dollars a weekwhats there in itsobwith that guy walters who walks the floor never lettin up on you he come up to me yesterday and says i didnt know you was near sighted miss bumpus just because there was a customer annie hatch was too lazy to wait onsobthats his line of dopethinks hes sarcasticand hes sweet on annie tomorrow im going to tell him to go to hell im through im sick of it i tell yousobid rather be dead than slave like that for six dollars  where are you going asked janet  i dont knowi dont care whats the difference any placed be better than this for awhile she continued to cry on a ridiculously high though subdued whining note her breath catching at intervals a feeling of helplessness of utter desolation crept over janet powerless to comfort herself how could she comfort her sister she glanced around the familiar sordid room at the magazine pages against the faded wallpaper at the littered bureau and the littered bed over which lises clothes were flung it was hot and close even now in summer it would be stifling suddenly a flash of sympathy revealed to her a glimpse of the truth that lise too after her own nature sought beauty and freedom never did she come as near comprehending lise as in such moments as this and when on dark winter mornings her sister clung to her terrified by the siren lise was a child and the thought that she janet was powerless to change her was a part of the tragic tenderness what would become of lise and what would become of her janet so she clung desperately to her sisters hand until at last lise roused herself her hair awry her face puckered and wet with tears and perspiration  i cant stand it any moreive just got to go away anywhere she said and the cry found an echo in janets heart  but the next morning lise went back to the bagatelle and janet to the mill  the fact that lises love affairs had not been prospering undoubtedly had something to do with the fit of depression into which she had fallen that evening a month or so before she had acquired another beau it was understood by lises friends and lises family though not by the gentleman himself that his position was only temporary or at most probationary he had not even succeeded to the rights title and privileges of the late mr wiley though occupying a higher position in the social scalebeing the agent of a patent lawn sprinkler with an office in faber street  stick to him and youll wear diamondsthats what he tries to put across was lises comment on mr frears method and thus janet gained the impression that her sisters feelings were not deeply involved if i thought hed make good with the sprinkler i might talk business but say hes one of those ginks thats always tryin to beat the bank hes never done a days work in his life last year he was passing around foleys magazine and before that he was with the race track that went out of business because the ministers got nutty over it well he may win out she added reflectively those guys sometimes do put the game on the blink he sure is a good spender when the orders come in with a line of talk to make you holler for mercy  mr frears line of talk came wholly astonishingly from one side of his mouththe left side as a muscular feat it was a triumph a deaf person on his right side would not have known he was speaking the effect was secretive extraordinarily confidential enabling him to sell sprinklers it ought to have helped him to make love so distinctly personal was it implying as it did that the individual addressed was alone of all the world worthy of consideration among his friends it was regarded as an accomplishment but lise was critical especially since he did not look into ones eyes but gazed off into space as though he werent talking at all  she had once inquired if the right side of his face was paralyzed  she permitted him to take her however to grubers cafe to the movies and one or two select dance halls and to slatterys riverside park where one evening she had encountered the rejected mr wiley  say he was sore she told janet the next morning relating the incident with relish for two cents he would have knocked charlie over the ropes i guess he could do it too all right  janet found it curious that lise should display such vindictiveness toward mr wiley who was more sinned against than sinning she was moved to inquire after his welfare  hes got one of them red motorcycles said lise he was gay with it toowhen we was waiting for the boulevard trolley he opened her up and went right between charlie and me i had to laugh hes got a job over in haverhill you cant hold that guy under water long  apparently lise had no regrets but her premonitions concerning mr frear proved to be justified he did not make good one morning the little office on faber street where the sprinklers were displayed was closed hampton knew him no more and the police alone were sincerely regretful it seemed that of late he had been keeping all the money for the sprinklers and spending a good deal of it on lise at the time she accepted the affair with stoical pessimism as one who has learned what to expect of the world though her moral sense was not profoundly disturbed by the reflection that she had indulged in the delights of slatterys and grubers and a sunday at the beach at the expense of the cascade sprinkler company of boston mr frear inconsiderately neglected to prepare her for his departure the news of which was conveyed to her in a singular manner and by none other than mr johnny tiernan of the tin shoptheir conversation throwing some light not only on lises sophistication but on the admirable and intricate operation of hamptons city government about five oclock lise was coming home along fillmore street after an uneventful tedious and manless holiday spent in the company of miss schuler and other friends when she perceived mr tiernan seated on his steps grinning and waving a tattered palmleaf fan  the mercury is sure on the jump he observed youd think it was july  and lise agreed  i suppose youll be going to tim slatterys place tonight he went on its the coolest spot this side of the atlantic ocean  there was apparently nothing cryptic in this remark yet it is worth noting that lise instantly became suspicious  why would i be going out there she inquired innocently darting at him a dark coquettish glance  mr tiernan regarded her guilelessly but there was admiration in his soul not because of her unquestioned feminine attractionshe being somewhat amazingly proof against such thingsbut because it was conveyed to him in some unaccountable way that her suspicions were aroused the brain beneath that corkscrew hair was worthy of a richelieu mr tiernans estimate of miss lise bumpus if he could have been induced to reveal it would have been worth listening to  and why wouldnt you he replied heartily dont i see all the pretty young ladies out there including yourself and you dancing with the cascade man why is it youll never give me a dance  why is it you never ask me demanded lise  what chance have i got against him  he dont own me said lise  mr tiernan threw back his head and laughed  well if youre there tonight tangoin with him and i come up and says miss bumpus the pleasure is mine im wondering what would happen  im not going to slatterys tonight she declared having that instant arrived at this conclusion  and where then ill come along if theres a chance for me  quit your kidding lise reproved him  mr tiernan suddenly looked very solemn  kidding is it me kiddin you give me a chance thats all im asking where will you be now  is frear wanted she demanded  mr tiernans expression changed his nose seemed to become more pointed his eyes to twinkle more merrily than ever he didnt take the trouble now to conceal his admiration  sure miss bumpus he said if you was a man wed have you on the force tomorrow  whats he wanted for  well said johnny a little matter of sprinklin hes been sprinklin his companys water without a license  she was silent a moment before she exclaimedi ought to have been wise that he was a crook  well said johnny consolingly theres others that ought to have been wise too the cascade people had no business takin on a man that couldnt use but half of his mouth  this seemed to lise a reflection on her judgment she proceeded to clear herself  he was nothing to me he never gave me no rest he used to come round and pester me to go out with him  sure interrupted mr tiernan dont i know how it is with the likes of him a good times a good time and no harm in it but the point is and here he cocked his nosethe point is where is he where will he be tonight  all at once lise grew vehement almost tearful  i dont knowhonest to god i dont if i did id tell you last night he said he might be out of town he didnt say where he was going she fumbled in her bag drawing out an imitation lace handkerchief and pressing it to her eyes  there now exclaimed mr tiernan soothingly how would you know and he deceivin you like he did the company  he didnt deceive me cried lise  listen said mr tiernan who had risen and laid his hand on her arm its not young ladies like you that works and are selfrespecting that any one would be troublin and you the daughter of such a fine man as your father run along now i wont be detaining you miss bumpus and youll accept my apology i guess well never see him in hampton again  some twenty minutes later he sauntered down the street saluting acquaintances and threading his way across the common entered a grimy brick building where a huge policeman with an insignia on his arm was seated behind a desk mr tiernan leaned on the desk and reflectively lighted a thomasjeffersonfivecent cigar union label the excellencies of which were set forth on large signs above the ten foot buildings on faber street  she dont know nothing mike he remarked i guess he got wise this morning  the sergeant nodded     chapter v  to feel potential within ones self the capacity to live and yet to have no means of realizing this capacity is doubtless one of the least comfortable and agreeable of human experiences such as summer came on was janets case the memory of that visit to silliston lingered in her mind sometimes to flare up so vividly as to make her existence seem unbearable how wonderful she thought to be able to dwell in such a beautiful place to have as friends and companions such amusing and intelligent people as the stranger with whom she had talked were all the inhabitants of silliston like him they must be since it was a seat of learning lises cry ive just got to go away anywhere found an echo in janets soul why shouldnt she go away she was capable of taking care of herself she was a good stenographer her salary had been raised twice in two yearswhy should she allow consideration for her family to stand in the way of what she felt would be self realization unconsciously she was a true modern in that the virtues known as duty and self sacrifice did not appeal to hershe got from them neither benefit nor satisfaction she understood instinctively that they were impeding to growth unlike lise she was able to see life as it is she did not expect of it miracles economic or matrimonial nothing would happen unless she made it happen she was twentyone earning nine dollars a week of which she now contributed five to the householdher father with characteristic incompetence having taken out a larger insurance policy than he could reasonably carry of the remaining four dollars she spent more than one on lunches there were dresses and underclothing shoes and stockings to buy in spite of darning and mending little treats with eda that mounted up and occasionally the dentistfor janet would not neglect her teeth as lise neglected hers she managed to save something but it was very little and she was desperately unhappy when she contemplated the grey and monotonous vista of the years ahead saw herself growing older and older driven always by the stern necessity of accumulating a margin against possible disasters little by little drying up losing by withering disuse those rich faculties of enjoyment with which she was endowed and which at once fascinated and frightened her marriage in such an environment offered no solution marriage meant dependence from which her very nature revolted and in her existence drab and necessitous though it were was still a remnant of freedom that marriage would compel her to surrender  one warm evening oppressed by such reflections she had started home when she remembered having left her bag in the office and retraced her steps as she turned the corner of west street she saw beside the canal and directly in front of the bridge a new and smartlooking automobile painted crimson and black of the type known as a runabout which she recognized as belonging to mr ditmar indeed at that moment mr ditmar himself was stepping off the end of the bridge and about to start the engine when dropping the crank he walked to the dashboard and apparently became absorbed in some mechanisms there was it the glance cast in her direction that had caused him to delay his departure janet was seized by a sudden and rather absurd desire to retreat but canal street being empty such an action would appear eccentric and she came slowly forward pretending not to see her employer ridiculing to herself the idea that he had noticed her much to her annoyance however her embarrassment persisted and she knew it was due to the memory of certain incidents each in itself almost negligible but cumulatively amounting to a suspicion that for some months he had been aware of her many times when he had passed through the outer office she had felt his eyes upon her had been impelled to look up from her work to surprise in them a certain glow to make her bow her head again in warm confusion now as she approached him she was pleasantly but rather guiltily conscious of the more rapid beating of the blood that precedes an adventure yet sufficiently selfpossessed to note the becoming nature of the light flannel suit axed rather rakish panama he had pushed back from his forehead it was not until she had almost passed him that he straightened up lifted the panama tentatively and not too far startling her  good afternoon miss bumpus he said i thought you had gone  i left my bag in the office she replied with the outward calmness that rarely deserted herthe calmness indeed that had piqued him and was leading him on to rashness  oh he said simmons will get it for you simmons was the watchman who stood in the vestibule of the office entrance  thanks i can get it myself she told him and would have gone on had he not addressed her again i was just starting out for a spin what do you think of the car its good looking isnt it he stood off and surveyed it laughing a little and in his laugh she detected a note apologetic at variance with the conception she had formed of his character though not alien indeed to the dustcoloured vigour of the man she scarcely recognized ditmar as he stood there yet he excited her she felt from him an undercurrent of something that caused her inwardly to tremble see how the lines are carried through he indicated this by a wave of his hand but his eyes were now on her  it is pretty she agreed  in contrast to the defensive tactics which other ladies of his acquaintance had adopted tactics of a patently coy and coquettish nature this selfcollected manner was new and spicy challenging to powers never as yet fully exerted while beneath her manner he felt throbbing that rare and dangerous thing in women a temperament for which men have given their souls this conviction of her possession of a temperamenthe could not have defined the word emotional rather than intellectual produced the apologetic attitude she was quick to sense he had never been at least during his maturity at a loss with the other sex and he found the experience delicious  you like pretty things im sure of that he hazarded but she did not ask him how he knew she simply assented he raised the hood revealing the engine isnt that pretty see how nicely everything is adjusted in that little space to do the particular work for which it is designed  thus appealed to she came forward and stopped still standing off a little way but near enough to see gazing at the shining copper caps on the cylinders at the bright rods and gears  it looks intricate said mr ditmar but really its very simple the gasoline comes in here from the tank behindthis is called the carburetor it has a jet to vaporize the gasoline and the vapour is sucked into each of these cylinders in turn when the piston moveslike this he sought to explain the action of the piston that compresses it and then a tiny electric spark comes just at the right moment to explode it and the explosion sends the piston down again and turns the shaft well all four cylinders have an explosion one right after another and that keeps the shaft going whereupon the most important personage in hampton the head of the great chippering mill proceeded for the benefit of a humble assistant stenographer to remove the floor boards behind the dash theres the shaft come here and look at it she obeyed standing beside him almost touching him his arm indeed brushing her sleeve and into his voice crept a tremor the shaft turns the rear wheels by means of a gear at right angles on the axle and the rear wheels drive the car do you see  yes she answered faintly honesty compelling her to add a little  he was looking now not at the machinery but intently at her and she could feel the blood flooding into her cheeks and temples she was even compelled for an instant to return his glance and from his eyes into hers leaped a flame that ran scorching through her body then she knew with conviction that the explanation of the automobile had been an excuse she had comprehended almost nothing of it but she had been impressed by the facility with which he described it by his evident mastery over it she had noticed his hands how thick his fingers were and close together yet how deftly he had used them without smearing the cuffs of his silk shirt or the sleeves of his coat with the oil that glistened everywhere  i like machinery he told her as he replaced the boards i like to take care of it myself  it must be interesting she assented aware of the inadequacy of the remark and resenting in herself an inarticulateness seemingly imposed by inhibition connected with his nearness fascination and antagonism were struggling within her her desire to get away grew desperate  thank you for showing it to me with an effort of will she moved toward the bridge but was impelled by a consciousness of the abruptness of her departure to look back at him onceand smile to experience again the thrill of the current he sped after her by lifting his hat a little higher a little more confidently than in the first instance he made her leaving seem more gracious the act somehow conveying an acknowledgment on his part that their relationship had changed  once across the bridge and in the mill she fairly ran up the stairs and into the empty office to perceive her bag lying on the desk where she had left it and sat down for a few minutes beside the window her heart pounding in her breast as though she had barely escaped an accident threatening her with physical annihilation something had happened to her at last but what did it mean where would it lead her fear her antagonism of which she was still conscious her resentment that ditmar had thus surreptitiously chosen to approach her in a moment when they were unobserved were mingled with a throbbing exultation in that he had noticed her that there was something in her to attract him in that way to make his voice thicker and his smile apologetic when he spoke to her of that somethinginher she had been aware before but never had it been so unmistakably recognized and beckoned to from without she was at once terrified excitedand flattered  at length growing calmer she made her way out of the building when she reached the vestibule she had a moment of sharp apprehension of paradoxical hope that ditmar might still be there awaiting her but he had gone  in spite of her efforts to dismiss the matter from her mind to persuade herself there had been no significance in the encounter when she was seated at her typewriter the next morning she experienced a renewal of the palpitation of the evening before and at the sound of every step in the corridor she started of this tendency she was profoundly ashamed and when at last ditmar arrived though the blood rose to her temples she kept her eyes fixed on the keys he went quickly into his room she was convinced he had not so much as glanced at her as the days went by however she was annoyed by the discovery that his continued ignoring of her presence brought more resentment than relief she detected in it a deliberation implying between them a guilty secret she hated secrecy though secrecy contained a thrill then one morning when she was alone in the office with young caldwell who was absorbed in some reports ditmar entered unexpectedly and looked her full in the eyes surprising her into answering his glance before she could turn away hating herself and hating him hate she determined was her prevailing sentiment in regard to mr ditmar  the following monday miss ottway overtook her at noon on the stairs  janet i wanted to speak to you to tell you im leaving she said  leaving repeated janet who had regarded miss ottway as a fixture  im going to boston miss ottway explained in her deep musical voice ive always wanted to go i have an unmarried sister there of whom im very fond and mr ditmar knows that hes got me a place with the treasurer mr semple  oh im sorry youre going though of course im glad for you janet said sincerely for she liked and respected miss ottway and was conscious in the older woman of a certain kindly interest  janet ive recommended you to mr ditmar for my place  oh cried janet faintly  it was he who asked about you he thinks you are reliable and quick and clever and i was very glad to say a good word for you my dear since i could honestly do so miss ottway drew janets arm through hers and patted it affectionately of course youll have to expect some jealousy there are older women in the other offices who will think they ought to have the place but if you attend to your own affairs as you always have done there wont be any trouble  oh i wont take the place i cant janet cried so passionately that miss ottway looked at her in surprise im awfully grateful to you she added flushing crimson iim afraid im not equal to it  nonsense said the other with decision youd be very foolish not to try it you wont get as much as i do at first at any rate but a little more money wont be unwelcome i guess mr ditmar will speak to you this afternoon i leave on saturday im real glad to do you a good turn janet and i know youll get along miss ottway added impulsively as they parted at the corner of faber street ive always thought a good deal of you  for awhile janet stood still staring after the sturdy figure of her friend heedless of the noonday crowd that bumped her then she went to gradys quick lunch counter and ordered a sandwich and a glass of milk which she consumed slowly profoundly sunk in thought presently eda rawle arrived and noticing her preoccupation inquired what was the matter  nothing said janet  at two oclock when ditmar returned to the office he called miss ottway who presently came out to summon janet to his presence fresh immaculate yet virile in his light suit and silk shirt with red stripes he was seated at his desk engaged in turning over some papers in a drawer he kept her waiting a moment and then said with apparent casualnessis that you miss bumpus would you mind closing the door  janet obeyed and again stood before him he looked up a suggestion of tenseness in her pose betraying an inner attitude of alertness of defiance conveyed to him sharply and deliciously once more the pantherlike impression he had received when first as a woman she had come to his notice the renewed and heightened perception of this feral quality in her aroused a sense of danger by no means unpleasurable though warning him that he was about to take an unprecedented step being drawn beyond the limits of caution he had previously set for himself in divorcing business and sex though he was by no means selfconvinced of an intention to push the adventure preferring to leave its possibilities open he strove in voice and manner to be businesslike and instinct perhaps whispered that she might take alarm  sit down miss bumpus he said pleasantly as he closed the drawer  she seated herself on an office chair  do you like your work here he inquired  no said janet  why not he demanded staring at her  why should i she retorted  wellwhats the trouble with it it isnt as hard as it would be in some other places is it  im not saying anything against the place  what then  you asked me if i liked my work i dont  then why do you do it he demanded  to live she replied  he smiled but his gesture as he stroked his moustache implied a slight annoyance at her composure he found it difficult with this dark selfcontained young woman to sustain the role of benefactor  what kind of work would you like to do he demanded  i dont know i havent got the choice anyway she said  he observed that she did her work well to which she made no answer she refused to help him although miss ottway must have warned her she acted as though she were conferring the favour and yet clearing his throat he was impelled to saymiss ottways leaving me shes going into the boston office with mr semple the treasurer of the corporation i shall miss her shes an able and reliable woman and she knows my ways he paused fingering his paper knife the fact is miss bumpus shes spoken highly of you she tells me youre quick and accurate and painstakingive noticed that for myself she seems to think you could do her work and recommends that i give you a trial you understand of course that the position is in a way confidential and that you could not expect at first at any rate the salary miss ottway has had but im willing to offer you fourteen dollars a week to begin with and afterwards if we get along together to give you more what do you say  id like to try it mr ditmar janet said and added nothing no word of gratitude or of appreciation to that consent  very well then he replied thats settled miss ottway will explain things to you and tell you about my peculiarities and when she goes you can take her desk by the window nearest my door  ditmar sat idle for some minutes after she had gone staring through the open doorway into the outer office  to ditmar she had given no evidence of the storm his offer had created in her breast and it was characteristic also that she waited until supper was nearly over to inform her family making the announcement in a matteroffact tone just as though it were not the unique piece of good fortune that had come to the bumpuses since edward had been eliminated from the mercantile establishment at dolton the news was received with something like consternation for the moment hannah was incapable of speech and her hand trembled as she resumed the cutting of the pie but hope surged within her despite her effort to keep it down her determination to remain true to the fatalism from which she had paradoxically derived so much comfort the effect on edward while somewhat less violent was temporarily to take away his appetite hope to flower in him needed but little watering great was his faith in the bumpus blood and secretly he had always regarded his eldest daughter as the chosen vessel for their redemption  well i swan he exclaimed staring at her in admiration and neglecting his pie ive always thought you had it in you to get on janet i guess ive told you youve always put me in mind of eliza bumpusthe one that held out against the indians till her husband came back with the neighbours i was just reading about her again the other night  yes youve told us edward said hannah  she had gumption he went on undismayed and from what i can gather of her looks i calculate you favour hershe was dark and not so very tallnot so tall as you i guess so youre goin he pronounced it very slowly youre goin to be mr ditmars private stenographer hes a smart man mr ditmar hes a good man too all youve got to do is to behave right by him he always speaks to me when he passes by the gate i was sorry for him when his wife dieda young woman too and hes never married again well i swan  youd better quit swanning exclaimed hannah and whats mr ditmars goodness got to do with it hes foundout janet has sense shes willing and hard working he wont pronounced want he wont be the loser by it and hes not giving her what he gave miss ottway its just like you thinking hes doing her a good turn  im not saying janet isnt smart he protested but i know its hard to get work with so many folks after every job  maybe it aint so hard when youve got some getup and go hannah retorted rather cruelly it was thus characteristically and with unintentional sharpness she expressed her maternal pride by a reflection not only upon edward but lise also janet had grown warm at the mention of ditmars name  it was miss ottway who recommended me she said glancing at her sister who during this conversation had sat in silence lises expression normally suggestive of a discontent not unbecoming to her type had grown almost sullen hannahs brisk gathering up of the dishes was suddenly arrested  lise why dont you say something to your sister aint you glad shes got the place  sure im glad said lise and began to unscrew the top of the salt shaker i dont see why i couldnt get a raise too i work just as hard as she does  edward who had never got a raise in his life was smitten with compunction and sympathy  give em time lise he said consolingly you aint so old as janet  time she cried flaring up and suddenly losing her control ive got a picture of waiters giving me a raise i know the girls that get raises from him  you ought to be ashamed of yourself hannah declared thereyouve spilled the salt  but lise suddenly bursting into tears got up and left the room edward picked up the banner and pretended to read it while janet collected the salt and put it back into the shaker hannah gathering up the rest of the dishes disappeared into the kitchen but presently returned as though she had forgotten something  hadnt you better go after her she said to janet  im afraid it wont be any use shes got sort of queer latelyshe thinks theyre down on her  im sorry i spoke so sharp but then hannah shook her head and her sentence remained unfinished  janet sought her sister but returned after a brief interval with the news that lise had gone out  one of the delights of friendship as is well known is the exchange of confidences of joy or sorrow but there was in janets promotion something intensely personal to increase her natural reserve her feelings toward ditmar were so mingled as to defy analysis and several days went by before she could bring herself to inform eda rawle of the new business relationship in which she stood to the agent of the chippering mill the sky was still bright as they walked out warren street after supper eda bewailing the trials of the day just ended mr frye the cashier of the bank had had one of his cantankerous fits had found fault with her punctuation nothing she had done had pleased him but presently when they had come to what the banner called the residential district she was cheered by the sight of the green lawns the flowerbeds and shrubbery the mansions of those inhabitants of hampton unfamiliar with boardinghouses and tenements before one of these she paused retaining janet by the arm exclaiming wistfully  wouldnt you like to live there that belongs to your boss  janet who had been dreaming as she gazed at the facade of rough stucco that once had sufficed to fill the ambitions of the late mrs ditmar recognized it as soon as eda spoke and dragged her friend hastily almost roughly along the sidewalk until they had reached the end of the block janet was red  whats the matter demanded eda as soon as she had recovered from her surprise  nothing said janet onlyim in his office  but what of it youve got a right to look at his house havent you  why yesa right janet assented knowing edas ambitions for her were not those of a business career she was in terror lest her friend should scent a romance and for this reason she had never spoken of the symptoms ditmar had betrayed she attempted to convey to eda the doubtful taste of staring pointblank at the house of ones employer especially when he might be concealed behind a curtain  you see she added miss ottways recommended me for her placeshes going away  janet cried eda why didnt you tell me  well said janet guiltily its only a trial i dont know whether hell keep me or not  of course hell keep you said eda warmly if that isnt just like you not saying a word about it gee if id had a raise like that i just couldnt wait to tell you but then im not smart like you  dont be silly said janet out of humour with herself and annoyed because she could not then appreciate edas generosity  weve just got to celebrate declared eda who had the gift which janet lacked of taking her joys vicariously and her romantic and somewhat medieval proclivities would permit no such momentous occasion to pass without an appropriate festal symbol well have a spree on saturdaythe circus is coming then  itll be my spree insisted janet her heart warming ive got the raise  on saturday accordingly they met at gradys for lunch eda attired in her best blouse of pale blue and when they emerged from the restaurant despite the torrid heat she beheld faber street as in holiday garb as they made their way to the cool recesses of winterhalters to complete the feast that glorified drugstore with the five bays included in its manifold functions a department rivalling delmonicos with electric fans and marbletopped tables and whiteclad waiters who took ones order and filled it at the soda fountain it mattered little to eda that the young man awaiting their commands had pimples and long hair and grinned affectionately as he greeted them  hello girls he said what strikes you today  me for a raspberry nut sundae announced eda and janet being unable to imagine any more delectable confection assented the penetrating odour peculiar to drugstores dominated by menthol and some unnamable but ancient remedy for catarrh was powerless to interfere with their enjoyment  the circus began at two rather than cling to the straps of a crowded car they chose to walk following the familiar route of the trolley past the car barns and the baseball park to the bare field under the seared face of torreys hill where circuses were wont to settle a siroccolike breeze from the southwest whirled into eddies the clouds of germladen dust stirred up by the automobiles blowing their skirts against their legs and sometimes they were forced to turn clinging to their hats confused and giggling conscious of male glances the crowd increasing as they proceeded was in holiday mood young men with a newlywashed aspect in faber street suits chaffed boisterously groups of girls who retorted with shrill cries and shrieks of laughter amorous couples strolled arm in arm oblivious as though the place were as empty as eden ladykillers with exaggerated square shoulders wearing bright neckties their predatory instincts alert hovered about in eager search of adventure there were menkillers too usually to be found in pairs in startling costumes they had been persuaded were the latest paris modelsimitations of french cocottes in hampton proof of the smallness of our modern world eda regarded them superciliously  theyd like you to think theyd never been near a loom or a bobbin she exclaimed  in addition to these more conspicuous elements the crowd contained sober operatives of the skilled sort possessed of sufficient means to bring hither their families including the baby there were sectionhands and foremen slashers mule spinners beamers frenchcanadians irish scotch welsh and english germans with only an occasional italian lithuanian or jew peanut and popcorn men venders of tamales and chileconcarne hoarsely shouted their wares while from afar could be heard the muffled booming of a band janets heart beat faster she regarded with a tinge of awe the vast expanse of tent that rose before her eyes the wind sending ripples along the heavy canvas from circumference to tent pole she bought the tickets they entered the circular enclosure where the animals were kept where the strong beams of the sun in trying to force their way through the canvas roof created an unnatural jaundiced twilight the weirdness of which was somehow enhanced by the hoarse amazingly penetrating growls of beasts suddenly a lion near them raised a shaggy head emitting a series of undulating soulshaking roars  ah whats eatin you demanded a thicknecked youth pretending not to be awestricken by this demonstration  suppose hed get out cried eda drawing janet away  i wouldnt let him hurt you dearie the young man assured her  you she retorted contemptuously but grinned in spite of herself showing her gums  the vague feeling of terror inspired by this tent was a part of its fascination for it seemed pregnant with potential tragedies suggested by the juxtaposition of helpless babies and wild beasts the babies crying or staring in blank amazement at padding tigers whose phosphorescent eyes never left these morsels beyond the bars the two girls wandered about their arms closely locked but the strange atmosphere the roars of the beasts the ineffable pungent odour of the circus of sawdust mingled with the effluvia of animals had aroused an excitement that was slow in subsiding some time elapsed before they were capable of taking a normal interest in the various exhibits  adjutant bird janet read presently from a legend on one of the compartments of a cage devoted to birds and surveying the somewhat dissolute occupant why hes just like one of those tall mashers who stay at the wilmot and stand on the sidewalktravelling men you know  sayisnt he eda agreed isnt he pleased with himself and his feet crossed  and see this one edahes a harpy eagle theres somebody we know looks just like that wait a minuteill tell youits the woman who sits in the cashiers cage at gradys  if it sure isnt said eda  she has the same fluffy light hairhairpins cant keep it down and she looks at you in that same sort of surprised way with her head on one side when you hand in your check  why its true to the life cried eda enthusiastically she thinks shes got all the men cinchedshe does and shes forty if shes a day  these comparisons brought them to a pitch of risible enjoyment amply sustained by the spectacle in the monkey cage to which presently they turned a chimpanzee with a solicitation more than human was solemnly searching a friend for fleas in the midst of a pandemonium of chattering and screeching and chasing of rattling of bars and trapezes carried on by their companions  well young ladies said a voice come to pay a call on your relationshave ye  eda giggled hysterically an elderly man was standing beside them he was shabbily dressed his own features were wizened almost simian and by his friendly and fatuous smile janet recognized one of the harmless obsessed in which hampton abounded  relations eda exclaimed  you and me yes and her he answered looking at janet though at first he had apparently entertained some doubt as to this inclusion were all descended from them his gesture triumphantly indicated the denizens of the cage  what are you giving us said eda  aint you never read darwin he demanded if you had youd know theyre our ancestors youd know we came from them instead of adam and eve that theres a fable  ill never believe i came from them cried eda vehement in her disgust  but janet laughed whats the difference some of us arent any better than monkeys anyway  thats so said the man approvingly thats so he wanted to continue the conversation but they left him rather ruthlessly and when from the entrance to the performance tent they glanced back over their shoulders he was still gazing at his cousins behind the bars seemingly deriving an acute pleasure from his consciousness of the connection     chapter vi  modern business by reason of the mingling of the sexes it involves for the playwright and the novelist and the sociologist is full of interesting and dramatic situations and in it may be studied undoubtedly one phase of the evolution tending to transform if not disintegrate certain institutions hitherto the cornerstones of society our stage is set a young woman conscious of ability owes her promotion primarily to certain dynamic feminine qualities with which she is endowed and though she may make an elaborate pretense of ignoring the fact in her heart she knows and resents it while at the same time paradoxically she gets a thrill from ita sustaining and inspiring thrill of power on its face it is a business arrangement secretlyattempt to repudiate this as one mayit is tinged with the colours of high adventure when janet entered into the intimate relationship with mr claude ditmar necessitated by her new duties as his private stenographer her attitude slightly defiant was the irreproachable one of a strict attention to duty all unconsciously she was a true daughter of the twentieth century and probably a feminist at heart which is to say that her conduct was determined by no preconceived or handeddown notions of what was proper and ladylike for feminism in a sense is a return to atavism and sex antagonism and sex attraction are functions of the same thing there were moments when she believed herself to hate mr ditmar when she treated him with an aloofness an impersonality unsurpassed moments when he paused in his dictation to stare at her in astonishment he who flattered himself that he understood women  she would show himsuch was her dominating determination her promotion assumed the guise of a challenge of a gauntlet flung down at the feet of her sex in a certain way an insult though incredibly stimulating if he flattered himself that he had done her a favour if he entertained the notion that he could presently take advantage of the contact with her now achieved to make unbusinesslike advanceswell he would find out he had proclaimed his desire for an able assistant in miss ottways placehe would get one and nothing more she watched narrowly a laffut as the french say for any signs of sentiment and indeed this awareness of her being on guard may have had some influence on mr ditmars own attitude likewise irreproachable a rather anaemic young woman a miss annie james was hired for janets old place  in spite of this aloofness and alertness for the first time in her life janet felt the exuberance of being in touch with affairs of import hitherto the mill had been merely a greedy monster claiming her freedom and draining her energies in tasks routine such as the copying of meaningless documents and rows of figures now supplied with stimulus and a motive the corporation began to take on significance and she flung herself into the work with an ardour hitherto unknown determined to make herself so valuable to ditmar that the time would come when he could not do without her she strove to memorize certain names and addresses lest time be lost in looking them up to familiarize herself with the ordinary run of his correspondence to recall what letters were to be marked personal to anticipate matters of routine in order that he might not have the tedium of repeating instructions she acquired the faculty of keeping his engagements in her head she came early to the office remaining after hours going through the files becoming familiar with his system and she learned to sort out his correspondence sifting the important from the unimportant to protect him more and more from numerous visitors who called only to waste his time her instinct for the detection of bookagents no matter how brisk and businesslike they might appear was unerringshe remembered faces and the names belonging to them an individual once observed to be persona non grata never succeeded in passing her twice on one occasion ditmar came out of his office to see the back of one of these visitors disappearing into the corridor  who was that he asked  his name is mccalla she said i thought you didnt want to be bothered  but how in thunder did you get rid of him he demanded  oh i just wouldnt let him in she replied demurely  and ditmar went away wondering thus she studied him without permitting him to suspect it learning his idiosyncrasies his attitude toward all those with whom daily he came in contact only to find herself approving she was forced to admit that he was a judge of men compelled to admire his adroitness in dealing with them he could be democratic or autocratic as occasion demanded he knew when to yield and when to remain inflexible one morning for instance there arrived from new york a dapper salesman whose jauntily tied bow whose thin haircarefully parted to conceal an incipient baldnesswhose wary and slightly weary eyes all impressively suggested the metropolitan atmosphere of high pressure and sophistication from which he had emerged he had a machine to sell an amazing machine endowed with human intelligence and more than human infallibility for when it made a mistake it stopped it was designed for the express purpose of eliminating from the payroll the skilled and sharpeyed women who are known as drawersin who sit all day long under a north light patiently threading the ends of the warp through the heddles of the loom harness janets imagination was gradually fired as she listened to the visitors eloquence and the textile industry which hitherto had seemed to her uninteresting and sordid took on the colours of romance  now ive made up my mind well place one with you mr ditmar the salesman concluded i dont object to telling you wed rather have one in the chippering than in any mill in new england  janet was surprised almost shocked to see ditmar shake his head yet she felt a certain reluctant admiration because he had not been swayed by blandishments at such moments when he was bent on refusing a request he seemed physically to acquire massivenessand he had a dogged way of chewing his cigar  i dont want it yet he replied not until you improve it and she was impressed by the fact that he seemed to know as much about the machine as the salesman himself in spite of protests denials appeals he remained firm when you get rid of the defects ive mentioned come back mr hicksbut dont come back until then  and mr hicks departed discomfited  ditmar knew what he wanted of the mill he was the absolute master familiar with every process carrying constantly in his mind how many spindles how many looms were at work and if anything untoward happened becoming aware of it by what seemed to janet a subconscious process sending for the superintendent of the department for mr orcutt perhaps whose office was across the halla tall lean spectacled man of fifty who looked like a schoolmaster  orcutt whats the matter with the opener in cooneys room  why the blowers out of order  well whose fault is it  he knew every watchman and foreman in the mill and many of the second hands the old workers men and women who had been in the chippering employ through good and bad times for years had a place in his affections but toward the labour force in general his attitude was impersonal the mill had to be run and people to be got to run it with him first and last and always it was the mill and little by little what had been for janet a heterogeneous mass of machinery and human beings became unified and personified in claude ditmar it was odd how the essence and quality of that great building had changed for her how the very roaring of the looms as she drew near the canal in the mornings had ceased to be sinister and depressing but bore now a burden like a great battle song to excite and inspire to remind her that she had been snatched as by a miracle from the commonplace and all this was a function of ditmar  life had become portentous and she was troubled by no qualms of logic but gloried womanlike in her lack of it she did not ask herself why she had deliberately enlarged upon miss ottways duties invaded debatable ground in part inevitably personal flung herself with such abandon into the enterprise of his lifes passion at the same time maintaining a deceptive attitude of detachment half deceiving herself that it was zeal for the work by which she was actuated in her soul she knew better she was really pouring fuel on the flames she read him up to a certain pointas far as was necessary and beneath his attempts at selfcontrol she was conscious of a dynamic desire that betrayed itself in many acts and signsas when he brushed against her and occasionally when he gave evidence with his subordinates of a certain shortness of temper unusual with him she experienced a vaguely alarming but delicious thrill of power and this of all men was the great mr ditmar was she in love with him that question did not trouble her either she continued to experience in his presence waves of antagonism and attraction revealing to her depths and possibilities of her nature that frightened while they fascinated it never occurred to her to desist that craving in her for high adventure was not to be denied  on summer evenings it had been ditmars habit when in hampton to stroll about his lawn from time to time changing the position of the sprinkler smoking a cigar and reflecting pleasantly upon his existence his house as he gazed at it against the whitening sky was an eminently satisfactory abode his wife was dead his children gave him no trouble he felt a glow of paternal pride in his son as the boy raced up and down the sidewalk on a bicycle george was manly large and strong for his age and had a domineering way with other boys that gave ditmar secret pleasure of amy who was showing a tendency to stoutness and who had inherited her mothers liking for candy and romances ditmar thought scarcely at all he would glance at her as she lounged reading in a chair on the porch but she did not come within his range of problems he had in short everything to make a reasonable man content a life nicely compounded of sustenance pleasure and businessbusiness naturally being the greatest of these he wasthough he did not know itethically and philosophically right in squaring his morals with his occupation and his had been the good fortune to live in a world whose codes and conventions had been carefully adjusted to the pursuit of that particular brand of happiness he had made his own why then in the name of that happiness of the peace and sanity and pleasurable effort it had brought him had he allowed and even encouraged the advent of a new element that threatened to destroy the equilibrium achieved an element refusing to be classified under the head of property since it involved something he desired and could not buy a woman who was not property who resisted the attempt to be turned into property was an anomaly in ditmars universe he had not of course existed for more than forty years without having heard and read of and even encountered in an acquaintance or two the species of sex attraction sentimentally called love that sometimes made fools of men and played havoc with more important affairs but in his experience it had never interfered with his sanity or his appetite or the chippering mill it had never made his cigars taste bitter it had never caused a deterioration in the appreciation of what he had achieved and held but now he was experiencing strange symptoms of an intensity out of all proportion to that of former relations with the other sex what was most unusual for him he was alarmed and depressed at moments irritable he regretted the capricious and apparently accidental impulse that had made him pretend to tinker with his automobile that day by the canal that had led him to the incomparable idiocy of getting rid of miss ottway and installing the disturber of his peace as his private stenographer  what the devil was it in her that made him so uncomfortable when in his office he had difficulty in keeping his mind on matters of import he would watch her furtively as she went about the room with the lithe and noiseless movements that excited him the more because he suspected beneath her outward and restrained demeanour a fierceness he craved yet feared he thought of her continually as a panther a panther he had caught and could not tame he hadnt even caught her since she might escape at any time he took precautions not to alarm her when she brushed against him he trembled continually she baffled and puzzled him and he never could tell of what she was thinking she represented a whole set of new and undetermined values for which he had no precedents and unlike every woman he had knownincluding his wifeshe had an integrity of her own seemingly beyond the reach of all influences economic and social all the more exasperating therefore was a propinquity creating an intimacy without substance or without the substance he craved for she had magically become for him a sort of enveloping protecting atmosphere in an astonishingly brief time he had fallen into the habit of talking things over with her naturally not affairs of the first importance but matters such as the economy of his time when for instance it was most convenient for him to go to boston and he would find that she had telephoned without being told to the office there when to expect him to his chauffeur to be on hand he never had to tell her a thing twice nor did she interruptas miss ottway sometimes had donethe processes of his thought without realizing it he fell into the habit of listening for the inflections of her voice and though he had never lacked the power of making decisions she somehow made these easier for him especially if a human equation were involved  he had at least the consolationif it were oneof reflecting that his reputation was safe that there would be no scandal since two are necessary to make the kind of scandal he had always feared and miss bumpus apparently had no intention of being the second party yet she was not virtuous as he had hitherto defined the word of this he was sure no woman who moved about as she did who had such an effect on him who had on occasions though inadvertently returned the lightning of his glances whose rare laughter resembled grace notes and in whose hair was that almost imperceptible kink could be virtuous this instinctive conviction inflamed him for the first time in his life he began to doubt the universal conquering quality of his own charmsand when such a thing happens to a man like ditmar he is in danger of hellfire he indulged less and less in the convivial meetings and excursions that hitherto had given him relaxation and enjoyment and if his cronies inquired as to the reasons for his neglect of them he failed to answer with his usual geniality  everything going all right up at the mills colonel he was asked one day by mr madden the treasurer of a large shoe company when they met on the marble tiles of the hall in their boston club  all right why  well replied madden conciliatingly you seem kind of preoccupied thats all i didnt know but what the fiftyfour hour bill the legislatures just put through might be worrying you  well handle that situation when the time comes said ditmar he accepted a gin rickey but declined rather curtly the suggestion of a little spree over sunday to a resort on the cape which formerly he would have found enticing on another occasion he encountered in the lobby of the parker house a more intimate friend chester sprole sallow selfmade somewhat corpulent one of those lawyers hail fellows well met in business circles and looked upon askance by the brahmins of their profession more than half politician he had been in congress and from time to time was retained by large business interests because of his persuasive gifts with committees of the legislaturethough these had been powerless to avert the recent calamity of the women and childrens fiftyfour hour bill mr sproles hair was prematurely white and the crowsfeet at the corners of his eyes were not the result of legal worries  hullo dit he said jovially  hullo ches said ditmar  now youre the very chap i wanted to see where have you been keeping yourself lately come out to the farm tonightsame of the boysll be there mr sprole like many a selfmade man was proud of his farm though he did not lead a wholly bucolic existence  i cant ches answered ditmar ive got to go back to hampton  this statement mr sprole unwisely accepted as a fiction he took hold of ditmars arm  a ladyehwhat  ive got to go back to hampton repeated ditmar with a suggestion of truculence that took his friend aback not for worlds would mr sprole have offended the agent of the chippering mill  i was only joking claude he hastened to explain ditmar somewhat mollified but still dejected sought the diningroom when the lawyer had gone  all alone tonight colonel asked the coloured head waiter obsequiously  ditmar demanded a table in the corner and consumed a solitary meal  very naturally janet was aware of the change in ditmar and knew the cause of it her feelings were complicated he the most important man in hampton the selfsufficient the powerful the hitherto distant and unattainable head of the vast organization known as the chippering mill of which she was an insignificant unit at times became for her just a mana man for whom she had achieved a delicious contempt and the knowledge that she if she chose could sway and dominate him by the mere exercise of that strange feminine force within her was intoxicating and terrifying she read this in a thousand signs in his glances in his movements revealing a desire to touch her in little things he said apparently insignificant yet fraught with meaning in a constant recurrence of the apologetic attitudeso alien to the ditmar formerly conceivedof which he had given evidence that day by the canal and from this attitude emanated paradoxically a virile and galvanic current profoundly disturbing sometimes when he bent over her she experienced a commingled ecstasy and fear that he would seize her in his arms yet the tension was not constant rising and falling with his moods and struggles all of which she readunguessed by himas easily as a printed page by the gift that dispenses with laborious processes of the intellect on the other hand a resentment boiled within her his masculine mind failed to fathom stevenson said of john knox that many women had come to learn from him but he had never condescended to become a learner in returna remark more or less applicable to ditmar she was perforce thrilled that he was virile and wanted her but because he wanted her clandestinely her pride revolted divining his fear of scandal and hating him for it like a thoroughbred to do her justice marriage never occurred to her she was not so commonplace  there were times however when the tension between them would relax when some incident occurred to focus ditmars interest on the enterprise that had absorbed and unified his life the chippering mill one day in september for instance after an absence in new york he returned to the office late in the afternoon and she was quick to sense his elation to recognize in him the restored presence of the quality of elan of command of singleness of purpose that had characterized him before she had become his stenographer at first as he read his mail he seemed scarcely conscious of her presence she stood by the window awaiting his pleasure watching the white mist as it rolled over the floor of the river catching glimpses in vivid saffron blurs of the lights of the arundel mill on the farther shore autumn was at hand suddenly she heard ditmar speaking  would you mind staying a little while longer this evening miss bumpus  not at all she replied turning  on his face was a smile almost boyish  the fact is i think ive got hold of the biggest single order that ever came into any mill in new england he declared  oh im glad she said quickly  the cotton cards he demanded  she knew he referred to the schedules based on the current prices of cotton made out in the agents office and sent in duplicate to the selling house in boston she got them from the shelf and as he went over them she heard him repeating the names of various goods now become familiar pongees poplins percales and voiles garbardines and galateas lawns organdies crepes and madras shirtings while he wrote down figures on a sheet of paper so complete was his absorption in this task that janet although she had resented the insinuating pressure of his former attitude toward her felt a paradoxical sensation of jealousy presently without looking up he told her to call up the boston office and ask for mr fraile the cotton buyer and she learned from the talk over the telephone though it was mostly about futuresthat ditmar had lingered for a conference in boston on his way back from new york afterwards having dictated two telegrams which she wrote out on her machine he leaned back in his chair and though the business for the day was ended showed a desire to detain her his mood became communicative  ive been on the trail of that order for a month he declared of course it isnt my business to get orders but to manage this mill and thats enough for one man god knows but i heard the bradlaughs were in the market for these goods and i told the selling house to lie low that id go after it i knew i could get away with it if anybody could i went to the bradlaughs and sat down on em i lived with em ate with em brought em home at night i didnt let em alone a minute until they handed it over i wasnt going to give any other mill in new england or any of those southern concerns a chance to walk off with itnot on your life why we have the facilities there isnt another mill in the country can turn it out in the time they ask and even we will have to go some to do it but well do it by george unless im struck by lightning  he leaned forward hitting the desk with his fist and janet standing beside him smiled she had the tempting gift of silence forgetting her twinge of jealousy she was drawn toward him now and in this mood of boyish exuberance of selfconfidence and pride in his powers and success she liked him better than ever before she had for the first time the curious feeling of being years older than he yet this did not detract from a newborn admiration  i made this mill and im proud of it he went on when old stephen chippering put me in charge he was losing money hed had three agents in four years the old man knew i had it in me and i knew it if i do say it myself all this union labour talk about shorter hours makes me sickwhy there was a time when i worked ten and twelve hours a day and im man enough to do it yet if i have to when the last agentthat was cortwas sacked i went to boston on my own hook and tackled the old gentlemanthats the only way to get anywhere i couldnt bear to see the mill going to scrap and i told him a thing or twoi had the facts and the figures stephen chippering was a big man but he had a streak of obstinacy in him he was conservative you bet i had to get it across to him there was a lot of dead wood in this plant i had to wake him up to the fact that the twentieth century was here he had to be shownhe was from boston you know ditmar laughedbut he was all wool and a yard wide and he liked me and trusted me  that was in nineteen hundred i can remember the interview as well as if it had happened last nightwe sat up until two oclock in the morning in that library of his with the marble busts and the leatherbound books and the double windows looking out over the charles where the wind was blowing a gale and at last he said all right claude go ahead ill put you in as agent and stand behind you and by thunder he did stand behind me he was quiet the finest looking old man i ever saw in my life straight as a ramrod with a little white goatee and a red weathered face full of creases and a skin that looked as if it had been pricked all over with needlesthe old boston sort they dont seem to turn em out any more why i have a picture of him here  he opened a drawer in his desk and drew out a photograph janet gazed at it sympathetically  it doesnt give you any notion of those eyes of his ditmar said reminiscently they looked right through a mans skull no matter how thick it was if anything went wrong i never wasted any time in telling him about it and i guess it was one reason he liked me some of the people up here didnt understand him kowtowed to him they were scared of him and if he thought they had something up their sleeves he looked as if he were going to eat em alive regular fighting eyes the kind that get inside of a man and turn the light on and he sat so stillmade you ashamed of yourself well he was a born fighter went from harvard into the rebellion and was left for dead at seven oaks where one of the company found him and saved him he set that may up for life and never talked about it either see what he wrote on the bottomto my friend claude ditmar stephen chippering and believe me when he once called a man a friend he never took it back i know one thing ill never get another friend like him  with a gesture that gave her a new insight into ditmar reverently he took the picture from her hand and placed it back in the drawer she was stirred almost to tears and moved away from him a little as though to lessen by distance the sudden attraction he had begun to exert yet she lingered half leaning half sitting on the corner of the big desk her head bent toward him her eyes filled with light she was wondering whether he could ever love a woman as he loved this man of whom he had spoken whether he could be as true to a woman his own attitude seemed never to have been more impersonal but she had ceased to resent it something within her whispered that she was the conductor the inspirer  i wish stephen chippering could have lived to see this order he exclaimed to see the chippering mill today i guess hed be proud of it i guess he wouldnt regret having put me in as agent  janet did not reply she could not she sat regarding him intently and when he raised his eyes and caught her luminous glance his expression changed she knew stephen chippering had passed from his mind  i hope you like it here he said his voice had become vibrant ingratiating he had changed from the master to the suppliantand yet she was not displeased power had suddenly flowed back into her and with it an exhilarating selfcommand  i do like it she answered  but you said when i asked you to be my stenographer that you didnt care for your work  oh this is different  how  im interested the mill means something to me now you see im not just copying things i dont know anything about  im glad youre interested he said in the same odd awkward tone ive never had any one in the office who did my work as well now miss ottway was a good stenographer she was capable and a fine woman but she never got the idea the spirit of the mill in her as youve got it and she wasnt able to save me trouble as you do its remarkable how youve come to understand and in such a short time  janet coloured she did not look at him but had risen and begun to straighten out the papers beside her  there are lots of other things id like to understand she said  what he demanded  wellabout the mill i never thought much about it before i always hated it she cried dropping the papers and suddenly facing him it was just drudgery but now i want to learn everything all i can id like to see the machinery  ill take you through myselftomorrow he declared  his evident agitation made her pause they were alone the outer office deserted and the ditmar she saw now whom she had summoned up with ridiculous ease by virtue of that mysterious power within her was no longer the agent of the chippering mill a boy filled with enthusiasm by a business achievement but a man the incarnation and expression of masculine desire desire for her she knew she could compel him if she chose to throw caution to the winds  oh no she exclaimed she was afraid of him she shrank from such a conspicuous sign of his favour  why not he asked  because i dont want you to she said and realized as soon as she had spoken that her words might imply the existence of a something between them never before hinted at by her ill get mr caldwell to take me through she moved toward the door and turned though still on fire within her manner had become demure repressed did you wish anything more this evening she inquired  thats all he said and she saw that he was gripping the arms of his chair     chapter vii  autumn was at hand all day it had rained but now as night fell and janet went homeward the white mist from the river was creeping stealthily over the city disguising the familiar and sordid landmarks these had become beautiful mysterious somehow appealing the electric arcs splotches in the veil revealed on the common phantom trees and in the distance against the blurred lights from the warren street stores skirting the park could be seen phantom vehicles phantom people moving to and fro thus it seemed to janet invaded by a pearly mist was her own soul in which she walked in wondera mist shot through and through with soft exhilarating lights half disclosing yet transforming and etherealizing certain landmarks there on which formerly she had not cared to gaze she was thinking of ditmar as she had left him gripping his chair as he had dismissed her for the day curtly almost savagely she had wounded and repelled him and lingering in her was that exquisite touch of feara fear now not so much inspired by ditmar as by the semiacknowledged recognition of certain tendencies and capacities within herself yet she rejoiced in them she was glad she had hurt ditmar she would hurt him again still palpitating she reached the house in fillmore street halting a moment with her hand on the door knowing her face was flushed anxious lest her mother or lise might notice something unusual in her manner but when she had slowly mounted the stairs and lighted the gas in the bedroom the sight of her sisters clothes cast over the chairs was proof that lise had already donned her evening finery and departed the room was filled with the stale smell of clothes which janet detested she flung open the windows she took off her hat and swiftly tidied herself yet the relief she felt at lises absence was modified by a sudden vehement protest against sordidness why should she not live by herself amidst clean and tidy surroundings she had begun to earn enough and somehow a vista had been opened upa vista whose end she could not see alluring enticing in the diningroom by the cleared table her father was reading the banner her mother appeared in the kitchen door  what in the world happened to you janet she exclaimed  nothing said janet mr ditmar asked me to staythat was all hed been away  i was worried i was going to make your father go down to the mill ive saved you some supper  i dont want much janet told her im not hungry  i guess you have to work too hard in that new place said hannah as she brought in the filled plate from the oven  well it seems to agree with her mother declared edward who could always be counted on to say the wrong thing with the best of intentions i never saw her looking as wellwhy i swan shes getting real pretty  hannah darted at him a glance but restrained herself and janet reddened as she tried to eat the beans placed before her the pork had browned and hardened at the edges the gravy had spread a crust covered the potatoes when her father resumed his reading of the banner and her mother went back into the kitchen she began to speculate rather resentfully and yet excitedly why it was that this adventure with a man with ditmar made her look better feel bettermore alive she was too honest to disguise from herself that it was an adventure a high one fraught with all sorts of possibilities dangers and delights her promotion had been merely incidental both her mother and father did they know the true circumstancesthat mr ditmar desired her was perhaps in love with herwould be disturbed undoubtedly they would have believed that she could take care of herself she knew that matters could not go on as they were that she would either have to leave mr ditmar orand here she baulked at being logical she had no intention of leaving him to remain according to the notions of her parents would be wrong why was it that doing wrong agreed with her energized her made her more alert cleverer keying up her faculties turned life from a dull affair into a momentous one to abandon ditmar would be to slump back into the humdrum into something from which she had magically been emancipated symbolized by the home in which she sat by the redchecked tablecloth the ugly metal lamp the cherry chairs with the frayed seats the horsehair sofa from which the stuffing protruded the tawdry pillow with its colours once gay that lise had bought at a bargain at the bagatelle the wooden clock with the round face and quaint landscape belowthe familys most cherished heirloomthough long familiar was not so bad but the two yellowed engravings on the wall offended her they had been wedding presents to edwards father one represented a stupid german peasant woman holding a baby and standing in front of a thatched cottage its companion was a sylvan scene in which certain wooden rustics were supposed to be enjoying themselves between the two and dotted with flyspecks hung an insurance calendar on which was a huge head of a lady florid fluffyhaired flirtatious lise thought her beautiful  the room was ugly she had long known that but tonight the realization came to her that what she chiefly resented in it was the note it proclaimedthe note of a mute acquiescence without protest or struggle in what life might send it reflected accurately the attitude of her parents particularly of her father with an odd sense of detachment of critical remoteness and contempt she glanced at him as he sat stupidly absorbed in his newspaper his face puckered his lips pursed and ditmar rose before herditmar the embodiment of an indomitableness that refused to be beaten and crushed she thought of the story he had told her how by selfassertion and persistence he had become agent of the chippering mill how he had convinced mr stephen chippering of his ability she could not think of the mill as belonging to the chipperings and the other stockholders but to ditmar who had shaped it into an expression of himself since it was his ideal and now it seemed that he had made it hers also she regretted having repulsed him pushed her plate away from her and rose  you havent eaten anything said hannah who had come into the room where are you going  outto edas janet answered  its late hannah objected but janet departed instead of going to edas she walked alone seeking the quieter streets that her thoughts might flow undisturbed at ten oclock when she returned the light was out in the diningroom her sister had not come in and she began slowly to undress pausing every now and then to sit on the bed and dream once she surprised herself gazing into the glass with a rapt expression that was almost a smile what was it about her that had attracted ditmar no other man had ever noticed it she had never thought herself good looking and nowit was astonishingshe seemed to have changed and she saw with pride that her arms and neck were shapely that her dark hair fell down in a cascade over her white shoulders to her waist she caressed it it was fine when she looked again a radiancy seemed to envelop her she braided her hair slowly in two long plaits looking shyly in the mirror and always seeing that radiancy  suddenly it occurred to her with a shock that she was doing exactly what she had despised lise for doing and leaving the mirror she hurried her toilet put out the light and got into bed for a long time however she remained wakeful turning first on one side and then on the other trying to banish from her mind the episode that had excited her but always it came back again she saw ditmar before her virile vital electric with desire at last she fell asleep  gradually she was awakened by something penetrating her consciousness something insistent pervasive unescapable which in drowsiness she could not define the gas was burning lise had come in and was moving peculiarly about the room janet watched her she stood in front of the bureau just as janet herself had done her hands at her throat at last she let them fall her head turning slowly as though drawn by some irresistible hypnotic power and their eyes met lises were filmed like those of a dog whose head is being stroked expressing a luxuriant dreaminess uncomprehending passionate  say did i wake you she asked i did my best not to make any noisehonest to god  it wasnt the noise that woke me up said janet  it couldnt have been  youve been drinking said janet slowly  lise giggled  whats it to you angel face she inquired quiet down now and go byebye  janet sprang from the bed seized her by the shoulders and shook her she was limp she began to whimper  cut it outleave me go it aint nothing to you what i doi just had a highball  janet released her and drew back  i just had a highballhonest to god  dont say that again whispered janet fiercely  oh very well for gods sake go to bed and leave me alonei can take care of myself i guessi aint nutty enough to hit the booze but i aint like youive got to have a little fun to keep alive  a little fun janet exclaimed the phrase struck her sharply a little fun to keep alive  with that same peculiar cautious movement she had observed lise approached a chair and sank into itjerking her head in the direction of the room where hannah and edward slept  dyou want to wake em up is that your game she asked and began to fumble at her belt overcoming with an effort a disgust amounting to nausea janet approached her sister again little by little undressing her and finally getting her into bed when she immediately fell into a profound slumber janet too got into bed but sleep was impossible the odour lurked like a foul spirit in the darkness mingling with the stagnant damp air that came in at the open window fairly saturating her with horror it seemed the very essence of degradation but as she lay on the edge of the bed shrinking from contamination in the throes of excitement inspired by an unnamed fear she grew hot she could feel and almost hear the pounding of her heart she rose felt around in the clammy darkness for her wrapper and slippers gained the door crept through the dark hall to the diningroom where she stealthily lit the lamp darkness had become a terror a cockroach scurried across the linoleum the room was warm and close it reeked with the smell of stale food but at least she found relief from that other odour she sank down on the sofa  her sister was drunk that in itself was terrible enough yet it was not the drunkenness alone that had sickened janet but the suggestion of something else where had lise been in whose company had she become drunk of late in contrast to a former communicativeness lise had been singularly secretive as to her companions and the manner in which her evenings were spent and she janet had grown too selfabsorbed to be curious lise with her shopgirls cynical knowledge of life and its pitfalls and the high valuation at which she held her charms had seemed secure from danger but janet recalled her discouragement her threat to leave the bagatelle since then there had been something furtive about her now because that odour of alcohol lise exhaled had destroyed in janet the sense of exhilaration of life on a higher plane she had begun to feel and filled her with degradation she hated lise felt for her sister no strain of pity a proof had she recognized it that immorality is not a matter of laws and decrees but of individual emotions a few hours before she had seen nothing wrong in her relationship with ditmar now she beheld him selfish ruthless pursuing her for one end his own gratification as a man he had become an enemy ditmar was like all other men who exploited her sex without compunction but the thought that she was like lise asleep in a drunken stupor that their cases differed only in degree was insupportable  at last she fell asleep from sheer weariness to dream she was with ditmar at some place in the country under spreading trees silliston perhapssilliston common cleverly disguised nor was she quite sure always that the man was ditmar he had a way of changing of resembling the man she had met in silliston whom she had mistaken for a carpenter he was pleading with her in his voice was the peculiar vibrancy that thrilled her that summoned some answering thing out of the depths of her and she felt herself yielding with a strange ecstasy in which were mingled joy and terror the terror was conquering the joy and suddenly he stood transformed before her eyes caricatured become a shrieking monster from whom she sought in agony to escape in this paralysis of fear she awoke staring with wide eyes at the flickering flame of the lamp to a world filled with excruciating soundthe siren of the chippering mill she lay trembling with the horror of the dreamspell upon her still more than half convinced that the siren was ditmars voice his true expression he was waiting to devour her would the sound never end  then remembering where she was alarmed lest her mother might come in and find her there she left the sofa turned out the sputtering lamp and ran into the bedroom rain was splashing on the bricks of the passageway outside the shadows of the night still lurked in the corners by the grey light she gazed at lise who breathed loudly and stirred uneasily her mouth open her lips parched janet touched her  liseget up she said its time to get up she shook her  leave me alonecant you  its time to get up the whistle has sounded  lise heavily opened her eyes they were bloodshot  i dont want to get up i wont get up  but you must insisted janet tightening her hold youve got toyouve got to eat breakfast and go to work  i dont want any breakfast i aint going to work any more  a gust of wind blew inward the cheap lace curtains and the physical effect of it emphasized the chill that struck janets heart she got up and closed the window lit the gas and returning to the bed shook lise again  listen she said if you dont get up ill tell mother what happened last night  say you wouldnt exclaimed lise angrily  get up janet commanded and watched her rather anxiously uncertain as to the after effects of drunkenness but lise got up she sat on the edge of the bed and yawned putting her hand to her forehead  ive sure got a head on me she remarked  janet was silent angrier than ever shocked that tragedy degradation could be accepted thus circumstantially lise proceeded to put up her hair she seemed to be mistress of herself only tired gaping frequently once she remarkedi dont see the good of getting nutty over a highball  seeing that janet was not to be led into controversy she grew morose  breakfast in fillmore street never a lively meal was more dismal than usual that morning eaten to the accompaniment of slopping water from the roofs on the pavement of the passage the indisposition of lise passed unobserved by both hannah and edward and at twenty minutes to eight the two girls with rubbers and umbrellas left the house together though it was janets custom to depart earlier since she had farther to go lise suspicious maintained an obstinate silence keeping close to the curb they reached the corner by the provision shop with the pink and orange chromos of jellies in the window  lise has anything happened to you demanded janet suddenly i want you to tell me  anything happenedwhat do you mean anything happened  you know very well what i mean  well suppose something has happened lises reply was pert defiant whats it to you if anythings happened its happened to mehasnt it  janet approached her  what are you trying to do said lise push me into the gutter  i guess youre there already said janet  lise was roused to a sudden pitch of fury she turned on janet and thrust her back  well if i am whos going to blame me she cried if you had to work all day in that hole standing on your feet picked on by yaps for six a week i guess you wouldnt talk virtuous either its easy for you to shoot off your mouth youve got a soft snap with ditmar  janet was outraged she could not restrain her anger  how dare you say that she demanded  lise was cowed  well you drove me to ityou make me mad enough to say anything just because i went to grubers with neva lorrie and a couple of gentlementhey were gentlemen all right as much gentlemen as ditmaryou come at me and tell me im all to the bad she began to sob im as straight as you are how was i to know the highball was stiff maybe i was tiredanyhow it put me on the queer and everything in the joint began to tango round meand neva came home with me  janet felt a surge of relief in which were mingled anxiety and resentment relief because she was convinced that lise was telling the truth anxiety because she feared for lises future resentment because ditmar had been mentioned still what she had feared most had not come to pass lise left her abruptly darting down a street that led to a back entrance of the bagatelle and janet pursued her way where she wondered would it all end lise had escaped so far but drunkenness was an ominous sign and gentlemen what kind of gentlemen had taken her sister to grubers would ditmar do that sort of thing if he had a chance  the pavement in front of the company boardinghouses by the canal was plastered with sodden leaves whipped from the maples by the driving rain in the night the sky above the mills was sepia white lights were burning in the loom rooms when she reached the vestibule simmons the watchman informed her that mr ditmar had already been there and left for boston  janet did not like to acknowledge to herself her disappointment on learning that ditmar had gone to boston she knew he had had no such intention the night before an accumulated mail and many matters demanding decisions were awaiting him and his sudden departure seemed an act directed personally against her in the nature of a retaliation since she had offended and repulsed him through lises degrading act she had arrived at the conclusion that all adventure and consequent suffering had to do with mana conviction peculiarly maddening to such temperaments as janets therefore she interpreted her suffering in terms of ditmar she had looked forward to tormenting him again and by departing he had deliberately balked and cheated her the rain fell ceaselessly out of black skies night seemed ever ready to descend on the river a darknessaccording to young mr caldwelldue not to the clouds alone but to forest fires many hundreds of miles away in canada as the day wore on however her anger gradually gave place to an extreme weariness and depression and yet she dreaded going home inventing things for herself to do arranging and rearranging ditmars papers that he might have less trouble in sorting them putting those uppermost which she thought he would deem the most important perhaps he would come in late in a world of impending chaos the brilliantly lighted office was a tiny refuge to which she clung at last she put on her coat and rubbers faring forth reluctantly into the wet  at first when she entered the bedroom she thought it empty though the gas was burning and them she saw lise lying face downward on the bed for a moment she stood still then closed the door softly  lise she said  what  janet sat down on the bed putting out her hand unconsciously she began to stroke lises hand and presently it turned and tightened on her own  lise she said i understand why you she could not bring herself to pronounce the words got drunki understand why you did it i oughtnt to have talked to you that way but it was terrible to wake up and see you  for awhile lise did not reply then she raised herself feeling her hair with an involuntary gesture regarding her sister with a bewildered look her face puckered her eyes burned and under them were black shadows  how do you meanyou understand she asked slowly you never hit the booze  even lises language which ordinarily offended her failed to change her sudden impassioned and repentant mood she was astonished at herself for this sudden softening since she did not really love lise and all day she had hated her wished never to see her again  no but i can understand how it would be to want to janet said lise i guess were searchingboth of us for something well never find  lise stared at her with a contracted puzzled expression as of a person awaking from sleep all of whose faculties are being strained toward comprehension  what do you mean she demanded you and me youre all rightyouve got no kick coming  life is hard its hard on girls like uswe want things we cant have janet was at a loss to express herself   well it aint any pipe dream lise agreed her glance turned involuntarily toward the picture of the olympian dinner party pinned on the wall swells have a good time she added  maybe they pay for it too said janet  i wouldnt holler about payingits paying and not getting the goods declared lise  youll pay and you wont get it that kind of life ishell janet cried  selfcentered as lise was absorbed in her own trouble and present physical discomfort this unaccustomed word from her sister and the vehemence with which it was spoken surprised and frightened her brought home to her some hint of the terror in janets soul  me for the water wagon she said  janet was not convinced she had hoped to discover the identity of the man who had taken lise to grubers but she did not attempt to continue the conversation she rose and took off her hat  why dont you go to bed she asked ill tell mother you have a headache and bring in your supper  well i dont care if i do replied lise gratefully  perhaps the most disconcerting characteristic of that complex affair the human organism is the lack of continuity of its moods the soul so called is as sensitive to physical conditions as a barometer affected by lack of sleep by smells and sounds by food by the weatherwhether a day be sapphire or obsidian and the resolutions arising from one mood are thwarted by the actions of the next janet had observed this phenomenon and sometimes when it troubled her she thought herself the most inconsistent and vacillating of creatures she had resolved far instance before she fell asleep to leave the chippering mill to banish ditmar from her life to get a position in boston whence she could send some of her wages home and in the morning as she made her way to the office the determination gave her a sense of peace and unity but the northwest wind was blowing it had chased away the mist and the clouds the smoke from canada the sun shone with a high brilliancy the elms of the common cast sharp black shadowpatterns on the pavements and when she reached the office and looked out of his window she saw the blue river covered with quicksilver waves chasing one another across the current ditmar had not yet returned to hampton about ten oclock as she was copying out some figures for mr price young mr caldwell approached her he had a boston newspaper in his hand  have you seen this article about mr ditmar he asked  about mr ditmar no  its quite a sendoff for the colonel said caldwell who was wont at times to use the title facetiously listen one of the most notable figures in the textile industry of the united states claude ditmar agent of the chippering mill caldwell spread out the page and pointed to a picture there he is as large as life  a little larger than life janet thought ditmar was one of those men who as the expression goes take well a valuable asset in semipublic careers and as he stood in the sunlight on the steps of the building where they had snapshotted him he appeared even more massive forceful and preponderant than she had known him beholding him thus set forth and praised in a public print he seemed suddenly to have been distantly removed from her to have reacquired at a bound the dizzy importance he had possessed for her before she became his stenographer she found it impossible to realize that this was the ditmar who had pursued and desired her at times supplicating apologetic abject and again revealed by the light in his eyes and the trembling of his hand as the sinister and ruthless predatory male from whomsince the revelation in her sister lise she had determined to flee and whom she had persuaded herself she despised he was a bigger man than she had thought and as she read rapidly down the column the fascination that crept over her was mingled with disquieting doubt of her own powers it was now difficult to believe she had dominated or could ever dominate this selfsufficient successful person the list of whose achievements and qualities was so alluringly set forth by an interviewer who himself had fallen a victim  the article carried the implication that the modern practical american business man was the highest type as yet evolved by civilization and ditmar referred to as a wizard of the textile industry was emphatically one who had earned the gratitude of the grand old commonwealth by the efforts of such sons she continued to maintain her commanding position among her sister states prominent among the qualities contributing to his success was openmindedness a willingness to be shown to scrap machinery when his competitors still clung to older methods the chippering mill had never had a serious strikeindication of an ability to deal with labour and mr ditmars views on labour followed if his people had a grievance let them come to him and settle it between them no unions he had consistently refused to recognize them there was mention of the bradlaugh order as being the largest commission ever given to a single mill a reference to the excitement and speculation it had aroused in trade circles claude ditmars ability to put it through was unquestioned one had only to look at himtenacity forcefulness executiveness were written all over him in addition the article contained much material of an autobiographical nature that mustjanet thoughthave been supplied by ditmar himself whose modesty had evidently shrunk from the cruder selfeulogy of an interview but she recognized several characteristic phrases  caldwell watching her as she read was suddenly fascinated during a trip abroad while still an undergraduate he had once seen the face of an actress a really good parisian actress light up in that way and it had revealed to him in a flash the meaning of enthusiasm now janet became vivid for him there must be something unusual in a person whose feelings could be so intense whose emotions rang so true he was not unsophisticated he had sometimes wondered why ditmar had promoted her though acknowledging her ability he admired ditmar but had no illusions about him harvard and birth in a social stratum where emphasis is superfluous enabled him to smile at the reporters exuberance and he was the more drawn toward her to see on janets flushed face the hint of a smile as she looked up at him when she had finished  the colonel hypnotized that reporter he said as he took the paper and her laugh despite its little tremor betrayed in her an unsuspected humorous sense of proportion well ill take off my hat to him caldwell went on he is a wonder hes got the mill right up to capacity in a week hes agreed to deliver those goods to the bradlaughs by the first of april you know and holster of the clarendon swears it cant be done he says ditmars crazy well i stand to lose twentyfive dollars on him  this loyalty pleased janet it had the strange effect of reviving loyalty in her she liked this evidence of dick caldwells confidence he was a selfcontained and industrious young man with crisp curly hair cordial and friendly yet never intimate with the other employer liked by thembut it was tacitly understood his footing differed from theirs he was a cousin of the chipperings and destined for rapid promotion he went away every saturday it was known that he spent sundays and holidays in delightful places to return reddened and tanned and though he never spoke about these excursions and put on no airs of superiority there was that in his manner and even in the cut of his wellworn suits proclaiming him as belonging to a sphere not theirs to a category of fortunate beings whose stumbles are not fatal who are sustained from above even ditmar was not of these  ive just been showing a lot of highbrows through the mill he told janet they asked questions enough to swamp a professor of economics  and janet was suddenly impelled to askwill you take me through sometime mr caldwell  youve never been through he exclaimed why well go now if you can spare the time  her face had become scarlet  dont tell mr ditmar she begged you seehe wanted to take me himself  not a word caldwell promised as they left the office together and went downstairs to the strong iron doors that led to the cotton department the showing through of occasional visitors had grown rather tiresome but now his curiosity and interest were aroused he was conscious of a keen stimulation when he glanced at janets face its illumination perplexed him the effect was that of a picture obscurely hung and hitherto scarcely noticed on which the light had suddenly been turned it glowed with a strange and disturbing radiance  as for janet she was as one brought suddenly to the realization of a miracle in whose presence she had lived for many years and never before suspected the miracle of machinery of the triumph of man over nature in the brief space of an hour she beheld the dirty bales flung off the freight cars on the sidings transformed into delicate fabrics wound from the looms cotton that only last summer perhaps while she sat typewriting at her window had been growing in the fields of the south she had seen it torn by the balebreakers blown into the openers loosened cleansed and dried taken up by the lappers pressed into batting and passed on to the carding machines to emerge like a wisp of white smoke in a sliver and coil automatically in a can once more it was flattened into a lap given to a comber that felt out its fibres removing with superhuman precision those for the finer fabric too short thrusting it forth again in another filmy sliver ready for the drawing frames six of these gossamer ropes were taken up and again six then came the blubbers and the roving frames twisting and winding the while maintaining the most delicate of tensions lest the rope break running the strands together into a thread constantly growing stronger and finer until it was ready for spinning  caldwell stood close to her shouting his explanations in her ear while she strained to follow them but she was bewildered and entranced by the marvellous swiftness accuracy and ease with which each of the complex machines fed by human hands performed its function these human hands were swift too as when they thrust the bobbins of roving on the ringspinning frames to be twisted into yarn she saw a woman in the space of an instant mend a broken thread women and boys were here doffer boys to lift off the full bobbins of yarn with one hand and set on the empty bobbins with the other while skilled workmen alert for the first sign of trouble followed up and down in its travels the long frame of the mulespinner after the spinning the heavy spools of yarn were carried to a beamwarper standing alone like a huge spiders web where hundreds of threads were stretched symmetrically and wound evenly side by side on a large cylinder forming the warp of the fabric to be woven on the loom first however this warp must be stiffened or slashed in starch and tallow dried over heated drums and finally wound around one great beam from which the multitude of threads are taken up one by one and slipped through the eyes of the loom harnesses by women who sit all day under the north windows overlooking the canalthe drawersin of whom ditmar had spoken then the harnesses are put on the loom the threads attached to the cylinder on which the cloth is to be wound the looms absorbed and fascinated janet above all else it seemed as if she would never tire of watching the rhythmic rise and fall of the harnesseseach rapid movement making a v in the warp within the angle of which the tiny shuttles darted to and fro to and fro carrying the thread that filled the cloth with a swiftness so great the eye could scarcely follow it to be caught on the other side when the angle closed and flung back and back again and in the elaborate patterns not one but several harnesses were used each awaiting its turn for the impulse bidding it rise and fall abruptly as she gazed one of the machines halted a weaver hurried up searched the warp for the broken thread tied it and started the loom again  thats intelligent of it said caldwell in her ear but she could only nod in reply  the noise in the weaving rooms was deafening the heat oppressive she began to wonder how these men and women boys and girls bore the strain all day long she had never thought much about them before save to compare vaguely their drudgery with that from which now she had been emancipated but she began to feel a new respect a new concern a new curiosity and interest as she watched them passing from place to place with indifference between the whirling belts up and down the narrow aisles flanked on either side by that bewildering clattering machinery whose polished surfaces continually caught and flung back the light of the electric bulbs on the ceiling how was it possible to live for hours at a time in this bedlam without losing presence of mind and thrusting hand or body in the wrong place or becoming deaf she had never before realized what mill work meant though she had read of the accidents but these peopleeven the childrenseemed oblivious to the din and the danger intent on their tasks unconscious of the presence of a visitor save occasionally when she caught a swift glance from a woman or girl a glance perhaps of envy or even of hostility the dark foreign faces glowed and instantly grew dull again and then she was aware of lurking terrors despite her exaltation her sense now of belonging to another world a world somehow associated with ditmar was it not he who had lifted her farther above all this was it not by grace of her association with him she was there a spectator of the toil beneath yet the terror persisted she presently would step out of the noise the oppressive moist heat of the drawing and spinning rooms the constant remorseless menace of whirling wheels and cogs and belts but they she drew closer to caldwells side  i never knew she said it must be hard to work here  he smiled at her reassuringly  oh they dont mind it he replied its like a health resort compared to the conditions most of them live in at home why theres plenty of ventilation here and youve got to have a certain amount of heat and moisture because when cotton is cold and dry it cant be drawn or spin and when its hot and dry the electricity is troublesome if you think this moisture is bad you ought to see a mill with the old vapourpot system with the steam shooting out into the room look here he led janet to the apparatus in which the pure air is forced through wet cloths removing the dust explaining how the ventilation and humidity were regulated automatically how the temperature of the room was controlled by a thermostat  there isnt an agent in the country whos more concerned about the welfare of his operatives than mr ditmar hes made a study of it hes spent thousands of dollars and as soon as these machines became practical he put em in the other day when i was going through the room one of these shuttles flew off as they sometimes do when the looms are running at high speed a woman was pretty badly hurt ditmar came right down  he really cares about them said janet she liked caldwells praise of ditmar yet she spoke a little doubtfully  of course he cares but its common sense to make em as comfortable and happy as possibleisnt it he wont stand for being held up and hed be stiff enough if it came to a strike i dont blame him for that do you  janet was wondering how ruthless ditmar could be if his will were crossed they had left the room with its noise and heat behind them and were descending the worn oaken treads of the spiral stairway of a neighbouring tower janet shivered a little and her face seemed almost feverish as she turned to caldwell and thanked him  oh it was a pleasure miss bumpus he declared and sometime when you want to see the print works or the worsted department let me knowim your man andi wont mention it  she did not answer as they made their way back to the office he glanced at her covertly astonished at the emotional effect in her their tour had produced though not of an inflammable temperament he himself was stirred and it was she who unaccountably had stirred him suggested in these processes he saw every day and in which he was indeed interested something deeper more significant and human than he had guessed and which he was unable to define  janet herself did not know why this intimate view of the mills of the people who worked in them had so greatly moved her all day she thought of them and the distant throb of the machinery she felt when her typewriter was silent meant something to her nowshe could not say what when she found herself listening for it her heart beat faster she had lived and worked beside it and it had not existed for her it had had no meaning the mills might have been empty she had indeed many many times seen these men and women boys and girls trooping away from work she had strolled through the quarters in which they lived speculated on the lands from which they had come but she had never really thought of them as human beings individuals with problems and joys and sorrows and hopes and fears like her own some such discovery was borne in upon her and always an essential function of this revelation looming larger than ever in her consciousness was ditmar it was for ditmar they toiled in ditmars hands were their very existences his was the stupendous responsibility and power  as the afternoon wore desire to see these toilers once more took possession of her from the white cupola perched above the huge mass of the clarendon mill across the water sounded the single stroke of a bell and suddenly the air was pulsing with sounds flung back and forth by the walls lining the river seizing her hat and coat she ran down the stairs and through the vestibule and along the track by the canal to the great gates which her father was in the act of unbarring she took a stand beside him by the gatehouse edward showed a mild surprise  there aint anything troubling youis there janet he asked  she shook her head  i wanted to see the hands come out she said  sometimes as at present he found janets whims unaccountable  well i should have presumed youd know what they look like by this time youd better stay right close to me theyre a rough lot with no respect or consideration for decent folksthese foreigners i never could see why the government lets em all come over here he put on the word foreigners an emphasis of contempt and indignation pathetic because of its peculiar note of futility janet paid no attention to him her ears were strained to catch the rumble of feet descending the tower stairs her eyes to see the vanguard as it came from the doorwaythe first tricklings of a flood that instantly filled the yard and swept onward and outward irresistibly through the narrow gorge of the gates impossible to realize this as the force which when distributed over the great spaces of the mills performed an orderly and useful task for it was now a turbid and lawless torrent unconscious of its swollen powers menacing breathlessly exciting to behold it seemed to janet indeed a torrent as she clung to the side of the gatehouse as one might cling to the steep bank of a mountain brook after a cloudburst and suddenly she had plunged into it the desire was absurd perhaps but not to be deniedthe desire to mix with it feel it be submerged and swept away by it losing all sense of identity she heard her father call after her faintlythe thought crossed her mind that his appeals were always faintand then she was being carried along the canal eastward the pressure relaxing somewhat when the draining of the side streets began  she remembered oddly the stanley street bridge where the many streams met and mingled streams from the arundel the patuxent the arlington and the clarendon and eager to prolong and intensify her sensations hurried thither reaching it at last and thrusting her way outward until she had gained the middle where she stood grasping the rail the great structure was atremble from the assault its footpaths and its roadway overrun with workers dodging between trolleys and truckssome darting nimbly dinner pails in hand along the steel girders doffer boys romped and whistled young girls in jaunty faber street clothes and flowered hats linked to one another for protection chewed gum and joked but for the most part these workers were silent the apathy of their faces making a strange contrast with the hurry hurry of their feet and set intentness of their bodies as they sped homeward to the tenements and the clothes of these were drab save when the occasional colour of a hooded peasants shawl like the slightly faded tints of an old master lit up a group of women here going home to their children were italian mothers bred through centuries to endurance and patience sallow jewesses gaunt bearded jews with shadowy halfclosed eyes and wrinkled brows broadfaced lithuanians flatheaded russians swarthy italian men and pale blond germans mingled with muddy syrians and nondescript canadians and suddenly the bridge was empty the army vanished as swiftly as it came  janet turned through the haze of smoke she saw the sun drop like a ball of fire cooled to redness whose course is spent the delicate lines of the upper bridge were drawn in sepia against crimsongilt for an instant the cupola of the clarendon became jasper and far far above floated in the azure a cloud of pink jewellers cotton even as she strove to fix these colours in her mind they vanished the western sky faded to magenta to purplemauve the corridor of the river darkened on either side pale lights sparkled from the windows of the mills while down the deepened blue of the waters came floating iridescent suds from the washing of the wools it was given to her to know that which an artist of living memory has called the incommunicable thrill of things     chapter viii  the aftereffects of this experience of janets were not what ordinarily are called spiritual though we may some day arrive at a saner meaning of the term include within it the impulses and needs of the entire organism it left her with a renewed sense of energy and restlessness brought her nearer to high discoveries of mysterious joys which a voice out of the past called upon her to forego a voice somehow identified with her father it was faint ineffectual in obeying it would she not lose all life had to give when she came in to supper her father was concerned about her because instead of walking home with him she had left him without explanation to plunge into the crowd of workers her evident state of excitement had worried him her caprice was beyond his comprehension and how could she explain the motives that led to it she was sure he had never felt like that and as she evaded his questions the something within her demanding life and expression grew stronger and more rebellious more contemptuous of the fearprecepts congenial to a nature timorous and less vitalized  after supper unable to sit still she went out and filled with the spirit of adventure hurried toward faber street which was already thronging with people it was bright here and gay the shops glittered and she wandered from window to window until she found herself staring at a suit of blue cloth hung on a form beneath which was a card that read marked down to 20 and suddenly the suggestion flashed into her mind why shouldnt she buy it she had the money she needed a new suit for the winter the one she possessed was getting shabbybut behind the excuse of necessity was the real reason triumphantly proclaiming itselfshe would look pretty in it she would be transformed she would be buying a new character to which she would have to live up the old janet would be cast off with the old raiment the new suit would announce to herself and to the world a janet in whom were released all those longings hitherto disguised and suppressed and now become insupportable this was what the purchase meant a change of existence as complete as that between the moth and the butterfly and the realization of this fact of the audacity she was resolved to commit made her hot as she gazed at the suit it was modest enough yet it had a certain distinction of cut it looked expensive twenty dollars was not cheap to be sure but as the placard announced it had the air of being much more costlyeven more costly than thirty dollars which seemed fabulous though she strove to remain outwardly calm her heart beat rapidly as she entered the store and asked for the costume and was somewhat reassured by the comportment of the saleswoman who did not appear to think the request preposterous to regard her as a spendthrift and a profligate she took down the suit from the form and led janet to a cabinet in the back of the shop where it was tried on  its worth every bit of thirty dollars she heard the woman say but weve had it here for some time and its no use for our trade you cant sell anything like that in hampton theres no taste here its too good it aint showy enough my it fits you like it was made for you and its just your styleand you can see it wants a lady to wear it your old suit is too tighti guess youve filled out some since you bought it  she turned janet around and around patting the skirt here and there and then stood off a little way with clasped hands her expression almost rapturous janets breath came fast as she gazed into the mirror and buttoned up the coat was the womans admiration cleverly feigned this image she beheld an illusion or did she really look different distinguished and if not beautifulalluring she had had a momentary apprehension almost sickening that she would be too conspicuous but the saleswoman had anticipated that objection with the magical word lady  ill take it she announced  well you couldnt have done better if youd gone to boston declared the woman its one chance in a thousand will you wear it  yes said janet faintly just put my old suit in a box and ill call for it in an hour  the womans sympathetic smile followed her as she left the shop she had an instant of hesitation of an almost panicky desire to go back and repair her folly ere it was too late why had she taken her money with her that evening if not with some deliberate though undefined purpose but she was ashamed to face the saleswoman again and her elation was not to be repressedan elation optically presented by a huge electric sign on the farther side of the street that flashed through all the colours of the spectrum surrounded by running fire like the running fire in her soul deliciously selfconscious her gaze fixed ahead she pressed through the wednesday night crowds young mill men and women in their best clothes housewives and fathers of families with children and bundles in front of the banner office a group blocked the pavement staring up at the news bulletin which she paused to read five millionaire directors indicted in new york state treasurer accused of graft murdock fortune contested by heirs the phrases seemed meaningless and she hurried on again she was being noticed a man looked at her twice the first glance accidental the second arresting appealing subtly flattering agitatingshe was sure he had turned and was following her she hastened her steps it was wicked what she was doing but she gloried in it and even the sight in burning red letters of grubers cafe failed to bring on a revulsion by its association with her sister lise the fact that lise had got drunk there meant nothing to her now she gazed curiously at the illuminated orangecoloured panes separated by curving leads at the design of a harp in green at the sign ladies entrance listened eagerly to the sounds of voices and laughter that came from within she looked cautiously over her shoulder a shadow appeared she heard a voice low insinuating  four blocks farther down she stopped the man was no longer following her she had been almost selfconvinced of an intention to go to edasnot quite of late her conscience had reproached her about eda janet had neglected her she told herself she was afraid of edas uncanny and somewhat nauseating flair for romance and to show eda the new suit though she would relish her friends praise would be the equivalent of announcing an affair of the heart which she janet would have indignantly to deny she was not going to edas she knew now where she was going a prepared but hitherto undisclosed decree of fate had bade her put money in her bag that evening directed her to the shop to buy the dress and would presently impel her to go to west streetnay was even now so impelling her ahead of her were the lights of the chippering mill in her ears was the rhythmic sound of the looms working of nights on the bradlaugh order she reached the canal the white arc above the end of the bridge cast sharp black shadows of the branches of the trees on the granite the thousand windows of the mill shone yellow reflected in the black water twice she started to go twice she paused held by the presage of a coming event a presage that robbed her of complete surprise when she heard footsteps on the bridge saw the figure of a man halting at the crown of the arch to look back at the building he had left his shoulders squared his hand firmly clasping the rail her heart was throbbing with the looms and yet she stood motionless until he turned and came rapidly down the slope of the arch and stopped in front of her under the arc lamp it was almost as bright as day  miss bumpus he exclaimed  mr ditmar she said  were youwere you coming to the office  i was just out walking she told him i thought you were in boston  i came home he informed her somewhat superfluously his eyes never leaving her wandering hungrily from her face to her new suit and back again to her face i got here on the seven oclock train i wanted to see about those new blubbers  they finished setting them up this afternoon she said  how did you know  i asked mr orcutt about iti thought you might telephone  youre a wonder was his comment well weve got a running start on that order and he threw a glance over his shoulder at the mill everything going full speed ahead when we put it through i guess ill have to give you some of the credit  oh i havent done anything she protested  more than you think youve taken so much off my shoulders i couldnt get along without you his voice vibrated reminding her of the voices of those who made sentimental recitations for the graphophone it sounded absurd yet it did not repel her something within her responded to it which way were you going he inquired  home she said  where do you live  in fillmore street and she added with a touch of defiance its a little street three blocks above hawthorne off east street  oh yes he said vaguely as though he had not understood ill come with you as far as the bridgealong the canal ive got so much to say to you  cant you say it tomorrow  no i cant there are so many people in the officeso many interruptions i mean and then you never give me a chance  she stood hesitating a struggle going on within her he had proposed the route along the canal because nobody would be likely to recognize them and her pride resented this on the other hand there was the sweet allurement of the adventure she craved which indeed she had come out to seek and by a strange fatality foundsince he had appeared on the bridge almost as soon as she reached it the sense of fate was strong upon her curiosity urged her and thanks to the eulogy she had read of him that day to the added impression of his power conveyed by the trip through the mills ditmar loomed larger than ever in her consciousness  what do you want to say she asked  oh lots of things  she felt his hand slipping under her arm his fingers pressing gently but firmly into her flesh and the experience of being impelled by a power stronger than herself a masculine power was delicious her arm seemed to burn where he touched her  have i done something to offend you she heard him say or is it because you dont like me  im not sure whether i like you or not she told him i dont like seeing youthis way and why should you want to know me and see me outside of the office im only your stenographer  because youre youbecause youre different from any woman i ever met you dont understand what you areyou dont see yourself  i made up my mind last night i wouldnt stay in your office any longer she informed him  for gods sake why he exclaimed ive been afraid of that dont goi dont know what id do ill be carefuli wont get you talked about  talked about she tore herself away from him why should you get me talked about she cried  he was frightened no no he stammered i didnt mean  what did you mean  wellas you say youre my stenographer but thats no reason why we shouldnt be friends i only meanti wouldnt do anything to make our friendship the subject of gossip  suddenly she began to find a certain amusement in his confusion and penitence she achieved a pleasurable sense of advantage of power over him  why should you want me i dont know anything ive never had any advantagesand you have so much i read an article in the newspaper about you todaymr caldwell gave it to me  did you like it he interrupted naively  well in some places it was rather funny  funny how  oh i dont know she had been quick to grasp in it the journalistic lack of restraint hinted at by caldwell i liked it but i thought it praised you too much it didnt criticize you enough  he laughed in spite of his discomfort he found her candour refreshing from the women to whom he had hitherto made love he had never got anything but flattery  i want you to criticize me he said  but she went on relentlesslywhen i read in that article how successful you were and how youd got everything youd started out to get and how some day you might be treasurer and president of the chippering mill well despairing of giving adequate expression to her meaning she added i didnt see how we could be friends  you wanted me for a friend he interrupted eagerly  i couldnt help knowing you wanted meyouve shown it so plainly but i didnt see how it could be you asked me where i livedin a little flat thats no better than a tenement i suppose you would call it a tenement its dark and ugly it only has four rooms and it smells of cooking you couldnt come theredont you see how impossible it is and you wouldnt care to be talked about yourself either she added vehemently  this defiant sincerity took him aback he groped for words  listen he urged i dont want to do anything you wouldnt like and honestly i dont know what id do if you left me ive come to depend on you and you may not believe it but when i got that bradlaugh order i thought of you i said to myself shell be pleased shell help me to put it over  she thrilled at this she even suffered him for some reason unknown to herself to take her arm again  how could i help you  oh in a thousand waysyou ought to know you do a good deal of thinking for me and you can help me by just being there i cant explain it but i feel somehow that things will go right ive come to depend on you  he was a little surprised to find himself saying these things he had not intended to say and the lighter touch he had always possessed in dealing with the other sex making him the envied of his friends had apparently abandoned him he was appalled at the possibility of losing her  ive never met a woman like you he went on as she remained silent youre differenti dont know what it is about you but you are his voice was low caressing his head was bent down to her his shoulder pressed against her shoulder ive never had a woman friend before ive never wanted one until now  she wondered about his wife  youve got brainsive never met a woman with brains  oh is that why she exclaimed  youre beautiful he whispered its queer but i didnt know it at first youre more beautiful tonight than ive ever seen you  they had come almost to warren street suddenly realizing that they were standing in the light that people were passing to and fro over the end of the bridge she drew away from him once more this time more gently  lets walk back a little way he proposed  i must go homeits late  its only nine oclock  i have an errand to do and theyll expect me good night  just one more turn he pleaded  but she shook her head backing away from him  youll see me tomorrow she told him she didnt know why she said that she hurried along warren street without once looking over her shoulder her feet seemed scarcely to touch the ground the sound of music was in her ears the lights sparkled she had had an adventure at last an adventure that magically had transformed her life she was beautiful no one had ever told her that before and he had said that he needed her she smiled as with an access of tenderness in spite of his experience and power she suddenly felt years older than ditmar she could help him  she was breathless when she reached the shop in faber street  i hope i havent kept you waiting she said  oh no we dont close until ten answered the saleswoman she was seated quietly sewing under the lamp  i wonder whether youd mind if i put on my old suit again and carried this janet asked  the expression of sympathy and understanding in the womans eyes as she rose brought the blood swiftly to janets face she felt that her secret had been guessed the change effected janet went homeward swiftly to encounter on the corner of faber street her sister lise whose attention was immediately attracted by the bundle  what have you got there angel face she demanded  a new suit said janet  you dont tell mewhered you get it at the paris  no at dowlings  say ill bet it was that plain blue thing marked down to twenty  well what if it was  lise when surprised or scornful had a peculiarly irritating way of whistling through her teeth  twenty bucks gee youll be getting your clothes in boston next well as sure as i live when i went by that window the other day when they first knocked it down i said to sadie those are the rags janet would buy if she had the ready have you got another raise out of ditmar  if i have it isnt any business of yours janet retorted ive got a right to do as i please with my own money  oh sure said lise and added darkly i guess ditmar likes to see you look well  after this janet refused obstinately to speak to lise to answer when they reached home her pleadings and complaints to their mother that janet had bought a new suit and refused to exhibit it and finally when they had got to bed janet lay long awake in passionate revolt against this new expression of the sordidness and lack of privacy in which she was forced to live made the more intolerable by the close sultry darkness of the room and the snoring of lise  in the morning however after a groping period of semiconsciousness during the ringing of the bells the siren startled her into awareness and alertness it had not wholly lost its note of terror but the note had somehow become exhilarating an invitation to adventure and to life and lises sarcastic comments as to the probable reasons why she did not put on the new suit had host their power of exasperation janet compromised wearing a blouse of china silk hitherto reserved for best the day was bright and she went rapidly toward the mill glorying in the sunshine and the autumn sharpness of the air and her thoughts were not so much of ditmar as of something beyond him of which he was the medium she was going not to meet him but to meet that when she reached the office she felt weak her fingers trembled as she took off her hat and jacket and began to sort out the mail and she had to calm herself with the assurance that her relationship with ditmar had undergone no change she had merely met him by the canal and he had talked to her that was all he had of course taken her arm it tingled when she remembered it but when he suddenly entered the room her heart gave a bound he closed the door he took off his hat and stood gazing at herwhile she continued arranging letters presently she was forced to glance at him his bearing his look his confident smile all proclaimed that he at least believed things to be changed he glowed with health and vigour with an aggressiveness from which she shrank yet found delicious  how are you this morning he said at lastthis morning as distinguished from all other mornings  im well as usual she answered she herself was sometimes surprised by her ability to remain outwardly calm  why did you run away from me last night  i didnt run away i had to go home she said still arranging the letters  we could have had a little walk i dont believe you had to go home at all you just wanted an excuse to get away from me  i didnt need an excuse she told him he moved toward her but she took a paper from the desk and carried it to a file across the room  i thought we were going to be friends he said  being friends doesnt mean being foolish she retorted and mr orcutts waiting to see you  let him wait  he sat down at his desk but his blood was warm and he read the typewritten words of the topmost letter of the pile without so much as grasping the meaning of them from time to time he glanced up at janet as she flitted about the room by george she was more desirable than he had ever dared to imagine he felt temporarily balked but hopeful on his way to the mill he had dwelt with epicurean indulgence on this sight of her and he had not been disappointed he had also thought that he might venture upon more than the mere feasting of his eyes yet found an inspiring alleviation in the fact that she by no means absolutely repulsed him her attitude toward him had undergone a subtle transformation there could be no doubt of that she was almost coquettish his eyes lingered the china silk blouse was slightly open at the neck suggesting the fullness of her throat it clung to the outline of her shoulders overcome by an impulse he could not control he got up and went toward her but she avoided him  ill tell mr orcutt youve come she said rather breathlessly as she reached the door and opened it ditmar halted in his steps at the sight of the tall spectacled figure of the superintendent on the threshold  orcutt hesitated looking from one to the other  ive been waiting for you he said after a moment the rest of that lot didnt come in this morning ive telephoned to the freight agent  ditmar stared at him uncomprehendingly orcutt repeated the information  oh well keep after him get him to trace them  im doing that replied the conscientious orcutt  hows everything else going ditmar demanded with unlookedfor geniality you mustnt take things too hard orcutt dont wear yourself out  mr orcutt was relieved he had expected an outburst of the exasperation that lately had characterized his superior they began to chat janet had escaped  miss bumpus told me you wanted to see me i was just going to ring you up ditmar informed him  shes a clever young woman seems to take such an interest in things orcutt observed and shes always on the job only yesterday i saw her going through the mill with young caldwell  ditmar dropped the paperweight he held  oh she went through did she  after orcutt departed he sat for awhile whistling a tune from a popular musical play keeping time by drumming with his fingers on the desk  that mr semple the mill treasurer came down from boston that morning to confer with ditmar was for janet in the nature of a reprieve she sat by her window and as her fingers flew over the typewriter keys she was swept by surges of heat in which ecstasy and shame and terror were strangely commingled a voice within her said this cant go on this cant go on its too terrible everyone in the office will notice itthere will be a scandal i ought to go away while there is yet timetoday though the instinct of flight was strong within her she was filled with rebellion at the thought of leaving when adventure was flooding her drab world with light even as the mill across the waters was transfigured by the heavy golden wash of the autumn sun she had made at length the discovery that adventure had to do with man was inconceivable without him  racked by these conflicting impulses of selfpreservation on the one hand and what seemed selfrealization on the other she started when toward the middle of the afternoon she heard ditmars voice summoning her to take his letters and went palpitating leaving the door open behind her seating herself on the far side of the desk her head bent over her book her neck where her hair grew in wisps behind her ear seemed to burn ditmars glance was focussed there her hands were cold as she wrote then like a deliverer she saw young caldwell coming in from the outer office holding a card in his hand which he gave to ditmar who sat staring at it  siddons he said whos siddons  janet who had risen spoke up  why hes been making the hampton survey you wrote him youd see himdont you remember mr ditmar  dont go exclaimed ditmar you cant tell what those confounded reformers will accuse you of if you dont have a witness  janet sat down again the sharpness of ditmars tone was an exhilarating reminder of the fact that in dealing with strangers he had come more or less to rely on her instinctive judgment while the implied appeal of his manner on such occasions emphasized the pleasurable sense of his dependence of her own usefulness besides she had been curious about the survey at the time it was first mentioned she wished to hear ditmars views concerning it mr siddons proved to be a small and sallow young man with a pointed nose and bright bulbous brown eyes like a chipmunks indeed he reminded one of a chipmunk as he whisked himself in and seized ditmars hand he gave a confused impression of polite selfeffacement as well as of dignity and selfassertion he had the air of one who expects opposition and though by no means desiring it is prepared to deal with it janet smiled she had a sudden impulse to drop the heavy book that lay on the corner of the desk to see if he would jump  how do you do mr ditmar he said ive been hoping to have this pleasure  my secretary miss bumpus said ditmar  mr siddons quivered and bowed ditmar sinking ponderously into his chair seemed suddenly ironically amused grinning at janet as he opened a drawer of his desk and offered the visitor a cigar  thanks i dont smoke said mr siddons  ditmar lit one for himself  now what can i do for you he asked  well as i wrote you in my letter i was engaged to make as thorough an examination as possible of the living conditions and housing of the operatives in the city of hampton im sure youd be interested in hearing something of the situation we found  i suppose youve been through our mills said ditmar  no the fact is  you ought to go through i think it might interest you ditmar put a slight emphasis on the pronoun we rather pride ourselves on making things comfortable and healthy for our people  ive no doubt of itin fact ive been so informed its because of your concern for the welfare of your workers in the mills that i ventured to come and talk to you of how most of them live when theyre at home replied siddons as janet thought rather neatly perhaps though living in hampton you dont quite realize what the conditions are i know a man who has lived in boston ten years and who hasnt ever seen the bunker hill monument  the bunker hill monuments a public affair retorted ditmar anybody can go there who has enough curiosity and interest but i dont see how you can expect me to follow these people home and make them clean up their garbage and wash their babies i shouldnt want anybody to interfere with my private affairs  but when you get to a point where private affairs become a public menace siddons objected mr ditmar ive seen block after block of tenements ready to crumble there are no provisions for foundations thickness of walls size of timbers and columns and if these houses had been deliberately erected to make a bonfire they couldnt have answered the purpose better if it were not for the danger to life and the pity of making thousands of families homeless a conflagration would be a blessing although i believe the entire north or south side of the city would go under certain conditions the best thing you could do would be to burn whole rows of these tenements they are ideal breeding grounds for disease in the older sections of the city youve got hundreds of rear houses here houses moved back on the lots in some extreme cases with only fourfoot courts littered with refusehouses without light without ventilation and many of the rooms where these people are cooking and eating and sleeping are so damp and foul theyre not fit to put dogs in youve got some blocks with a density of over five hundred to the acre and your average density is considerably over a hundred  are things any worse than in any other manufacturing city asked ditmar  that isnt the point said siddons the point is that theyre bad theyre dangerous theyre inhuman if you could go into these tenements as i have done and see the way some of these people live it would make you sick the poles and lithuanians and italians especially you wouldnt treat cattle that way in some households of five rooms including the kitchen i found as many as fourteen fifteen and once seventeen people living youve got an alarming infant deathrate  isnt it because these people want to live that way ditmar inquired they actually like it they wouldnt be happy in anything but a pigstythey had em in europe and what do you expect us to do buy land and build flats for them inside of a month theyd have all the woodwork stripped off for kindling the drainage stopped up the bathtubs filled with ashes i know because its been tried  tilted back in his chair he blew a cloud of smoke toward the ceiling and his eyes sought janets she avoided them resenting a little the assumption of approval she read in them her mind sensitive to new ideas had been keenly stimulated as she listened to siddons who began patiently to dwell once more on the ill effect of the conditions he had discovered on the welfare of the entire community she had never thought of this she was surprised that ditmar should seem to belittle it siddons was a new type in her experience she could understand and to a certain extent maliciously enjoy ditmars growing exasperation with him he had a formal precise manner of talking as though he spent most of his time presenting cases in committees and in warding off ditmars objections he was forever indulging in such maddening phrases as before we come to that let me say a word just here ditmar hated words his outbursts his efforts to stop the flow of them were not unlike the futile charges of a large and powerful animal harassed by a smaller and more agile one with nimble politeness with an exasperating air of deference to ditmars opinions mr siddons gave ground only to return to the charge yet despite a manner and method which when contrasted to ditmars verged on the ludicrous mr siddons had a force and fire of his own nervous almost fanatical when he dwelt on the misery he had seen and his voice trembled from the intensity of his feeling janet began to be moved it was odd considering the struggle for existence of her own family that these foreigners had remained outside the range of her sympathy  i guess youll find ditmar had interrupted peremptorily i guess youll find if you look up the savings banks statistics these people have got millions tucked away and they send a lot of it to the other side they go back themselves and though they live like cattle they manage to buy land ask the real estate men why i could show you a dozen who worked in the mills a few years ago and are capitalists today  i dont doubt it mr ditmar siddons gracefully conceded but what does it prove merely the cruelty of an economic system based on ruthless competition the great majority who are unable to survive the test pay the price and the community also pays the price the state and nation pay it and we have this misery on our consciences ive no doubt you could show me some who have grown rich but if you would let me i could take you to families in desperate want living in rooms too dark to read in at midday in clear weather where the husband doesnt get more than seven dollars a week when the mills are running full time where the woman has to look out for the children and work for the lodgers and even with lodgers they get into debt and the woman has to go into the mills to earn money for winter clothing ive seen enough instances of this kind to offset the savings bank argument and even then when you have a family where the wife and older children work where the babies are put out to board where there are three and four lodgers in a room why do you suppose they live that way isnt it in the hope of freeing themselves ultimately from these very conditions and arent these conditions a disgrace to hampton and america  well what am i to do about it ditmar demanded  i see that these operatives have comfortable and healthful surroundings in the mill ive spent money to put in the latest appliances thats more than a good many mills i could mention attempt  you are a person of influence mr ditmar you have more influence than any man in hampton you can bring pressure to bear on the city council to enforce and improve the building ordinances you can organize a campaign of public opinion against certain property owners  yes retorted ditmar and what then you raise the rents and you wont get anybody to live in the houses theyll move out to settlements like glendale full of dirt and vermin and disease and live as theyre accustomed to what you reformers are actually driving at is that we should raise wagesisnt it if we raised wages theyd live like rats anyway i give you credit for sincerity mr siddons but i dont want you to think im not as much interested in the welfare of these people as you and the men behind you the trouble is you only see one side of this question when youre in my position youre up against hard facts we cant pay a dubber or a drawing tender any more than hes worth whether he has a wife or children in the mills or whether he hasnt were in competition with other mills were in competition with the south we cant regulate the cost of living we do our best to make things right in the mills and thats all we can do we cant afford to be sentimental about life competitions got to be the rule the worlds made that way some are efficient and some arent good god any man whos had anything to do with hiring labour and running a plant has that drummed into him hard you talk about ordinances lawsthere are enough laws and ordinances in this city and in this state right now if we have any more the mills will have to shut down and these people will starveall of em ditmars chair came down on its four legs and he flung his cigar away send me a copy of your survey when its published ill look it over  well what do you think of the nerve of a man like that ditmar exploded when mr siddons had bowed himself out comes in here to advise me that its my business to look out for the whole city of hampton id like to see him up against this lowclass european labour trying to run a mill with them theyre here one day and there the next they dont know what loyalty is youve got to drive emif you give em an inch theyll jump at your throat dynamite your property why theres nothing i wouldnt do for them if i could depend on them id build em houses id have automobiles to take em home as it is i do my best though they dont deserve itin slack seasons i run half time when i oughtnt to be running at all  his tone betrayed an effort of selfjustification and his irritation had been increased by the suspicion in janet of a certain lack of the sympathy on which he had counted she sat silent gazing searchingly at his face  whats the matter he demanded you dont mean to say you agree with that kind of talk  i was wondering she began  what  if you wereif you could really understand those who are driven to work in order to keep alive  understand them why not he asked  becausebecause youre on top youve always been successful youre pretty much your own masterand that makes it different im not blaming youin your place id be the same im sure but this man siddons made me think ive lived like that you see i know what it is in a way  not like these foreigners he protested  oh almost as bad she cried with vehemence and ditmar stopped suddenly in his pacing as by a physical force looked at her with the startled air of the male who has inadvertently touched off one of the many hidden springs in the feminine emotional mechanism how do you know what it is to live in a squalid ugly street in dark little rooms that smell of cooking and not be able to have any of the finer beautiful things in life unless youd wanted these things as ive wanted them you couldnt know oh i can understand what it would feel like to strike to wish to dynamite men like you  you can he exclaimed in amazement you  yes me you dont understand these people you couldnt feel sorry for them any more than you could feel sorry for me you want them to run your mills for you you dont want to know how they feel or how they live and you just want mefor your pleasure  he was indeed momentarily taken aback by this taunt which no woman in his experience had had the wit and spirit to fling at him but he was not the type of man to be shocked by it on the contrary it swept away his irritation and as a revelation of her inner moltenness stirred him to a fever heat as he approached and stood over her  you littlepanther he whispered you want beautiful things do you well ill give em to you ill take care of you  do you think i want them from you she retorted almost in tears do you think i want anybody to take care of me that shows how little you know me i want to be independent to do my work and pay for what i get  janet herself was far from comprehending the complexity of her feelings ditmar had not apologized or feigned an altruism for which she would indeed have despised him the ruthlessness of his laughthe laugh of the redblooded man who makes laws that he himself may be lawless shook her with a wild appeal what do i care about any othersi want you such was its message and against this paradoxical wish to be conquered intensified by the magnetic field of his passion battled her selfassertion her pride her innate desire to be free to escape now from a domination the thought of which filled her with terror she felt his cheek brushing against her hair his fingers straying along her arm for the moment she was hideously yet deliciously powerless then the emotion of terror conqueredterror of the unknownand she sprang away dropping her notebook and running to the window where she stood swaying  janet youre killing me she heard him say for gods sake why cant you trust me  she did not answer but gazed out at the primrose lights beginning to twinkle fantastically in the distant mills presently she turned ditmar was in his chair she crossed the room to the electric switch turning on the flood of light picked up her totebook and sat down again  dont you intend to answer your letters she asked  he reached out gropingly toward the pile of his correspondence seized the topmost letter and began to dictate savagely she experienced a certain exultation a renewed and pleasurable sense of power as she took down his words     chapter ix  at certain moments during the days that followed the degree of tension her relationship with ditmar had achieved tested the limits of janets ingenuity and powers of resistance yet the sense of mastery at being able to hold such a man in leash was by no means unpleasurable to a young woman of her vitality and spirit there was always the excitement that the leash might breakand then what here was a situation she knew instinctively that could not last one fraught with all sorts of possibilities intoxicating or abhorrent to contemplate and for that very reason fascinating when she was away from ditmar and tried to think about it she fell into an abject perplexity so full was it of anomalies and contradictions of conflicting impulses so far beyond her knowledge and experience for janet had been born in an age which is rapidly discarding blanket morality and taboos which has as yet to achieve the morality of scientific knowledge of the individual instance tradition convention the awful examples portrayed for gain in the movies even her mothers pessimistic attitude in regard to the freedom with which the sexes mingle today were powerless to influence her the thought however that she might fundamentally resemble her sister lise despite a fancied superiority did occasionally shake her and bring about a revulsion against ditmar janets problem was in truth though she failed so to specialize it the supreme problem of our time what is the path to selfrealization how achieve emancipation from the commonplace  was she in love with ditmar the question was distasteful she avoided it for enough of the tatters of orthodox christianity clung to her to cause her to feel shame when she contemplated the feelings he aroused in her it was when she asked herself what his intentions were that her resentment burned pride and a sense of her own value convinced her that he had deeply insulted her in not offering marriage plainly he did not intend to offer marriage on the other hand if he had done so a profound selfrespecting and moral instinct in her would in her present mood have led her to refuse she felt a fine scorn for the woman who under the circumstances would insist upon a bond and all a mans worldly goods in return for that which it was her privilege to give freely while the notion of servility of economic dependencethough she did not so phrase itrepelled her far more than the possibility of social ruin  this she did not contemplate at all her impulse to leave hampton and ditmar had nothing to do with that  away from ditmar this war of inclinations possessed her waking mind invaded her dreams when she likened herself to the other exploited beings he drove to run his mills and fill his ordersof whom mr siddons had spokenher resolution to leave hampton gained such definite ascendancy that her departure seemed only a matter of hours  in this perspective ditmar appeared so ruthless his purpose to use her and fling her away so palpable that she despised herself for having hesitated a longing for retaliation consumed her she wished to hurt him before she left at such times however unforeseen events invariably intruded to complicate her feelings and alter her plans one evening at supper for instance when she seemed at last to have achieved the comparative peace of mind that follows a decision after struggle she gradually became aware of an outburst from hannah concerning the stove the condition of which for many months had been a menace to the welfare of the family edward it appeared had remarked mildly on the absence of beans  beans hannah cried youre lucky to have any supper at all i just wish i could get you to take a look at that oventheres a hole you can put your hand through if youve a mind to ive done my best ive made out to patch it from time to time and today i had mr tiernan in he says its a miracle ive been able to bake anything a new onell cost thirty dollars and i dont know where the moneys coming from to buy it and the firebox is most worn through  well mother well see what we can do said edward  youre always seeing what you can do but i notice you never do anything retorted hannah and edward had the wisdom not to reply beside his place lay a lengthy closewritten letter and from time to time as he ate his canned pears his hand turned over one of its many sheets  its from eben wheeler says hes been considerably troubled with asthma he observed presently his mother was a bumpus a daughter of calebdescended from robert who went from dolton to tewksbury in 1816 and fought in the war of 1812 ive told you about him this caleb was born in 53 and hes living now with his daughters family in detroit soninlaws named nott doing well with a construction company now i never could find out before what became of roberts descendants he married sarah styles reading painfully and they had issue john robert anne susan eliphalet john went to middlebury vermont and married  hannah gathering up the plates clattered them together noisily  a lot of good it does us to have all that information about eben wheelers asthma she complained itll buy us a new stove i guess him and his old bumpus papers if the house burned down over our heads thats all hed think of  as she passed to and fro from the diningroom to the kitchen hannahs lamentations continued grew more and more querulous accustomed as janet was to these frequent arraignments of her fathers inefficiency it was gradually borne in upon her nowdespite a preoccupation with her own fatethat the affair thus plaintively voiced by her mother was in effect a family crisis of the first magnitude she was stirred anew to anger and revolt against a life so precarious and sordid as to be threatened in its continuity by the absurd failure of a stove when glancing at her sister she felt a sharp pang of selfconviction of selfdisgust was she also like that indifferent and selfabsorbed lise in her evening finery looking occasionally at the clock was awaiting the hour set for a rendezvous whiling away the time with the boston evening sheet whose glaring red headlines stretched across the page when the newspaper fell to her lap a dreamy expression clouded lises eyes she was thinking of some man quickly janet looked away at her father only to be repelled anew by the expression almost of fatuity she discovered on his face as he bent over the letter once more suddenly she experienced an overwhelming realization of the desperation of hannahs plightthe destiny of spending ones days without sympathy toiling in the confinement of these rooms to supply their bodily needs never had a destiny seemed so appalling and yet janet resented that pity the effect of it was to fetter and inhibit from the moment of its intrusion she was no longer a free agent to leave hampton and ditmar when she chose without her this family was helpless she rose and picked up some of the dishes hannah snatched them from her hands  leave em alone janet she said with unaccustomed sharpness i guess i aint too feeble to handle em yet  and a flash of new understanding came to janet the dishes were vicarious a substitute for that greater destiny out of which hannah had been cheated by fate a substitute yes and perhaps become something of a mania like her fathers bumpus papers janet left the room swiftly entered the bedroom put on her coat and hat and went out across the street the light in mr tiernans shop was still burning and through the window she perceived mr tiernan himself tilted back in his chair his feet on the table the tip of his nose pointed straight at the ceiling when the bell betrayed the opening of the door he let down his chair on the floor with a bang  why its miss janet he exclaimed how are you this evening now i was just hoping some one would pay me a call  twinkling at her he managed somewhat magically to dispel her temper of pessimism and she was moved to replyyou know you were having a beautiful time all by yourself  a beautiful time is it maybe its because i was dreaming of some young lady acoming to pay me a visit  well dreams never come up to expectations do they  then its dreaming i am still retorted mr tiernan quickly  janet laughed his tone though bantering was respectful one of the secrets of mr tiernans very human success was due to his ability to estimate his fellow creatures his manner of treating janet for instance was quite different from that he employed in dealing with lise in the course of one interview he had conveyed to lise without arousing her antagonism the conviction that it was wiser to trust him than to attempt to pull wool over his eyes janet had the intelligence to trust him and tonight as she faced him the fact was brought home to her with peculiar force that this wiryhaired little man was the person above all others of her immediate acquaintance to seek in time of trouble it was his great quality moreover mr tiernan even in his morning greetings as she passed always contrived to convey to her in some unaccountable fashion the admiration and regard in which he held her and the effect of her contact with him was invariably to give her a certain objective image of herself an increased selfconfidence and selfrespect for instance by the light dancing in mr tiernans eyes as he regarded her she saw herself now as the mainstay of the helpless family in the clayyellow flat across the street and there was nothing she was convinced mr tiernan did not know about that family so she saidive come to see about the stove  sure he replied as much as to say that the visit was not unexpected well ive been thinking about it miss janet ive got a stove here i knowll suit your mother its a reading its almost new yed better be having a look at it yourself  he led her into a chaos of stoves grates and pipes at the back of the store  its in need of a little polish he added as he turned on a light but its sound and a good baker and economical with coal he opened the oven and took off the lids  im afraid i dont know much about stoves she told him but ill trust your judgment how much is it she inquired hesitatingly  he ran his hand through his corkscrewed hair his familiar gesture  well im willing to let ye have it for twentyfive dollars if thats too muchmebbe we can find another  can you put it in tomorrow morning she asked  i can that he said she drew out her purse ye neednt be paying for it all at once he protested laying a hand on her arm you wont be running away  oh id ratheri have the money she declared hurriedly and she turned her back that he might not perceive when she had extracted the bills how little was left in her purse  ill wager ye wont be wanting another soon he said as he escorted her to the door and he held it open politely looking after her until she had crossed the street calling out a cheerful goodnight that had in it something of a benediction she avoided the diningroom and went straight to bed in a strange medley of feelings the selfsacrifice had brought a certain selfsatisfaction not wholly unpleasant she had been equal to the situation and a part of her being approved of thisa part which had been suppressed in another mood wherein she had become convinced that selfrealization lay elsewhere life was indeed a bewildering thing  the next morning at breakfast though her mothers complaints continued janet was silent as to her purchase and she lingered on her return home in the evening because she now felt a reluctance to appear in the role of protector and preserver of the family she would have preferred if possible to give the stove anonymously not that the expression of hannahs gratitude was maudlin she glared at janet when she entered the diningroom and exclaimed you hadnt ought to have gone and done it  and janet retorted with almost equal vehemencesomebody had to do itdidnt they who else was there  its a shame for you to spend your money on such things youd ought to save it youll need it hannah continued illogically  its lucky i had the money said janet  both janet and hannah knew that these recriminations from the other were the explosive expressions of deep feeling janet knew that her mother was profoundly moved by her sacrifice she herself was moved by hannahs plight but tenderness and pity were complicated by a renewed sense of rebellion against an existence that exacted such a situation  i hope the stoves all right mother she said mr tiernan seemed to think it was a good one  its a different thing declared hannah i was just wondering this evening before you came in how i ever made out to cook anything on the other come and see how nice it looks  janet followed her into the kitchen as they stood close together gazing at the new purchase janet was uncomfortably aware of drops that ran a little way in the furrows of hannahs cheeks stopped and ran on again she seized her apron and clapped it to her face  you hadnt ought to be made to do it she sobbed  and janet was suddenly impelled to commit an act rare in their intercourse she kissed her swiftly on the cheek and fled from the room  supper was an ordeal janet did not relish her enthronement as a heroine she deplored and even resented her mothers attitude toward her father which puzzled her for the studied cruelty of it seemed to belie her affection for him every act and gesture and speech of hannahs took on the complexion of an invidious reference to her reliability as compared with edwards worthlessness as a provider and she contrived in some sort to make the meal a sacrament in commemoration of her elder daughters act  i guess you notice the difference in that pork she would exclaim and when he praised it and attributed its excellence to janets gift hannah observed as long as you aint got a son youre lucky to have a daughter like her  janet squirmed her fathers acceptance of his comparative worthlessness was so abject that her pity was transferred to him though she scorned him as on former occasions for the selfdepreciation that made him powerless before her mothers reproaches after the meal was over he sat listlessly on the sofa like a visitor whose presence is endured pathetically refraining from that occupation in which his soul found refreshment and peace the compilation of the bumpus genealogy that evening the papers remained under the lid of the desk in the corner untouched  what troubled janet above all however was the attitude of lise who also came in for her share of implied reproach of late lise had become an increased source of anxiety to hannah who was unwisely resolved to make this occasion an object lesson and though parental tenderness had often moved her to excuse and defend lise for an increasing remissness in failing to contribute to the household expenses she was now quite relentless in her efforts to wring from lise an acknowledgment of the nobility of her sisters act of qualities in janet that she lise might do well to cultivate lise was equally determined to withhold any such acknowledgment in her face grew that familiar mutinous look that hannah invariably failed to recognize as a danger signal and with it anotherthe sophisticated expression of one who knows life and ridicules the lack of such knowledge in others its implication was made certain when the two girls were alone in their bedroom after supper lise feverishly occupied with her toilet on her departure broke the silence there by inquiringsay if i had your easy money i might buy a stove too how much does ditmar give you sweetheart  janet infuriated flew at her sister lise struggled to escape  leave me go she whimpered in genuine alarm and when at length she was released she went to the mirror and began straightening her hat which had flopped to one side of her head i didnt mean nothin i was only kiddie youwhats the use of gettin nutty over a jest  im not likeyou said janet  i was only kiddin i tell you insisted lise with a hat pin in her mouth forget it  when lise had gone out janet sat down in the rockingchair and began to rock agitatedly what had really made her angry she began to perceive was the realization of a certain amount of truth in her sisters intimation concerning ditmar why should she have in lise continually before her eyes a degraded caricature of her own aspirations and ideals or was lise a mirrorsomewhat tarnished indeedin which she read the truth about herself for some time janet had more than suspected that her sister possessed a new lovera lover whom she refrained from discussing an ominous sign since it had been her habit to dangle her conquests before janets eyes to discuss their merits and demerits with an engaging though cynical freedom although the existence of this gentleman was based on evidence purely circumstantial janet was inclined to believe him of a type wholly different from his predecessors and the fact that his attentions were curiously intermittent and irregular inclined her to the theory that he was not a resident of hampton what was he like it revolted her to reflect that he might in some ways possibly resemble ditmar thus he became the object of a morbid speculation especially at such times as this when lise attired herself in her new winter finery and went forth to meet him janet also had recently been selfconvicted of sharing with lise the same questionable tendency toward selfadornment to please the eye of man the very next saturday night after she had indulged in that mad extravagance of the blue suit lise had brought home from the window of the paris in faber street a hat that had excited the cupidity and admiration of miss schuler and herself and in front of which they had stood languishing on three successive evenings in its acquisition lise had expended almost the whole of a weeks salary its colour was purple on three sides were massed drooping lilac feathers but over the left ear the wide brim was caught up and held by a crescent of brilliant paste stones shortly after this purchasethe next week in factthe paris had alluringly and craftily displayed for the tempting sum of 629 the very cloak ordained by providence to go with the hat miss schuler declared it would be a crime to fail to take advantage of such an opportunity but the trouble was that lise had had to wait for two more paydays and endure the suspense arising from the possibility that some young lady of taste and means might meanwhile become its happy proprietor had not the saleslady been obdurate lise would have had it on credit but she did succeed by an initial payment the ensuing saturday in having it withdrawn from public gaze the second saturday lise triumphantly brought the cloak home a velvet cloakif the eyes could be believedvelvet bordering on plush with a dark purple ground delicately and artistically spotted with a lilac to match the hat feathers and edged with a material whichif not too impudently examined and no questions askedmight be mistaken by the uninitiated male for the fur of a white fox both investments had been made needless to say on the strength of janets increased salary and lise when janet had surprised her before the bureau rapturously surveying the combination justified herself with a defiant apology  i just had to have somethingwhat with winter coming on she declared seizing the hand mirror in order to view the back you might as well get your clothes chick while youre about itand i didnt have to dig up twenty bones neithernor anything like it a reflection on janets most blue suit and her abnormal extravagance for it was lises habit to carry the war into the enemys country sadies dippy about itsays it puts her in mind of one of the swells snapshotted in last sundays supplement well dearie how does the effect get you and she wheeled around for her sisters inspection  if you take my advice youll be careful not to be caught out in the rain  whats chewin you now demanded lise she was not lacking in imagination of a certain sort and janets remark did not fail in its purpose of summoning up a somewhat abject image of herself in wet velvet and bedraggled feathersan image suggestive of a certain hunted type of woman lise and her kind held in peculiar horror and she was the more resentful because she felt instinctively that the memory of this suggestion would never be completely eradicated it would persist like a canker to mar the completeness of her enjoyment of these clothes she swung on janet furiously  i get you all right she cried i guess i know whats eatin you youve got money to burn and youre sore because i spend mine to buy what i need you dont know how to dress yourself any more than one of them polak girls in the mills and you dont want anybody else to look nice  and janet was impelled to make a retort of almost equal crudityif i were a man and saw you in those clothes i wouldnt wait for an introduction you asked me what i thought i dont care about the money she exclaimed passionately ive often told you you were pretty enough without having to wear that kind of thingto make men stare at you  i want to know if i dont always look like a lady and theres no man living would try to pick me up more than once the nasal note in lises voice had grown higher and shriller she was almost weeping with anger you want me to go round lookin like a floorwasher  id rather look like a floorwasher thanthan another kind of woman janet declared  well youve got your wish sweetheart said lise you neednt be scared anybody will pick you up  im not said janet  this quarrel had taken place a week or so before janets purchase of the stove hannah too was outraged by lises costume and had also been moved to protest futile protest its only effect on lise was to convince her of the existence of a prearranged plan of persecution to make her more secretive and sullen than ever before  sometimes i just cant believe shes my daughter hannah said dejectedly to janet when they were alone together in the kitchen after lise had gone out im fond of her because shes my own flesh and bloodim ashamed of it but i cant help it i guess its what the minister in dolton used to call a visitation i suppose i deserve it but sometimes i think maybe if your father had been different he might have been able to put a stop to the way shes going on she aint like any of the wenches nor any of the bumpuses so fars im able to find out she just dont seem to have any notion about right and wrong well the world has got all jumbled upit beats me  hannah wrung out the mop viciously and hung it over the sink  i used to hope some respectable man would come along but ive quit hopin i dont know as any respectable man would want lise or that i could honestly wish him to have her  mother protested janet sometimes in those conversations she was somewhat paradoxically impelled to defend her sister  well i dont insisted hannah thats a fact ill tell you what she looks like in that hat and cloaka bad woman i dont say she isi dont know what id do if i thought she was but i never expected my daughter to look like one  oh lise can take care of herself janet said in spite of certain recent misgivings  this towns sodom and gomorrah rolled into one declared hannah who from early habit was occasionally prone to use scriptural parallels and after a moments silence she inquired whos this man thats payin her attention now  i dont know replied janet i dont know that theres anybody  i guess there is said hannah i used to think that that wiley was low enough but i could see him it was some satisfaction i could know the worst anyhow i guess its about time for another flood  this talk had left janet in one of these introspective states so frequent in her recent experience her mother had used the words right and wrong but what was right or wrong there was no use asking hannah whoshe perceivedwas as confused and bewildered as herself did she refuse to encourage mr ditmar because it was wrong because if she acceded to his desires and what were often her own she would be punished in an after life she was not at all sure whether she believed in an after lifea lack of faith that had of late sorely troubled her friend eda rawle who had got religion from an itinerant evangelist and was now working off in a live church some of the emotional idealism which is the result of a balked sex instinct in young unmarried women of a certain mentality and unendowed with good looks this was not of course janets explanation of the change in her friend of whom she now saw less and less they had had arguments in which neither gained any ground for the first time in their intercourse ideas had come between them eda having developed a surprising selfassertion when her new convictions were attacked a dogged loyalty to a scheme of salvation that janet found neither inspiring nor convincing she resented being prayed for and an eda fervent in good works bored her more than ever eda was deeply pained by janets increasing avoidance of her company yet her heroineworship persisted her continued regard for her friend might possibly be compared to the attitude of an orthodox baptist who has developed a hobby let us say for napoleon bonaparte  janet was not wholly without remorse she valued edas devotion she sincerely regretted the fact on edas account as well as her own that it was a devotion of no use to her in the present crisis nor indeed in any crisis likely to confront her in life she had felt instinctively from the first that the friendship was not founded on mental harmony and now it was brought home to her that edas solution could never be hers eda would have been thrilled on learning of ditmars attentions would have advocated the adoption of a campaign leading up to matrimony in matrimony for eda the soul was safe eda would have been horrified that janet should have dallied with any other relationship god would punish her janet in her conflict between alternate longing and repugnance was not concerned with the laws and retributions of god she felt indeed the need of counsel and knew not where to turn for itthe modern need for other than supernatural sanctions she did not resist her desire for ditmar because she believed in the orthodox sense that it was wrong but because it involved a loss of selfrespect a surrender of the personality from the very contemplation of which she shrank she was a true daughter of her time  on friday afternoon shortly after ditmar had begun to dictate his correspondence mr holster the agent of the clarendon mill arrived and interrupted him janet had taken advantage of the opportunity to file away some answered letters when her attention was distracted from her work by the conversation which had gradually grown louder the two men were standing by the window facing one another in an attitude that struck her as dramatic both were vital figures dominant types which had survived and prevailed in that upper world of unrelenting struggle for supremacy into which through her relation to ditmar she had been projected and the significance of which she had now begun to realize she surveyed holster critically he was short heavily built with an almost grotesque width of shoulder a muddy complexion thick lips and kinky greasy black hair that glistened in the sun his nasal voice was complaining yet distinctly aggressive and he emphasized his words by gestures the veins stood out on his forehead she wondered what his history had been she compared him to ditmar on whose dustgrey face she was quick to detect a look she had seen beforea contraction of the eyes a tightening of the muscles of the jaw that look and the peculiarly set attitude of the body accompanying it aroused in her a responsive sense of championship  all right ditmar she heard the other exclaim i tell you again youll never be able to pull it off  ditmars laugh was short defiant  why not he asked  why not because the fiftyfour hour law goes into effect in january  whats that got to do with it ditmar demanded  youll seeyoull remember what i told you fellows at the conference after that bill went through and that damned demagogue of a governor insisted on signing it i said if we tried to cut wages down to a fiftyfour hour basis wed have a strike on our hands in every mill in hamptondidnt i i said it would cost us millions of dollars and make all the other strikes weve had here look like fifty cents didnt i say that hammond our president backed me up and rogers of the wool people you remember you were the man who stood out against it and they listened to you they voted to cut down the pay and say nothing about it wait until those first pay envelopes are opened after that law goes into effect youll see whatll happen youll never be able to fill that bradlaugh order in gods world  oh hell retorted ditmar contemptuously youre always for lying down holster why dont you hand over your mill to the unions and go to work on a farm you might as well if youre going to let the unions run the state why not have socialism right now and cut out the agony when they got the politicians to make the last cut from fiftysix to fiftyfour and we kept on payin em for fiftysix against my advice what happened did they thank us i guess not were they contented not on your life they went right on agitating throwing scares into the party conventions and into the house and senate committeesand now its fiftyfour hours itll be fifty in a couple of years and then well have to scrap our machinery and turn over the trade to the south and donate our mills to the state for insane asylums  no if we handle this thing right well have the public on our side theyre getting sick of the unions now  ditmar went to the desk for a cigar bit it off and lighted it  the public he exclaimed contemptuously a whole lot of good theyll do us  holster approached him menacingly until the two men stood almost touching and for a moment it seemed to janet as if the agent of the clarendon were ready to strike ditmar she held her breath her blood ran fasterthe conflict between these two made an elemental appeal  all rightremember what i saywait and see where you come out with that order holsters voice trembled with anger he hesitated and left the office abruptly ditmar stood gazing after him for a moment and then taking his cigar from his mouth turned and smiled at janet and seated himself in his chair his eyes still narrowed had in them a gleam of triumph that thrilled her combat seemed to stimulate and energize him  he thought he could bluff me into splitting that bradlaugh order with the clarendon ditmar exclaimed well hell have to guess again ive got his number he began to turn over his letters lets see where were we tell caldwell not to let in any more idiots and shut the door  janet obeyed and when she returned ditmar was making notes with a pencil on a pad the conversation with holter had given her a new idea of ditmars daring in attempting to fill the bradlaugh order with the chippering mills alone had aroused in her more strongly than ever that hot loyalty to the mills with which he had inspired her and that strange surge of sympathy of fellowfeeling for the operatives she had experienced after the interview with mr siddons of rebellion against him the conviction that she also was one of the slaves he exploited had wholly disappeared ditmar was the chippering mills and she somehow enlisted once again on his side  by the way he said abruptly you wont mention thisi know  wont mention what she asked  this matter about the pay envelopesthat we dont intend to continue giving the operatives fiftysix hours pay for fiftyfour when this law goes into effect theyre like animals most of em they dont reason and it might make trouble if it got out now you understand theyd have time to brood over it to get the agitators started when the time comes they may kick a little but theyll quiet down and itll teach em a lesson  i never mention anything i hear in this office she told him  i know you dont he assured her apologetically i oughtnt to have said thatit was only to put you on your guard in case you heard it spoken of you see how important it is how much trouble an agitator might make by getting them stirred up you can see what it means to me with this order on my hands ive staked everything on it  butwhen the law goes into effect when the operatives find out that they are not receiving their full wagesas mr holster said janet inquired  why they may grumble a littlebut ill be on the lookout for any move ill see to that ill teach em a lesson as to how far they can push this business of shorter hours and equal pay its the unskilled workers who are mostly affected you understand and theyre not organized if we can keep out the agitators were all right even then ill show em they cant come in here and exploit my operatives  in the mood in which she found herself his selfconfidence his aggressiveness continued to inspire and even to agitate her to compel her to accept his point of view  why he continued i trust you as i never trusted anybody else ive told you that before ever since youve been here youve made life a different thing for mejust by your being here i dont know what id do without you youve got so much sense about thingsabout peopleand i sometimes think youve got almost the same feeling about these mills that i have you didnt tell me you went through the mills with caldwell the other day he added accusingly  ii forgot said janet why should i tellyou she knew that all thought of holster had already slipped from his mind she did not look up if youre not going to finish your letters she said a little faintly ive got some copying to do  youre a deep one he said and as he turned to the pile of correspondence she heard him sigh he began to dictate she took down his sentences automatically scarcely knowing what she was writing he was making love to her as intensely as though his words had been the absolute expression of his desire instead of the commonplace mediums of commercial intercourse presently he stopped and began fumbling in one of the drawers of his desk  where is the memorandum i made last week for percy and company  isnt it there she asked  but he continued to fumble running through the papers and disarranging them until she could stand it no longer  you never know where to find anything she declared rising and darting around the desk and bending over the drawer her deft fingers rapidly separating the papers she drew forth the memorandum triumphantly  there she exclaimed it was right before your eyes  as she thrust it at him his hand closed over hers she felt him drawing her irresistibly  janet he said for gods sakeyoure killing medont you know it i cant stand it any longer  dont she whispered terrorstricken straining away from him mr ditmarlet me go  a silent struggle ensued she resisting him with all the aroused strength and fierceness of her nature he kissed her hair her neckshe had never imagined such a force as this she felt herself weakening welcoming the annihilation of his embrace  mr ditmar she cried somebody will come in  her fingers sank into his neck she tried to hurt him and by a final effort flung herself free and fled to the other side of the room  you littlewildcat she heard him exclaim saw him put his handkerchief to his neck where her fingers had been saw a red stain on it ill have you yet  but even then as she stood leaning against the wall motionless save for the surging of her breast there was about her the same strange feral inscrutableness he was baffled he could not tell what she was thinking she seemed unconquered to triumph over her disarray and the agitation of her body then with an involuntary gesture she raised her hands to her hair smoothing it and without seeming haste left the room not so much as glancing at him closing the door behind her  she reached her table in the outer office and sat down gazing out of the window the face of the worldthe river the mills and the bridgewas changed tinged with a new and unreal quality she too must be changed she wasnt couldnt be the same person who had entered that room of ditmars earlier in the afternoon mr caldwell made a commonplace remark she heard herself answer him her mind was numb only her body seemed swept by fire by emotionsemotions of fear of anger of desire so intense as to make her helpless and when at length she reached out for a sheet of carbon paper her hand trembled so she could scarcely hold it only by degrees was she able to get sufficient control of herself to begin her copying when she found a certain relief in actionher hands flying over the keys tearing off the finished sheets and replacing them with others she did not want to think to decide and yet she knewsomething was trying to tell her that the moment for decision had come she must leave now if she stayed on this tremendous adventure she longed for and dreaded was inevitable fear and fascination battled within her to run away was to deny life to remain to taste and savour it she had tasted itwas it sweetthat sense of being swept away engulfed by an elemental power beyond them both yet in them both she felt him drawing her to him and she struggling yet inwardly longing to yield and the scarlet stain on his handkerchiefwhen she thought of that her blood throbbed her face burned  at last the door of the inner office opened and ditmar came out and stood by the rail his voice was queer scarcely recognizable  miss bumpuswould you mind coming into my room a moment before you leave he said  she rose instantly and followed him closing the door behind her but standing at bay against it her hand on the knob  im not going to touch youyou neednt be afraid he said reassured by the unsteadiness of his voice she raised her eyes to perceive that his face was ashy his manner nervous apprehensive conciliatorya ditmar she had difficulty in recognizing i didnt mean to frighten to offend you he went on something got hold of me i was crazy i couldnt help iti wont do it again if youll stay i give you my word  she did not reply after a pause he began again repeating himself  i didnt mean to do it i was carried awayit all happened before i knew ii wouldnt frighten you that way for anything in the world  still she was silent  for gods sake speak to me he cried say you forgive megive me another chance  but she continued to gaze at him with widened enigmatic eyeswhether of reproach or contempt or anger he could not say the situation transcended his experience he took an uncertain step toward her as though half expecting her to flee and stopped  listen he pleaded i cant talk to you here wont you give me a chance to explainto put myself right you know what i think of you how i respect andadmire you if youll only let me see you somewhereanywhere outside of the office for a little while i cant tell you how much id appreciate it im sure you dont understand how i feeli couldnt bear to lose you ill be down by the canalnear the bridgeat eight oclock tonight ill wait for you youll come say youll come and give me another chance  arent you going to finish your letters she asked  he stared at her in sheer perplexity letters he exclaimed damn the letters do you think i could write any letters now  as a faint ray in dark waters a gleam seemed to dance in the shadows of her eyes yet was gone so swiftly that he could not be sure of having seen it had she smiled  ill be there he cried ill wait for you  she turned from him opened the door and went out  that evening as janet was wiping the dishes handed her by her mother she was repeating to herself shall i goor shant ijust as if the matter were in doubt but in her heart she was convinced of its predetermination by some power other than her own volition with this feeling that she really had no choice that she was being guided and impelled she went to her bedroom after finishing her task the hands of the old diningroom clock pointed to quarter of eight and lise had already made her toilet and departed janet opened the wardrobe looked at the new blue suit hanging so neatly on its wire holder hesitated and closed the door again here at any rate seemed a choice she would not wear that tonight she tidied her hair put on her hat and coat and went out but once in the street she did not hurry though she knew the calmness she apparently experienced to be false the calmness of fatality because she was obeying a complicated impulse stronger than herselfan impulse that at times seemed mere curiosity somewhere removed from her immediate consciousness a storm was raging she was aware of a disturbance that reached her faintly like the distant throbbing of the looms she heard when she turned from faber into west street she had not been able to eat any supper that throbbing of the looms in the night as it grew louder and louder the tension within her increased broke its bounds set her heart to throbbing toothrobbing wildly she halted and went on again precipitately but once more slowed her steps as she came to west street and the glare of light at the end of the bridge at a little distance under the chequered shadows of the bare branches she saw something movea man ditmar she stood motionless as he hurried toward her  youve come youve forgiven me he asked  why were youdown there she asked  why because i thoughti thought you wouldnt want anybody to know  it was quite natural that he should not wish to be seen although she had no feeling of guilt she herself did not wish their meeting known she resented the subterfuge in him but she made no comment because his perplexity his embarrassment were gratifying to her resentment were restoring her selfpossession giving her a sense of power  we cant stay here he went on after a moment lets take a little walkive got a lot to say to you i want to put myself right he tried to take her arm but she avoided him they started along the canal in the direction of the stanley street bridge dont you care for me a little he demanded  why should i she parried  thenwhy did you come  to hear what you had to say  you meanabout this afternoon  partly said janet  wellwell talk it all over i wanted to explain about this afternoon especially im sorry  sorry she exclaimed  the vehemence of her rebukefor he recognized it as suchtook him completely aback thus she was wont at the most unexpected moments to betray the passion within her the passion that made him sick with desire how was he to conquer a woman of this type who never took refuge in the conventional tactics of her sex as he had known them  i didnt mean that he explained desperately my godto feel you to have you in my arms i was sorry because i frightened you but when you came near me that way i just couldnt help it you drove me to it  drove you to it  you dont understand you dont know howhow wonderful you are you make me crazy i love you i want you as ive never wanted any woman beforein a different way i cant explain it ive got so that i cant live without you he flung his arm toward the lights of the mills thatthat used to be everything to me i lived for it i dont say ive been a saintbut i never really cared anything about any woman until i knew you until that day i went through the office and saw you what you were you dont understand i tell you im sorry for what i did today because it offended youbut you drove me to it most of the time you seem cold youre like an iceberg you make me think you hate me and then all of a sudden youll be kind as you were the other night as you seemed this afternoonyou make me think ive got a chance and then when you came near me when you touched my handwhy i didnt know what i was doing i just had to have you a man like me cant stand it  then id better go away she said i ought to have gone long ago  why he cried why whats your reason why do you want to ruin my life youveyouve woven yourself into ityoure a part of it i never knew what it was to care for a woman before i tell you theres that mill he repeated naively ive made it the best mill in the country ive got the biggest order that ever came to any millif you went away i wouldnt care a continental about it if you went away i wouldnt have any ambition left because youre a part of it dont you see youyou sort of stand for it now in my mind im not literary i cant express what id like to say but sometimes i used to think of that mill as a womanand now youve come along ditmar stopped for lack of adequate eloquence  she smiled in the darkness at his boyish fervourone of the aspects of the successful ditmar the ditmar of great affairs that appealed to her most strongly she was softened touched she felt too a responsive thrill to such a desire as his yet she did not reply she could not she was learning that emotion is never simple and some inhibition the identity of which was temporarily obscured still persisted pervading her consciousness  they were crossing the bridge at stanley street now deserted and by common consent they paused in the middle of it leaning on the rail the hideous chocolate factory on the point was concealed by the nightonly the lights were there trembling on the surface of the river against the flushed sky above the city were silhouetted the high chimneys of the power plant ditmars shoulder touched hers he was still pleading but she seemed rather to be listening to the symphony of the unseen waters falling over the dam his words were like that suggestive of a torrent into which she longed to fling herself yet refrained without knowing why her hands tightened on the rail suddenly she let it go and led the way toward the unfrequented district of the south side it was the road to silliston but she had forgotten that ditmar regaining her side continued his pleading he spoke of his loneliness which he had never realized he needed her and she experienced an answering pang it still seemed incredible that he too who had so much should feel that gnawing need for human sympathy and understanding that had so often made her unhappy and because of the response his need aroused in her she did not reflect whether he could fulfil her own need whether he could ever understand her whether at any time she could unreservedly pour herself out to him  i dont see why you want me she interrupted him at last ive never had any advantages i dont know anything ive never had a chance to learn ive told you that before  what difference does that make youve got more sense than any woman i ever saw he declared  it makes a great deal of difference to me she insistedand the sound of these words on her own lips was like a summons arousing her from a dream the sordidness of her life its cruel lack of opportunity in contrast with the gifts she felt to be hers and on which he had dwelt was swept back into her mind selfpity dignity and inherent selfrespect struggled against her womans desire to give an inherited racial pride whispered that she was worthy of the best but because she had lacked the chance he refrained from offering her what he would have laid at the feet of another woman  ill give you advantagestheres nothing i wouldnt give you why wont you come to me ill take care of you  do you think i want to be taken care of she wheeled on him so swiftly that he started back is that what you think i want  no no he protested when he recovered his speech  do you think im afterwhat you can give me she shot at him what you can buy for me  to tell the truth he had not thought anything about it that was the trouble and her question instead of enlightening him only added to his confusion and bewilderment  im always getting in wrong with you he told her pathetically there isnt anything id stop at to make you happy janet thats what im trying to say id go the limit  your limit she exclaimed  what do you mean he demanded but she had become inarticulatecryptic to him he could get nothing more out of her  you dont understand meyou never will she cried and burst into tearstears of rage she tried in vain to control the world was black with his ignorance she hated herself she hated him her sobs shook her convulsively and she scarcely heard him as he walked beside her along the empty road pleading and clumsily seeking to comfort her once or twice she felt his hand on her shoulders and then unlooked for and unbidden pity began to invade her absurd to pity him she fought against it but the thought of ditmar reduced to abjectness gained ground after all he had tried to be generous he had done his best he loved her he needed herthe words rang in her heart after all he did not realize how could she expect him to realize and her imagination conjured up the situation in a new perspective her sobs gradually ceased and presently she stopped in the middle of the road and regarded him he seemed utterly miserable like a hurt child whom she longed to comfort but what she said wasi ought to be going home  not yet he begged its early you say i dont understand you janetmy god i wish i did it breaks me all up to see you cry like that  im sorry she said after a moment ii cant make you understand i guess im not like anybody else im queeri cant help it you must let me go i only make you unhappy  let you go he criedand then in utter selfforgetfulness she yielded her lips to his a sound penetrated the night she drew back from his arms and stood silhouetted against the glare of the approaching headlight of a trolley car and as it came roaring down on them she hailed it ditmar seized her arm  youre not goingnow he said hoarsely  i must she whispered i want to be alonei want to think you must let me  ill see you tomorrow  i dont knowi want to think imim tired  the brakes screamed as the car came joltingly to a stop she flew up the steps glancing around to see whether ditmar had followed her and saw him still standing in the road the car was empty of passengers but the conductor must have seen her leaving a man in this lonely spot she glanced at his face white and pinched and apathetiche must have seen hundreds of similar episodes in the course of his nightly duties he was unmoved as he took her fare nevertheless at the thought that these other episodes might resemble hers her face flamedshe grew hot all over what should she do now she could not think confused with her shame was the memory of a delirious joy yet no sooner would she give herself up trembling to this memory when in turn it was penetrated by qualms of resentment defiling its purity was ditmar ashamed of her when she reached home and had got into bed she wept a little but her tears were neither of joy nor sorrow her capacity for both was exhausted in this strange mood she fell asleep nor did she waken when at midnight lise stealthily crept in beside her     chapter x  ditmar stood staring after the trolley car that bore janet away until it became a tiny speck of light in the distance then he started to walk toward hampton in the unwonted exercise was an outlet for the pentup energy her departure had thwarted and presently his body was warm with a physical heat that found its counterpart in a delicious emotional glow of anticipation of exultant satisfaction after all he could not expect to travel too fast with her had he not at least gained a signal victory when he remembered her lipswhich she had indubitably given himhe increased his stride and in what seemed an incredibly brief time he had recrossed the bridge covered the long residential blocks of warren street and gained his own door  the house was quiet the children having gone to bed and he groped his way through the dark parlour to his den turning on the electric switch sinking into an armchair and lighting a cigar he liked this room of his which still retained something of that flavour of a refuge and sanctuary it had so eminently possessed in the now forgotten days of matrimonial conflict one of the few elements of agreement he had held in common with the late mrs ditmar was a similarity of taste in household decoration and they had gone together to a great emporium in boston to choose the furniture and fittings the lamp in the centre of the table was a bronze column supporting a hemisphere of heavy red and emerald glass the colours woven into an intricate and bizarre design after the manner of the art nouveauso the zealous salesman had informed them cora ditmar when exhibiting this lamp to admiring visitors had remembered the phrase though her pronunciation of it according to the standard of the sorbonne left something to be desired the table and chairs of heavy shiny oak marvellously and precisely carved by machines matched the big panels of the wainscot the windows were high in the wall thus preventing any intrusion from the clothesyard on which they looked the bookcases protected by leaded panes held countless volumes of the fiction from which cora ditmar had derived her knowledge of the great world outside of hampton together with certain sets she had bought not only as ornaments but with a praiseworthy view to future culturesuch as whitmarshs library of the best literature these volumes alas were still uncut but some of the pages of the novelsif one cared to open themwere stained with chocolate the steam radiator was a decoration in itself the fireplace set in the red and yellow tiles that made the hearth above the oak mantel in a gold frame was a large coloured print of a magdalen doubled up in grief with a glory of loose titian hair chosen by ditmar himself as expressing the nearest possible artistic representation of his ideal of the female form cora ditmars objections on the score of voluptuousness and of insufficient clothing had been vain she had recognized no immorality of sentimentality in the art itself what she felt and with some justice was that this particular magdalen was unrepentant and that ditmar knew it and the picture remained an offence to her as long as she lived formerly he had enjoyed the contemplation of this figure reminding him as it did of mellowed moments in conquests of the past suggesting also possibilities of the future for he had been quick to discount the attitude of bowed despair the sop flung by a sensuous artist to christian orthodoxy he had been sceptical about despairfeminine despair which could always be cured by gifts and baubles but tonight as he raised his eyes he felt a queer sensation marring the ecstatic perfection of his mood that quality in the picture which so long had satisfied and entranced him had now become repellent an ugly significant reflection of somethingsomething in himself he was suddenly eager to repudiate and deny it was with a certain amazement that he found himself on his feet with the picture in his hand gazing at the empty space where it had hung for he had had no apparent intention of obeying that impulse what should he do with it light the fire and burn itframe and all the frame was an integral part of it what would his housekeeper say but now that he had actually removed it from the wall he could not replace it so he opened the closet door and thrust it into a corner among relics which had found refuge there he had put his past in the closet yet the relief he felt was mingled with the peculiar qualm that follows the discovery of symptoms never before remarked why should this woman have this extraordinary effect of making him dissatisfied with himself he sat down again and tried to review the affair from that first day when he had surprised in her eyes the flame dwelling in her she had completely upset his life increasingly distracted his mind until now he could imagine no peace unless he possessed her hitherto he had recognized in his feeling for her nothing but that same desire he had had for other women intensified to a degree never before experienced but this sudden access of moralityhe did not actually define it as suchwas disquieting and in the feverish semiobjective survey he was now making of his emotional tract he was discovering the presence of other disturbing symptoms such as an unwonted tenderness a consideration almost amounting to pity which at times he had vaguely sensed yet never sought imaginatively to grasp it bewildered him by hampering a ruthlessness hitherto absolute the fierceness of her inflamed his passion yet he recognized dimly behind this fierceness an instinct of selfprotectionand he thought of her in this moment as a struggling bird that fluttered out of his hands when they were ready to close over her so it had been tonight he might have kept her prevented her from taking the car yet he had let her go there came again utterly to blot this out the memory of her lips  even then there had been something sorrowful in that kiss a quality he resented as troubling a flavour that came to him after the wildness was spent what was she struggling against what was behind her resistance she loved him it had never before occurred to him to enter into the nature of her feelings having been so preoccupied with and tortured by his own this realization that she loved him as it persisted began to make him uneasy though it should according to all experience have been a reason for sheer exultation he began to see that with her it involved complications responsibilities disclosures perhaps all of those things he had formerly avoided and resented in woman he thought of certain friends of his who had become tangled upof one in particular whose bank account had been powerless to extricate him and he was ashamed of himself  in view of the nature of his sex experience of his habit of applying his imagination solely to matters of business rather than to affairs of the heartif his previous episodes may be so designatedhis failure to surmise that a wish for marriage might be at the back of her resistance is not so surprising as it may seem he laid down half smoked his third cigar the suspicion followed swiftly on his recalling to mind her vehement repudiation of his proffered gifts did he think she wanted what he could buy for her she was not purchasablethat way he ought to have known it he hadnt realized what he was saying but marriage literally it had never occurred to him to image her in a relation he himself associated with shackles one of the unconscious causes of his fascination was just her emancipation from and innocence of that herdconvention to which most womeneven those who lack wedding ringsare slaves the force of such an appeal to a man of ditmars type must not be underestimated and the idea that she too might prefer the sanction of the law the gilded cage as a popular song which once had taken his fancy illuminatingly expressed itseemed utterly incongruous with the freedom and daring of her spirit was a sobering shock was he prepared to marry her if he could obtain her in no other way the question demanded a survey of his actual position of which he was at the moment incapable there were his children he had never sought to arrive at even an approximate estimate of the boy and girl as factors in his life to consider his feelings toward them but now though he believed himself a man who gave no weight to social considerationshe had scorned this tendency in his wifehe was to realize the presence of ambitions for them he was young he was astonishingly successful he had reason to think with his opportunities and the investments he already had made that he might some day be moderately rich and he had at times even imagined himself in later life as the possessor of one of those elaborate country places to be glimpsed from the high roads in certain localities which the sophisticated are able to recognize as the seats of the socially ineligible but which to ditmar were outward and visible emblems of success he liked to think of george as the inheritor of such a place as the son of a millionaire as a college graduate as an influential man of affairs he liked to imagine amy as the wife of such another in short ditmars wife had left him as an unconscious legacy her aspirations for their childrens social prestige  the polished oak grandfathers clock in the hall had struck one before he went to bed mentally wearied by an unwonted problem involving in addition to selfinterest an element of ethics of affection not wholly compounded of desire  he slept soundly however he was one of those fortunate beings who come into the world with digestive organs and thyroid glands in that condition whichso physiologists tell usmakes for a sanguine temperament and his course of action though not decided upon no longer appeared as a problem it differed from a business matter in that it could wait as sufficient proof of his liver having rescued him from doubts and qualms he was able to whistle as he dressed and without a tremor of agitation the forgotten tune suggested to his consciousness during the unpleasant reverie of the night beforeonly a bird in a gilded cage it was saturday he ate a hearty breakfast joked with george and amy and refreshed glowing with an expectation mingled with just the right amount of delightful uncertainty that made the great affairs of life a gamble yet with the confidence of the conqueror he walked in sunlight to the mill in view of this firm and hopeful tone of his being he found it all the more surprising as he reached the canal to be seized by a trepidation strong enough to bring perspiration to his forehead what if she had gone he had never thought of that and he had to admit it would be just like her you never could tell what she would do  nodding at simmons the watchman he hurried up the ironshod stairs gained the outer once and instantly perceived that her chair beside the window was empty caldwell and mr price stood with their heads together bending over a sheet on which mr price was making calculations  hasnt miss bumpus come yet ditmar demanded he tried to speak naturally casually but his own voice sounded strange seemed to strike the exact note of sickening apprehension that suddenly possessed him both men turned and looked at him in some surprise  goodmorning mr ditmar caldwell said why yes shes in your room  oh said ditmar  the boston office has just been calling youthey want to know if you cant take the nine twentytwo caldwell went on its about that lawsuit it comes into court monday morning and mr sprole is there and they say they have to see you miss bumpus has the memorandum  ditmar looked at his watch  damn it why didnt they let me know yesterday he exclaimed i wont see anybody caldwellnot even orcuttjust now you understand ive got to have a little time to do some letters i wont be disturbedby any onefor half an hour  caldwell nodded  all right mr ditmar  ditmar went into his office closing the door behind him she was occupied as usual cutting open the letters and laying them in a pile with the deftness and rapidity that characterized all she did  janet he exclaimed  theres a message for you from boston ive made a note of it she replied  i knowcaldwell told me but i wanted to see you before i wenti had to see you i sat up half the night thinking of you i woke up thinking of you arent you glad to see me  she dropped the letter opener and stood silent motionless awaiting his approacha pose so eloquent of the sense of fatality strong in her as to strike him with apprehension unused though he was to the appraisal of inner values he read darkly something of this mystery in her eyes as they were slowly raised to his he felt afraid he was swept again by those unwonted emotions of pity and tendernessbut when she turned away her head and he saw the bright spot of colour growing in her cheek spreading to her temple suffusing her throat when he touched the soft contour of her arm his passion conquered still he was acutely conscious of a resistance within hernot as before physically directed against him but repudiating her own desire she became limp in his arms though making no attempt to escape and he knew that the essential self of her he craved still evaded and defied him and he clung to her the more desperatelyas though by crushing her peradventure he might capture it  youre hurting me she said at last and he let her go standing by helplessly while she went through the movements of readjustment instinctive to women even in these he read the existence of the reservation he was loth to acknowledge  dont you love me he said  i dont know  you do he said youyou proved iti know it  she went a little away from him picking up the paper cutter but it lay idle in her hand  for gods sake tell me whats the matter he exclaimed i cant stand this janet arent you happy  she shook her head  why not i love you iive never been so happy in my life as i was this morning why arent you happywhen we love each other  because im not  why not theres nothing i wouldnt do to make you happyyou know that tell me  you wouldnt understand i couldnt make you understand  is it something ive done  you dont love me she said you only want me im not made that way im not generous enough i guess ive got to have work to do  work to do but youll share my workits nothing without you  she shook her head i knew you couldnt understand you dont realize how impossible it is i dont blame youi suppose a man cant  she was not upbraiding him she spoke quietly in a tone almost lifeless yet the emotional effect of it was tremendous  but he began and stopped and was swept on again by an impulse that drowned all caution all reason but you can help mewhen we are married  married she repeated you want to marry me  yes yesi need you he took her hands he felt them tremble in his her breath came quickly but her gaze was so intent as seemingly to penetrate to the depths of him and despite his mans amazement at her hesitation now that he had offered her his all he was moved disturbed ashamed as he had never been in his life at length when he could stand no longer the suspense of this inquisition he stammered out i want you to be my wife  youve wanted to marry me all along she asked  i didnt think janet i was mad about you i didnt know you  do you know me now  thats just it he cried with a flash of clairvoyance i never will know youits what makes you different from any woman ive ever seen youll marry me  im afraid she said oh ive thought over it and you havent a woman has to think a man doesnt so much and now youre willing to marry me if you cant get me any other way her hand touched his coat checking his protest it isnt that i want marriagewhat you can give meim not like that ive told you so before but i couldnt live as yourmistress  the word on her lips shocked him a littlebut her courage and candour thrilled him  if i stayed here it would be found out i wouldnt let you keep me id have to have work you see or id lose my selfrespectits all ive gotid kill myself she spoke as calmly as though she were reviewing the situation objectively and then ive thought that you might come to believe you really wanted to marry meyou wouldnt realize what you were doing or what might happen if we were married ive tried to tell you that too only you didnt seem to understand what i was saying my fathers only a gatekeeper were poorpoorer than some of the operatives in the mill and the people you know here in hampton wouldnt understand perhaps you think you wouldnt care but she spoke with more effort there are your children when ive thought of them it all seems impossible id make you unhappyi couldnt bear it i wouldnt stay with you you see i ought to have gone away long ago  believing as he did that marriage was the goal of all women even of the best the immediate capitulation he had expected would have made matters far less difficult but these scruples of hers so startlingly his own her disquieting insight into his entire mental process had a momentary checking effect summoned up the vague presage of a future that might become extremely troublesome and complicated his very reluctance to discuss with her the problem she had raised warned him that he had been swept into deep waters on the other hand her splendid resistance appealed to him enhanced her value and accustomed as he had been to a lifelong selfgratification the thought of being balked in this supreme desire was not to be borne such were the shades of his feeling as he listened to her  thats nonsense he exclaimed when she had finished youre a ladyi know all about your family i remember hearing about it when your father came hereits as good as any in new england what do you suppose i care janet we love each otherive got to have you well be married in the spring when the rush is over  he drew her to him once more and suddenly in the ardour of that embrace he felt her tenseness suddenly relaxas though against her willand her passion as she gave her lips vied with his own her lithe body trembled convulsively her cheeks were wet as she clung to him and hid her face in his shoulder his sensations in the presence of this thing he had summoned up in her were incomprehensible surpassing any he had ever known it was no longer a woman he held in his arms the woman he craved but something greater more fearful the mystery of sorrow and suffering of creation and lifeof the universe itself  janetarent you happy he said again  she released herself and smiled at him wistfully through her tears  i dont know what i feel doesnt seem like happiness i cant believe in it somehow  you must believe in it he said  i cantperhaps i may later youd better go now she begged youll miss your train  he glanced at the office clock confound it i have to listen ill be back this evening and ill get that little car of mine  no not tonighti dont want to gotonight  why not  not tonight she repeated  well then tomorrow tomorrows sunday do you know where the boat club is on the river boulevard ill be there tomorrow morning at ten id come for you to your house he added quickly but we dont want any one to know yetdo we  she shook her head  we must keep it secret for a while he said wear your new dressthe blue one goodbyesweetheart  he kissed her again and hurried out of the office boarding the train just as it was about to start he settled himself in the back seat of the smoker lit a cigar inhaling deep breaths of the smoke and scarcely noticing an acquaintance who greeted him from the aisle well he had done it he was amazed he had not intended to propose marriage and when he tried to review the circumstances that had led to this he became confused but when he asked himself whether indeed he were willing to pay such a price to face the revolution marriageand this marriage in particularwould mean in his life the tumult in his blood beat down his incipient anxieties besides he possessed the kind of mind able to throw off the consideration of possible consequences and by the time the train had slowed down in the darkness of the north station in boston all traces of worry had disappeared the future would take care of itself  for the bumpus family supper that evening was an unusually harmonious meal hannahs satisfaction over the new stove had by no means subsided and edward ventured without reproof to praise the restored quality of the pie crust and in contrast to her usual moroseness and selfabsorption even lise was gaylargely because her pet aversion the dignified and allegedly amorous mr waiters floorwalker at the bagatelle had fallen down the length of the narrow stairway leading from the cashiers cage she became almost hysterical with glee as she pictured him lying prone beneath the counter dedicated to lingerie draped with various garments from the pile that toppled over on him ruby nash picked a brassiere off his whiskers lise shrieked she gave the pile a shove when he landed hes got her number all right but say it was worth the price of admission to see that old mutt when he got up he looked like santa claus all the girls in the floor were there we nearly split trying to keep from giving him the haha and ruby says sympathetic as she brushed him off i hope you aint hurt mr waiters he was sore he went around all afternoon with a bunch on his coco as big as a potato so vivid was lises account of this affair which apparently she regarded as compensation for many days of drudgerythat even hannah laughed though deploring a choice of language symbolic of a world she feared and detested  if i talked like you said lise they wouldnt understand me  janet too was momentarily amused drawn out of that reverie in which she had dwelt all day ever since ditmar had left for boston now she began to wonder what would happen if she were suddenly to announce im going to marry mr ditmar after the first shock of amazement she could imagine her fathers complete and complacent acceptance of the news as a vindication of an inherent quality in the bumpus blood he would begin to talk about the family for despite what might have been deemed a somewhat disillusionizing experience in the depths of his being he still believed in the providence who had presided over the perilous voyage of the mayflower and the birth of peregrine white whose omniscient mind was peculiarly concerned with the family trees of puritans and what could be a more striking proof of the existence of this providence or a more fitting acknowledgment on his part of the bumpus virtues than that janet should become the wife of the agent of the chippering mills janet smiled she was amused too by the thought that lises envy would be modified by the prospect of a heightened social status since lise it will be remembered had her providence likewise hannahs god was not a providence but one deeply skilled in persecution in ingenious methods of torture one who would not hesitate to dangle baubles before the eyes of his childrenonly to snatch them away again hannahs pessimism would persist as far as the altar and beyond  on the whole such was janets notion of the deity though deep within her there may have existed a hope that he might be outwitted that by dint of energy and brains the fair things of life might be obtained despite a malicious opposition and she loved ditmar this must be love she felt this impatience to see him again this desire to be with him this agitation possessing her so utterly that all day long she had dwelt in an unwonted state like a somnambulism it must be love though not resembling in the least the generally accepted virginal ideal she saw him as he was crude powerful relentless in his desire his very faults appealed his passion had overcome his prudence he had not intended to propose but any shame she felt on this score was put to flight by a fierce exultation over the fact that she had brought him to her feet that he wanted her enough to marry her it was wonderful to be wanted like that but she could not achieve the mental picture of herself as ditmars wifeespecially when later in the evening she walked up warren street and stood gazing at his house from the opposite pavement she simply could not imagine herself living in that house as its mistress notwithstanding the testimony of the movies such a cinderellalike transition was not within the realm of probable facts things just didnt happen that way  she recalled the awed exclamation of eda when they had walked together along warren street on that evening in summer how would you like to live thereand hot with sudden embarrassment and resentment she had dragged her friend onward to the corner in spite of its size of the spaciousness of existence it suggested the house had not appealed to her then janet did not herself realize or estimate the innate if undeveloped sense of form she possessed the artistinstinct that made her breathless on first beholding silliston common and then the vision of silliston had still been bright but now the light of a slender moon was as a gossamer silver veil through which she beheld the house as in a stage setting softening and obscuring its lines lending it qualities of dignity and glamour that made it seem remote unreal unattainable and she felt a sudden overwhelming longing as though her breast would burst  through the drawn blinds the lights in the second storey gleamed yellow a dim lamp burned in the deep vestibule as in a sanctuary and then as though some supernaturally penetrating ray had pierced a square hole in the lower walls a glimpse of the interior was revealed to her of the living room at the north end of the house two figures chased one another around the centre tableditmars children was ditmar there impelled irresistibly by a curiosity overcoming repugnance and fear she went forward slowly across the street gained the farther pavement stepped over the concrete coping and stood shivering violently on the lawn feeling like an interloper and a thief yet held by morbid fascination the children continued to romp the boy was strong and swift the girl stout and ungainly in her movements not mistress of her body he caught her and twisted her arm roughlyjanet could hear her cries through the windowwhen an elderly woman entered seized him struggling with him he put out his tongue at her but presently released his sister who stood rubbing her arm her lips moving in evident recrimination and complaint the faces of the two were plain now the boy resembled ditmar but the features of the girl heavy and stamped with selfindulgence were evidently reminiscent of the woman who had been his wife then the shade was pulled down abruptly and janet overcome by a sense of horror at her position took to flight  when after covering the space of a block she slowed down and tried to imagine herself as established in that house the stepmother of those children she found it impossible despite the fact that her attention had been focussed so strongly on them the fringe of her vision had included their surroundings the costly furniture the piano against the farther wall the music rack evidently the girl was learning to play she felt a renewed intenser bitterness against her own lot she was aware of something within her better and finer than the girl than the woman who had been her mother had possessedthat in her janet had lacked the advantages of development could itcould it ever be developed now had this love which had come to her brought her any nearer to the unknown realm of light she craved     chapter xi  though december had come sunday was like an april day before whose sunlight the nightmists of scruples and morbid fears were scattered and dispersed and janet as she fared forth from the fillmore street flat felt resurging in her the divine recklessness that is the very sap of life the future save of the immediate hours to come lost its power over her the blue and white beauty of the sky proclaimed all things possible for the strong and the air was vibrant with the sweet music of bells calling her to happiness she was going to meet happiness to meet loveto meet ditmar the trolley which she took in faber street though lagging in its mission seemed an agent of that happiness as it left the city behind it and wound along the heights beside the tarvia roadway above the river bright glimpses of which she caught through the openings in the woods and when she looked out of the window on her right she beheld on a little forested rise a succession of tiny camps built by residents of hampton whose modest incomes could not afford more elaborate summer places camps of all descriptions and colours with queer names that made her smile the cranny the nook snug harbour buena vistaof coursewhich she thought pretty though she did not know its meaning and another in german equally perplexing klein aber mein though the windows of these places were now boarded up though the mosquito netting still clung rather dismally to the porches they were mutely suggestive of contentment and domestic joy  scarcely had she alighted from the car at the rendezvous he had mentioned beside the now deserted boathouse where in the warm weather the members of the hampton rowing club disported themselves when she saw an automobile approachingand recognized it as the gay roadster ditmar had exhibited to her that summer afternoon by the canal and immediately ditmar himself bringing it to a stop and leaping from it stood before her in the sunlight radiating as it seemed more sunlight still with his clipped blond moustache and his strawcoloured hairas yet but slightly grey at the templeshe looked a veritable conquering berserker in his huge coat of golden fur never had he appeared to better advantage  i was waiting for you he said i saw you in the car turning to the automobile he stripped the tissue paper from a cluster of dark red roses with the priceless long stems of which lise used to rave when she worked in the flower store and he held the flowers against her suit her new suit she had worn for this meeting  oh she cried taking a deep intoxicating breath of their fragrance you brought thesefor me  from bostonmy beauty  but i cant wear all of them  why not he demanded havent you a pin  she produced one attaching them with a gesture that seemed habitual though the thought of their valuerevealing in some degree her own worth in his eyesunnerved her she was warmly conscious of his gaze then he turned and opening a compartment at the back of the car drew from it a bright tweed motor coat warmly lined  oh no she protested drawing back illill be warm enough but laughingly triumphantly he seized her and thrust her arms in the sleeves his fingers pressing against her overcome by shyness she drew away from him  i made a pretty good guess at the sizedidnt i janet he cried delightedly surveying her i couldnt forget it his glance grew more concentrated warmer penetrating  you mustnt look at me like that she pleaded with lowered eyes  why notyoure minearent you youre mine now  i dont know there are lots of things i want to talk about she replied but her protest sounded feeble unconvincing even to herself he fairly lifted her into the automobileit was a caress only tempered by the semipublicity of the place he was giving her no time to thinkbut she did not want to think starting the engine he got in and leaned toward her  not here she exclaimed  all rightill wait he agreed tucking the robe about her deftly solicitously and she sank back against the seat surrendering herself to the luxury the wonder of being cherished the caressing and sheltering warmth she felt of security and love the sense of emancipation from discontent and sordidness and struggle for a moment she closed her eyes but opened them again to behold the transformed image of herself reflected in the windshield to confirm the illusionif indeed it were one the tweed coat seemed startlingly white in the sunlight and the woman she saw yet recognized as herself was one of the fortunately placed of the earth with power and beauty at her command and she could no longer imagine herself as the same person who the night before had stood in front of the house in warren street the car was speeding over the smooth surface of the boulevard the swift motion which seemed to her like that of flying the sparkling air the brightness of the day the pressure of ditmars shoulder against hers thrilled her she marvelled at his sure command over the machine that responded like a live thing to his touch on the wide straight stretches it went at a mad pace that took her breath and again in turning a corner or passing another car it slowed down purring in meek obedience once she gasped not so fast i cant stand it  he laughed and obeyed her they glided between river and sky across the delicate fabric of a bridge which but a moment before she had seen in the distance running through the little village on the farther bank they left the river  where are you going she asked  oh for a little spin he answered indulgently turning into a side road that wound through the woods and suddenly stopping janet weve got this daythis whole day to ourselves he seized and drew her to him and she yielded dizzily repaying the passion of his kiss forgetful of past and future while he held her whispering brokenly endearing phrases  youll ruin my roses she protested breathlessly at last when it seemed that she could no longer bear this embrace nor the pressure of his lips there you see youre crushing them she undid them and buttoning the coat held them to her face their odour made her faint her eyes were clouded  listen claude she said at lastit was the first time she had called him sogetting free you must be sensible some one might come along  ill never get enough of you he said i cant believe it yet and added irrelevantly pin the roses outside  she shook her head something in her protested against this too public advertisement of their love  id rather hold them she answered lets go on he started the car again listen i want to talk to you seriously ive been thinking  dont i know youve been thinking he told her exuberantly if i could only find out whats always going on in that little head of yours if you keep on thinking youll dry up like a new england schoolmarm and now do you know what you are one of those dusky red roses just ready to bloom some day ill buy enough to smother you in em  listen she repeated making a great effort to calm herself to regain something of that frame of mind in which their love had assumed the proportions of folly and madness to summon up the scruples which before she had left home that morning she had resolved to lay before him which she knew would return when she could be alone again i have to thinkyou wont she exclaimed with a fleeting smile  well what is it he assented you might as well get it off now  and it took all her strength to say i dont see how i can marry you ive told you the reasons youre rich and you have friends who wouldnt understandand your childrenthey wouldnt understand iim nothing i know it isnt right i know you wouldnt be happy ive never livedin the kind of house you live in and known the kind of people you know i shouldnt know what to do  he took his eyes off the road and glanced down at her curiously his smile was selfconfident exultant  now do you feel betteryou little puritan he said  and perforce she smiled in return a pucker appearing between her eyebrows  i mean it she said i came out to tell you so i knowit just isnt possible  id marry you today if i could get a license he declared why youre worth any woman in america i dont care who she is or how much money she has  in spite of herself she was absurdly pleased  now that is over we wont discuss it again do you understand ive got you he said and i mean to hold on to you  she sighed he was driving slowly now along the sandy road and with his hand on hers she simply could not think the spell of his nearness of his touch which all nature that morning conspired to deepen was too powerful to be broken and something was calling to her take this day take this day drowning out the other voice demanding an accounting she was livingwhat did it all matter she yielded herself to the witchery of the hour the sheer delight of forthfaring into the unknown  they turned away from the river crossing the hills of a rolling country now open now wooded passing white farmhouses and red barns and ancient weatherbeaten dwellings with hipped roofs and leantos which had been there in colonial days when the road was a bridlepath cows and horses stood gazing at them from warm paddocks where the rich black mud glistened melted by the sun chickens scratched and clucked in the barnyards or flew frantically across the road sometimes within an ace of destruction janet flinched but ditmar would laugh gleefully boyishly  we nearly got that one he would exclaim and then he had to assure her that he wouldnt run over them  i havent run over one yethave i he would demand  no but you will its only luck  luck he cried derisively skill i wish i had a dollar for every one i got when i was learning to drive there was a farmer over here in chester and he proceeded to relate how he had had to pay for two turkeys he got my number the old hayseed he was laying for me and the next time i went back that way he held me up for five dollars i can remember the time when a man in a motor was an easy mark for every reuben in the county they got rich on us  she responded to his mood which was wholly irresponsible exuberant and they laughed together like children every little incident assuming an aspect irresistibly humorous once he stopped to ask an old man standing in his dooryard how far it was to kingsbury  wal mebbe its two mile they mostly call it two said the patriarch after due reflection gathering his beard in his band mebbe its more his upper lip was blue shaven prehensile  what did you ask him for when you know said janet mirthfully when they had gone on and ditmar was imitating him ditmars reply was to wink at her presently they saw another figure on the road  lets see what hell say ditmar proposed this man was young the colour of mahogany with glistening black hair and glistening black eyes that regarded the too palpable joyousness of their holiday humour in mute surprise  i no knowstranger he said  no speaka portugueso inquired ditmar gravely  the country is getting filthy with foreigners he observed when he had started the car i went down to plymouth last summer to see the old rock and by george it seemed as if there wasnt anybody could speak american on the whole cape all the portuguese islands are dumped therecranberry pickers you know  i didnt know that said janet  sure thing he exclaimed and when i got there what do you think there was hardly enough of the old stone left to stand on and that had a fence around it like an exhibit in an exposition it had all been chipped away by souvenir hunters  she gazed at him incredulously  you dont believe me ill take you down there sometime and another thing the rocks high and dryup on the land i said to charlie crane who was with me that it must have been a peach of a jump for old miles standish and priscilla whats her name  how id love to see the ocean again janet exclaimed  why ill take youas often as you like he promised well go out on it in summer up to maine or down to the cape  her enchantment was now so great that nothing seemed impossible  and well go down to plymouth too some sunday soon if this weather keeps up if we start early enough we can get there for lunch easy well see the rock i guess some of your ancestors must have come over with that mayflower outfitfirst cabin eh you look like it  janet laughed its a joke on them if they did i wonder what theyd think of hampton if they could see it now i counted up once just to tease fatherhes the seventh generation from ebenezer bumpus who came to dolton well i proved to him he might have one hundred and twentysix other ancestors besides ebenezer and his wife  that must have jarred him some was ditmars comment great old man your father ive talked to himhes a regular historical society all by himself well there must be something in it this family business now you can tell he comes from fine old american stockhe looks it  janet flushed a lot of good it does she exclaimed  i dont know said ditmar its something to fall back ona good deal and he hasnt got any of that nonsense in his head about labour unionshes a straight american and you look the part he added you remind mei never thought of it until nowyou remind me of a picture of priscilla i saw once in a book of poems longfellows you know im not much on literature but i remember that and i remember thinking she could have me funny isnt it that you should have come along but youve got more ginger than the woman in that picture im the only man that ever guessed it isnt that so he asked jealously  youre wonderful retorted janet daringly  you just bet i am or i couldnt have landed you he asserted youre chock full of ginger but its been all corked up youre so primso priscilla he was immensely pleased with the adjective he had coined repeating it its a great combination when i think of it i want to shake you to squeeze you until you scream  then please dont think of it she said  thats easy he exclaimed mockingly  at a quarter to one they entered a sleepy village reminiscent of a new england of other days the long street deeply shaded in summer was bordered by decorous homes some of which had stood there for a century and a half others were of the mansard period the high school of strawberrycoloured brick had been the pride and glory of the kingsbury of the 70s there were many churches some graceful and some hideous at the end of the street they came upon a common surrounded by stone posts and a railing with a monument in the middle of it and facing the common on the north side was a rambling edifice with many white gables in front of which from an iron arm on a post swung a quaint sign kingsbury tavern in revolutionary and coaching days the place bad been a famous inn and now thanks to the enterprise of a man who had foreseen the possibilities of an era of automobiles it had become even more famous a score of these modern vehicles were drawn up before it under the bare ancient elms there was a scene of animation on the long porch where guests strolled up and down or sat in groups in the rockingchairs which the mild weather had brought forth again ditmar drew up in line with the other motors and stopped  well here we are he exclaimed as he pulled off his gauntlets i guess i could get along with something to eat how about you they treat you as well here as any place i know of in new england  he assumed their lunching together at a public place as a matter of course to which there could not possibly be an objection springing out of the car removing the laprobe from her knees and helping her to alight she laid the roses on the seat  arent you going to bring them along he demanded  id rather not she said dont you think theyll be safe here  oh i guess so he replied she was always surprising him but her solicitation concerning them was a balm and he found all such instinctive acts refreshing  afraid of putting up too much of a front are you he asked smilingly  id rather leave them here she replied as she walked beside ditmar to the door she was excited unwontedly selfconscious painfully aware of inspection by the groups on the porch she had seen such people as these hurrying in automobiles through the ugliness of faber street in hampton toward just such delectable spots as this village of kingsburypeople of that world of freedom and privilege from which she was excluded ditmars world he was at home here but she the delusion that she somehow had been miraculously snatched up into it was marred by their glances what were they thinking of her her face was hot as she passed them and entered the hall where more people were gathered but ditmars complacency his ease and selfconfidence his manner of owning the place as it were somewhat reassured her he went up to the desk behind which stood a burly redcomplexioned man who greeted him effusively yet with the air of respect accorded the powerful  hullo eddie said ditmar youve got a good crowd here today any room for me  sure mr ditmar we can always make room for you well i havent laid eyes on you for a dogs age only last sunday mr crane was here and i was asking him where youd been keeping yourself  why ive been busy eddie ive landed the biggest order ever heard of in hampton some of us have to work you know all youve got to do is to loaf around this place and smoke cigars and rake in the money  the proprietor of the kingsbury tavern smiled indulgently at this persiflage  let me present you to miss bumpus said ditmar this is my friend eddie hale he added for janets benefit and when youve eaten his dinner youll believe me when i say hes got all the other hotel men beaten a mile  janet smiled and flushed she had been aware of mr hales discreet glance  pleased to meet you miss bumpus he said with a somewhat elaborate bow  eddie said ditmar have you got a nice little table for us  its a pity i didnt know you was coming but ill do my best declared mr hale opening the door in the counter  oh i guess you can fix us all right if you want to eddie  mr ditmars a great josher mr hale told janet confidentially as he escorted them into the diningroom and ditmar gazing around over the heads of the diners spied in an alcove by a window a little table with tilted chairs  that onell do he said  im sorry but its engaged apologized mr hale  forget it eddietell em theyre late said ditmar making his way toward it  the proprietor pulled out janets chair  say he remarked its no wonder you get along in business  well this is cosy isnt it said ditmar to janet when they were alone he handed her the menu and snapped his fingers for a waitress  why didnt you tell me you were coming to this place she asked  i wanted to surprise you dont you like it  yes she replied only  only what  i wish you wouldnt look at me like thathere  all right ill try to be good until we get into the car again you watch me ill behave as if wed been married ten years  he snapped his fingers again and the waitress hurried up to take their orders  kingsburys still dry i guess he said to the girl who smiled sympathetically somewhat ruefully when she had gone he began to talk to janet about the folly in general of prohibition the fuse oil distributed on the sly ill bet i could go out and find half a dozen rum shops within a mile of here he declared  janet did not doubt it ditmars aplomb his faculty of getting what he wanted had amused and distracted her she was growing calmer able to scrutinize at first covertly and then more boldly the people at the other tables only to discover that she and ditmar were not the objects of the universal curiosity she had feared once in a while indeed she encountered and then avoided the glance of some man felt the admiration in it was thrilled a little and her sense of exhilaration returned as she regained her poise she must be nice lookingmore than thatin her new suit on entering the tavern she had taken off the tweed coat which ditmar had carried and laid on a chair this new and amazing adventure began to go to her head like wine  when luncheon was over they sat in a sunny corner of the porch while ditmar smoked his cigar his digestion was good his spirits high his lovemakingon account of the public nature of the placesurreptitious yet fervent the glamour to which janet had yielded herself was on occasions slightly troubled by some new and enigmatic element to be detected in his voice and glances suggestive of intentions vaguely disquieting at last she said  oughtnt we to be going home  home he ridiculed the notion im going to take you to the prettiest road you ever sawaround by frenchs lower falls i only wish it was summer  i must be home before dark she told him you see the family dont know where i am i havent said anything to them aboutabout this  thats right he said after a moments hesitation  i didnt think you would theres plenty of time for thatafter things get settled a littleisnt there  she thought his look a little odd but the impression passed as they walked to the motor he insisted now on her pinning the roses on the tweed coat and she humoured him the winter sun had already begun to drop and with the levelling rays the bare hillsides yellow and brown in the higher light were suffused with pink little by little as the sun fell lower imperceptible clouds whitened the blue cambric of the sky distant copses were stained lilac and janet as she gazed wondered at a world that held at once so much beauty so much joy and sorrowsuch strange sorrow as began to invade her now not personal but cosmic at times it seemed almost to suffocate her she drew in deep breaths of air it was the essence of all thingsof the man by her side of herself of the beauty so poignantly revealed to her  gradually ditmar became conscious of this detachment this new evidence of an extraordinary faculty of escaping him that seemed unimpaired constantly he tried by leaning closer to her by reaching out his hand to reassure himself that she was at least physically present and though she did not resent these tokens submitting passively he grew perplexed and troubled his optimistic atheism concerning things unseen was actually shaken by the impression she conveyed of beholding realities hidden from him shadows had begun to gather in the forest filmy mists to creep over the waters he asked if she were cold and she shook her head and sighed as one coming out of a trance smiling at him  its been a wonderful day she said  the greatest ever he agreed and his ardour mounting again swept away the unwonted mood of tenderness and awe she had inspired in him made him bold to suggest the plan which had been the subject of an ecstatic contemplation  ill tell you what well do he said well take a little run down to boston and have dinner together well be there in an hour and back by ten oclock  to boston she repeated now  why not he said stopping the car heres the roadits a boulevard all the way  it was not so much the proposal as the passion in his voice in his touch the passion to which she felt herself responding that filled her with apprehension and dismay and yet aroused her pride and anger  i told you i had to be home she said  ill have you home by ten oclock i promise were going to be married janet he whispered  oh if you meant to marry me you wouldnt ask me to do this she cried i want to go back to hampton if you wont take me ill walk  she had drawn away from him and her hand was on the door he seized her arm  for gods sake dont take it that way he cried in genuine alarm all i meant wasthat wed have a nice little dinner i couldnt bear to leave you itll be a whole week before we get another day do you suppose idid do anything to insult you janet  with her fingers still tightened over the doorcatch she turned and looked at him  i dont know she said slowly sometimes i think you would why shouldnt you why should you marry me why shouldnt you try to do with me what youve done with other women i dont know anything about the world about life im nobody why shouldnt you  because youre not like the other womenthats why i love youwont you believe it he was beside himself with anxiety listenill take you home if you want to go you dont know how it hurts me to have you think such things  well then take me home she said it was but gradually that she became pacified a struggle was going on within her between these doubts of him he had stirred up again and other feelings aroused by his pleadings night fell and when they reached the silliston road the lights of hampton shone below them in the darkness  youd better let me out here she said you cant drive me home  he brought the car to a halt beside one of the small wooden shelters built for the convenience of passengers  you forgive meyou understand janet he asked  sometimes i dont know what to think she said and suddenly clung to him ii forgive you i oughtnt to suspect such things but im like that im horrid and i cant help it she began to unbutton the coat he had bought for her  arent you going to take it he said its yours  and what do you suppose my family would say if i told them mr ditmar had given it to me  come on ill drive you home ill tell them i gave it to you that were going to be married he announced recklessly  oh no she exclaimed in consternation you couldnt you said so yourselfthat you didnt want any one to know now ill get on the trolley  and the roses he asked  she pressed them to her face and chose one ill take this she said laying the rest on the seat  he waited until he saw her safely on the trolley car and then drove slowly homeward in a state of amazement he had been on the verge of announcing himself to the family in fillmore street as her prospective husband he tried to imagine what that household was like and again he found himself wondering why she had not consented to his proposal and the everrecurring question presented itselfwas he prepared to go that length he didnt know she was beyond him he had no clew to her she was to him as mysterious as a symphony certain strains of her moved him intenselythe rest was beyond his grasp at supper while his children talked and laughed boisterously he sat silent restless and in spite of their presence the house seemed appallingly empty  when janet returned home she ran to her bedroom and taking from the wardrobe the tissue paper that had come with her new dress and which she had carefully folded she wrapped the rose in it and put it away in the back of a drawer thus smothered its fragrance stifled it seemed emblematic somehow of the clandestine nature of her love  the weeks that immediately followed were strange ones all the elements of life that previously had been realities trivial yet fundamental her work her home her intercourse with the family became fantastic there was the mill to which she went every day she recognized it yet it was not the same mill nor was fillmore street the fillmore street of old nor did the new and feverish existence over whose borderland she had been transported seem real save in certain hours she spent in ditmars company when he made her forgethers being a temperament to feel the weight of an unnatural secrecy she was aware for instance that her mother and even her father thought her conduct odd were anxious as to her absences on certain nights and on sundays she offered no explanation it was impossible she understood that the reason why they refrained from questioning her was due to a faith in her integrity as well as to a respect for her as a breadwinner who lead earned a right to independence and while her suspicion of hannahs anxiety troubled her on the occasions when she thought of it lises attitude disturbed her even more from lise she had been prepared for suspicion arraignment ridicule what a vindication if it were disclosed that she janet had a loverand that lover ditmar but lise said nothing she was remote selfabsorbed hannah spoke about it on the evenings janet stayed at home  she would not consent to meet ditmar every evening yet as the days succeeded one another janet was often astonished by the fact that their love remained apparently unsuspected by mr price and caldwell and others in the office they must have noticed on some occasions the manner in which ditmar looked at her and in business hours she had continually to caution him to keep him in check again on the evening excursions to which she consented though they were careful to meet in unfrequented spots someone might easily have recognized him and she did not like to ponder over the number of young women in the other offices who knew her by sight these reflections weighed upon her particularly when she seemed conscious of curious glances but what caused her the most concern was the constantly recurring pressure to which ditmar himself subjected her and which as time went on she found increasingly difficult to resist he tried to take her by storm and when this method failed resorted to pleadings and supplications even harder to deny because of the innate feminine pity she felt for him to recount these affairs would be a mere repetition of identical occurrences on their second sunday excursion he had actually driven her despite her opposition several miles on the boston road and her resistance only served to inflame him the more it seemed afterwards as she sat unnerved a miracle that she had stopped him then came reproaches she would not trust him they could not be married at once she must understand thatan argument so repugnant as to cause her to shake with sobs of inarticulate anger after this he would grow bewildered then repentant then contrite in contritionhad he known ithe was nearest to victory  as has been said she did not intellectualize her reasons but the core of her resistance was the very essence of an individuality having its roots in a selfrespecting and selfcontrolling inheritancean element wanting in her sister lise it must have been largely the thought of lise the spectacle of liseoften perhaps unconsciously present that dominated her conduct yet reinforcing such an ancestral sentiment was another environmental and more complicated the result in our modern atmosphere of an undefined feminism apt to reveal itself in many undesirable ways but which in reality is a logical projection of the american tradition of liberty to submit was not only to lose her liberty to become a dependent but also and inevitably she thought to lose ditmars love  no experience however is emotionally continuous nor was their intimacy by any means wholly on this plane of conflict there were hours when ditmars passion leaving spent itself they achieved comradeship in the office and out of it revelations for janet when he talked of himself relating the little incidents she found most illuminating and thus by degrees she was able to build up a new and truer estimate of him for example she began to perceive that his life outside of his interest in the mills instead of being the romance of privileged joys she had once imagined had been almost as empty as her own without either unity or direction her perception was none the less keen because definite terms were wanting for its expression the idea of him that first had captivated her was that of an energized and focussed character controlling with a sure hand the fortunes of a great organization of a power in the city and state of a being who in his leisure moments dwelt in a delectable realm from which she was excluded she was still acutely conscious of his force but what she now felt was its lack of directionsave for the portion that drove the chippering mills the rest of it like the river flowed away on the line of least resistance to the sea  as was quite natural this gradual discovery of what he wasor of what he wasntthis truer estimate this partial disillusionment merely served to deepen and intensify the feeling he had aroused in her to heighten likewise the sense of her own value by confirming a belief in her possession of certain qualities of a kind of fibre he needed in a helpmate she dwelt with a womans fascination upon the prospect of exercising a creative influenceeven while she acknowledged the fearful possibility of his power in unguarded moments to overwhelm and destroy her here was another incentive to resist the gusts of his passion she could guide and develop him by helping and improving herself hope and ambition throbbed within her she felt a contempt for his wife for the women who had been her predecessors he had not spoken of these save once or twice by implication but with what may seem a surprising leniency she regarded them as consequences of a life lacking in content if only she could keep her head she might supply that content and bring him happiness the thought of his children troubled her most but she was quick to perceive that he got nothing from them and even though it were partly his own fault she was inclined to lay the heavier blame on the woman who had been their mother the triviality the emptiness of his existence outside of the walls of the mill made her heart beat with pure pity for she could understand it  one of the many and often humorous incidents that served to bring about this realization of a former aimlessness happened on their second sunday excursion this time he had not chosen the kingsbury tavern but another automobilists haunt an enlightening indication of established habits involving a wide choice of resorts while he was paying for luncheon and chatting with the proprietor ditmar snatched from the change he had flung down on the counter a five dollar gold coin  now how in thunder did that get into my righthand pocket i always keep it in my vest he exclaimed and the matter continued to disturb him after they were in the automobile its my lucky piece i guess i was so excited at the prospect of seeing you when i dressed this morning i put it into my change just see what you do to me  does it bring you luck she inquired smilingly  how about you i call you the biggest piece of luck i ever had  youd better not be too sure she warned him  oh im not worrying i has that piece in my pocket the day i went down to see old stephen chippering when he made me agent and ive kept it ever since and ill tell you a funny thingits enough to make any man believe in luck do you remember that day last summer i was tinkering with the car by the canal and you came along  the day you pretended to be tinkering she corrected him  he laughed so you were on to me he said youre a foxy one  anyone could see you were only pretending it made me angry when i thought of it afterwards  i just had to do iti wanted to talk to you but listen to what im going to tell you its a miracle all righthappening just at that timethat very morning i was coming back to boston from new york on the midnight and when the train ran into back bay and i was putting on my trousers the piece rolled out among the bed clothes i didnt know id lost it until i sat down in the parker house to eat my breakfast and i suddenly felt in my pocket it made me sick to think it was gone well i started to telephone the pullman office and then i made up my mind id take a taxi and go down to the south station myself and just as i got out of the cab there was the nigger porter all dressed up in his glad rags coming out of the station i knew him id been on his car lots of times say george i said i didnt forget you this morning did i  no suh said george you done give me a quarter  i guess youre mistaken george says i and i fished out a ten dollar bill you ought to have seen that niggers eyes  whats this for mister ditmar says he  for that lucky gold piece you found in lower seven i told him well trade  was you in lower sevenso you was says george well he had it all rightyou bet he had it now wasnt that queer the very day you and i began to know each other  wonderful janet agreed why dont you put it on your watch chain  well ive thought of that he replied with the air of having considered all sides of the matter but ive got that charm of the secret order i belong tothats on my chain i guess ill keep it in my vest pocket  i didnt know you were so superstitious she mocked  pretty nearly everybodys superstitious he declared and she thought of lise  im not i believe if things are going to happen well theyre going to happen nothing can prevent it  by thunder he exclaimed struck by her remark you are like that youre different from any person i ever knew  from such anecdotes she pieced together her new ditmar he spoke of a large world she had never seen of new york and washington and chicago where he intended to take her in the future he would never travel alone and he told her of his having been a delegate to the last national republican convention explaining what a delegate was he gloried in her innocence and it was pleasant to dazzle her with impressions of his cosmopolitanism in this perhaps he was not quite so successful as he imagined but her eyes shone she had never even been in a sleeping car for her delectation he launched into an enthusiastic description of these vehicles of palatial compartment cars of limited transcontinental trains where one had a stenographer and a barber at ones disposal  neither of them would do me any good she complained  you could go to the manicure he said  there had been in ditmars life certain events which in his anecdotal moods were magnified into matters of climacteric importance high festal occasions on which it was sweet to reminisce such as his visit as delegate at large to that chicago convention he had travelled on a special train stocked with cigars and white seal champagne in the company of senators and congressmen and exgovernors state treasurers collectors of the port mill owners and bankers to whom he referred as the french say in terms of their little names he dwelt on the magnificence of the huge hotel set on the borders of a lake like an inland sea and related such portions of the festivities incidental to the seeing of chicago as would bear repetition no women belonged to this realm no women at least who were to be regarded as persons ditmar did not mention them but no doubt they existed along with the cigars and the white seal champagne contributing to the amenities and the excursion to janet took on the complexion of a sort of glorified picnic in the course of which incidentally a president of the united states had been chosen in her innocence she had believed the voters to perform this function ditmar laughed  do you suppose were going to let the mob run this country he inquired once in a while we cant get away with it as wed like we have to take the best we can  thus was brought home to her more and more clearly that what men strove and fought for were the joys of prominence privilege and power everywhere in the great world they demanded and received consideration it was ditmars boast that if nobody else could get a room in a crowded new york hotel he could always obtain one and she was fain to concedeshe who had never known privilegea certain intoxicating quality to this eminence if you could get the power and refused to take it the more fool you a topsyturvy world in which the stupid toiled day by day week by week exhausting their energies and craving joy while others adroitly carried off the prize and virtue had apparently as little to do with the matter as fair hair or a club foot if janet had ever read darwin she would have recognized in her lover a creature rather wonderfully adapted to his environment and what puzzled her perhaps was the riddle that presents itself to many better informed than herselfthe utter absence in this environment of the sign of any being who might be called god her perplexitiesfor she did have themtook the form of an instinctive sense of inadequacy of persistently recurring though inarticulate convictions of the existence of elements not included in ditmars categoriesof things that money could not buy of things too alas that poverty was as powerless to grasp stored within her sometimes rising to the level of consciousness was that experience at silliston in the may weather when she had had a glimpsejust a glimpse of a garden where strange and precious flowers were in bloom on the other hand this mysterious perception by her of things unseen and hitherto unguessed of rays of delight in the spectrum of values to which his senses were unattuned was for ditmar the supreme essence of her fascination at moments he was at once bewildered and inebriated by the rare delicacy of fabric of the woman whom he had somehow stumbled upon and possessed  then there were the hours when they worked together in the office here she beheld ditmar at his best it cannot be said that his infatuation for her was ever absent from his consciousness he knew she was there beside him he betrayed it continually but here she was in the presence of what had been and what remained his ideal the chippering mill here he acquired unity all his energies were bent toward the successful execution of the bradlaugh order which had to be completed on the first of february and as day after day went by her realization of the magnitude of the task he had undertaken became keener excitement was in the air ditmar seemed somehow to have managed to infuse not only orcutt the superintendent but the foremen and second hands and even the workers with a common spirit of pride and loyalty of interest of determination to carry off this matter triumphantly the mill seemed fairly to hum with effort janets increasing knowledge of its organization and processes only served to heighten her admiration for the confidence ditmar had shown from the beginning it was superb and now as the probability of the successful execution of the task tended more and more toward certainty he sometimes gave vent to his boyish exuberant spirits  i told holster i told all those croakers id do it and by thunder i will do it with three days margin too ill get the last shipment off on the twentyeighth of january why even george chippering was afraid i couldnt handle it if the old man was alive he wouldnt have had cold feet then ditmar added half jocularly half seriously looking down on her as she sat with her notebook waiting for him to go on with his dictation i guess youve had your share in it too youve been a wonder the way youve caught on and taken things off my shoulders if orcutt died i believe you could step right into his shoes  im sure i could step into his shoes she replied only i hope he wont die  i hope he wont either said ditmar and as for you  never mind me now she said  he bent over her  janet youre the greatest girl in the world  yes she was happiest when she felt she was helping him it gave her confidence that she could do more lead him into paths beyond which they might explore together she was useful sometimes however he seemed to her oversanguine though he had worked hard his success had come too easily had been too uniform his temper was quick the prospect of opposition often made him overbearing yet on occasions he listened with surprising patience to his subordinates when they ventured to differ from his opinions at other times janet had seen him overrule them ruthlessly humiliate them there were days when things went wrong when there were delays complications more matters to attend to than usual on one such day after the dinner hour mr orcutt entered the office his long lean face wore a certain expression janet had come to know an expression that always irritated ditmarthe conscientious superintendent having the unfortunate faculty of exaggerating annoyances by his very bearing ditmar stopped in the midst of dictating a peculiarly difficult letter and looked up sharply  well he asked whats the trouble now  orcutt seemed incapable of reading storm signals when anything happened he had the air of declaring i told you so  you may remember i spoke to you once or twice mr ditmar of the talk over the fiftyfour hour law that goes into effect in january  yes what of it ditmar cut in the notices have been posted as the law requires  the hands have been grumbling there are trouble makers among them a delegation came to me this noon and wanted to know whether we intended to cut the pay to correspond to the shorter working hours  of course its going to be cut said ditmar what do they suppose that were going to pay em for work they dont do the hands not paid by the piece are paid practically by the hour not by the day and theres got to be some limit to this thing if these damned demagogues in the legislature keep on cutting down the hours of women and children every three years or soand we cant run the mill without the women and childrenwe might as well shut down right now three years ago when they made it fiftysix hours we were fools to keep up the pay i said so then at the conference but they wouldnt listen to me they listened this time holster and one or two others croaked but we shut em up no they wont get any more pay not a damned cent  orcutt had listened patiently lugubriously  i told them that  what did they say  they said they thought thered be a strike  pooh strike exclaimed ditmar with contemptuous violence do you believe that youre always borrowing trouble you are they may have a strike at one mill the clarendon i hope they do i hope holster gets it in the neckhe dont know how to run a mill anyway we wont have any strike our people understand when theyre well off theyve got all the work they can do theyre sending fortunes back to the old country or piling them up in the banks its all bluff  there was a meeting of the english branch of the i w w last night a committee was appointed said orcutt who as usual took a gloomy satisfaction in the prospect of disaster  the i w w my god orcutt dont you know enough not to come in here wasting my time talking about the i w w those anarchists havent got any organization cant you get that through your head  all right replied orcutt and marched off janet felt rather sorry for him though she had to admit that his manner was exasperating but ditmars anger instead of cooling increased it all seemed directed against the unfortunate superintendent  would you believe that a man whos been in this mill twentyfive years could be such a fool he demanded the i w w why not the ku klux he must think i havent anything to do but chin i dont know why i keep him here sometimes i think hell drive me crazy  his eyes seemed to have grown small and red as was always the case when his temper got the better of him janet did not reply but sat with her pencil poised over her book  lets see where was i he asked i cant finish that letter now go out and do the others  mundane experience like a badly mixed cake has a tendency to run in streaks and on the day following the incident related above janets heart was heavy ditmar betrayed an increased shortness of temper and preoccupation and the consciousness that her love had lent her a clairvoyant power to trace the source of his humours though these were often hidden from or unacknowledged by himselfwas in this instance small consolation she saw clearly enough that the apprehensions expressed by mr orcutt whom he had since denounced as an idiotic old woman had made an impression aroused in him the everabiding concern for the mill which was his lifes passion and which had been but temporarily displaced by his infatuation with her that other passion was paramount what was she beside it would he hesitate for a moment to sacrifice her if it came to a choice between them the tempestuousness of these thoughts when they took possession of her hinting as they did of possibilities in her nature hitherto unguessed and unrevealed astonished and frightened her she sought to thrust them away to reassure herself that his concern for the successful delivery of the bradlaugh order was natural during the morning in the intervals between interviews with the superintendents he was selfabsorbed and she found herself inconsistently resenting the absence of those expressions of endearmentthe glances and stolen caressesfor indulgence in which she had hitherto rebuked him and though pride came to her rescue fuel was added to her feeling by the fact that he did not seem to notice her coolness since he failed to appear after lunch she knew he must be investigating the suspicions orcutt had voiced but at six oclock when he had not returned she closed up her desk and left the office an odour of cheap perfume pervading the corridor made her aware of the presence of miss lottie myers  oh its you said that young woman looking up from the landing of the stairs i might have known it you never make a getaway until after six do you  oh sometimes said janet  i stayed as a special favour tonight miss myers declared but im not so stuck on my job that i cant tear myself away from it  i dont suppose you are said janet  for a moment miss myers looked as if she was about to be still more impudent but her eye met janets and wavered they crossed the bridge in silence well tata she said if you like it its up to you five oclock for mineand walked away up the canal swinging her hips defiantly and janet gazing after her grew hot with indignation and apprehension her relations with ditmar were suspected after all made the subject of the kind of comment indulged in sotto voce by lottie myers and her friends at the luncheon hour she felt a mad primitive desire to run after the girl to spring upon and strangle her and compel her to speak what was in her mind and then retract it and the motor impulse inhibited caused a sensation of sickness of unhappiness and degradation as she turned her steps slowly homeward was it a misinterpretation after allwhat lottie myers had implied and feared to say  in fillmore street supper was over and lise her face contorted her body strained was standing in front of the bureau doing her hair her glance now seeking the mirror now falling again to consult a model in one of those periodicals of froth and fashion that cause such numberless heart burnings in every quarter of our democracy and which are filled with photographs of prominent persons at race meetings horse shows and resorts and with actresses dancersand mannequins janets eyes fell on the open page to perceive that the coiffure her sister so painfully imitated was worn by a young woman with an insolent vapid face and hard eyes whose knees were crossed revealing considerably more than an ankle the picture was labelled a dance at palm beacha flashlight of mrs trudy gascoigneschellone of those mysterious hybrid names which in connection with the thoughts of new york and the visible rakish image of the lady herself cause involuntary shudders down the spine of the reflecting american provincial some such responsive quiver akin to disgust janet herself experienced  its the very last scream lise was saying and say if i owned a ball dress like that id be somebodys lulu all right can i have the pleasure of the next maxixe miss bumpus with deft and rapid fingers she lead parted her hair far on the right side and pulled it down over the left eyebrow twisted it over her ear and tightly around her head inserting here and there a hairpin seizing the hand mirror with the cracked back and holding it up behind her finally when the operation was finished to her satisfaction she exclaimed evidently to the paragon in the picture i get you whereupon from the wardrobe she produced a hat you sure had my number when you guessed the feathers on that other would get draggled she observed in high good humour generously ignoring their former unpleasantness on the subject when she had pinned it on she bent mockingly over her sister who sat on the bed how dyou like my new toque peekaboo thats the way the guys rubberneck to see if youre good lookin  lise was exalted feverish apparently possessed by some high secret her eyes shone and when she crossed the room she whistled bars of ragtime and executed mincing steps of the maxixe fumbling in the upper drawer for a pair of white gloves also new she knocked off the corner of the bureau her velvet bag it opened as it struck the floor and out of it rolled a lilac vanity case and a yellow coin casting a suspicious lightning glance at janet she snatched up the vanity case and covered the coin with her foot  lock the doors she cried with an hysteric giggle then removing her foot she picked up the coin surreptitiously to her amazement her sister made no comment did not seem to have taken in the significance of the episode lise had expected a tempest of indignant searching questions a third degree as she would have put it she snapped the bag together drew on her gloves and when she was ready to leave with characteristic audacity crossed the room taking her sisters face between her hands and kissing her  tell me your troubles sweetheart she saidand did not wait to hear them  janet was incapable of speechnor could she have brought herself to ask lise whether or not the money had been earned at the bagatelle and remained miraculously unspent it was possible but highly incredible and then the vanity case and the new hat were to be accounted for the sight of the gold piece indeed had suddenly revived in janet the queer feeling of faintness almost of nausea she had experienced after parting with lottie myers and by some untoward association she was reminded of a conversation she had had with ditmar on the saturday afternoon following their first sunday excursion when on opening her pay envelope she had found twenty dollars  are you sure im worth it she had demandedand he had been quite sure he had added that she was worth more much more but that he could not give her as yet without the risk of comment a sum commensurate with the value of her services but now she asked herself again was she worth it or was it merelypart of her price going to the wardrobe and opening a drawer at the bottom she searched among her clothes until she discovered the piece of tissue paper in which she had wrapped the rose rescued from the cluster he had given her the petals were dry yet they gave forth still a faint reminiscent fragrance as she pressed them to her face janet wept  the following morning as she was kneeling in a corner of the room by the letter files one of which she had placed on the floor she recognized his step in the outer office heard him pause to joke with young caldwell and needed not the visual proofwhen after a moment he halted on the thresholdof the fact that his usual buoyant spirits were restored he held a cigar in his hand and in his eyes was the eager look with which she had become familiar which indeed she had learned to anticipate as they swept the room in search of her and when they fell on her he closed the door and came forward impetuously but her exclamation caused him to halt in bewilderment  dont touch me she said  and he stammered out as he stood over herwhats the matter  everything you dont love mei was a fool to believe you did  dont love you he repeated my god whats the trouble now what have i done  oh its nothing youve done its what you havent done its what you cant do you dont really care for meall you care for is this millwhen anything happens here you dont know im alive  he stared at her and then an expression of comprehension of intense desire grew in his eyes and his laugh as he flung his cigar out of the open window and bent down to seize her was almost brutal she fought him she tried to hurt him and suddenly convulsively pressed herself to him  you little tigress he said as he held her you were jealouswere youjealous of the mill and he laughed again id like to see you with something really to be jealous about so you love me like that do you  she could feel his heart beating against her  i wont be neglected she told him tensely i want all of youif i cant have all of you i dont want any do you understand  do i understand well i guess i do  you didnt yesterday she reproached him somewhat dazed by the swiftness of her submission and feeling still the traces of a lingering resentment she had not intended to surrender you forgot all about me you didnt know i was here much less that i was hurt oh i was hurt and youi can tell at once when anythings wrong with youi know without your saying it  he was amazed he might indeed have been troubled and even alarmed by this passion he had aroused had his own passion not been at the flood and as he wiped away her tears with his handkerchief he could scarcely believe his senses that this was the woman whose resistance had demanded all his force to overcome indeed although he recognized the symptoms she betrayed as feminine as having been registeredthough feebly compared to this by incidents in his past precisely his difficulty seemed to be in identifying this complex and galvanic being as a woman not as something almost fearful in her significance outside the bounds of experience  presently she ceased to tremble and he drew her to the window the day was as mild as autumn the winter sun like honey in its mellowness a soft haze blurred the outline of the upper bridge  only two more days until sunday he whispered caressingly exultantly     chapter xii  it had been a strange year in hampton unfortunate for coal merchants welcome to the poor but sunday lacked the transforming touch of sunshine the weather was damp and cold as janet set out from fillmore street ditmar she knew would be waiting for her he counted on her and she could not bear to disappoint him to disappoint herself and all the doubts and fears that from time to time had assailed her were banished by this impulse to go to him to be with him he loved her the words as she sat in the trolley car ran in her head like the lilt of a song what did the weather matter  when she alighted at the lonely crossroads snow had already begun to fall but she spied the automobile with its top raised some distance down the lane and in a moment she was in it beside him wrapped in the coat she had now come to regard as her own he buttoned down the curtains and took her in his arms  what shall we do today she asked if it snows  dont let that worry you sweetheart he said i have the chains on i can get through anything in this car  he was in high almost turbulent spirits as he turned the car and drove it out of the rutty lane into the state road the snow grew thicker and thicker still the world was blotted out by swiftly whirling feathery flakes that melted on the windshield and through the wet glass janet caught distorted glimpses of black pines and cedars beside the highway  the ground was spread with fleece occasionally and with startling suddenness other automobiles shot like dark phantoms out of the whiteness and like phantoms disappeared presently through the veil she recognized sillistona very different silliston from that she had visited on the fragrant day in springtime when the green on the common had been embroidered with dandelions and the great elms whose bare branches were now fantastically traced against the flowing veil of whiteheavy with leaf vignettes emergedonly to fadeof the oldworld houses whose quaint beauty had fascinated and moved her and she found herself wondering what had become of the strange man she had mistaken for a carpenter all that seemed to have taken place in a past life she asked ditmar where he was going  boston he told her theres no other place to go  but youll never get back if it goes on snowing like this  well the trains are still running he assured her with a quizzical smile how about it little girl it was a term of endearment derived undoubtedly from a theatrical source in which he sometimes indulged  she did not answer surprisingly today she did not care all she could think of all she wanted was to go on and on beside him with the world shut outon and on forever she was hiswhat did it matter they were on their way to boston she began dreamily to think about boston to try to restore it in her imagination to the exalted place it had held before she met ditmar to reconstruct it from vague memories of childhood when in two of the family peregrinations she had crossed it traces remained of emotionallytoned impressions acquired when she had walked about the city holding edwards handof a long row of stately houses with forbidding fronts set on a hillside of a wide treecovered space where children were playing and her childish verdict persisting today was one of inaccessibility impenetrability of jealously guarded wealth and beauty those houses and the treasures she was convinced they must contain were not for her some of the panes of glass in their windows were purpleshe remembered a little thing like that and asking her father the reason he hadnt known this purple quality had somehow steeped itself into her memory of boston and even now the colour stood for the word impenetrable that was extraordinary even now well they were going to boston if ditmar had said they were going to bagdad it would have been quite as credibleand incredible wherever they were going it was into the larger larger life and walls were to crumble before them walls through which they would pass even as they rent the white veil of the storm into regions of beauty  and now the world seemed abandoned to them alone so empty so still were the white villages flitting by so empty so still the great parkway of the fells stretching away and away like an enchanted forest under the snow like the domain of some sleeping king and the flakes melted silently into the black waters and the wide avenue to which they came led to a sleeping palace no it was a city somerville ditmar told her as they twisted in and out of streets past stores churches and fireengine houses breasted the heights descended steeply on the far side into cambridge and crossed the long bridge over the charles and here at last was bostonbeacon street the heart or funnel of it as one chose ditmar removing one of the side curtains that she might see with just a hint in his voice of a reverence she was too excited to notice pointed out the stern and respectable facades of the twin chippering mansions standing side by side save for these shrinesfor such in some sort they were to himthe back bay in his eyes was nothing more than a collection of houses inhabited by people whom money and social position made unassailable but today he too was excited never had he been more keenly aware of her sensitiveness to experience and he to whom it had not occurred to wonder at boston wondered at her who seemed able to summon forth a presiding brooding spirit of the place from out of the snow deep in her eyes though they sparkled was the reflection of some mystic vision her cheeks were flushed and in her delight vicariously his own he rejoiced in his trembling hope of more delight to come which this mentorship would enhancedespite the fast deepening snow he drove her up one side of commonwealth avenue and down the other encircling the common and the public garden stopping at the top of park street that she might gaze up at the state house whose golden dome seen through the veil was tinged with blue boston why not russia janet was speechless for sheer lack of words to describe what she felt  at length he brought the car to a halt opposite an imposing doorway in front of which a glass roof extended over the pavement and janet demanded where they were  well weve got to eat havent we ditmar replied she noticed that he was shivering  are you cold she inquired with concern  i guess i am a little he replied i dont know why i should be in a fur coat but ill be warm soon enough now  a man in blue livery hurried toward them across the sidewalk helping them to alight and ditmar after driving the car a few paces beyond the entrance led her through the revolving doors into a long corridor paved with marble and lighted by bulbs glowing from the ceiling where benches were set against the wall overspread by the leaves of potted plants set in the intervals between them  sit down a moment he said to her i must telephone to have somebody take that car or itll stay there the rest of the winter  she sat down on one of the benches the soft light the warmth the exotic odour of the plants the welldressed people who trod softly the strip of carpet set on the marble with the air of being at homeall contributed to an excitement intense yet benumbing she could not think she didnt want to thinkonly to feel to enjoy to wring the utmost flavour of enchantment from these new surroundings and her face wore the expression of one in a dream presently she saw ditmar returning followed by a boy in a blue uniform  all right he said at the end of the corridor was an elevator in which they were shot to one of the upper floors and the boy inserting a key in a heavy mahogany door revealed a sittingroom between its windows was a table covered with a long white cloth reaching to the floor on which amidst the silverware and glass was set a tall vase filled with dusky roses janet drawing in a deep breath of their fragrance glanced around the room the hangings the wallpaper the carpet the velvet upholstery of the mahogany chairs of the wide lounge in the corner were of a deep and restful green the marble mantelpiece with its english coal grate was copiedhad she known itfrom a mansion of the georgian period the hands of a delicate georgian clock pointed to one and in the large mirror behind the clock she beheld an image she supposed dreamily to be herself the bell boy was taking off her coat which he hung with ditmars on a rack in a corner  shall i light the fire sir he asked  sure said ditmar and tell them to hurry up with lunch  the boy withdrew closing the door silently behind him  were going to have lunch here janet exclaimed  why not i thought it would be nicer than a public diningroom and when i got up this morning and saw what the weather was i telephoned he placed two chairs before the fire which had begun to blaze isnt it cosy he said taking her hands and pulling her toward him his own hands trembled the tips of his fingers were cold  you are cold she said  not nownot now he replied the queer vibrations were in his voice that she had heard before sweetheart this is the best yet isnt it and after that trip in the storm  its beautiful she murmured gently drawing away from him and looking around her once more i never was in a room like this  well youll be in plenty more of them he exulted sit down beside the fire and get warm yourself  she obeyed and he took the chair at her side his eyes on her face as usual she was beyond him and despite her exclamations of surprise of appreciation and pleasure she maintained the outward poise the inscrutability that summed up for him her uniqueness in the world of woman she sat as easily upright in the delicate chippendale chair as though she had been born to it he made wild surmises as to what she might be thinking was she as she seemed taking all this as a matter of course she imposed on him an impelling necessity to speak to say anythingit did not matter whatand he began to dwell on the excellences of the hotel she did not appear to hear him her eyes lingering on the room until presently she askedwhats the name of this hotel  he told her  i thought they only allowed married people to come like this in a private room  oh he beganand the sudden perception that she had made this statement impartially added to his perplexity well he was able to answer were as good as married arent we janet he leaned toward her he put his hand on hers the manager here is an old friend of mine he knows were as good as married  another old friend she queried and the touch of humour in spite of his taut nerves delighted him  yes yes he laughed rather uproariously ive got em everywhere as thick as landmarks  you seem to she said  i hope youre hungry he said  not very she replied its all so strangethis day claude its like a fairy story coming here to boston in the snow and this place andand being with you  you still love me he cried getting up  you must know that i do she answered simply raising her face to his and he stood gazing down into it with an odd expression she had never seen before whats the matter she asked  nothingnothing he assured her but continued to look at her youre soso wonderful he whispered i just cant believe it  and if its hard for you she answered think what it must be for me and she smiled up at him  ditmar had known a moment of awe suddenly he took her face between his hands and pressed his rough cheek against it blindly his hands trembled his body was shaken as by a spasm  why youre still cold claude she cried anxiously  and he stammered out im notits youits having you  before she could reply to this strange exclamation to which nevertheless some fire in her leaped in response there came a knock at the door and he drew away from her as he answered it two waiters entered obsequiously one bearing a serving table the other holding above his head a large tray containing covered dishes and glasses  i could do with a cocktail ditmar exclaimed and the waiter smiled as he served them heres how he said giving her a glass containing a yellow liquid  she tasted it made a grimace and set it down hastily  whats the trouble he asked laughing as she hurried to the table and took a drink of water  its horrid she cried  oh youll get over that idea he told her youll be crazy about em  i never want to taste another she declared  he laughed again he had taken his at a swallow but almost nullifying its effect was this confirmationif indeed he had needed itof the extent of her inexperience she was in truth untouched by the worldthe world in which he had lived he pulled out her chair for her and she sat down confronted by a series of knives forks and spoons on either side of a plate of oysters oysters served in this fashion needless to say had never formed part of the menu in fillmore street or in any hampton restaurant where she had lunched but she saw that ditmar had chosen a little fork with three prongs and she followed his example  you mustnt tell me you dont like cotuits he exclaimed  she touched one delicately with her fork  theyre alive she exclaimed though the custom of consuming them thus was by no means unknown to her lise had often boasted of a taste for oysters on the shell though really preferring them smothered with red catsup in a cocktail  theyre alive but they dont know it they wont eat you ditmar replied gleefully squeeze a little lemon on one another sort of woman he reflected would have feigned a familiarity with the dish  she obeyed him put one in her mouth gave a little shiver and swallowed it quickly  well he said it isnt bad is it  it seems so queer to eat anything alive and enjoy it she said as she ate the rest of them  if you think theyre good here you ought to taste them on the cape right out of the water he declared and went on to relate how he had once eaten a fabulous number in a contest with a friend of his and won a bet he was fond of talking about wagers he had won betting had lent a zest to his life well roll down there together some day next summer little girl its a great place you can go in swimming three times a day and never feel it and talk about eating oysters you cant swallow em as fast as a fellow i know down there joe pusey can open em its some trick to open em  he described the process but shescarcely listened she was striving to adjust herself to the elements of a new and revolutionary experience to the waiters who came and went softly deferentially putting hot plates before her helping her to strange and delicious things a creamy soup a fish with a yellow sauce whose ingredients were artfully disguised a breast of guinea fowl a salad an ice and a small cup of coffee instincts and tastes hitherto unsuspected and ungratified were aroused in her what would it be like always to be daintily served to eat ones meals in this leisurely and luxurious manner as her physical hunger was satisfied by the dainty food even as her starved senses drank in the caressing warmth and harmony of the room the gleaming fire the heavy scent of the flowers the rose glow of the lights in contrast to the storm withoutso the storm flinging itself against the windows powerless to reach her seemed to typify a former existence of cold black mornings and factory bells and harsh sirens of toil and limitations had her existence been like that or was it a dream a nightmare from which she had awakened at last from time to time deep within her she felt persisting a conviction that that was reality this illusion but she fought it down she wantedoh how she wanted to believe in the illusion  facing her was the agent the genius the man who had snatched her from that existence who had at his command these delights to bestow she loved him she belonged to him he was to be her husbandyet there were moments when the glamour of this oddly tended to dissolve when an objective vision intruded and she beheld herself as though removed from the body lunching with a strange man in a strange place and once it crossed her mindwhat would she think of another woman who did this what would she think if it were lise she could not then achieve a sense of identity it was as though she had partaken of some philtre lulling her inhibiting her power to grasp the fact in its enormity and little by little grew on her the realization of what all along she had known that the spell of these surroundings to which she had surrendered was an expression of the man himself he was the source of it more and more as he talked his eyes troubled and stirred her the touch of his hand as he reached across the table and laid it on hers burned her when the waiters had left them alone she could stand the strain no longer and she rose and strayed about the room examining the furniture the curtains the crystal pendants faintly pink that softened and diffused the light and she paused before the grand piano in the corner  id like to be able to play she said  you can learn he told her  im too old  he laughed and as he sat smoking his eyes followed her ceaselessly  above the sofa hung a large print of the circus maximus with crowded tiers mounting toward the sky and awninged boxes where sat the vestal virgins and the emperor high above a motley serried group on the sand at the mouth of a tunnel a lion stood motionless menacing regarding them the picture fascinated janet  its meant to be rome isnt it she asked  what that i guess so he got up and came over to her sure he said im not very strong on history but i read a book once a novel which told how those old fellows used to like to see christians thrown to the lions just as we like to see football games ill get the book againwell read it together  janet shivered heres another picture he said turning to the other side of the room it was apparently an engraved copy of a modern portrait of a woman in evening dress with shapely arms and throat and a small aristocratic head around her neck was hung a heavy rope of pearls  isnt she beautiful janet sighed  beautiful he led her to the mirror look he said ill buy you pearls janet i want to see them gleaming against your skin she cant compare to you illill drape you with pearls  no no she cried i dont want them claude i dont want them please she scarcely knew what she was saying and as she drew away from him her hands went out were pressed together with an imploring supplicating gesture he seized them his nearness was suffocating her she flung herself into his arms and their lips met in a long swooning kiss she began instinctively but vainly to struggle not against himbut against a primal thing stronger than herself stronger than he stronger than codes and conventions and institutions which yet she craved fiercely as her beings fulfilment it was sweeping them dizzilywhither the sheer sweetness and terror of it  dont dont she murmured desperately you mustnt  janetwere going to be married sweetheartjust as soon as we can wont you trust me for gods sake dont be cruel youre my wife now  his voice seemed to come from a great distance and from a great distance too her own in reply drowned as by falling waters  do you love mewill you love me alwaysalways  and he answered hoarsely yesalwaysi swear it janet he had found her lips again he was pulling her toward a door on the far side of the room and suddenly as he opened it her resistance ceased  the snow made automobiling impossible and at half past nine that evening ditmar had escorted janet to the station in a cab and she had taken the train for hampton for a while she sat as in a trance she knew that something had happened something portentous cataclysmic which had irrevocably changed her from the janet bumpus who had left hampton that same morningan age ago but she was unable to realize the metamorphosis in the course of a single day she had lived a lifetime exhausted the range of human experience until now she was powerless to feel any more the car was filled with all sorts and conditions of people returning to homes scattered through the suburbs and smaller cities north of bostona mixed sundaynight crowd and presently she began in a detached way to observe them their aspects their speech and manners had the queer effect of penetrating her consciousness without arousing the emotional judgments of approval or disapproval which normally should have followed ordinarily she might have felt a certain sympathy for the fragile young man on the seat beside her who sat moodily staring through his glasses at the floor and the group across the aisle would surely have moved her to disgust two couples were seated visavis the men apparently making fun of a pony coat one of the girls was wearing in spite of her shrieks which drew general attention they pulled it from her backan operation regarded by the conductor himself with tolerant amusement whereupon her companion a big blond teuton with an inane guffaw boldly thrust an arm about her waist and held her while he presented the tickets janet beheld all this as one sees dancers through a glass without hearing the music  behind her two men fell into conversation  i guess theres well over a foot of snow i thought wed have an open winter too  look out for them when they start in mild  i was afraid this darned road would be tied up if i waited until morning im in real estate and theres a deal on in my town ive got to watch every minute  even the talk between two slouchhatted millhands foreigners failed at the time to strike janet as having any significance they were discussing with some heat the prospect of having their pay reduced by the fiftyfour hour law which was to come into effect on monday they denounced the mill owners  they speed up the machine and make work harder said one i think we goin to have a strike sure  bad sisson too to have strike replied the second pessimistically it will be cold winter now  across the black square of the window drifted the stray lights of the countryside and from time to time when the train stopped she gazed out unheeding at the figures moving along the dim station platforms suddenly without premeditation or effort she began to live over again the day beginning with the wonders half revealed half hidden of that journey through the whiteness to boston awakened listening she heard beating louder and louder on the shores of consciousness the waves of the storm which had swept her awaywaves like crashing chords of music she breathed deeply she turned her face to the window seeming to behold reflected there as in a crystal all her experiences little and great great and little she was seated once more leaning back in the corner of the carriage on her way to the station she felt ditmars hand working in her own and she heard his voice pleading forgivenessfor her silence alarmed him and she heard herself sayingit was my fault as much as yours  and his vehement replyit wasnt anybodys faultit was natural it was wonderful janet i cant bear to see you sad  to see her sad twice during the afternoon and evening he had spoken those wordsor was it three times was there a time she had forgotten and each time she had answered im not sad what she had felt indeed was not sadnessbut how could she describe it to him when she herself was amazed and dwarfed by it could he not feel it too were men so different in the cab his solicitation his tenderness were only to be compared with his bewilderment his apparent awe of the feeling he himself had raised up in her and which awed her likewise she had actually felt that bewilderment of his when just before they had reached the station she had responded passionately to his last embrace even as he returned her caresses it had been conveyed to her amazingly by the quality of his touch was it a lack all women felt in men and were these even in supreme moments merely the perplexed transmitters of lifenot life itself her thoughts did not gain this clarity though she divined the secret and yet she loved himloved him with a fierceness that frightened her with a tenderness that unnerved her  at the hampton station she took the trolley alighting at the common following the narrow path made by pedestrians in the heavy snow to fillmore street she climbed the dark stairs opened the diningroom door and paused on the threshold hannah and edward sat there under the lamp hannah scanning through her spectacles the pages of a sunday newspaper on perceiving janet she dropped it hastily in her lap  well i was concerned about you in all this storm she exclaimed thank goodness youre home anyway you havent seen lise have you  lise janet repeated hasnt she been home  your father and i have been alone all day long not that it is so uncommon for lise to be gone i wish it wasnt but you when you didnt come home for supper i was considerably worried  janet sat down between her mother and father and began to draw off her gloves  im going to marry mr ditmar she announced  for a few moments the silence was broken only by the ticking of the oldfashioned clock  mr ditmar said hannah at length youre going to marry mr ditmar  edward was still inarticulate his face twitched his eyes watered as he stared at her  not right away said janet  well i must say you take it rather cool declared hannah almost resentfully you come in and tell us youre going to marry mr ditmar just like you were talking about the weather  hannahs eyes filled with tears there had been indeed an unconscious lack of consideration in janets abrupt announcement which had fallen like a spark on the dry tinder of hannahs hope the result was a suffocating flame janet whom love had quickened had a swift perception of this she rose quickly and took hannah in her arms and kissed her it was as though the relation between them were reversed and the daughter had now become the mother and the comforter  i always knew something like this would happen said edward his words incited hannah to protest  you didnt anything of the kind edward bumpus she exclaimed  just to think of janet livin in that big house up in warren street he went on unheeding jubilant youll drop in and see the old people once in a while janet you wont forget us  i wish you wouldnt talk like that father said janet  well hes a fine man claude ditmar i always said that the way he stops and talks to me when he passes the gate  that doesnt make him a good man hannah declared and added if he wasnt a good man janet wouldnt be marrying him  i dont know whether hes good or not said janet  thats so too observed hannah approvingly we cant any of us tell till weve tried em and then its too late to change id like to see him but i guess he wouldnt care to come down here to fillmore street the difference between ditmars social and economic standing and their own suggested appalling complications to her mind i suppose i wont get a sight of him till after youre married and not much then  theres plenty of time to think about that mother answered janet  id want to have everything decent and regular hannah insisted we may be poor but we come of good stock as your father says  itll be all rightmr ditmar will behave like a gentleman edward assured her  i thought i ought to tell you about it janet said but you mustnt mention it yet not even to lise lise will talk mr ditmars very busy nowhe hasnt made any plans  i wish lise could get married exclaimed hannah irrelevantly shes been acting so queer lately shes not been herself at all  now there you go borrowing trouble mother edward exclaimed he could not take his eyes from janet but continued to regard her with benevolence lisell get married some day i dont suppose we can expect another mr ditmar  well said hannah presently theres no use sitting up all night she rose and kissed janet again i just cant believe it she declared but i guess its so if you say it is  of course its so said edward  i so want you should be happy janet said hannah  was it so her mother and father the dwarfed and ugly surroundings of fillmore street made it seem incredible once more andwhat would they say if they knew what had happened to her this day when she had reached her room janet began to wonder why she had told her parents had it not been in order to relieve their anxietyespecially her motherson the score of her recent absences from home yes that was it and because the news would make them happy and then the mere assertion to them that she was to marry ditmar helped to make it more real to herself but now that reality was fading again she was unable to bring it within the scope of her imagination her mind refused to hold one remembered circumstance long enough to coordinate it with another she realized that she was tiredtoo tired to think any more but despite her exhaustion there remained within her possessing her as it were overshadowing her unrelated to future or past the presence of the man who had awakened her to an intensity of life hitherto unconceived when her head touched the pillow she fell asleep  when the bells and the undulating scream of the siren awoke her she lay awhile groping in the darkness where was she who was she the discovery of the fact that the nail of the middle finger on her right hand was broken gave her a clew she had broken that nail in reaching out to save somethinga vase of rosesthat was ita vase of roses on a table with a white cloth ditmar had tipped it over the sudden flaring up of this trivial incident served to reestablish her identity to light a fuse along which her mind began to run like fire illuminating redly all the events of the day before it was sweet to lie thus to possess as her very own these precious passionate memories of life lived at last to fulness to feel that she had irrevocably given herself and takenall a longing to see ditmar again invaded her he would take an early train he would be at the office by nine how could she wait until then  with a movement that had become habitual subconscious she reached out her hand to arouse her sister the coldness of the sheets on the right side of the bed sent a shiver through hera shiver of fear  lise she called but there was no answer from the darkness and janet trembling her heart beating wildly sprang from the bed searched for the matches and lit the gas there was no sign of lise her clothes which she had the habit of flinging across the chairs were nowhere to be seen janets eyes fell on the bureau marked the absence of several knickknacks including a comb and brush and with a sudden sickness of apprehension she darted to the wardrobe and flung open the doors in the bottom were a few odd garments above was the hat with the purple feather now shabby and discarded on the hooks a skirt and jacket lise wore to work at the bagatelle in bad weather that was all janet sank down in the rockingchair her hands clasped together overwhelmed by the sudden apprehension of the tragedy that had lurked all unsuspected in the darkness a tragedy not of lise alone but in which she herself was somehow involved just why this was so she could not for the moment declare the room was cold she was clad only in a nightdress but surges of heat ran through her body what should she do she must think but thought was impossible she got up and closed the window and began to dress with feverish rapidity pausing now and again to stand motionless in one such moment there entered her mind an incident that oddly had made little impression at the time of its occurrence because she janet had been blinded by the prospect of her own happinessthat happiness which a few minutes ago had seemed so real and vital a thing and it was the memory of this incident that suddenly threw a glaring evil light on all of lises conduct during the past monthsher accidental dropping of the vanity case and the gold coin now she knew for a certainty what had happened to her sister  having dressed herself she entered the kitchen which was warm filled with the smell of frying meat streaks of grease smoke floated fantastically beneath the low ceiling and hannah with the fryingpan in one hand and a fork in the other was bending over the stove wisps of her scant whitening hair escaped from the ridiculous tightly drawn knot at the back of her head in the light of the flickering gasjet she looked so old and worn that a sudden pity smote janet and made her dumbpity for her mother pity for herself pity for lise pity that lent a staggering insight into life itself hannah had once been young desirable perhaps swayed by those forces which had swayed her janet wondered why she had never guessed this before and why she had guessed it now but it was hannah who looking up and catching sight of janets face was quick to divine the presage in it and gave voice to the foreboding that had weighed on her for many weeks  wheres lise  and janet could not answer she shook her head hannah dropped the fork the handle of the frying pan and crossed the room swiftly seizing janet by the shoulders  is she gone i knew it i felt it all along i thought shed done something she was afraid to tell abouti tried to ask her but i couldnti couldnt and now shes gone oh my god ill never forgive myself  the unaccustomed sight of her mothers grief was terrible for an instant only she clung to janet then becoming mute she sat down in the kitchen chair and stared with dry unseeing eyes at the wall her face twitched janet could not bear to look at it to see the torture in her mothers eyes she janet seemed suddenly to have grown old herself to have lived through ages of misery and tragedy she was aware of a pungent odour went to the stove picked up the fork and turned the steak now and then she glanced at hannah grief seemed to have frozen her then from the diningroom she heard footsteps and edward stood in the doorway  well whats the matter with breakfast he asked from where he stood he could not see hannahs face but gradually his eyes were drawn to her figure his intuition was not quick and some moments passed before the rigidity of the pose impressed itself upon him  is mother sick he asked falteringly  janet went to him but it was hannah who spoke  lise has gone she said  lisegone edward repeated gone where  shes run awayshes disgraced us hannah replied in a monotonous dulled voice  edward did not seem to understand and presently janet felt impelled to break the silence  she didnt come home last night father  didnt come home mebbe she spent the night with a friend he said  it seemed incredible at such a moment that he could still be hopeful  no shes gone i tell you shes lost well never lay eyes on her again my god i never thought shed come to this but i might have guessed it lise lise to think its my lise  hannahs voice echoed pitifully through the silence of the flat so appealing so heartbroken was the cry one might have thought that lise wherever she was would have heard it edward was dazed by the shock his lower lip quivered and fell he walked over to hannahs chair and put his hand on her shoulder  there there mother he pleaded if shes gone well find her well bring her back to you  hannah shook her head she pushed back her chair abruptly and going over to the stove took the fork from janets hand and put the steak on the dish  go in there and set down edward she said i guess weve got to have breakfast just the same whether shes gone or not  it was terrible to see hannah with that look on her face going about her tasks automatically and edward too seemed suddenly to have become aged and broken his trust in the world so amazingly preserved through many vicissitudes shattered at last he spilled his coffee when he tried to drink and presently he got up and wandered about the room searching for his overcoat it was janet who found it and helped him on with it he tried to say something but failing departed heavily for the mill janet began to remove the dishes from the table  youve got to eat something too before you go to work said hannah  ive had all i want janet replied  hannah followed her into the kitchen the scarcely touched food was laid aside the coffeepot emptied hannah put the cups in the basin in the sink and let the water run she turned to janet and seized her hands convulsively  let me do this mother said janet she knew her mother was thinking of the newlyfound joy that lises disgrace had marred but she released her hands gently and took the mop from the nail on which it hung  you sit down mother she said  hannah would not they finished the dishes together in silence while the light of the new day stole in through the windows janet went into her room set it in order made up the bed put on her coat and hat and rubbers then she returned to hannah who seized her  it aint going to spoil your happiness  but janet could not answer she kissed her mother and went out down the stairs into the street the day was sharp and cold and bracing and out of an azure sky the sun shone with dazzling brightness on the snow which the west wind was whirling into little eddies of white smoke leaving on the drifts delicate scalloped designs like those printed by waves on the sands of the sea they seemed to janet that morning hatefully beautiful in front of his tin shop whistling cheerfully and labouring energetically with a shovel to clean his sidewalk was johnny tiernan the tip of his pointed nose made very red by the wind  good morning miss bumpus he said now if youd only waited awhile id have had it as clean as a parlour its fine weather for coal bills  she halted  can i see you a moment mr tiernan  johnny looked at her  why sure he said leaning his shovel against the wall he gallantly opened the door that she might pass in before him and then led the way to the back of the shop where the stove was glowing hospitably he placed a chair for her now what can i be doing to serve you he asked  its about my sister said janet  miss lise  i thought you might know what man shes been going with lately said janet  mr tiernan had often wondered how much janet knew about her sister in spite of a momentary embarrassment most unusual in him the courage of her question made a strong appeal and his quick sympathies suspected the tragedy behind her apparent calmness he met her magnificently  why he said i have seen miss lise with a fellow named duvalhoward duvalwhen hes been in town he travels for a boston shoe house humphrey and gillmount  im afraid lise has gone away with him said janet i thought you might be able to find out something about him andwhether any one had seen them she left home yesterday morning  for an instant mr tiernan stood silent before her his legs apart his fingers running through his bristly hair  well ye did right to come straight to me miss janet its me that can find out if anybody can and its glad i am to help you just you stay heremake yourself at home while i run down and see some of the boys ill not be longand dont be afraid ill let on about it  he seized his overcoat and departed presently the sun glinting on the sheets of tin started janets glance straying around the shop noting its disorderly details the heapedup stovepipes the littered workbench with the shears lying across the vise once she thought of ditmar arriving at the office and wondering what had happened to her the sound of a bell made her jump mr tiernan had returned  shes gone with him said janet not as a question but as one stating a fact  mr tiernan nodded  they took the ninethirtysix for boston yesterday morning eddy colahan was at the depot  janet rose thank you she said simply  what are you going to do he asked  im going to boston she answered im going to find out where she is  then its me thats going with you he announced  oh no mr tiernan she protested i couldnt let you do that  and why not he demanded ive got a little business there myself im proud to go with you its your sister you want isnt it  yes  well what would you be doing by yourselfa young lady how will you find your sister  do you think you can find her  sure i can find her he proclaimed confidently he had evidently made up his mind that casual treatment was what the affair demanded havent i good friends in boston by friendship he swayed his world nor was he completely unknownthough he did not say soto certain influential members of his race of the boston police department pulling out a large nickel watch and observing that they had just time to catch the train he locked up his shop and they set out together for the station mr tiernan led the way for the path was narrow the dry snow squeaked under his feet  after escorting her to a seat on the train he tactfully retired to the smoking car not to rejoin her until they were on the trestle spanning the charles river by the north station all the way to boston she had sat gazing out of the window at the blinding whiteness of the fields incapable of rousing herself to the necessity of thought to a degree of feeling commensurate with the situation she did not know what she would say to lise if she should find her and in spite of mr tiernans expressed confidence the chances of success seemed remote when the train began to thread the crowded suburbs the city spreading out over its hills instead of thrilling her as yesterday with a sense of dignity and power of opportunity and emancipation seemed a labyrinth with many warrens where vice and crime and sorrow could hide in front of the station the traffic was already crushing the snow into filth they passed the spot where the night before the carriage had stopped where ditmar had bidden her goodbye something stirred within her became a shooting pain she asked mr tiernan what he intended to do  im going right after the man if hes here in the city he told her and they boarded a street car which almost immediately shot into the darkness of the subway emerging at scollay square and walking a few blocks they came to a window where guns revolvers and fishing tackle were displayed and on which was painted the name timothy mulally mr tiernan entered  is tim in he inquired of one of the clerks who nodded his head towards the rear of the store where a middleaged greyhaired irishman was seated at a desk under a drop light  is it you johnny he exclaimed looking up  its meself said mr tiernan and this is miss bumpus a young lady friend of mine from hampton  mr mulally rose and bowed  how do ye do maam he said  ive got a little business to do for her mr tiernan continued i thought you might offer her a chair and let her stay here quiet while i was gone  with pleasure maam mr mulally replied pulling forward a chair with alacrity just sit there comfortableno one will disturb ye  when in the course of half an hour mr tiernan returned there was a grim yet triumphant look in his little blue eyes but it was not until janet had thanked mr mulally for his hospitality and they had reached the sidewalk that he announced the result of his quest  well i caught him its lucky we came when we didhe was just going out on the road again up to maine i know where miss lise is  he told you exclaimed janet  he told me indeed but it wasnt any joy to him he was all for bluffing at first its easy to scare the likes of him he was as white as his collar before i was done with him he knows who i am all right hes heard of me in hampton mr tiernan added with a pardonable touch of pride  what did you say inquired janet curiously  say repeated mr tiernan its not much i had to say miss janet i was all ready to go to mr gillmount his boss im guessing he wont take much pleasure on this trip  she asked for no more details     chapter xiii  once more janet and mr tiernan descended into the subway taking a car going to the south and west which finally came out of the tunnel into a broad avenue lined with shabby shops hotels and saloons and long rows of boardingand roominghouses they alighted at a certain corner walked a little way along a street unkempt and dreary mr tiernan scrutinizing the numbers until he paused in front of a house with a basement kitchen and snowcovered sandstone steps climbing these he pulled the bell and they stood waiting in the twilight of a halfclosed vestibule until presently shuffling steps were heard within the door was cautiously opened not more than a foot but enough to reveal a woman in a loose wrapper with an untidy mass of bleached hair and a puffy face like a fungus grown in darkness  i want to see miss lise bumpus mr tiernan demanded  youve got the wrong place there aint no one of that name here said the woman  there aint all right he insisted aggressively pushing open the door in spite of her if you dont let this young lady see her quick theres trouble coming to you  who are you asked the woman impudently yet showing signs of fear  never mind who i am mr tiernan declared i know all about you and i know all about duval if you dont want any trouble you wont make any and youll take this young lady to her sister ill wait here for you miss janet he added  i dont know nothing about hershe rented my room thats all i know the woman replied sullenly if you mean that couple that came here yesterday  she turned and led the way upstairs mounting slowly and janet followed nauseated and almost overcome by the foul odours of dead cigarette smoke which mingling with the smell of cooking cabbage rising from below seemed the very essence and reek of hitherto unimagined evil a terror seized her such as she had never known before an almost overwhelming impulse to turn and regain the air and sunlight of the day in the dark hallway of the second story the woman knocked at the door of a front room  shes in there unless shes gone out and indeed a voice was heard petulantly demanding what was wantedlises voice janet hesitated her hand on the knob her body fallen against the panels then as she pushed open the door the smell of cigarette smoke grew stronger and she found herself in a large bedroom the details of which were instantly photographed on her mindthe dingy claretred walls the crayon over the mantel of a buxom lady in a decollete costume of the 90s the outspread fan concealing the fireplace the soiled lace curtains the bed was unmade and on the table beside two empty beer bottles and glasses and the remains of a box of candysuggestive of a sunday purchase at a drug storeshe recognized lises vanity case the effect of all this integrated at a glance was a paralyzing horror janet could not speak she remained gazing at lise who paid no attention to her entrance but stood with her back turned before an oldfashioned bureau with a marble top and raised sides she was dressed and engaged in adjusting her hat it was not until janet pronounced her name that she turned swiftly  you she exclaimed what thewhat brought you here  oh lise janet repeated  how did you get here lise demanded coming toward her who told you where i was what business have you got sleuthing round after me like this  for a moment janet was speechless once more astounded that lise could preserve her effrontery in such an atmosphere could be insensible to the evils lurking in this houseevils so real to janet that she seemed actually to feel them brushing against her  lise come away from here she pleaded come home with me  home said lise defiantly and laughed what do you take me for why would i be going home when ive been trying to break away for two years i aint so dippy as thatnot me go home like a good little girl and march back to the bagatelle and ask em to give me another show standing behind a counter all day nix no home sweet home for me im all for easy street when it comes to a home like that  heartless terrific as the repudiation was it struck a selfconvicting almost sympathetic note in janet she herself had revolted against the monotony and sordidness of that existence she herself she dared not complete the thought now  but this she exclaimed  whats the matter with it lise demanded it aint commonwealth avenue but its got fillmore street beat a mile there aint no whistles hereto get you out of bed at six am for one thing there aint no geezers like walters to nag you round all day long whats the matter with it  something in lises voice roused janets spirit to battle  whats the matter with it she cried its hellthats the matter with it cant you see it cant you feel it you dont know what it means or youd come home with me  i guess i know what it means as well as you do said lise sullenly weve all got to croak sometime and id rather croak this way than be smothered up in hampton ill get a run for my money anyway  no you dont know what it means janet repeated or you wouldnt talk like that do you think this man will support you stick to you he wont hell desert you and youll have to go on the streets  a dangerous light grew in lises eyes  hes as good as any other man hes as good as ditmar she said theyre all the same to girls like us  janets heart caught it seemed to stop beating was this a hazard on lises part or did she speak from knowledge and yet what did it matter whether lise knew or only suspected if her words were true if men were all alike had she been a dupe as well as lise and was the only difference between them now the fact that lise was able without illusion to see things as they were to accept the consequences while she janet had beheld visions and dreamed dreams was there any real choice between the luxurious hotel to which ditmar had taken her and this detestable house suddenly seemingly by chance her eyes fell on the box of drugstore candy from which the cheap red ribbon had been torn and by some odd association of ideas it suggested and epitomized lises sunday excursion with a mama hideous travesty on the journey of wonders she herself had taken had that been heaven and this of lises hell and was lises ambition to be supported in idleness and luxury to be condemned because she had believed her own to be higher did not both lead to destruction the weight that had lain on her breast since the siren had awakened her that morning and she had reached out and touched the chilled empty sheets now grew almost unsupportable  its true said janet all men are the same  lise was staring at her  my god she exclaimed you  yesme cried janetand what are you going to do about it stay here with him in this filthy place until he gets tired of you and throws you out on the street before id let any man do that to me id kill him  lise began to whimper and suddenly buried her face in the pillow but a new emotion had begun to take possession of janetan emotion so strong as to give her an unlookedfor sense of detachment and the words lise had spoken between her sobs at first conveyed no meaning  im going to have a baby  lise was going to have a child why hadnt she guessed it a child perhaps she janet would have a child this enlightenment as to lises condition and the possibility it suggested in regard to herself brought with it an overwhelming sympathy which at first she fiercely resented then yielded to the bond between them instead of snapping had inexplicably strengthened and lise despite her degradation was more than ever her sister forgetting her repugnance to the bed janet sat down beside lise and put an arm around her  he said hed marry me he swore he was richand he was a spender all right and then some guy came up to me one night at grubers and told me he was married already  what janet exclaimed  sure hes got a wife and two kids here in boston that was a twentyone round knockout maybe i didnt have something to tell him when he blew into hampton last friday but he said he couldnt help ithe loved me lise sat up seemingly finding relief in the relation of her wrongs dabbing her eyes with a cheap lace handkerchief well while hed been awaythis thing came i didnt know what was the matter at first and when i found out i was scared to death i was ready to kill myself when i told him he was scared too and then he said hed fix it say i was a goat to think hed marry me lise laughed hysterically  and then janet spoke with difficulty and then you came down here  i told him hed have to see me through id start something if he didnt say he almost got down on his knees right there in grubers but he came back inside of ten secondshes a jollier for sure he was right there with the goods it was because he loved me he couldnt help himself i was his cutie and all that kind of baby talk  lises objective manner of speaking about her seducer amazed janet  do you love him she asked  say what is love lise demanded do you ever run into it outside of the movies do i love him well hes a good looker and a fancy dresser he aint a tight wad and he can start a laugh every minute if he hadnt put it over on me i wouldnt have been so sore i dont know he aint so bad hes weak thats the trouble with him  this was the climax lises mental processes her tendency to pass from wild despair to impersonal comment her inability her courtesans temperament that prevented her from realizing tragedy for more than a moment at a timeeven though the tragedy were her ownwere incomprehensible to janet  get on to this lise adjured her when i first was acquainted with him he handed me a fairy tale that he was taking five thousand a year from humphrey and gillmount he was going into the firm he had me razzledazzled hes some hypnotizes as a salesman too they say nothing was too good for me i saw myself with a house on the avenue shopping in a limousine well he blew up but i cant help liking him  liking him cried janet passionately id kill him thats what id do  lise regarded her with unwilling admiration  thats where you and me is different she declared i wish i was like that but i aint and where would i come in now youre wise why i cant go back to hampton even if i was stuck on the burg and cryin my eyes out for the bagatelle i couldnt go back  what are you going to do janet demanded  well said lise hes come acrossill say that for him maybe its because hes scared but hes stuck on me too when you dropped in i was just going down town to get a pair of patent leathers these are all wore out she explained twisting her foot they aint fit for boston and i thought of lookin at blousestheres a sale on i was reading about in the paper say its great to be on easy street to be able to stay in bed until youre good and ready to get up and go shopping to gaze at the girls behind the counter and ask the price of things im going to wallings and give the salesladies the hahathats what im going to do  but janet found words inadequate  lise understood her  oh im due at the doctors this afternoon  where  the doctors dont you get meits a private hospital lise gave a slight shudder at the word but instantly recovered her sangfroid howard fixed it up yesterdayand they say it aint very bad if you take it early  for a space janet was too profoundly shocked to reply  lise thats a crime she cried  crime nothing retorted lise and immediately became indignant say i sometimes wonder how you could have lived all these years without catching on to a few things what do you take me for whatd i do with a baby  what indeed the thought came like an avalanche stripping away the veneer of beauty from the face of the world revealing the scarred rock and crushed soil beneath this was reality what right had society to compel a child to be born to degradation and prostitution to beget perhaps other children of suffering were not she and lise of the exploited of those duped and tempted by the fair things the more fortunate enjoyed unscathed and now for their natural cravings their family must be disgraced they must pay the penalty of outcasts neither lise nor she had had a chance she saw that now the scorching revelation of lifes injustice lighted within her the fires of anarchy and revenge lise other women might submit tamely to be crushed might be lulled and drugged by bribes she would not a wild desire seized her to get back to hampton  give me the address of the hospital she said  come off cried lise in angry bravado do you think im going to let you butt into this i guess youve got enough to do to look out for your own business  janet produced a pencil from her bag and going to the table tore off a piece of the paper in which had been wrapped the candy box  give me the address she insisted  say what are you going to do  i want to know where you are in case anything happens to you  anything happens what do you mean janets words had frightened lise the withdrawal of janets opposition bewildered her but above all she was cowed by the sudden change in janet herself by the attitude of steely determination eloquent of an animus persons of lises type are incapable of feeling and which to them is therefore incomprehensible nothings going to happen to me she whined the place is all righthed be scared to send me there if it wasnt it costs something too say you aint going to tell em at home she cried with a fresh access of alarm  if you do as i say i wont tell anybody janet replied in that odd impersonal tone her voice had acquired you must write me as soonas soon as it is over do you understand  honest to god i will lise assured her  and you mustnt come back to a house like this  wherell i go lise asked  i dont know well find out when the time comes said janet significantly  youve seen him lise exclaimed  no said janet and i dont want to see him unless i have to mr tiernan has seen him mr tiernan is downstairs now waiting for me  johnny tiernan is johnny tiernan downstairs  janet wrote the address and thrust the slip of paper in her bag  goodbye lise she said ill come down again ill come down whenever you want me lise suddenly seized her and clung to her sobbing for a while janet submitted and then kissing her gently detached herself she felt indeed pity for lise but something within her seemed to have hardenedsomething that pity could not melt possessing her and thrusting heron to action she knew not what action so strong was this thing that it overcame and drove off the evil spirits of that darkened house as she descended the stairs to join mr tiernan who opened the door for her to pass out once in the street she breathed deeply of the sunlit air nor did she observe mr tiernans glance of comprehension when they arrived at the north station he saidyoull be wanting a bite of dinner miss janet and as she shook her head he did not press her to eat he told her that a train for hampton left in ten minutes i think ill stay in boston the rest of the day as long as im here he added  she remembered that she had not thanked him she took his hand but he cut her short  its glad i was to help you he assured her and if theres anything more i can do miss janet youll be letting me knowyoull call on johnny tiernan wont you  he left her at the gate he had intruded with no advice he had offered no comment that she had come downstairs alone without lise his confidence in her seemed never to have wavered he had respected perhaps partly imagined her feelings and in spite of these now a sense of gratitude to him stole over her mitigating the intensity of their bitterness mr tiernan alone seemed stable in a chaotic world he was a man  no sooner was she in the train however than she forgot mr tiernan utterly up to the present the mental process of dwelling upon her own experience of the last three months had been unbearable but now she was able to take a fearful satisfaction in the evolving of parallels between her case and lises despite the fact that the memories she had cherished were now become hideous things she sought to drag them forth and compare them ruthlessly with what must have been the treasures of lise were her own any less tawdry only she janet had been the greater fool of the two the greater dupe because she had allowed herself to dream to believe that what she had done had been for love for light because she had not listened to the warning voice within her it had always been on the little unpremeditated acts of ditmar that she had loved to linger and now in the light of lises testimony of lises experience she saw them all as false it seemed incredible now that she had ever deceived herself into thinking that ditmar meant to marry her that he loved her enough to make her his wife nor was it necessary to summon and marshal incidents to support this view they came of themselves crowding one another a cumulative and appalling array of evidence before which she stood bitterly amazed at her former stupidity and in the events of yesterday which she pitilessly reviewed she beheld a deliberate and prearranged plan for her betrayal had he not telephoned to boston for the rooms rehearsed in his own mind every detail of what had subsequently happened was there any essential difference between the methods of ditmar and duval both were skilled in the same art and ditmar was the cleverer of the two it had only needed her meeting with lise in that house to reveal how he had betrayed her faith and her love sullied and besmirched them and then came the odd reflectionhow strange that that same sunday had been so fateful for herself and lise  the agony of these thoughts was mitigated by the scorching hatred that had replaced her love the desire for retaliation revenge occasionally however that stream of consciousness was broken by the recollection of what she had permitted and even advised her sister to do and though the idea of the place to which lise was going sickened her though she achieved a certain objective amazement at the transformation in herself enabling her to endorse such a course she was glad of having endorsed it she rejoiced that lises child would not be born into a world that had seemedso falselyfair and sweet and in reality was black and detestable her acceptance of the actfor lisewas a function of the hatred consuming her a hatred which growing in bigness had made ditmar merely the personification of that world from time to time her hands clenched her brow furrowed powerful waves of heat ran through her the craving for action became so intense she could scarcely refrain from rising in her seat  by some odd whim of the weather the wind had backed around into the east gathering the clouds once more the brilliancy of the morning had given place to greyness the high slits of windows seemed dirtier than ever as the train pulled into the station at hampton shrouded in gothic gloom as she left the car janet was aware of the presence on the platform of an unusual number of people she wondered vaguely as she pushed her way through them why they were there what they were talking about one determination possessed her to go to the chippering mill to ditmar emerging from the street she began to walk rapidly the change from inaction to exercise bringing a certain relief starting the working of her mind arousing in her a realization of the necessity of being prepared for the meeting therefore instead of turning at faber street she crossed it but at the corner of the common she halted her glance drawn by a dark mass of people filling the end of hawthorne street where it was blocked by the brickcoloured facade of the clarendon mill in the middle distance men and boys were running to join this crowd a girl evidently an irishamerican mill hand of the higher paid sort hurried toward her from the direction of the mill itself janet accosted her  its the strike she explained excitedly evidently surprised at the question the polaks and the dagoes and a lot of other foreigners quit when they got their envelopesstopped their looms and started through the mill and when they came into our room i left i didnt want no trouble with em its the fiftyfour hour lawtheir pays cut two hours youve heard about it i guess  janet nodded  they had a big mass meeting last night in maxwell hall the girl continued the foreignersnot the skilled workers and they voted to strike they tell me theyre walking out over at the patuxent too  and the chippering asked janet eagerly  i dont knowi guess itll spread to all of em the way these foreigners are going ontheyre crazy but say the girl added it aint right to cut our pay either is it they never done it two years ago when the law came down to fiftysix  janet did not wait to reply while listening to this explanation excitement had been growing in her again and some fearful overpowering force of attraction emanating from that swarm in the distance drew her until she yielded fairly running past the rows of italian tenements in their strange setting of snow not to pause until she reached the fruit shop where she and eda had eaten the olives now she was on the outskirts of the crowd that packed itself against the gates of the clarendon it spread over the width of east street growing larger every minute until presently she was hemmed in here and there hoarse shouts of approval and cheers arose in response to invisible orators haranging their audiences in weird foreign tongues tiny american flags were waved and suddenly in one of those unforeseen and incomprehensible movements to which mobs are subject a trolley car standing at the end of the hawthorne street track was surrounded the desperate clanging of its bell keeping pace with the beating of janets heart a dark sicilian holding aloft the green red and white flag of italy leaped on the rear platform and began to speak the slav conductor regarding him stupidly pulling the bellcord the while three or four policemen fought their way to the spot striving to clear the tracks bewildered and impotent in the face of the alien horde momentarily growing more and more conscious of power  janet pushed her way deeper and deeper into the crowd she wanted to savour to the full its wrath and danger to surrender herself to be played upon by these sallow stubbybearded exhorters whose menacing tones and passionate gestures made a grateful appeal whose wild musical words just because they were uncomprehended aroused in her dim suggestions of a raceexperience not her own but in which she was now somehow summoned to share that these were the intruders whom she as a native american had once resented and despised did not occur to her the racial sense so strong in her was drowned in a sense of fellowship their anger seemed to embody and express as nothing else could have done the revolt that had been rising rising within her soul and the babel to which she listened was not a confusion of tongues but one voice lifted up to proclaim the wrongs of all the duped of all the exploited and oppressed she was fused with them their cause was her cause their betrayers her betrayers  suddenly was heard the cry for which she had been tensely but unconsciously awaiting another cry like that had rung out in another mob across the seas more than a century before ala bastille became to the chippering some man shouted it out in shrill english hundreds repeated it the sicilian leaped from the trolley car and his path could be followed by the agitated progress of the alien banner he bore to the chippering it rang in janets ears like a call to battle was she shouting it too a galvanic thrill ran through the crowd an impulse that turned their faces and started their steps down east street toward the canal and janet was irresistibly carried along nay it seemed as if the force that second by second gained momentum was in her that she herself had released and was guiding it her feet were wet as she ploughed through the trampled snow but she gave no thought to that the odour of humanity was in her nostrils on the left a gaunt jew pressed against her on the right a solid ruthenian woman one hand clasping her shawl the other holding aloft a miniature emblem of new world liberty her eyes were fixed on the grey skies and from time to time her lips were parted in some strange ancestral chant that could be heard above the shouting all about janet were dark awakening faces  it chanced that an american a college graduate stood gazing down from a point of vantage upon this scene he was ignorant of anthropology psychology and the phenomena of environment but bits of knowledgewhich he embodied in a newspaper article composed that evening stuck waxlike in his brain not thus he deplored was the anglosaxon wont to conduct his rebellions these czechs and slavs hebrews and latins and huns might have appropriately been clad in the skins worn by the hordes of attila had they not been drawn hither by the renown of the republics wealth and how essentially did they differ from those other barbarians before whose bewildered lustful gaze had risen the glittering palaces on the hills of the tiber the spoils of rome the spoils of america they appeared to him ferocious atavistic beasts as they broke into the lumberyard beneath his window to tear the cordwood from the piles and rush out again armed with billets  janet in the main stream sweeping irresistibly down the middle of the street was carried beyond the lumberyard into the narrow roadway beside the canalpresently to find herself packed in the congested mass in front of the bridge that led to the gates of the chippering mill across the water above the angry hum of human voices could be heard the whirring of the looms rousing the mob to a higher pitch of fury the halt was for a moment only the bridge rocked beneath the weight of their charge they battered at the great gates they ran along the snowfilled tracks by the wall of the mill some in a frenzy of passion hurled their logs against the windows others paused seemingly to measure the distance and force of the stroke thus lending to their act a more terrible and deliberate significance a shout of triumph announced that the gates like a broken dam had given way and the torrent poured in between the posts flooding the yard pressing up the towered stairways and spreading through the compartments of the mill more ominous than the tumult seemed the comparative silence that followed this absorption of the angry spirits of the mob little by little as the power was shut off the antiphonal throbbing of the looms was stilled pinioned against the parapet above the canalalmost on that very spot where the first evening she had met ditmarjanet awaited her chance to cross every crashing window every resounding blow on the panels gave her a fierce throb of joy she had not expected the gates to yieldher father must have insecurely fastened them gaining the farther side of the canal she perceived him flattened against the wall of the gatehouse shaking his fist in the faces of the intruders who rushed past him unheeding his look arrested her his face was livid his eyes were red with anger he stood transformed by a passion she had not believed him to possess she had indeed heard him give vent to a mitigated indignation against foreigners in general but now the oldschool americanism in which he had been bred the americanism of individual rights of respect for the convention of property had suddenly sprung into flame he was ready to fight for it to die for it the curses he hurled at these people sounded blasphemous in janets ears  father she cried father  he looked at her uncomprehendingly seemingly failing to recognize her  what are you doing here he demanded seizing her and attempting to draw her to the wall beside him but she resisted there sprang from her lips an unpremeditated question where is mr ditmar she was indeed amazed at having spoken it  i dont know edward replied distractedly weve been looking for him everywhere my god to think that this should happen with me at the gates he lamented go home janet you cant tell whatll happen what these fiends will do you may get hurt youve got no business here catching sight of a belated and breathless policeman he turned from her in desperation get em out far gods sake cant you get em out before they ruin the machines  but janet waited no longer pushing her way frantically through the people filling the yard she climbed the tower stairs and made her way into one of the spinning rooms the frames were stilled the overseer and second hands thrust aside looked on helplessly while the intruders harangued cajoled or threatened the operatives some of whom were cowed and already departing others sullen and resentful remained standing in the aisles and still others seemed to have caught the contagion of the strike suddenly with reverberating strokes the mill bells rang out the electric gongs chattered the siren screeched drowning the voices janet did not pause but hurried from room to room until in passing through an open doorway in the weaving department she ran into mr caldwell he halted a moment in surprise at finding her there calling her by name she clung to his sleeve and again she asked the question  wheres mr ditmar  caldwell shook his head his answer was the same as edwards i dont know he shouted excitedly above the noise weve got to get this mob out before they do any damage  he tore himself away she saw him expostulating with the overseer and then she went on these tower stairs she remembered led to a yard communicating by a little gate with the office entrance the door of the vestibule was closed but the watchman simmons recognizing her permitted her to enter the offices were deserted silent for the bells and the siren had ceased their clamour the stenographers and clerks had gone the short day was drawing to a close shadows were gathering in the corners of ditmars room as she reached the threshold and gazed about her at the objects there so poignantly familiar she took off her coat his desk was littered with books and papers and she started mechanically to set it in order replacing the schedule books on the shelves sorting out the letters and putting them in the basket she could not herself have told why she should take up again these trivial tasks as though no cataclysmic events had intervened to divide forever the world of yesterday from that of tomorrow with a movement suggestive of tenderness she was picking up ditmars pen to set it in the glass rack when her ear caught the sound of voices and she stood transfixed listening intently there were footsteps in the corridor the voices came nearer one loud and angered she detected above the others it was ditmars nothing had happened to him dropping the pen she went over to the window staring out over the grey waters trembling so violently that she could scarcely stand  she did not look around when they entered the room ditmar caldwell orcutt and evidently a few watchmen and overseers some one turned on the electric switch darkening the scene without ditmar continued to speak in vehement tones of uncontrolled rage  why in hell werent those gates bolted tight he demanded thats what i want to know there was plenty of time after they turned the corner of east street you might have guessed what they would do but instead of that you let em into the mill to shut off the power and intimidate our own people he called the strikers an unprintable name and though janet stood with her back turned directly before him he gave no sign of being aware of her presence  it wasnt the gatekeepers fault she heard orcutt reply in a tone quivering with excitement and apprehension they really didnt give us a chancethats the truth they were down canal street and over the bridge before we knew it  its just as ive said a hundred times ditmar retorted i cant afford to leave this mill a minute i cant trust anybody and he broke out in another tirade against the intruders by god ill fix em for thisill crush em and if any operatives try to walkout here ill see that they starve before they get backafter all ive done for em kept the mill going in slack times just to give em work if they desert me now when ive got this bradlaugh order on my hands speech became an inadequate expression of his feelings and suddenly his eye fell on janet she had turned but her look made no impression on him call up the chief of police he said  automatically she obeyed getting the connection and handing him the receiver standing by while he denounced the incompetence of the department for permitting the mob to gather in east street and demanded deputies the veins of his forehead were swollen as he cut short the explanations of the official and asked for the city hall in making an appointment with the mayor he reflected on the management of the city government and when janet by his command obtained the boston office he gave the mill treasurer a heated account of the afternoons occurrences explaining circumstantially how in his absence at a conference in the patuxent mill the mob had gathered in east street and attacked the chippering and he urged the treasurer to waste no time in obtaining a force of detectives in securing in boston and new york all the operatives that could be hired in order to break the impending strike save for this untimely and unreasonable revolt he was bent on stamping out for ditmar the world today was precisely the same world it had been the day before it seemed incredible to janet that he could so regard it could still be blind to the fact that these workers whom he was determined to starve and crush if they dared to upset his plans and oppose his will were human beings with wills and passions and grievances of their own until today her eyes had been sealed in agony they had been opened to the panorama of sorrow and suffering of passion and evil and what she beheld now as life was a vast and terrible cruelty she had needed only this final proof to be convinced that in his eyes she also was but one of those brought into the world to minister to his pleasure and profit he had taken from her as his weed the most precious thing a woman has to give and now that she was here again at his side by some impulse incomprehensible to herselfin spite of the wrong he had done herhad sought him out in danger he had no thought of her no word for her no use save a menial one he cared nothing for any help she might be able to give he had no perception of the new light which had broken within her soul the telephoning seemed interminable yet she waited with a strange patience while he talked with mr george chippering and two of the most influential directors these conversations had covered the space of an hour or more and perhaps as a result of selfsuggestion of his repeated assurances to mr semple to mr chippering and the directors of his ability to control the situation ditmars habitual selfconfidence was gradually restored and when at last he hung up the instrument and turned to her though still furious against the strikers his voice betrayed the joy of battle the assurance of victory  they cant bluff me theyll have to guess again its that damned holsterhe hasnt any gutshed give in to em right now if id let him its the limit the way he turned the clarendon over to them ill show him how to put a crimp in em if they dont turn up here tomorrow morning  he was so magnificently sure of her sympathy she did not reply but picked up her coat from the chair where she had laid it  where are you going he demanded and she replied laconically home  wait a minute he said rising and taking a step toward her  you have an appointment with the mayor she reminded him  i know he said glancing at the clock over the door where have you beenwhere were you this morning i was worried about you ii was afraid you might be sick  were you she said im all right i had business in boston  why didnt you telephone me in boston he repeated  she nodded he started forward again but she avoided him  whats the matter he cried ive been worried about you all dayuntil this damned strike broke loose i was afraid something had happened  you might have asked my father she said  for gods sake tell me whats the matter  his desire for her mounted as his conviction grew more acute that something had happened to disturb a relationship which he had congratulated himself after many vicissitudes and anxieties had at last been established he was conscious however of irritation because this whimsical and unanticipated grievance of hers should have developed at the moment when the caprice of his operatives threatened to interfere with his cherished plansfor ditmar measured the inconsistencies of humanity by the yardstick of his desires her question as to why he had not made inquiries of her father added a new element to his disquietude as he stood thus worried exasperated and perplexed the fact that there was in her attitude something ominous dangerous was slow to dawn on him his faculties were wholly unprepared for the blow she struck him  i hate you she said she did not raise her voice but the deliberate concentrated conviction she put into the sentence gave it the dynamic quality of a bullet and save for the impact of itbefore which he physically recoiledits import was momentarily without meaning  what he exclaimed stupidly  i might have known you never meant to marry me she went on her hands were busy with the buttons of her coat  all you want is to use me to enjoy me and turn me out when you get tired of methe way youve done with other women its just the same with these mill hands theyre not human beings to you theyretheyre cattle if they dont do as you like you turn them out you say they can starve for all you care  for gods sake what do you mean he demanded what have i done to you janet i love you i need you  love me she repeated i know how men of your sort loveive seen iti know as long as i give you what you want and dont bother you you love me and i know how these workers feel she cried with sudden passionate vehemence i never knew before but i know now ive been with them i marched up here with them from the clarendon when they battered in the gates and smashed your windowsand i wanted to smash your windows too to blow up your mill  what are you saying you came here with the strikers you were with that mob asked ditmar astoundedly  yes i was in that mob i belong there with them i tell youi dont belong here with you but i was a fool even then i was afraid theyd hurt you i came into the mill to find you and youand you you acted as if youd never seen me before i was a fool but im glad i cameim glad i had a chance to tell you this  my godwont you trust me he begged with a tremendous effort to collect himself you trusted me yesterday whats happened to change you wont you tell me its nothing ive donei swear and what do you mean when you say you were in that mob i was almost crazy when i came back and found theyd been here in this millcant you understand it wasnt that i didnt think of you id been worrying about you all day look at this thing sensibly i love you i cant get along without youill marry you i said i would i meant it ill marry you just as soon as i can clean up this mess of a strike it wont take long  dont touch me she commanded and he recoiled again ill tell you where ive been if you want to knowive been to see my sister inin a house in boston i guess you know what kind of a house i mean youve been in them youve brought women to themjust like the man that brought her there would you marry me nowwith my sister there and am i any different from her you youve made me just like her her voice had broken now into furious uncontrolled weepingto which she paid no heed  ditmar was stunned he could only stare at her  if i have a child she said illill kill youill kill myself  and before he could replyif indeed he had been able to replyshe had left the office and was running down the stairs     chapter xiv  what was happening to hampton some hundreds of ignorant foreigners dissatisfied with the money in their pay envelopes had marched out of the clarendon mill and attacked the chippering and behold the revered structure of american government had quivered and tumbled down like a pack of cards despite the feverish assurances in the banner extra that the disturbance was merely local and temporary solid citizens became panicky vaguely apprehending the release of elemental forces hitherto unrecognized and unknown who was to tell these solid educated business men that the crazy industrial babel they had helped to rear and in which they unconsciously dwelt was no longer the simple edifice they thought it that authority spelled with a capital was a thing of the past that human instincts suppressed become explosives to displace the strata of civilization and change the face of the world that conventions and institutions laws and decrees crumble before the whirlwind of human passions that their city was not of special but of universal significance and how were these who still believed themselves to be dwelling under the old dispensation to comprehend that environments change and changing demand new and terrible philosophies when night fell on that fateful tuesday the voice of syndicalism had been raised in a temple dedicated to ordered anglosaxon libertythe hampton city hall  only for a night and a day did the rebellion lack both a leader and a philosophy meanwhile in obedience to the unerring instinct for drama peculiar to great metropolitan dailies newspaper correspondents were alighting from every train interviewing officials and members of labour unions and mill agents interviewing claude ditmar the strongest man in hampton that day he at least knew what ought to be done and even before his siren broke the silence of the morning hours in vigorous and emphatic terms he had informed the mayor and council of their obvious duty these strikers were helots unorganized scum the regular unionsby comparison respectableheld aloof from them here in effect was his argument a strong show of force was imperative if the police and deputies were inadequate request the governor to call out the local militia but above all waste no time arrest the ringleaders the plotters break up all gatherings keep the streets clear he demanded from the law protection of his property protection for those whose right to continue at work was inalienable he was listened to with sympathy and respectbut nothing was done the world had turned upside down indeed if the city government of hampton refused to take the advice of the agent of the chippering mill american institutions were a failure but such was the fact some unnamed fear outweighing their dread of the retributions of capital possessed these men made them supine derelict in the face of their obvious duty  by the faint grey light of that bitter january morning ditmar made his way to the mill in faber street dark figures flitted silently across the ghostly whiteness of the snow and gathered in groups on the corners seeking to avoid these other figures hurried along the sidewalks close to the buildings to be halted accosted pleaded withthreatened perhaps picketing had already begun the effect of this pantomime of the eternal struggle for survivals which he at first beheld from a distance was to exaggerate appallingly the emptiness of the wide street to emphasize the absence of shoppers and vehicles and a bluish darkness lurked in the stores whose plate glass windows were frosted in quaint designs where were the police it was not fear that ditmar felt he was galvanized and dominated by anger by an overwhelming desire for action physical combat would have brought him relief and as he quickened his steps he itched to seize with his own hands these foreigners who had dared to interfere with his cherished plans who had had the audacity to challenge the principles of his government which welcomed them to its shores he would have liked to wring their necks his philosophy too was environmental and beneath this wrath stimulating and energizing it the more was the ache in his soul from the loss for which he held these enemies responsible two days ago happiness and achievement had both been within his grasp the only womanso now it seemedhe had ever really wanted what had become of her what obscure and passionate impulse had led her suddenly to defy and desert him to cast in her lot with these insensate aliens a hundred times during the restless inactive hours of a sleepless night this question had intruded itself in the midst of his scheming to break the strike as he reviewed word by word act by act that almost incomprehensible revolt of hers which had followed so swiftlya final vindictive blow of fateon that other revolt of the workers at moments he became confused unable to separate the two he saw her fire in that other her sister she had said had been disgraced she had defied him to marry her in the face of that degradationand this suddenly had sickened him he had let her go what a fool he had been to let her go had she herself been he did not finish this thought throughout the long night he had known for a certainty that this woman was a vital part of him flame of his flame had he never seen her he would have fought these strikers to their knees but now the force of this incentive was doubled he would never yield until he had crushed them until he had reconquered her  he was approaching one of the groups of strikers and unconsciously he slowed his steps the whites of his eyes reddened the great coat of golden fur he wore gave to his aspect an added quality of formidableness there were some who scattered as he drew near and of the less timorous spirits that remained only a few raised dark sullen glances to encounter his which was unflinching passionately contemptuous throughout the countless generations that lay behind them the instinct of submission had played its dominant phylogenetic role he was the master the journey across the seas had not changed that a few shiverednot alone because they were thinly clad he walked on slowly past other groups turned the corner of west street where the groups were more numerous while the number of those running the gantlet had increased and he heard twice or thrice the word scab cried out menacingly his eyes grew redder still as he spied a policeman standing idly in a doorway  why in hell dont you do your duty he demanded what do you mean by letting them interfere with these workers  the man flinched he was apologetic so long as theyre peaceable mr ditmarthose are my orders i do try to keep em movin  your orders youre a lot of damned cowards ditmar replied and went on there were mutterings here herded together these slaves were bolder and hunger and cold discouragement at not being able to stop the flow toward the mills were having their effect by the frozen canal the scene of the onslaught of yesterday the crowd had grown comparatively thick and at the corner of the lodginghouse row ditmar halted a moment unnoticed save by a few who nudged one another and murmured he gave them no attention he was trying to form an estimate of the effect of the picketing on his own operatives some came with timid steps others mostly women fairly ran still others were selfpossessed almost defiantand such he marked there were those who when the picketers held them by the sleeve broke precipitately from their annoyers and those who hesitated listening with troubled faces with feelings torn between dread of hunger for themselves and their children and sympathy with the revolt a small number joined the ranks of the picketers ditmar towered above these foreigners who were mostly undersized a student of human nature and civilization free from industrial complexes would from that point of vantage have had much to gather from the expressions coming within his view but to ditmar humanity was a means to an end suddenly from the cupolas above the battlement of the mill the bells shattered the early morning air the remnant of the workers hastened across the canal and through the guarded gates which were instantly closed ditmar was left alone among the strikers as he moved toward the bridge they made a lane for him to pass one or two he thrust out of his way but there were mutterings and from the sidewalk he heard a man curse him  perhaps we shall understand some day that the social body also is subject to the operation of cause and effect it was not what an ingenuous orthodoxy keeping alive the fate of the ancient city from which lot fled would call the wrath of heaven that visited hampton although a sermon on these lines was delivered from more than one of her pulpits on the following sunday let us surmise rather that a decrepit social system in a moment of lowered vitality becomes an easy prey to certain diseases which respectable communities are not supposed to have the germ of a philosophy evolved in decadent europe flies across the sea to prey upon a youthful and vigorous america lodging as host wherever industrial strife has made congenial soil in four and twenty hours hampton had caught syndicalism all day tuesday before the true nature of the affection was developed prominent citizens were outraged and appalled by the supineness of their municipal phagocytes property that sacred fabric of government had been attacked and destroyed law had been defied and yet the city hall the sanctuary of american tradition was turned over to the alien mob for a continuous series of mass meetings all day long that edifice hitherto chastely familiar with american doctrine alone with patriotic oratory with perorations that dwelt upon the wrongs and woes of irelandpart of our national propagandaall day long that edifice rang with strange exotic speech sometimes guttural often musical but always impassioned weirdly cadenced and intoned from the raised platform in place of the shrewd matteroffact new england politician alive to the votegetting powers of fourth of july patriotism in place of the vehement but funloving son of erin men with wild dark faces with burning black eyes and unkempt hair unshaven flannel skirtedmade more alien paradoxically by their conventional readymade american clothesgave tongue to the inarticulate aspirations of the peasant drudge of europe from lands long steeped in blood they came from low countries by misty northern seas from fair and ancient plains of lombardy from guelph and ghibelline hamlets in the apennines from vinecovered slopes in sicily and greece from the balkans from caucasus and carpathia from the mountains of lebanon whose cedars lined the palaces of kings and from villages beside swollen rivers that cross the dreary steppes each peasant listened to a recital in his own tonguethe tongue in which the folklore the cradle sayings of his race had been preservedof the common wrongs of all of misery still present of happiness still unachieved in this land of liberty and opportunity they had found a mockery to appeals to endure and suffer for a common cause but who was to weld together this medley of races and traditions to give them the creed for which their passions were prepared to lead into battle these ignorant and unskilled from whom organized labour held aloof even as dusk was falling even as the mayor the hon michael mcgrath was making from the platform an eloquent plea for order and peace promising a committee of arbitration and thinking about soldiers the leader and the philosophy were landing in hampton  the five oclock edition of the banner announced him antonio antonelli of the industrial workers of the world an ominous name an ominous titlecompared by a wellknown publicist to the sound of a firebell in the night the industrial workers not of america but of the world no wonder it sent shivers down the spine of hampton the writer of the article in the banner was unfamiliar with the words syndicalism and sabotage or the phrase direct action he was too young to know the history of the knights he had never heard of a philosophy of labour or of sorel or pouget but the west he had heard ofthe home of lawlessness of bloodshed rape and murder for obvious reasons he did not betray this opinion but for him the iww was born in the west where it had ravaged and wrecked communities his article was guardedly respectful but he ventured to remind his readers that mr antonelli had been a leader in some of these titanic struggles between crude labour and capitalcatastrophes that hitherto had seemed to the citizens of hampton as remote as kansas cyclones  some of the less timorous of the older inhabitants curious to learn what doctrine this interloper had to proclaim thrust their way that evening into the city hall which was crowded as the papers said to suffocation not prepossessing this modern robespierre younger than he looked for life had put its mark on him once in the days of severe work in the mines his body had been hard and now had grown stout in the eyes of a complacent armchair historian he must have appeared one of the strange and terrifying creatures which in times of upheaval are thrust from the depths of democracies to the surface with gifts to voice the longings and passions of those below he did not blink in the light he was sure of himself he had a creed and believed in it he gazed around him with the leonine stare of the conqueror and a hush came over the hall as he arose his speech was taken down verbatim to be submitted to the sharpest of legal eyes when was discovered the possession of a powerrare among agitatorsto pour forth in torrents apparently unpremeditated appeals to skirt the border of sedition and never transgress it to weigh his phrases before he gave them birth and to remember them if he said an incendiary thing one moment he qualified it the next he justified violence only to deprecate it and months later when on trial for his life and certain remarks were quoted against him he confounded his prosecutors by demanding the contexts skilfully always within the limits of their intelligence he outlined to his hearers his philosophy and proclaimed it as that of the worlds oppressed their cause was histhe cause of human progress he universalized it the world belonged to the producer if only he had the courage to take possession of his own  suddenly the inspirer was transformed into the man of affairs who calmly proposed the organization of a strike committee three members of which were to be chosen by each nationality and the resolution translated into many tongues was adopted amidst an uproar of enthusiasm until that moment the revolt had been personal local founded on a particular grievance which had to do with wages and the material struggle for existence now all was changed now they were convinced that the deprivation and suffering to which they had pledged themselves were not for selfish ends alone but also vicarious dedicated to the liberation of all the downtrodden of the earth antonelli became a saviour they reached out to touch him as he passed they trooped into the snowy street young men and old and girls and women holding children in their arms their faces alight with something never known or felt before  such was antonelli to the strikers but to those staid residents of hampton who had thought themselves still to be living in the old new england tradition he was the genius of an evil dream hard on his heels came a nightmare troop whose coming brought to the remembrance of the imaginative the old nursery rhymehark hark the dogs do bark the beggars are come to town  it has indeed a knelllike ring do philosophies tend also to cast those who adopt them into a mould these were of the selfsame breed indubitably the followers of antonelli the men wore their hair long affected like their leader soft felt hats and loose black ties that fell over the lapels of their coats loose morals and loose ties the projection of these against a puritan background ties symbolical of everything the anglosaxon shudders at and abhors of anarchy and mob rule of bohemia and vagabondia of sedition and murder of latin revolutions and reigns of terror of sex irregularitynot of the clandestine sort to be found in decent communitiesbut of free love that flaunts itself in the face of an outraged public for there were women in the band all this and more the invaders suggestedatheism unfamiliarity with soap and water and more vaguely an exotic poetry and art that to the virile of american descent is saturated with something indefinable yet abhorrent such things are felt few of the older citizens of hampton were able to explain why something rose in their gorges why they experienced a new and clammy quality of fear and repulsion when on the day following antonellis advent these strangers arrived from nowhere to install themselveswith no baggage to speak ofin hamptons more modest but hitherto respectable hostelries and no sooner had the city been rudely awakened to the perilous presence in overwhelming numbers of ignorant and inflammable foreigners than these turned up and presumed to lead the revolt to make capital out of it to interpret it in terms of an exotic and degenerate creed hampton would take care of itselfor else the sovereign state within whose borders it was would take care of it and his honour the mayor who had proclaimed his faith in the reasonableness of the strikers who had scorned the suggestions of indignant inhabitants that the governor be asked for soldiers twentyfour hours too late arranged for the assembly of three companies of local militia in the armory and swore in a hundred extra police  the hideous stillness of fillmore street was driving janet mad what she burned to do was to go to boston and take a train for somewhere in the west to lose herself never to see hampton again butthere was her mother she could not leave hannah in these empty rooms alone and edward was to remain at the mill to eat and sleep there until the danger of the strike had passed a messenger had come to fetch his clothes after leaving ditmar in the office of the mill janet crept up the dark stairs to the flat and halted in the hallway through the open doorway of the diningroom she saw hannah seated on the horsehair sofafor the first time within memory idle at this hour of the day nothing else could have brought home to her like this the sheer tragedy of their plight until then janet had been sustained by anger and excitement by physical action she thought hannah was staring at her after a moment it seemed that the widened pupils were fixed in fascination on something beyond on the thing that had come to dwell here with them forever  janet entered the room she sat down on the sofa and took her mothers hand in hers and hannah submitted passively janet could not speak a minute might have passed and the silence which neither had broken acquired an intensity that to janet became unbearable never had the room been so still her glance raised instinctively to the face of the pictureclock saw the hands pointing to ten every monday morning as far back as she could recall her father had wound it before going to workand today he had forgotten getting up she opened the glass door and stood trying to estimate the hour it must be she thought about six she set the hands took the key from the nail above the shelf wound up the weight and started the pendulum and the sound of familiar ticking was a relief releasing at last her inhibited powers of speech  mother she said ill get some supper for you  on hannah these simple words had a seemingly magical effect habit reasserted itself she started and rose almost briskly  no you wont she said ill get it id ought to have thought of it before you must be tired and hungry  her voice was odd and thin janet hesitated a moment and ceded  well ill set the dishes on the table anyway  janet had sought refuge wistfully in the commonplace and when the meal was ready she strove to eat though food had become repulsive  you must take something mother she said  i dont feel as if i ever wanted to eat anything again she replied  i know said janet but youve got to and she put some of the cold meat left over from sundays dinner on hannahs plate hannah took up a fork and laid it down again suddenly she saidyou saw lise  yes said janet  where is she  in a housein boston  one ofthose houses  ii dont know said janet i think so  you went there  mr tiernan went with me  she wouldnt come home  notnot just now mother  you left her there in that place you didnt make her come home  the sudden vehemence of this question the shrill note of reproach in hannahs voice that revealed even more than the terrible inertia from which she had emerged the extent of her suffering for the instant left janet utterly dismayed oh mother she exclaimed i triedii couldnt  hannah pushed back her chair  ill go to her ill make her come shes disgraced us but ill make her where is she where is the house  janet terrified seized her mothers arm then she saidlise isnt there any moreshes gone away  away and you let her go away you let your sister go away and be aa woman of the town you never loved heryou never had any pity for her  tears sprang into janets eyestears of pity mingled with anger the situation had grown intolerable yet how could she tell hannah where lise was  you havent any right to say that mother she cried i did my best she wouldnt come ii cant tell you where shes gone but she promised to write to send me her address  lise hannahs cry seemed like the uncomprehending whimper of a stricken child and then a hidden cadence made itself felt a cadence revealing to janet with an eloquence never before achieved the mystery of mother love and by some magic of tone was evoked a new image of liseof lise as she must be to hannah no waywardness no degradation or disgrace could efface it the infant whom hannah had clutched to her breast the woman her sister whom janet had seen that day were oneimmutably one this then was what it meant to be a mother all the years of deadening hope had not availed to kill the cravingeven in this withered body it was still alive and quick the agony of that revelation was scarcely to be borne and it seemed that lise even in the place where she was must have heard that cry and heeded it and yetthe revelation of lises whereabouts of lises contemplated act janet had nearly been goaded into making died on her lips she could not tell hannah and lises child must not come into a world like this even now the conviction remained fierce exultant final but if janet had spoken now hannah would not have heard her under the storm she had begun to rock weeping convulsively but gradually her weeping ceased and to janet helplessly watching this process of congealment was more terrible even than the release that only an unmitigated violence of grief had been able to produce in silence hannah resumed her shrunken duties and when these were finished sat awhile before going to bed her hands lying listless in her lap she seemed to have lived for centuries to have exhausted the gamut of suffering which save for that one wild outburst had been the fruit of commonplace passive sordid tragedy that knows no touch of fire  the next morning janet was awakened by the siren never even in the days when life had been routine and commonplace had that sound failed to arouse in her a certain tremor of fear with its first penetrating shriek terror invaded her then by degrees overcoming her numbness came an agonizing realization of tragedy to be faced the siren blew and blew insistently as though it never meant to stop and now for the first time she seemed to detect in it a note of futility there were those who would dare to defy it she for one would defy it in that reflection she found a certain fierce joy and she might lie in bed if she wishedhow often had she longed to but she could not the room was cold appallingly empty and silent as she hurried into her clothes the diningroom lamp was lighted the table set her mother was bending over the stove when she reached the kitchen after the pretence of breakfast was gone through janet sought relief in housework making her bed tidying her room it was odd this morning how her notice of little familiar things had the power to add to her pain brought to mind memories become excruciating as she filled the water pitcher from the kitchen tap she found herself staring at the nick broken out of it when lise had upset it she recalled lises characteristically flippant remark and there was the streak in the wallpaper caused one night by the rain leaking through the roof after the bed was made and the room swept she stood a moment motionless and then opening the drawer in the wardrobe took from it the rose which she had wrapped in tissue paper and hidden there and with a perverse desire as it were to increase the bitterness consuming her to steep herself in pain she undid the parcel and held the withered flower to her face even now a fragrance faint yet poignant clung to it she wrapped it up again walked to the window hesitated and then with a sudden determination to destroy this sole relic of her happiness went to the kitchen and flung it into the stove hannah lingering over her morning task of cleaning did not seem to notice the act janet turned to her  i think ill go out for a while mother she said  youd ought to hannah replied theres no use settin around here  the silence of the flat was no longer to be endured and janet putting on her coat and hat descended the stairs not once that morning had her mother mentioned lise nor had she asked about her own plansabout ditmar this at least was a relief it was the question she had feared most in the street she met the postman  i have a letter for you miss janet he said and on the pink envelope he handed her in purple ink she recognized the unformed childish handwriting of lise theres great doings down at the city hall the postman added the foreigners are holding mass meetings there janet scarcely heard him as she tore open the envelope dear janet the letter ran the doctor told me i had a false alarm there was nothing to it wouldnt that jar you bostons a slow burg and theres no use of my staying here now im going to new york and maybe ill come back when ive had a look at the great white way ive got the coin and i gave him the mit tonight if you havent anything better to do drop in at the bagatelle and give walters my love and tell them not to worry at home theres no use trying to trail me your affectionate sister lise  janet thrust the letter in her pocket then she walked rapidly westward until she came to the livercoloured facade of the city hall opposite the common pushing through the crowd of operatives lingering on the pavement in front of it she entered the building     chapter xv  occasionally the art of narrative may be improved by borrowing the method of the movies another night has passed and we are called upon to imagine the watery sunlight of a mild winter afternoon filtering through bare trees on the heads of a multitude a large portion of hampton common is black with the people of sixteen nationalities who have gathered there trampling down the snow to listen wistfully and eagerly to a new doctrine of salvation in the centre of this throng on the bandstandreminiscent of concerts on sultry summer nightsare the itinerant apostles of the cult called syndicalism exhorting by turns in divers tongues antonelli had spoken and many others when janet impelled by a craving not to be denied had managed to push her way little by little from the outskirts of the crowd until now she stood almost beneath the orator who poured forth passionate words in a language she recognized as italian her curiosity was aroused she was unable to classify this tall man whose long and narrow face was accentuated by a pointed brown beard whose lips gleamed red as he spoke whose slim hands were eloquent the artist as propagandistthe unsuccessful artist with more facility than will the nose was classic and wanted strength the restless eyes that at times seemed fixed on her were smouldering windows of a burning house the fire that stirred her was also consuming him though he could have been little more than five and thirty his hair was thinned and greying at the temples and somehow emblematic of this physiognomy and physique summing it up and expressing it in terms of apparel were the soft collar and black scarf tied in a flowing bow janet longed to know what he was saying his phrases like music played on her emotions and at last when his voice rose in crescendo at the climax of his speech she felt like weeping  un poeta a woman beside her exclaimed  who is he janet asked  rolfe said the woman  but hes an italian  the woman shrugged her shoulders it is his name that is all i know he had begun to speak again and now in english with an enunciation a distinctive manner of turning his phrases new to such gatherings in america where labour intellectuals are little known surprising to janet diverting her attention at first from the meaning of his words labour she heard labour is the creator of all wealth and wealth belongs to the creator the wage system must be abolished you the creators must do battle against these selfimposed masters until you shall come into your own you who toil miserably for nine hours and produce let us say nine dollars of wealthdo you receive it no what is given you is barely enough to keep the slave and the slaves family alive the master the capitalist seizes the rightful reward of your labour and spends it on luxuries on automobiles and fine houses and women on food he cant eat while you are hungry yes you are slaves he cried because you submit like slaves  he waited motionless and scornful for the noise to die down since i have come here to hampton i have heard some speak of the state others of the unions yet the state is your enemy it will not help you to gain your freedom the legislature has shortened your hoursbut why because the politicians are afraid of you and because they think you will be content with a little and now that the masters have cut your wages the state sends its soldiers to crush you only fifty cents they sayonly fifty cents most of you miss from your envelopes what is fifty cents to them but i who speak to you have been hungry i know that fifty cents will buy ten loaves of bread or three pounds of the neck of pork or six quarts of milk for the babies fifty cents will help pay the rent of the ratholes where you live once more he was interrupted by angry shouts of approval and the labour unions have they aided you why not i will tell you whybecause they are the servile instruments of the masters the unions say that capital has rights bargain with it but for us there can be only one bargain complete surrender of the tools to the workers for the capitalists are parasites who suck your blood and your childrens blood from now on there can be no compromise no truce no peace until they are exterminated it is war war in janets soul the word resounded like a tocsin and again as when swept along east street with the mob that sense of identity with these people and their wrongs of submergence with them in their cause possessed her despite her ancestry her lot was cast with them she too had been precariously close to poverty had known the sordidness of life she too and lise and hannah had been duped and cheated of the fairer things eagerly she had drunk in the vocabulary of that new and terrible philosophy the master class must be exterminated was it not true if she had been of that class that ditmar would not have dared to use and deceive her why had she never thought of these things before the light was beginning to fade the great meeting was breaking up and yet she lingered at the foot of the bandstand steps conversing with a small group of operatives that surrounded him she perceived the man who had just spoken and as she stood hesitating gazing at him a desire to hear more to hear all of this creed he preached that fed the fires in her soul urged her forward her need had she known it was even greater than that of these toilers whom she now called comrades despite some qualifying reserve she felt and which had had to do with the redness of his lips he attracted her he had a mind an intellect he must possess stores of the knowledge for which she thirsted he appeared to her as one who had studied and travelled who had ascended heights and gained the wider view denied her a cynical cosmopolitanism would have left her cold but here apparently was a cultivated man burning with a sense of the worlds wrongs ditmar who was to have led her out of captivity had only thrust her the deeper into bondage she joined the group halting on the edge of it listening rolfe was arguing with a man about the labour unions but almost at once she knew she had fixed his attention from time to time as he talked his eyes sought hers boldly and in their dark pupils were tiny points of light that stirred and confused her made her wonder what was behind them in his soul when he had finished his argument he singled her out  you do not work in the mills he asked  no im a stenographeror i was one  and now  ive given up my place  you want to join us  i was interested in what you said i never heard anything like it before  he looked at her intently  come let us walk a little way he said and she went along by his side through the common feeling a neophytes excitement in the freemasonry the contempt for petty conventions of this newly achieved doctrine of brotherhood i will give you things to read you shall be one of us  im afraid i shouldnt understand them janet replied ive read so little  oh you will understand he assured her easily there is too much learning too much reason and intelligence in the world too little impulse and feeling intuition where do reason and intelligence lead us to selfishness to thirst for powerstraight into the master class they separate us from the mass of humanity no our fight is against those who claim more enlightenment than their fellowmen who control the public schools and impose reason on our children because reason leads to submission makes us content with our station in life the true syndicalist is an artist a revolutionist he cried  janet found this bewildering and yet through it seemed to shine for her a gleam of light her excitement grew never before had she been in the presence of one who talked like this with such assurance and ease and the fact that he despised knowledge yet possessed it lent him glamour  but you have studied she exclaimed  oh yes i have studied he replied with a touch of weariness only to learn that life is simple after all and that what is needed for the social order is simple we have only to take what belongs to us we who work to follow our feelings our inclinations  you would take possession of the mills she asked  yes he said quickly of all wealth and of the government there would be no governmentwe should not need it a little courage is all that is necessary and we come into our own you are a stenographer you say but youyou are not content i can see it in your face in your eyes you have cause to hate them too these masters or you would not have been herein this place today is it not so  she shivered but was silent  is it not so he repeated they have wronged you too perhapsthey have wronged us all but some are too stupid too cowardly to fight and crush them christians and slaves submit the old religion teaches that the world is cruel for most of us but if we are obedient and humble we shall be rewarded in heaven rolfe laughed the masters approve of that teaching they would not have it changed but for us it is war well strike and keep on striking well break their machinery spoil their mills and factories and drive them out and even if we do not win at once it is better to suffer and die fighting than to have the life ground out of usis it not  yes it is better she agreed the passion in her voice did not escape him  some day perhaps sooner than we think we shall have the true armageddon the general strike when the last sleeping toiler shall have aroused himself from his lethargy to rise up and come into his inheritance he seemed to detach himself from her his eyes became more luminous  like unseen music in the nightso sorel writes about it they may scoff at it the wise ones but it will come like music in the night you respond to that  again she was silent they had walked on through familiar streets that now seemed strange  you respondi can tell he said and yet you are not like these others like me even you are an american and yet you are not like most of your countrywomen  why do you say that  i will tell you because they are cold most of them and trivial they do not feel but youyou can feel you can love and hate you look calm and cold but you are noti knew it when i looked at you when you came up to me  she did not know whether to resent or welcome his clairvoyance his assumption of intimacy his air of appropriation but her curiosity was tingling  and you she asked your name is rolfe isnt it  he assented and yours  she told him  you have been in america longyour family  very long she said but you speak italian and rolfe isnt an italian name  my father was an englishman an artist who lived in italymy mother a peasant woman from lombardy such as these who come to work in the mills when she was young she was beautifullike a madonna by an old master  an old master  the old masters are the great painters who lived in italy four hundred years ago i was named after one of themthe greatest i am called leonard he was leonardo da vinci  the name as rolfe pronounced it stirred her and art painting it was a realm unknown to her and yet the very suggestion of it evoked yearnings and she recalled a picture in the window of hartmanns bookstore a coloured print before which she used to stop on her way to and from the office the copy of a landscape by a california artist the steep hillside in the foreground was spread with the misty green of olive trees and beyondfar beyonda snowcovered peak like some high altar flamed red in the sunset she had not been able to express her feeling for this picture it had filled her with joy and sadness once she had ventured to enter and ask its priceten dollars and then came a morning when she had looked for it and it was gone  and your fatherdid he paint beautiful pictures too  ah he was too much of a socialist he was always away whey i was a child and after my mothers death he used to take me with him when i was seventeen we went to milan to take part in the great strike and there i saw the soldiers shooting down the workers by the hundreds putting them in prison by the thousands then i went to live in england among the socialists there and i learned the printers trade when i first came to this country i was on a labour paper in new york i set up type i wrote articles and once in a while i addressed meetings on the east side but even before i left london i had read a book on syndicalism by one of the great frenchmen and after a while i began to realize that the proletariat would never get anywhere through socialism  the proletariat the word was new to janets ear  the great mass of the workers the oppressed the people you saw here today socialism is not for them socialismpolitical socialismbetrays them into the hands of the master class direct action is the thing the general strike warthe new creed the new religion that will bring salvation i joined the industrial workers of the world that is the american organization of syndicalism i went west to colorado and california and oregon i preached to the workers wherever there was an uprising i met the leaders ritter and borkum and antonelli and jastro and nellie bond i was useful to them i understand syndicalism as they do not and now we are here to sow the seed in the east come he said slipping his arm through hers i will take you to headquarters i will enlist you you shall be my recruit i will give you the cause the religion you need  she longed to go and yet she drew back puzzled the man fired and fascinated her but there were reservations apprehensions concerning him felt rather than reasoned because of her state of rebellion of her intense desire to satisfy in action the emotion aroused by a sense of wrong his creed had made a violent appeal but in his voice in his eyes in his manner she had been quick to detect a personal sexual note that disturbed and alarmed her that implied in him a lack of unity  i cant tonight she said i must go homemy mother is all alone but i want to help i want to do something  they were standing on a corner under a street lamp and she averted her eyes from his glance  then come tomorrow he said eagerly you know where headquarters is in the francobelgian hall  what could i do she asked  you you could help in many waysamong the women do you know what picketing is  you mean keeping the operatives out of the mills  yes in the morning when they go to work and out of the chippering mill especially ditmar the agent of that mill is the ablest of the lot im told hes the man we want to cripple  cripple exclaimed janet  oh i dont mean to harm him personally rolfe did not seem to notice her tone but he intends to crush the strike and i understand hes importing scabs here to finish out an ordera big order if it werent for him wed have an easier fight he stiffens up the others theres always one man like that in every place and what we want to do is to make him shut down especially  i see said janet  youll come to headquarters rolfe repeated  yes ill come tomorrow she promised  after she had left him she walked rapidly through several streets not heeding her directionsuch was the driving power of the new ideas he had given her certain words and phrases he had spoken rang in her head and like martial music kept pace with her steps she strove to remember all that he had said to grasp its purport and because it seemed recondite cosmic it appealed to her and excited her the more and he the man himself had exerted a kind of hypnotic force that partially had paralyzed her faculties and aroused her fears while still in his presence her first feeling in escaping had been one of reliefand then she began to regret not having gone to headquarters hadnt she been foolish in the retrospect the elements in him that had disturbed her were less disquieting his intellectual fascination was enhanced and in that very emancipation from cant and convention characteristic of the order to which he belonged had lain much of his charm she had attracted him as a woman there was no denying that he who had studied and travelled and known life in many lands had discerned in her janet bumpus some quality to make him desire her acknowledge her as a comrade tremblingly she exulted in the possession of that qualitywhatever it might be ditmar too had perceived it he had not known how to value it with this thought came a flaming suggestionditmar should see her with this man rolfe she would make him scorch with the fires of jealousy ditmar should know that she had joined his enemies the industrial workers of the world of the world her shackles had been cast off at last and then suddenly she felt tired the prospect of returning to fillmore street to the silent flatmade the more silent by her mothers tragic presenceoverwhelmed her the ache in her heart began to throb again how could she wait until the dawn of another day  in the black hours of the morning with the siren dinning in her ears a hoarse call to war janet leaped from her bed and began to dress there is a degree of cold so sharp that it seems actually to smell and as she stole down the stairs and out of the door she shivered assailed by a sense of loneliness and fear yet an insistent voice urged her on whispering that to remain at home inactive was to go mad salvation and relief lay in plunging into the struggle in contributing her share toward retribution and victory victory in faber street the light of the electric arcs tinged the snow with blue and the flamboyant advertisements of breakfast foods cigarettes and ales seemed but the mockery of an activity now unrealizable the groups and figures scattered here and there farther down the street served only to exaggerate its wide emptiness what could these do what could she accomplish against the mighty power of the mills gradually as she stood gazing she became aware of a beating of feet upon the snow over her shoulder she caught the gleam of steel a squad of soldiers muffled in heavy capes and woolen caps was marching along the cartracks she followed them at the corner of west street in obedience to a sharp command she saw them halt turn and advance toward a small crowd gathered there it scattered only to collect again when the soldiers had passed on janet joined them she heard men cursing the soldiers the women stood a little aside some were stamping to keep warm and one with a bundle in her arms which janet presently perceived to be a child sank down on a stone step and remained there crouching resigned  we gotta right to stay here in the street we gotta right to live i guess the girls teeth were chattering but she spoke with such vehemence and spirit as to attract janets attention you worked in the chippering like meyes she asked  janet nodded the faded lemoncoloured shawl the girl had wrapped about her head emphasized the dark beauty of her oval face she smiled and her white teeth were fairly dazzling impulsively she thrust her arm through janets  you americanyou comrade you come to help she asked  ive never done any picketing  i showa you  the dawn had begun to break revealing little by little the outlines of cruel ugly buildings the great mill looming darkly at the end of the street and janet found it scarcely believable that only a little while ago she had hurried thither in the mornings with anticipation and joy in her heart eager to see ditmar to be near him the sight of two policemen hurrying toward them from the direction of the canal aroused her with sullen murmurs the group started to disperse but the woman with the baby numb with cold was slow in rising and one of the policemen thrust out his club threateningly  move on you cant sit here he said  with a lithe movement like the spring of a cat the italian girl flung herself between thema remarkable exhibition of spontaneous inflammability her eyes glittered like the points of daggers and as though they had been dagger points the policeman recoiled a little the act which was absolutely natural superb electrified janet restored in an instant her own fierceness of spirit the girl said something swiftly in italian and helped the woman to rise paying no more attention to the policeman janet walked on but she had not covered half the block before she was overtaken by the girl her anger had come and gone in a flash her vivacity had returned her vitality again found expression in an abundant good nature and good will she asked janets name volunteering the information that her own was gemma that she was a fine speeder in the chippering mill where she had received nearly seven dollars a week she had been among the first to walk out  why did you walk out asked janet curiously  why i get mad when i know that my wages is cut i want the moneyi get married  is that why you are striking asked janet curiously  that is whyof course  then you havent heard any of the speakers they say it is for a causethe workers are striking for freedom some day they will own the mills i heard a man named rolfe yesterday  the girl gave her a radiant smile  rolfe it is beautiful what rolfe said you think so i think so i am for the cause i hate the capitalist we will win and get more money until we have all the money we will be rich and you why do you strike  i was mad too janet replied simply  revenge exclaimed the girl glittering again i understan here come the scabs now i show you  the light had grown but the stores were still closed and barred along faber street singly or in little groups anxiously glancing around them behind them came the workers who still clung desperately to their jobs gemma fairly darted at two girls who sought the edge of the sidewalk seizing them by the sleeves and with piteous expressions they listened while she poured forth on them a stream of italian after a moment one tore herself away but the other remained and began to ask questions presently she turned and walked slowly away in the direction from which she had come  i get her exclaimed gemma triumphantly  what did you say asked janet  listenthat she take the bread from our mouths she is traditorescab we strike for them too is it not so  it is no use for them to work for wages that starve we win the strike we get good wages for all here comes anothershe is a jewessyou try you spik  janet failed with the jewess who obstinately refused to listen or reply as the two walked along with her one on either side near west street they spied a policeman and desisted up and down faber street everywhere the game went on but the police were watchful and once a detachment of militia passed the picketing had to be done quickly in the few minutes that were to elapse before the gates should close janets blood ran faster she grew excited absorbed bolder as she perceived the apologetic attitude of the scabs and she began to despise them with gemmas heartiness and soon she had lost all sense of surprise at finding herself arguing pleading appealing to several women in turn fluently in the language of the industrial revolution somebecause she was an americanexamined her with furtive curiosity others pretended not to understand accelerating their pace she gained no converts that morning but one girl pale anemic with high cheek bones evidently a slavlistened to her intently  i gotta right to work she said  not if others will starve because you work objected janet  if i dont work i starve said the girl  no the committee will take care of youthere will be food for all how much do you get now  four dollar and a half  you starve now janet declared contemptuously the quicker you join us the sooner youll get a living wage  the girl was not quite convinced she stood for a while undecided and then ran abruptly off in the direction of west street janet sought for others but they had ceased coming only the scattered prowling picketers remained  over the black rim of the clarendon mill to the eastward the sky had caught fire the sun had risen the bells were ringing riotously resonantly in the clear cold air another working day had begun  janet benumbed with cold yet agitated and trembling because of her unwonted experience of the morning made her way back to fillmore street she was prepared to answer any questions her mother might ask as they ate their dismal breakfast and hannah asked no questions she longed to blurt out where she had been to announce that she had cast her lot with the strikers the foreigners to defend them and declare that these were not to blame for the misfortunes of the family but men like ditmar and the owners of the mills the capitalists her mother she reflected bitterly had never once betrayed any concern as to her shattered happiness but gradually as from time to time she glanced covertly at hannahs face her resentment gave way to apprehension hannah did not seem now even to be aware of her presence this persistent apathy filled her with a dread she did not dare to acknowledge  mother she cried at last  hannah started have you finished she asked  yes  youve ben out in the cold and you havent eaten much janet fought back her tears oh yes i have she managed to reply convinced of the futility of speech of all attempts to arouse her mother to a realization of the situation perhapsthough her heart contracted at the thought perhaps it was a merciful thing but to live day after day in the presence of that comfortless apathy later in the morning she went out to walk the streets and again in the afternoon and twice she turned her face eastward in the direction of the francobelgian hall her courage failed her how would these foreigners and the strange leaders who had come to organize them receive her ditmars stenographer she would have to tell them she was ditmars stenographer they would find it out and now she was filled with doubts about rolfe had he really thought she could be of use to them around the common in front of the city hall men went about their affairs alertly or stopped one another to talk about the strike in faber street indeed an air of suppressed excitement prevailed newsboys were shouting out extras but business went on as though nothing had happened to disturb it there was however the spectacle unusual at this time of day of operatives mingling with the crowd while policemen stood watchfully at the corners a company of soldiers marched by drawing the people in silence to the curb janet scanned the faces of these idle operatives they seemed for the most part either calm or sullen wanting the fire and passion of the enthusiasts who had come out to picket in the early hours of the day she sought vainly for the italian girl with whom she had made friends despondency grew in her a sense of isolation of lacking any one now to whom she might turn and these feelings were intensified by the air of confidence prevailing here the strike was crushed injustice and wrong had triumphedwould always triumph in front of the banner office she heard a man say to an acquaintance who had evidently just arrived in townthe chippering sure thats running by tomorrow ditmarll have a full force there now that the militia has come i guess weve got this thing scotched  just how and when that order and confidence of faber street began to be permeated by disquietude and alarm janet could not have said something was happening somewhereor about to happen an obscure apparently telepathic process was at work people began to hurry westward a few had abandoned the sidewalk and were running while other pedestrians more timid were equally concerned to turn and hasten in the opposite direction at the corner of west street was gathering a crowd that each moment grew larger and larger despite the efforts of the police to disperse it these were strikers angry strikers they blocked the traffic halted the clanging trolleys surged into the mouth of west street booing and cursing at the soldiers whose threatening line of bayonets stretched across that thoroughfare halfway down toward the canal guarding the detested chippering mill bordering west street behind the companys lodginghouses on the canal were certain low buildings warehouses and on their roofs tense figures could be seen standing out against the sky the vanguard of the mob thrust on by increasing pressure from behind tumbled backward the thin cordon of police drew nearer and nearer the bayonets while the soldiers grimly held their ground a voice was heard on the roof a woman in the front rank of the mob gave a warning shriek and two swift streams of icy water burst forth from the warehouse parapet tearing the snow from the cobbles flying in heavy stinging spray as it advanced and mowed the strikers down and drove them like flies toward faber street screams of fright curses of defiance and hate mingled with the hissing of the water and the noise of its impact with the groundlike the tearing of heavy sailcloth then from somewhere near the edge of the mob came a single sharp detonation quickly followed by anotherbelow the watchmen on the roof a window crashed the nozzles on the roof were raised their streams sweeping around in a great semicircle bowled down the rioters below the telltale wisps of smoke and no sooner had the avalanche of water passed than the policemen who forewarned had sought refuge along the walls rushed forward and seized a man who lay gasping on the snow dazed half drowned he had dropped his pistol they handcuffed him and dragged him away through the ranks of the soldiers which opened for him to pass the mob including those who had been flung down bruised and drenched and who had painfully got to their feet again had backed beyond the reach of the water and for a while held that ground until above its hoarse defiant curses was heard from behind the throbbing of drums  cossacks more cossacks  the cry was taken up by canadians italians belgians poles slovaks jews and syrians the drums grew louder the pressure from the rear was relaxed the throng in faber street began a retreat in the direction of the power plant down that street now in double time came three companies of boston militia newly arrived in hampton bluetaped gaitered slouchhatted from columns of fours they wheeled into line and with bayonets at charge slowly advanced then the boldest of the mob who still lingered sullenly gave way west street was cleared and on the wider thoroughfare the long line of traffic the imprisoned trolleys began to move again  janet had wedged herself into the press far enough to gain a view down west street of the warehouse roofs to see the water turned on to hear the screams and the curses and then the shots once more she caught the contagious rage of the mob the spectacle had aroused her to fury it seemed ignominious revolting that human beings already sufficiently miserable should be used thus as she retreated reluctantly across the car tracks her attention was drawn to a man at her side a slovak his face was white and pinched his clothes were wet suddenly he stopped turned and shook his fist at the line of soldiers  the cossack the politzman belong to the boss the capitalist he cried we aint got no right to live i say kill the capitalistkill ditmar  a man with a deputys shield ran toward them  move on he said brutally move on or ill roil you in and janet once clear of the people fled westward the words the foreigner had spoken ringing in her ears she found herself repeating them aloud kill ditmar as she hurried through the gathering dusk past the power house with its bottleshaped chimneys and crossed the little bridge over the stream beside the chocolate factory she gained the avenue she had trod with eda on that summer day of the circus here was the ragpickers shop the fence covered with bedraggled posters the deserted grandstand of the baseball park spread with a milkyblue mantle of snow and beyond the monotonous frame cottages all built from one model now she descried looming above her the outline of torreys hill blurred and melting into a darkening sky and turned into the bleak lane where stood the francobelgian hallhampton headquarters of the industrial workers of the world she halted a moment at sight of the crowd of strikers loitering in front of it then went on again mingling with them excitedly beside the little building its lines were simple and unpretentious and yet it had an exotic character all its own differing strongly from the surrounding houses it might have been transported from a foreign country and set down here as the home of that odd cooperative society of thrifty and gregarious belgians it had stimulated her imagination and once before she had gazed as now through the yellowed lanternlike windows of the little store at the women and children waiting to fill their baskets with the days provisions in the middle of the building was an entrance leading up to the second floor presently she gathered the courage to enter her heart was pounding as she climbed the dark stairs and thrust open the door and she stood a moment on the threshold almost choked by the fumes of tobacco bewildered by the scene within confused by the noise through a haze of smoke she beheld groups of swarthy foreigners fiercely disputing among themselvesapparently on the verge of actual combat while a sprinkling of silent spectators of both sexes stood at the back of the hall at the far end was a stage still set with painted sylvan scenery and seated there alone above the confusion and the strife with a calmness a detachment almost disconcerting was a stout man with long hair and a loose black tie he was smoking a cigar and reading a newspaper which he presently flung down taking up another from a pile on the table beside him suddenly one of the groups shouting and gesticulating surged toward him and made an appeal through their interpreter he did not appear to be listening without so much as lowering his newspaper he spoke a few words in reply and the group retired satisfied by some incomprehensible power he dominated panting fascinated loath to leave yet fearful janet watched him breathing now deeply this atmosphere of smoke of strife and turmoil she found it grateful for the strike the battle was in her own soul as well momentarily she had forgotten rolfe who had been in her mind as she had come hither and then she caught sight of him in a group in the centre of the hall he saw her he was making his way toward her he was holding her hands looking down into her face with that air of appropriation of possession she remembered but she felt no resentment now only a fierce exultation at having dared  youve come to join us he exclaimed i thought id lost you  he bent closer to her that she might hear  we are having a meeting of the committee he said and she smiled despite her agitation this struck her as humorous and rolfe smiled back at her you wouldnt think so but antonelli knows how to manage them he is a general come i will enlist you you shall be my recruit  but what can i do she asked  i have been thinking you said you were a stenographerwe need stenographers clerks you will not be wasted come in here  behind her two boxlike rooms occupying the width of the building had been turned into offices and into one of these rolfe led her men and women were passing in and out while in a corner a man behind a desk sat opening envelopes deftly extracting bills and postoffice orders and laying them in a drawer on the wall of this same room was a bookcase half filled with nondescript volumes  the bibliothequethats french for the library of the francobelgian cooperative association explained rolfe and this is comrade sanders sanders is easier to say than czernowitz here is the young lady i told you about who wishes to help usmiss bumpus  mr sanders stopped counting his money long enough to grin at her  you will be welcome he said in good english stenographers are scarce here when can you come  tomorrow morning answered janet  good he said ill have a machine for you what kind do you use  she told him instinctively she took a fancy to this little man whose flannel shirt and faded purple necktie whose blue unshaven face and tousled black hair seemed incongruous with an alert businesslike and efficient manner his nose though not markedly jewish betrayed in him the blood of that vital race which has triumphantly survived so many centuries of bondage and oppression  he was a find czernowitzhe calls himself sanders rolfe explained as they entered the hall once more an operative in the patuxent educated himself went to night schoolmight have been a capitalist like so many of his tribe if he hadnt loved humanity youll get along with him  im sure i shall she replied  rolfe took from his pocket a little red button with the letters iww printed across it he pinned it caressingly on her coat  now you are one of us he exclaimed youll come tomorrow  ill come tomorrow she repeated drawing away from him a little  andwe shall be friends  she nodded i must go now i think  addio he said i shall look for you for the present i must remain here with the committee  when janet reached faber street she halted on the corner of stanley to stare into the window of the glorified drugstore but she gave no heed to the stationery the cameras and candy displayed there being in the emotional state that reduces to unreality objects of the commonplace everyday world presently however she became aware of a man standing beside her  havent we met before he asked orcan i be mistaken  some oddly familiar quizzical note in his voice stirred as she turned to him a lapsed memory the hawklike yet benevolent and illuminating look he gave her recalled the man at silliston whom she had thought a carpenter though he was dressed now in a warm suit of gray wool and wore a white low collar  in silliston she exclaimed whywhat are you doing here  wellthis instant i was just looking at those notepapers wondering which i should choose if i really had good taste but its very puzzlingisnt itwhen one comes from the country now that saffron with the rough edges is veryartistic dont you think so  she looked at him and smiled though his face was serious  you dont really like it yourself she informed him  now youre reflecting on my taste he declared  oh noits because i saw the fence you were making is it finished yet  i put the last pineapple in place the day before christmas do you remember the pineapples  she nodded and the house and the garden  oh those will never be finished i shouldnt have anything more to do  is thatall you do she asked  its more important than anything else but you have you been back to silliston since i saw you ive been waiting for another call  you havent even thought of me since she was moved to reply in the same spirit  havent i he exclaimed i wondered when i came up here to hampton whether i mightnt meet youand here you are doesnt that prove it  she laughed somewhat surprised at the ease with which he had diverted her drawn her out of the tense emotional mood in which he had discovered her as before he puzzled her but the absence of any flirtatious suggestion in his talk gave her confidence he was just friendly  sometimes i hoped i might see you in hampton she ventured  well here i am i heard the explosion and came  the explosion the strike she exclaimed suddenly enlightened now i remember you said something about hampton being nitroglycerinehuman nitroglycerine you predicted this strike  did i perhaps i did he assented maybe you suggested the idea  i suggested it oh no i didntit was new to me it frightened me at the time but it started me thinking about a lot of things that had never occurred to me  you might have suggested the idea without intending to you know there are certain people who inspire propheciesperhaps you are one  his tone was playful but she was quick to grasp at an inferencesince his glance was fixed on the red button she wore  you meant that i would explode too  oh nonothing so terrible as that he disclaimed and yet most of us have explosives stored away inside of usinstincts impulses and all that sort of thing that wont stand too much bottlingup  yes ive joined the strike she spoke somewhat challengingly though she had an uneasy feeling that defiance was somewhat out of place with him i suppose you think it strange since im not a foreigner and havent worked in the mills but i dont see why that should make any difference if you believe that the workers havent had a chance  no difference he agreed pleasantly no difference at all  dont you sympathize with the strikers she insisted orare you on the other side the side of the capitalists  i im a spectatoran innocent bystander  you dont sympathize with the workers she cried  indeed i do i sympathize with everybody  with the capitalists  why not  why not because theyve had everything their own way theyve exploited the workers deceived and oppressed them taken all the profits she was using glibly her newly acquired labour terminology  isnt that a pretty good reason for sympathizing with them he inquired  what do you mean  well i should think it might be difficult to be happy and have done all that at any rate it isnt my notion of happiness is it yours  for a moment she considered this  nonot exactly she admitted but they seem happy she insisted vehemently they have everything they want and they do exactly as they please without considering anybody except themselves what do they care how many they starve and make miserable youyou dont know you cant know what it is to be driven and used and flung away  almost in tears she did not notice his puzzled yet sympathetic glance  the operatives the workers create all the wealth and the capitalists take it from them from their wives and children  now i know what youve been doing he said accusingly youve been studying economics  her brow puckered  studying what  economicsthe distribution of wealth its enough to upset anybody  but im not upset she insisted smiling in spite of herself at his comical concern  its very exciting i remember reading a book once on economics and such things and i couldnt sleep for a week it was called the organization of happiness i believe and it described just how the world ought to be arrangedand isnt i thought seriously of going to washington and telling the president and congress about it  it wouldnt have done any good said janet  no i realized that  the only thing that will do any good is to strike and keep on striking until the workers own the millstake everything away from the capitalists  its very simple he agreed much simpler than the book i read thats what they call syndicalism isnt it  yes she was conscious of his friendliness of the fact that his skepticism was not cynical yet she felt a strong desire to convince him to vindicate her new creed theres a man named rolfe an educated man whos lived in italy and england who explains it wonderfully hes one of the iww leadersyou ought to hear him  rolfe converted you ill go to hear him  yesbut you have to feel it you have to know what it is to be kept down and crushed if youd only stay here awhile  oh i intend to he replied  she could not have said why but she felt a certain relief on hearing this  then youll see for yourself she cried i guess thats what youve come for isnt it  well partly to tell the truth ive come to open a restaurant  to open a restaurant somehow she was unable to imagine him as the proprietor of a restaurant but isnt it rather a bad time she gasped  i dont look as if i had an eye for businessdo i but i have no its a good timeso many people will be hungry especially children im going to open a restaurant for children oh it will be very modest of coursei suppose i ought to call it a soup kitchen  oh she exclaimed staring at him then you really the sentence remained unfinished im sorry she said simply you made me think  oh you mustnt pay any attention to what i say come round and see my establishment number 77 dey street one flight up no elevator will you  she laughed tremulously as he took her hand  yes indeed i will she promised and she stood awhile staring after him she was glad he had come to hampton and yet she did not even know his name     chapter xvi  she had got another placesuch was the explanation of her new activities janet gave to hannah who received it passively and the question dreaded about ditmar was never asked hannah had become as a child performing her tasks by the momentum of habituation occasionally talking simply of trivial everyday affairs as though the old life were going on continuously at times indeed she betrayed concern about edward wondering whether he were comfortable at the mill and she washed and darned the clothes he sent home by messenger she hoped he would not catch cold her suffering seemed to have relaxed it was as though the tortured portion of her brain had at length been seared to janet her mothers condition when she had time to think of itwas at once a relief and a new and terrible source of anxiety  mercifully however she had little leisure to reflect on that tragedy else her own sanity might have been endangered as soon as breakfast was over she hurried across the city to the francobelgian hall and often did not return until nine oclock at night usually so tired that she sank into bed and fell asleep for she threw herself into her new labours with the desperate energy that seeks forgetfulness not daring to pause to think about herself to reflect upon what the future might hold for her when the strike should be over nor did she confine herself to typewriting but as with ditmar constantly assumed a greater burden of duty helping czernowitzwho had the work of five menwith his accounts with the distribution of the funds to the everincreasing number of the needy who were facing starvation the money was paid out to them in proportion to the size of their families as the strike became more and more effective their number increased until many mills had closed other mills including the chippering were still making a desperate attempt to operate their looms and sixteen thousand operatives were idle she grew to know these operatives who poured all day long in a steady stream through headquarters she heard their stories she entered into their lives she made decisions some even in those early days of the strike were frauds were hiding their savings but for the most part investigation revealed an appalling destitution a resolution to suffer for the workers cause a few complained the majority were resigned some indeed showed exaltation and fire were undaunted by the task of picketing in the cold mornings by the presence of the soldiery in this work of dealing with the operatives janet had the advice and help of anna mower a young woman who herself had been a skilled operative in the clarendon mill and who was giving evidence of unusual qualities of organization and leadership anna with no previous practise in oratory had suddenly developed the gift of making speeches the more effective with her fellow workers because unstudied because they flowed directly out of an experience she was learning to interpret and universalize janet who heard her once or twice admired and envied her they became friends  the atmosphere of excitement in which janet now found herself was cumulative day by day one strange event followed another and at times it seemed as if this extraordinary existence into which she had been plunged were all a feverish dream hither to the absurd little solle de reunion of the francobelgian hall came notables from the great world emissaries from an uneasy governor delegations from the legislature members of the congress of the united states and even senators students investigators men and women of prominence in the universities magazine writers to consult with uncouth leaders of a rebellion that defied and upset the powers which hitherto had so serenely ruled unchallenged rolfe identified these visitors and one morning called her attention to one who he said was the nations foremost authority on social science janet possessed all unconsciously the new england reverence for learning she was stirred by the sight of this distinguishedlooking person who sat on the painted stage fingering his glasses and talking to antonelli the two men made a curious contrast but her days were full of contrasts of which her mood exultingly approved the politicians were received cavalierly toward these who sought to act as gobetweens in the conflict antonelli was contemptuous he behaved like the general of a conquering army and his audacity was reflected in the other leaders in rolfe in the committee itself  that committee a neverending source of wonder to janet with its nine or ten nationalities and interpreters was indeed a triumph over the obstacles of race and language a babel made successful in a community of anglosaxon traditions an amazing anomaly the habiliments of the west the sack coats and sweaters the slouch hats and caps the socalled derbies pulled down over dark brows and flashing eyes lent to these peasant types an incongruity that had the air of ferocity the faces of most of them were covered with a blueblack stubble of beard some slouched in their chairs others stood and talked in groups gesticulating with cigars and pipes yet a keen spectator after watching them awhile through the smoke might have been able to pick out striking personalities among them he would surely have noticed froment the stout limping man under whose white eyebrows flashed a pair of livid blue and peculiarly gallic eyes he held the belgians in his hand lindtzki the pole with his zealots face radeau the big canadian in the checked mackinaw and findley the young americanless by any arresting quality of feature than by an expression suggestive of practical wisdom  imagine then on an afternoon in the middle phase of the strike some half dozen of the lawmakers of a sovereign state tophatted and conventionally garbed in black accustomed to authority to conferring favours instead of requesting them climbing the steep stairs and pausing on the threshold of that hall fingering their watch chains awaiting recognition by the representatives of the new and bewildering force that had arisen in an historic commonwealth a debate was in progress some of the debaters indeed looked over their shoulders but the leader who sat above them framed in the sylvan setting of the stage never so much as deigned to glance up from his newspaper a halfburned cigar rolled between his mobile lips he sat on the back of his neck and yet he had an air napoleonic nietzschean it might better be saidalthough it is safe to assert that these moulders of american institutions knew little about that terrible philosopher who had raised his voice against the slave morals of christianity it was their first experience with the superman it remained for the canadian radeau when a lull arrived in the turmoil to suggest that the gentlemen be given chairs  sure give them chairs assented antonelli in a voice hoarse from speechmaking breathtaking audacity to certain spectators who had followed the delegation hither some of whom could not refrain from speculating whether it heralded the final scrapping of the machinery of the state amusing to cynical metropolitan reporters who grinned at one another as they prepared to take down the proceedings evoking a fierce approval in the breasts of all rebels among whom was janet the legislative chairman a stout and suave gentleman of irish birth proceeded to explain how greatly concerned was the legislature that the deplorable warfare within the state should cease they had come he declared to aid in bringing about justice between labour and capital  well get justice without the help of the state remarked antonelli curtly while a murmur of approval ran through the back of the hall  that was scarcely the attitude said the chairman he had expected he knew that such a strike as this had engendered bitterness there had been much suffering sacrifice undoubtedly on both sides but he was sure if mr antonelli and the committee would accept their services here he was interrupted  had the mill owners accepted their services  the chairman cleared his throat  the fact was that the mill owners were more difficult to get together in a body a meeting would be arrangedwhen you arrange a meeting let me know said antonelli  a laugh went around the room it was undoubtedly very difficult to keep ones temper under such treatment the chairman looked it  a meeting would be arranged he declared with a longsuffering expression he even smiled a little in the meantime  what can your committee do demanded one of the strike leaders passionatelyit was findley if you find one party wrong can your state force it to do right can you legislators be impartial when you have not lived the bitter life of the workers would you arbitrate a question of life and death and are the worst wages paid in these mills anything short of death do you investigate because conditions are bad or because the workers broke loose and struck why did you not come before the strike  this drew more approval from the rear why indeed the chairman was adroit he had pulled himself out of many tight places in the assembly chamber but now he began to perspire to fumble in his coat tails for a handkerchief the legislature he maintained could not undertake to investigate such matters until called to its attention  later on a tall gentleman whom heaven had not blessed with tact saw fit to deplore the violence that had occurred he had no doubt the leaders of the strike regretted it as much as he he was confident it would be stopped when public opinion would be wholly and unreservedly on the side of the strikers  public opinion savagely cried lindtzki who spoke english with only a slight accent if your little boy if your little girl come to you and ask for shoes for bread and you say i have no shoes i have no bread but public opinion is with us would that satisfy you  this drew so much applause that the tall lawmaker sat down again with a look of disgust on his face the committee withdrew and for many weeks thereafter the state they represented continued to pay some four thousand dollars daily to keep its soldiers on the streets of hampton  in the meanwhile janet saw much of rolfe owing to his facile command of language he was peculiarly fitted to draft those proclamations bombastically worded in the french style issued and circulated by the strike committeeappeals to the polyglot army to withstand the pangs of hunger to hold out for the terms laid down assurances that victory was at hand walking up and down the bibliotheque his hands behind his back his red lips gleaming as he spoke he dictated these documents to janet in the ecstasy of this composition he had a way of shaking his head slowly from side to side and when she looked up she saw his eyes burning down at her a dozen times a day while she was at her other work he would come in and talk to her he excited her she was divided between attraction and fear of him and often she resented his easy assumption that a tie existed between themthe more so because this seemed to be taken for granted among certain of his associates in their eyes apparently she was rolfes recruit in more senses than one it was indeed a strange society in which she found herself and rolfe typified it he lived on the plane of the impulses and intellect discarded as inhibiting factors what are called moral standards decried individual discipline and restraint and while she had never considered these things the spectacle of a philosophyembodied in himthat frankly and cynically threw them overboard was disconcerting he regarded her as his proselyte he called her a puritan and he seemed more concerned that she should shed these relics of an ancestral code than acquire the doctrines of sorel and pouget and yet association with him presented the allurement of a dangerous adventure intellectually he fascinated her and still another motivewhich she partially disguised from herselfprevented her from repelling him that motive had to do with ditmar she tried to put ditmar from her mind she sought in desperation not only to keep busy but to steep and lose herself in this fierce creed as an antidote to the insistent throbbing pain that lay ambushed against her moments of idleness the second evening of her installation at headquarters she had worked beyond the supper hour helping sanders with his accounts she was loath to go home and when at last she put on her hat and coat and entered the hall rolfe who had been talking to jastro immediately approached her his liquid eyes regarded her solicitously  you must be hungry he said come out with me and have some supper  but she was not hungry what she needed was air then he would walk a little way with herhe wanted to talk to her she hesitated and then consented a fierce hope had again taken possession of her and when they came to warren street she turned into it  where are you going rolfe demanded  for a walk she said arent you coming  will you have supper afterwards  perhaps  he followed her puzzled yet piqued and excited by her manner as with rapid steps she hurried along the pavement he tried to tell her what her friendship meant to him they were he declared kindred spiritsfrom the first time he had seen her on the common he had known this she scarcely heard him she was thinking of ditmar and this was why she had led rolfe into warren street they might meet ditmar it was possible that he would be going to the mill at this time after his dinner she scrutinized every distant figure and when they reached the block in which he lived she walked more slowly from within the house came to her faintly the notes of a pianohis daughter amy was practising it was the music a hackneyed theme of schuberts played heavily that seemed to arouse the composite emotion of anger and hatred yet of sustained attraction and wild regret she had felt before but never so poignantly as now and she lingered perversely resolved to steep herself in the agony  who lives here rolfe asked  mr ditmar she answered  the agent of the chippering mill  she nodded  hes the worst of the lot rolfe said angrily if it werent for him wed have this strike won today he owns this town hes run it to suit himself he stiffens up the owners and holds the other mills in line hes a type a driver the kind of man we must get rid of look at himhe lives in luxury while his people are starving  get rid of repeated janet in an odd voice  oh i dont mean to shoot him rolfe declared but he may get shot for all i know by some of these slaves hes made desperate  they wouldnt dare shoot him janet said and whatever he is he isnt a coward hes stronger than the others hes more of a man  rolfe looked at her curiously  what do you know about him he asked  ii know all about him i was his stenographer  you his stenographer then why are you herewith us  because i hate him she cried vehemently because ive learned that its truewhat you say about the mastersthey only think of themselves and their kind and not of us they use us  he tried to use you you loved him  how dare you say that  he fell back before her anger  i didnt mean to offend you he exclaimed i was jealousim jealous of every man youve known i want you ive never met a woman like you  they were the very words ditmar had used she did not answer and for a while they walked along in silence leaving warren street and cutting across the city until they canoe in sight of the common rolfe drew nearer to her  forgive me he pleaded you know i would not offend you come well have supper together and i will teach you more of what you have to know  where she asked  at the hamptonit is a little cafe where we all go perhaps youve been there  no said janet  it doesnt compare with the cafes of europeor of new york perhaps we shall go to them sometime together but it is cosy and warm and all the leaders will be there youll comeyes  yes ill come she said  the hampton was one of the citys secondclass hotels but sufficiently pretentious to have in its basement a cafe furnished in the mission style of brass tacks and dull red leather in the warm foodscented air fantastic wisps of smoke hung over the groups among them janet made out several of the itinerant leaders of syndicalism loosetied debonnair giving a tremendous impression of freedom as they laughed and chatted with the women for there were women ranging from the redoubtable nellie bond herself down to those who may be designated as campfollowers rolfe as he led janet to a table in a corner of the room greeted his associates with easy camaraderie from miss bond he received an illuminating smile janet wondered at her striking good looks at the boldness and abandon with which she talked to jastro or exchanged sallies across the room the atmosphere of this tawdry resort formerly frequented by shop girls and travelling salesmen was magically transformed by the presence of this company made bohemian cosmopolitan exhilarating and janet her face flushed sat gazing at the scene while rolfe consulted the bill of fare and chose a beefsteak and french fried potatoes the apathetic waiter in the soiled linen jacket he addressed as comrade janet protested when he ordered cocktails  you must learn to live to relax to enjoy yourself he declared  but a horror of liquor held her firm in her refusal rolfe drank his and while they awaited the beefsteak she was silent the prey of certain misgivings that suddenly assailed her lise she remembered had sometimes mentioned this place though preferring grubers and she was struck by the contrast between this spectacle and the grimness of the strike these people had come to encourage and sustain the conflict in the streets the suffering in the tenements she glanced at rolfe noting the manner in which he smoked cigarettes sensually as though seeking to wring out of each all there was to be got before flinging it down and lighting another again she was struck by the anomaly of a religion that had indeed enthusiasms sacrifices perhaps but no disciplines he threw it out in snatches this religion while relating the histories of certain persons in the room of jastro for instance letting fall a hint to the effect that this evangelist and bliss bond were dwelling together in more than amity  then you dont believe in marriage she demanded suddenly  rolfe laughed  what is it he exclaimed but the survival of the system of property its slavery taboo a device upheld by the master class to keep women in bondage in superstition by inducing them to accept it as a decree of god  did the masters themselves ever respect it or any other decrees of god they preached to the slaves read history and you will see they had their loves their mistresses read the newspapers and you will find out whether they respect it today but they are very anxious to have you and me respect it and all the other christian commandments because they will prevent us from being discontented they say that we must be satisfied with the situation in this world in which god has placed us and we shall have our reward in the next  she shivered slightly not only at the ideas thus abruptly enunciated but because it occurred to her that those others must be taking for granted a certain relationship between herself and rolfe but presently when the supper arrived these feelings changed she was very hungry and the effect of the food of the hot coffee was to dispel her doubt and repugnance to throw a glamour over the adventure to restore to rolfes arguments an exciting and alluring appeal and with renewed physical energy she began to experience once more a sense of fellowship with these free and daring spirits who sought to avenge her wrongs and theirs  for us who create there are no rules of conduct no conventions rolfe was saying we do not care for the opinions of the middle class of the bourgeois with us men and women are on an equality it is fear that has kept the workers down and now we have cast that offwe know our strength as they say in italy il mondo e a chi se lo piglia the world belongs to him who is bold  italian is a beautiful language she exclaimed  i will teach you italian he said  i want to learnso much she sighed  your soul is parched he said in a commiserating tone i will water it i will teach you everything his words aroused a faint derisive echo ditmar had wish to teach her too but now she was strongly under the spell of the new ideas hovering like shining gossamer spirits just beyond her reach that she sought to grasp and correlate unlike the code which rolfe condemned they seemed not to be separate from life opposed to it but entered even into that most important of its elements sex in deference to that other code ditmar had made her his mistress and because he was concerned for his position and the security of the ruling class had sought to hide the fact rolfe with a cigarette between his red lips sat back in his chair regarding with sensuous enjoyment the evident effect of his arguments  but love she interrupted when presently he had begun to talk again she strove inarticulately to express an innate feminine objection to relationships that were made and broken at pleasure  love is nothing but attraction between the sexes the lifeforce working in us and when that attraction ceases what is left bondage the hideous bondage of christian marriage in which women promise to love and obey forever  but womenwomen are not like men when once they give themselves they do not so easily cease to love theythey suffer  he did not seem to observe the bitterness in her voice  ah that is sentiment he declared something that will not trouble women when they have work to do inspiring work it takes time to change our ideas to learn to see things as they are he leaned forward eagerly but you will learn you are like some of those rare women in history who have had the courage to cast off traditions you were not made to be a drudge  but now her own words not his were ringing in her headwomen do not so easily cease to love they suffer in spite of the new creed she had so eagerly and fiercely embraced in which she had sought deliverance and retribution did she still love ditmar and suffer because of him she repudiated the suggestion yet it persisted as she glanced at rolfes red lips and compared him with ditmar love rolfe might call it what he wouldthe lifeforce attraction between the sexes but it was proving stronger than causes and beliefs he too was making love to her like ditmar he wanted her to use and fling away when he should grow weary was he not pleading for himself rather than for the human cause he professed taking advantage of her ignorance and desperation of her craving for new experience and knowledge the suspicion sickened her were all men like that suddenly without apparent premeditation or connection the thought of the stranger from silliston entered her mind was he like that rolfe was bending toward her across the table solicitously whats the matter he asked  her reply was listless  nothingexcept that im tired i want to go home  not now he begged its early yet  but she insisted     chapter xvii  the next day at the noon hour janet entered dey street cheek by jowl there with the tall tenements whose spindledpillared porches overhung the darkened pavements were smaller houses of all ages and descriptions their lower floors altered to accommodate shops while in the very midst of the block stood a queer wooden building with two rows of dormer windows let into its highpitched roof it bore a curious resemblance to a town hall in the low countries in front of it the street was filled with children gazing up at the doorway where a man stood surveying themthe stranger from silliston there was a rush toward him a rush that drove janet against the wall almost at his side and he held up his hands in mock despair gently impeding the little bodies that strove to enter he bent over them to examine the numerals printed on pasteboard they wore on their breasts his voice was cheerful yet compassionate  its hard to wait i know im hungry myself he said but we cant all go up at once the building would fall down one to one hundred now and the second hundred will be first for supper thats fair isnt it  dozens of hands were raised  im twentynine  im three mister  im fortyone  he let them in one by one and they clattered up the stairs as he seized a tiny girl bundled in a dark red muffler and set her on the steps above him he smiled at janet  this is my restaurant he said  but she could not answer she watched him as he continued to bend over the children and when the smaller ones wept because they had to wait he whispered in their ears astonishing one or two into laughter some ceased crying and clung to him with dumb faith and after the chosen hundred had been admitted he turned to her again  you allow visitors  oh dear yes theyd come anyway theres one up there now a very swell lady from new yorkso swell i dont know what to say to her talk to her for me  but i shouldnt know what to say either replied janet she smiled but she had an odd desire to cry what is she doing here  oh thrashing round trying to connect with lifeshes one of the unfortunate unemployed  unemployed  the idle rich he explained perhaps you can give her a jobenlist her in the iww  we dont want that kind janet declared  have pity on her he begged nobody wants themthats why theyre so pathetic  she accompanied him up the narrow stairway to a great loft the bareness of which had been tempered by draped american flags from the trusses of the roof hung improvised electric lights and the children were already seated at the four long tables where half a dozen ladies were supplying them with enamelled bowls filled with steaming soup they attacked it ravenously and the absence of the talk and laughter that ordinarily accompany childrens feasts touched her impressed upon her as nothing else had done the destitution of the homes from which these little ones had come the supplies that came to hampton the money that poured into headquarters were not enough to allay the suffering even now and what if the strike should last for months would they be able to hold out to win in this mood of pity of anxiety mingled with appreciation and gratitude for what this man was doing she turned to speak to him to perceive on the platform at the end of the room a lady seated so complete was the curve of her back that her pose resembled a letter u set sidewise the gap from her crossed knee to her face being closed by a slender forearm and hand that held a lorgnette through which she was gazing at the children with an apparently absorbed interest this impression of willowy flexibility was somehow heightened by large pearshaped pendants hanging from her ears by a certain filminess in her black costume and hat flung across the table beside her was a long coat of grey fur she struck an odd note here presented a strange contrast to janets friend from silliston with his rough suit and fine but rugged features  im sorry i havent a table for you just at present he was saying but perhaps youll let me take your orderand he imitated the obsequious attitude of a waiter a little fresh caviar and a clear soup and then a fish  the lady took down her lorgnette and raised an appealing face  youre always joking brooks she chided him even when youre doing things like this i cant get you to talk seriously even when i come all the way from new york to find out whats going on here  how hungry children eat for instance he queried  dear little things its heartrending she exclaimed especially when i think of my own children who have to be made to eat tell me the nationality of that adorable tot at the end  perhaps miss bumpus can tell you he ventured and janet though distinctly uncomfortable and hostile to the lady was surprised and pleased that he should have remembered her name brooks she had called him that was his first name this strange and sumptuous person seemed intimate with him could it be possible that he belonged to her class mrs brocklehurst miss bumpus  mrs brocklehurst focussed her attention on janet through the lorgnette but let it fall immediately smiling on her brightly persuasively  how dye do she said stretching forth a slender arm and taking the girls somewhat reluctant hand do come and sit down beside me and tell me about everything here im sure you knowyou look so intelligent  her friend from silliston shot at janet an amused but fortifying glance and left them going down to the tables somehow that look of his helped to restore in her a sense of humour and proportion and her feeling became one of curiosity concerning this exquisitely soigneed being of an order she had read about but never encounteredan order which her newly acquired views declared to be usurpers and parasites but despite her palpable effort to be gracious perhaps because of itmrs brocklehurst had an air about her that was disconcerting janet however seemed composed as she sat down  im afraid i dont know very much maybe you will tell me something first  why certainly said mrs brocklehurst sweetly when she had got her breath  who is that man janet asked  whom do you meanmr insall  is that his name i didnt know ive seen him twice but he never told me  why my dear do you mean to say you havent heard of brooks insall  brooks insall janet repeated the name as her eyes sought his figure between the tables no  im sure i dont know why i should have expected you to hear of him declared the lady repentantly hes a writeran author and at this janet gave a slight exclamation of pleasure and surprise you admire writers hes done some delightful things  what does he write about janet asked  oh wild flowers and trees and mountains and streams and birds and humanshe has a wonderful insight into people  janet was silent she was experiencing a swift twinge of jealousy of that familiar rebellion against her limitations  you must read them my dear mrs brocklehurst continued softly in musical tones they are wonderful they have such distinction hes walked im told over every foot of new england talking to the farmers and their wives andall sorts of people she too paused to let her gaze linger upon insall laughing and chatting with the children as they ate he has such a splendid outdoor look dont you think and hes clever with his hands he bought an old abandoned farmhouse in silliston and made it all over himself until it looks as if one of our greatgreatgrandfathers had just stepped out of it to shoot an indian only much prettier and his garden is a dream its the most unique place ive ever known  janet blushed deeply as she recalled how she had mistaken him for a carpenter she was confused overwhelmed she had a sudden longing to leave the place to be alone to think about this discovery yet she wished to know more  but how did he happen to come here to hamptonto be doing this she asked  well thats just what makes him interesting one never can tell what hell do he took it into his head to collect the money to feed these children i suppose he gave much of it himself he has an income of his own though he likes to live so simply  this placeits not connected with any organization janet ejaculated  thats the trouble he doesnt like organizations and he doesnt seem to take any interest in the questions or movements of the day mrs brocklehurst complained or at least he refuses to talk about them though ive known him for many years and his people and mine were friends now there are lots of things i want to learn that i came up from new york to find out i thought of course hed introduce me to the strike leaders and he tells me he doesnt know one of them perhaps you know them she added with sudden inspiration  im only an employee at strike headquarters janet replied stiffening a little despite the ladys importuning lookwhich evidently was usually effective  you mean the iww  yes  meanwhile insall had come up and seated himself below them on the edge of the platform  oh brooks your friend miss bumpus is employed in the strike headquarters mrs brocklehurst cried and turning to janet she went on i didnt realize you were a factory girl i must say you dont look it  once more a gleam of amusement from insall saved janet had the effect of compelling her to meet the affair somewhat after his own manner he seemed to be putting the words into her mouth and she even smiled a little as she spoke  you never can tell what factory girls do look like in these days she observed mischievously  thats so mrs brocklehurst agreed we are living in such extraordinary times everything topsy turvy i ought to have realizedit was stupid of mei know several factory girls in new york ive been to their meetings ive had them at my houseshirtwaist strikers  she assumed again the willowy a position her fingers clasped across her knee her eyes supplicatingly raised to janet then she reached out her hand and touched the iww button do tell me all about the industrial workers and what they believe she pleaded  well said janet after a slight pause im afraid you wont like it much why do you want to know  because im so interestedespecially in the women of the movement i feel for them so i want to helpto do something too of course youre a suffragist  you mean do i believe in votes for women yes i suppose i do  but you must declared mrs brocklehurst still sweetly but with emphasis you wouldnt be working you wouldnt be striking unless you did  ive never thought about it said janet  but how are you working girls ever going to raise wages unless you get the vote its the only way men ever get anywherethe politicians listen to them she produced from her bag a gold pencil and a tablet mrs ned carfax is here from bostoni saw her for a moment at the hotel shes been here investigating for nearly three days she tells me ill have her send you suffrage literature at once if youll give me your address  you want a vote asked janet curiously gazing at the pearl earrings  certainly i want one  why  why repeated mrs brocklehurst  yes you must have everything you want  even then the ladys sweet reasonableness did not desert her she smiled winningly displaying two small and even rows of teeth  on principle my dear for one reason because i have such sympathy with women who toil and for another i believe the time has come when women must no longer be slaves they must assert themselves become individuals independent  but you exclaimed janet  mrs brocklehurst continued to smile encouragingly and murmured yes  you are not a slave  a delicate pink like the inside of a conch shell spread over mrs brocklehursts cheeks  were all slaves she declared with a touch of passion its hard for you to realize i know about those of us who seem more fortunate than our sisters but its true the men give us jewels and automobiles and clothes but they refuse to give us what every real woman cravesliberty  janet had become genuinely interested  but what kind of liberty  liberty to have a voice to take part in the government of our country to help make the laws especially those concerning workingwomen and children what they ought to be  here was altruism truly here were words that should have inspired janet yet she was silent mrs brocklehurst gazed at her solicitously  what are you thinking she urgedand it was janets turn to flush  i was just thinking that you seemed to have everything life has to give and yetand yet youre not happy  oh im not unhappy protested the lady why do you say that  i dont know you too seem to be wanting something  i want to be of use to count said mrs brocklehurstand janet was startled to hear from this womans lips the very echo of her own desires  mrs brocklehursts feelings had become slightly complicated it is perhaps too much to say that her complacency was shaken she was withal a person of resolutionof resolution taking the form of unswerving faith in herself a faith persisting even when she was being carried beyond her depth she had the kind of pertinacity that sever admits being out of depth the happy buoyancy that does not require to feel the bottom under ones feet she floated in swift currents when life became uncomfortable she evaded it easily and she evaded it now as she gazed at the calm but intent face of the girl in front of her by a characteristic inner refusal to admit that she had accidentally come in contact with something baking therefore she broke the silence  isnt that what you wantyou who are striking she asked  i think we want the things that youve got said janet a phrase one of the orators had used came into her mind enough money to live up to american standardsbut she did not repeat it enough money to be free to enjoy life to have some leisure and amusement and luxury the last three she took from the orators mouth  but surely exclaimed mrs brocklehurst surely you want more than that  janet shook her head  you asked me what we believed the iww the syndicalists and i told you you wouldnt like it well we believe in doing away with you the rich and taking all you have for ourselves the workers the producers we believe you havent any right to what youve got that youve fooled and cheated us out of it thats why we women dont care much about the vote i suppose though i never thought of it we mean to go on striking until weve got all that youve got  but what will become of us said mrs brocklehurst you wouldnt do away with all of us i admit there are many who dontbut some do sympathize with you will help you get what you want help you perhaps to see things more clearly to go about it lessruthlessly  ive told you what we believe repeated janet  im so glad i came cried mrs brocklehurst its most interesting i never knew what the syndicalists believed why its like the french revolutiononly worse how are you going to get rid of us cut our heads off  janet could not refrain from smiling  let you starve i suppose  really said mrs brocklehurst and appeared to be trying to visualize the process she was a true athenian she had discovered some new thing she valued discoveries more than all else in life she collected them though she never used them save to discuss them with intellectuals at her dinner parties now you must let me come to headquarters and get a glimpse of some of the leadersof antonelli and im told theres a fascinating man named rowe  rolfe janet corrected  rolfethats it she glanced down at the diminutive watch set with diamonds on her wrist rose and addressed insall oh dear i must be going im to lunch with nina carfax at one and shes promised to tell me a lot of things shes writing an article for cravens weekly all about the strike and the suffering and injusticeshe says its been horribly misrepresented to the public the mill owners have had it all their own way i think what youre doing is splendid brooks only here she gave him an appealing rather commiserating lookonly i do wish you would take more interest inin underlying principles  insall smiled  its a question of brains you have to have brains to be a sociologist he answered as he held up for her the fur coat with a gesture of gentle reproof she slipped into it and turned to janet  you must let me see more of you my dear she said im at the best hotel i cant remember the name theyre all so horriblebut ill be here until tomorrow afternoon i want to find out everything come and call on me youre quite the most interesting person ive met for a long timei dont think you realize how interesting you are au revoir she did not seem to expect any reply taking acquiescence for granted glancing once more at the rows of children who had devoured their meal in an almost uncanny silence she exclaimed the dears im going to send you a cheque brooks even if you have been horrid to meyou always are  horrid repeated insall put it down to ignorance  he accompanied her down the stairs from her willowy walk a sophisticated observer would have hazarded the guess that her search for an occupation had included a course of lessons in fancy dancing  somewhat dazed by this interview which had been so suddenly forced upon her janet remained seated on the platform she had the perception to recognize that in mrs brocklehurst and insall she had come in contact with a social stratum hitherto beyond the bounds of her experience those who belonged to that stratum were not characterized by the possession of independent incomes alone but by an attitude toward life a manner of not appearing to take its issues desperately ditmar was not like that she felt convicted of enthusiasms she was puzzled rather annoyed and ashamed insall and mrs brocklehurst different though they were had this attitude in common insall when he returned regarded her amusedly  so youd like to exterminate mrs brocklehurst he asked  and janet flushed well she forced me to say it  oh it didnt hurt her he said  and it didnt help her janet responded quickly  no it didnt help her insall agreed and laughed  but im not sure it isnt true she went on that we want what shes got the remark on her own lips surprised janet a little she had not really meant to make it insall seemed to have the quality of forcing one to think out loud  and what she wants youve got he told her  what have i got  perhaps youll find out some day  it may be too late she exclaimed if youd only tell me it might help  i think its something youll have to discover for yourself he replied more gravely than was his wont  she was silent a moment and then she demanded why didnt you tell me who you were you let me think when i met you in silliston that day that you were a carpenter i didnt know youd written books  you cant expect writers to wear uniforms like policementhough perhaps we ought to it might be a little fairer to the public he said besides i am a carpenter a better carpenter than a writer  id give anything to be an author she cried  its a hard life he assured her we have to go about seeking inspiration from others  is that why you came to hampton  well not exactly its a queer thing about inspiration you only find it when youre not looking for it  she missed the point of this remark though his eyes were on her they were not like rolfes eyes insinuating possessive they had the anomalistic quality of being at once personal and impersonal friendly alight evoking curiosity yet compelling trust  and you didnt tell me he reproached her that you were at iww headquarters  a desire for selfjustification impelled her to exclaim you dont believe in syndicalismand yet youve come here to feed these children  oh i think i understand the strike he said  how have you seen it have you heard the arguments  no ive seen you youve explained it  to mrs brocklehurst  it wasnt necessary he repliedand immediately added in semiserious apology i thought it was admirable what you said if shed talked to a dozen syndicalist leaders she couldnt have had it put more clearly only im afraid she doesnt know the truth when she hears it  now youre making fun of me  indeed im not he protested  but i didnt give any of the arguments any of thephilosophy she pronounced the word hesitatingly i dont understand it yet as well as i should  you are it he said its not always easy to understand what we areits generally after weve become something else that we comprehend what we have been  and while she was pondering over this one of the ladies who had been waiting on the table came toward insall  the children have finished brooks she informed him its time to let in the others  insall turned to janet this is miss bumpusand this is mrs maturin he said mrs maturin lives in silliston  the greeting of this lady differed from that of mrs brocklehurst she too took janets hand  have you come to help us she asked  and janet said oh id like to but i have other work  come in and see us again said insall and janet promising took her leave  who is she brooks mrs maturin asked when janet had gone  well he answered i dont know what does it matter  mrs maturin smiled  i should say that it did matter she replied but theres something unusual about herwhere did you find her  she found me and insall explained she was a stenographer it seems but now shes enlisted heart and soul with the syndicalists he added  a history mrs maturin queried well i neednt askits written on her face  thats all i know said insall  id like to know said mrs maturin you say shes in the strike  i should rather put it that the strike is in her  what do you mean brooks  but insall did not reply  janet came away from dey street in a state of mental and emotional confusion the encounter with mrs brocklehurst had been upsetting she had an uneasy feeling of having made a fool of herself in insalls eyes she desired his approval even on that occasion when she had first met him and mistaken him for a workman she had been conscious of a compelling faculty in him of a pressure he exerted demanding justification of herself and today because she was now pledged to syndicalism because she had made the startling discovery that he was a writer of some renown she had been more than ever anxious to vindicate her cause she found herself indeed wondering uneasily whether there were a higher truth of which he was in possession and the fact that his attitude toward her had been one of sympathy and friendliness rather than of disapproval that his insight seemed to have fathomed her case apprehended it in all but the details was even more disturbingyet vaguely consoling the consolatory element in the situation was somehow connected with the lady his friend from silliston to whom he had introduced her and whose image now came before her the more vividly perhaps in contrast with that of mrs brocklehurst mrs maturincould janet have so expressed her thought had appeared as an extension of insalls own personality she was a strong tall vital woman with a sweet irregularity of feature with a heavy crown of chestnut hair turning slightly grey quaintly braided becomingly framing her face her colour was high the impression she conveyed of having suffered was emphasized by the simple mourning gown she wore but the dominant note she had struck was one of dependability it was after all insalls dominant too insall had asked her to call again and the reflection that she might do so was curiously comforting the soup kitchen in the loft with these two presiding over it took on something of the aspect of a sanctuary  insall in some odd manner and through the medium of that frivolous lady had managed to reenforce certain doubts that had been stirring in janetdoubts of rolfe of the verity of the doctrine which with such abandon she had embraced it was insall who though remaining silent just by being there seemed to have suggested her manner of dealing with mrs brocklehurst it had indeed been his manner of dealing with mrs brocklehurst janet had somehow been using his words his method and thus for the first time had been compelled to look objectively on what she had deemed a part of herself we never know what we are he had said until we become something else he had forced her to use an argument that failed to harmonize somehow with rolfes poetical apologetics stripped of the glamour of these was not rolfes doctrine just one of taking taking and when the workers were in possession of all would not they be as badly off as mrs brocklehurst or ditmar rolfe despite the inspiring intellectual creed he professed lacked the poise and unity that go with happiness he wanted things for himself whereas she beheld in insall one who seemed emancipated from possessions whose life was so organized as to make them secondary affairs and she began to wonder what insall would think of ditmar  these sudden flashes of tenderness for ditmar startled and angered her she had experienced them before and always had failed to account for their intrusion into a hatred she cherished often at her desk in the bibliotheque she had surprised herself speculating upon what ditmar might be doing at that moment and it seemed curious living in the same city with him that she had not caught a glimpse of him during the strike more than once moved by a perverse impulse she had ventured of an evening down west street toward the guard of soldiers in the hope of catching sight of him he had possessed her and the memory of the wild joy of that possession of that surrender to great strength refused to perish why at such moments should she glory in a strength that had destroyed her and why when she heard him cursed as the man who stood more than any other in the way of the strikers victory should she paradoxically and fiercely rejoice why should she feel pride when she was told of the fearlessness with which he went about the streets and her heart stop beating when she thought of the possibility of his being shot for these unwelcome phenomena within herself janet could not account when they disturbed and frightened her she plunged into her work with the greater zeal  as the weeks went by the strain of the strike began to tell on the weak the unprepared on those who had many mouths to feed shivering with the cold of that hardest of winters these unfortunates flocked to the francobelgian hall where a little food or money in proportion to the size of their families was doled out to them in spite of the contributions received by mail of the soup kitchens and relief stations set up by various organizations in various parts of the city the supply little more than sufficed to keep alive the more needy portion of the five and twenty thousand who now lacked all other means of support janets heart was wrung as she gazed at the gaunt bewildered faces growing daily more tragic more bewildered and gaunt she marvelled at the animallike patience of these europeans at the dumb submission of most of them to privations that struck her as appalling some indeed complained but the majority recited in monotonous unimpassioned tones their stories of suffering or of ill treatment by the cossacks or the police the stipends were doled out by czernowitz but all through the week there were special appeals once it was a polish woman wan and white who carried her baby wrapped in a frayed shawl  wahna littel money for milk she said when at length their attention was drawn to her  but you get your money every saturday the secretary informed her kindly  she shook her head  baby die less i have littel milki show you  janet drew back before the sight of the child with its sunken cheeks and ghastly blue lips and she herself went out with the woman to buy the milk and afterwards to the dive in kendall street which she called homein one of those rear tenements separated from the front buildings by a narrow court reeking with refuse the place was dank and cold malodorous the man of the family the lodgers who lived in the other room of the kennel were out on the streets but when her eyes grew used to the darkness she perceived three silent children huddled in the bed in the corner  on another occasion a man came running up the stairs of the hall and thrust his way into a meeting of the committeeone of those normally happy irresponsible syrians who because of a love for holidays are the despair of mill overseers now he was dazed breathless his great eyes griefstricken like a wounded animals  she is killidd my wifede polees dey killidd her  it was anna mower who investigated the case the girl wasnt doing nothing but walk along hudson street when one of those hirelings set on her and beat her she put out her hand because she thought hed hit herand he gave her three or four with his billy and left her in the gutter if youd see her youd know she wouldnt hurt a fly shes that gentle looking like all the syrian women she had a dont be a scab ribbon onthats all she done somebodyll shoot that guy and i wouldnt blame em anna stood beside janets typewriter her face red with anger as she told the story  and how is the woman now asked janet  in bed with two ribs broken and a bruise on her back and a cut on her head i got a doctor he could hardly see her in that black place they live  such were the incidents that fanned the hatred into hotter and hotter flame daily reports were brought in of arrests of fines and imprisonments for picketing or sometimes merely for booing at the remnant of those who still clung to their employment one magistrate in particular a judge hennessy was hated above all others for giving the extreme penalty of the law and even stretching it minions slaves of the capitalists of the masters the courts were called and janet subscribed to these epithets beheld the judges as willing agents of a tyranny from which she too had suffered there arrived at headquarters frenzied bearers of rumours such as that of the reported intention of landlords to remove the windows from the tenements if the rents were not paid antonelli himself calmed these let the landlords try it he said phlegmatically  after a while as the deadlock showed no signs of breaking the siege of privation began to tell ominous signs of discontent became apparent chief among the waverers were those who had come to america with visions of a fortune who had practised a repulsive thrift in order to acquire real estate who carried in their pockets dogeared bank books recording payments already made these had consented to the strike reluctantly through fear or had been carried away by the eloquence and enthusiasm of the leaders by the expectation that the mill owners would yield at once some went back to work only to be seen by the militant watchful picketsgenerally in their rooms at night one evening as janet was walking home she chanced to overhear a conversation taking place in the dark vestibule of a tenement  working today  yah  work tomorrow  hesitation i dno  you work i cut your throat a significant noise naw i no work  shake  she hurried on trembling not with fear but exultingly nor did she reflect that only a month ago such an occurrence would have shocked and terrified her this was war on her way to fillmore street she passed at every street corner in this district a pacing sentry muffled in greatcoat and woollen cap alert and watchful the ugly knife on the end of his gun gleaming in the blue light of the arc it did not occur to her despite the uniform that the souls of many of these men were divided also that their voices and actions when she saw them threatening with their bayonets were often inspired by that inner desperation characteristic of men who find themselves unexpectedly in false situations once she heard a woman shriek as the sharp knife grazed her skirt at another time a man whose steps had been considerably hurried turned at a safe distance and shouted defiantly  say who are you working for me or the wool trust  aw get along retorted the soldier or ill give you yours  the man caught sight of janets button as she overtook him he was walking backward  that feller has a job in a machine shop over in barrington i seen him there when i was in the mills and here he is tryin to put us outaint that the limit  the thud of horses feet in the snow prevented her reply the silhouettes of the approaching squad of cavalry were seen down the street and the man fled precipitately into an alleyway  there were ludicrous incidents too though never lacking in a certain pathos the wife of a russian striker had her husband arrested because he had burned her clothes in order to prevent her returning to the mill from the police station he sent a compatriot with a message to headquarters oye he fix her she no get her jawb nowshe gotta stay in bed this one cried triumphantly  she was like to tear me in pieces when i brought her the clothes said anna mower who related her experience with mingled feelings i couldnt blame her you see it was the kids crying with cold and starvation and she got so she just couldnt stand it i couldnt stand it neither  day by day the element who wished to compromise and end the strike grew stronger brought more and more pressure on the leaders these people were subsidized antonelli declared by the capitalists     chapter xviii  a more serious atmosphere pervaded headquarters where it was realized that the issue hung in the balance and more proclamations a la napoleon were issued to sustain and hearten those who were finding bread and onions meagre fare to shame the hesitating the wavering as has been said it was rolfe who because of his popular literary gift composed these appeals for the consideration of the committee dictating them to janet as he paced up and down the bibliotheque inhaling innumerable cigarettes and flinging down the ends on the floor a famous one was headed shall wool and cotton kings rule the nation we are winning it declared the world is with us forced by the unshaken solidarity of tens of thousands the manufacturers offer bribes to end the reign of terror they have inaugurated inhuman treatment and oppressive toil have brought all nationalities together into one great army to fight against a brutal system of exploitation in years and years of excessive labour we have produced millions for a class of idle parasites who enjoy all the luxuries of life while our wives have to leave their firesides and our children their schools to eke out a miserable existence and this for the militia the lowest aim of life is to be a soldier the good soldier never tries to distinguish right from wrong he never thinks he never reasons he only obeys  but janet was tempted to say your syndicalism declares that none of us should think or reason we should only feel she was beginning to detect rolfes inconsistencies yet she refrained from interrupting the inspirational flow  the soldier is a blind heartless soulless murderous machine rolfe was fond of adjectives all that is human in him all that is divine has been sworn away when he took the enlistment oath no man can fall lower than a soldier it is a depth beyond which we cannot go  all that is human all that is divine wrote janet and thrilled a little at the words why was it that mere words and their arrangement in certain sequences gave one a delicious creepy feeling up and down the spine her attitude toward him had become more and more critical she had avoided him when she could but when he was in this ecstatic mood she responded forgot his red lips his contradictions lost herself in a medium she did not comprehend perhaps it was because in his absorption in the task he forgot her forgot himself she too despised the soldiers fervently believed they had sold themselves to the oppressors of mankind and rolfe when in the throes of creation had the manner of speaking to the soldiers themselves as though these were present in the lane just below the window as though he were on the tribune at such times he spoke with such rapidity that quick though she was she could scarcely keep up with him most of you soldiers are workingmen he cried yesterday you were slaving in the mills yourselves you will profit by our victory why should you wish to crush us be human  pale excited he sank down into the chair by her side and lit another cigarette  they ought to listen to that he exclaimed its the best one ive done yet  night had come czernowitz sat in the other room talking to jastro a buzz of voices came from the hall through the thin pine panels of the door all day long a sixtymile gale had twisted the snow of the lane into whirling fantastic columns and rattled the windows of francobelgian hall but now the wind had fallen presently as his selfmade music ceased to vibrate within him rolfe began to watch the girl as she sat motionless with parted lips and eyes alight staring at the reflection of the lamp in the blueblack window  is that the end she asked at length  yes he replied sensitively cant you see its a climax dont you think its a good one  she looked at him puzzled  why yes she said i think its fine you see i have to take it down so fast i cant always follow it as id like to  when you feel you can do anything he exclaimed it is necessary to feel  it is necessary to know she told him  i do not understand you he cried leaning toward her sometimes you are a flamea wonderful scarlet flame i can express it in no other way or again you are like the madonna of our new faith and i wish i were a del sarto to paint you and then again you seem as cold as your new england snow you have no feeling you are an anglosaxona puritan  she smiled though she felt a pang of reminiscence at the word ditmar had called her so too  i cant help what i am she said  it is that which inhibits you he declared that puritanism it must be eradicated before you can develop and thenand then you will be completely wonderful when this strike is over when we have time i will teach you many thingsdevelop you we will read sorel together he is beautiful like poetryand the great poets dante and petrarch and tassoyes and dannunzio we shall live  we are living now she answered the look with which she surveyed him he found enigmatic and then abruptly she rose and went to her typewriter  you dont believe what i say he reproached her  but she was cool im not sure that i believe all of it i want to think it out for myselfto talk to others too  what others  nobody in particulareverybody she replied as she set her notebook on the rack  there is some one else he exclaimed rising  there is every one else she said  as was his habit when agitated he began to smoke feverishly glancing at her from time to time as she fingered the keys experience had led him to believe that he who finds a woman in revolt and gives her a religion inevitably becomes her possessor but more than a month had passed he had not become her possessorand now for the first time there entered his mind a doubt as to having given her a religion the obvious inference was that of another man of another influence in opposition to his own characteristically however he shrank from accepting this since he was of those who believe what they wish to believe the sudden fear of losing herintruding itself immediately upon an ecstatic creative moodunnerved him yet he strove to appear confident as he stood over her  when youve finished typewriting that well go out to supper he told her  but she shook her head  why not  i dont want to she repliedand then to soften her refusal she added i cant tonight  but you never will come with me anymore why is it  im very tired at night i dont feel like going out she sought to temporize  youve changed he accused her youre not the same as you were at firstyou avoid me  the swift gesture with which she flung over the carriage of her machine might have warned him  i dont like that hampton hotel she flashed back imim not a vagabondyet  a vagabond he repeated  she went on savagely with her work  you have two natures he exclaimed you are still a bourgeoise a puritan you will not be yourself you will not be free until you get over that  im not sure i want to get over it  he leaned nearer to her  but now that i have found you janet i will not let you go  youve no rights over me she cried in sudden alarm and anger im not doing this work im not wearing myself out here for you  thenwhy are you doing it his suspicions rose again and made him reckless  to help the strikers she said he could get no more out of her and presently when anna mower entered the room he left it  more than once since her first visit to the soup kitchen in dey street janet had returned to it the universe rocked but here was equilibrium the streets were filled with soldiers with marching strikers terrible things were constantly happening the tension at headquarters never seemed to relax out in the world and within her own soul were strife and suffering and sometimes fear the work in which she sought to lose herself no longer sufficed to keep her from thinking and the spectaclewhen she returned homeof her mothers increasing apathy grew more and more appalling but in dey street she gained calmness was able to renew something of that sense of proportion the lack of which in the chaos in which she was engulfed often brought her to the verge of madness at first she had had a certain hesitation about going back and on the occasion of her second visit had walked twice around the block before venturing to enter she had no claim on this man he was merely a chance acquaintance a strangerand yet he seemed nearer to her to understand her better than any one else she knew in the world this was queer because she had not explained herself nor had he asked her for any confidences she would have liked to confide in himsome things he gave her the impression of comprehending life of having as his specialty humanity itself he should she reflected have been a minister and smiled at the thought ministers at any rate ought to be like him and then one might embrace christianitythe religion of her forefathers that rolfe ridiculed but there was about insall nothing of religion as she had grown up to apprehend the term  now that she had taken her courage in her hands and renewed her visits they seemed to be the most natural proceedings in the world on that second occasion when she had opened the door and palpitatingly climbed to the loft the second batch of children were finishing their midday mealrather more joyously she thought than beforeand insall himself was stooping over a small boy whom he had taken away from the table he did not notice her at once and janet watched them the child had a cough his extreme thinness was emphasized by the coat he wore several sizes too large for him  you come along with me marcus i guess i can fit you out insall was saying when he looked up and saw janet  why if it isnt miss bumpus i thought youd forgotten us  oh no she protested i wanted to come  then why didnt you  well i have come she said with a little sigh and he did not press her further and she refrained from offering any conventional excuse such as that of being interested in the children she had come to see him and such was the faith with which he inspired hernow that she was once more in his presencethat she made no attempt to hide the fact  youve never seen my clothing store have you he asked and with the childs hand in his he led the way into a room at the rear of the loft a kit of carpenters tools was on the floor and one wall was lined with boxlike compartments made of new wood each with its label in neat lettering indicating the articles contained therein shoes he repeated as he ran his eye down the labels and suddenly opened a drawer here we are marcus sit down there on the bench and take off the shoes you have on  the boy had one of those long faces of the higher jewish type intelligent wistful he seemed dazed by insalls kindness the shoes he wore were those of an adult but cracked and split revealing the cotton stocking and here and there the skin his little blue hands fumbled with the knotted strings that served for facings until insall producing a pocket knife deftly cut the strings  those are summer shoes marcuswell ventilated  theyre by me since august said the boy  and now the stockings prompted insall the old ones wet discoloured and torn were stripped off and thick woollen ones substituted insall casting his eye over the open drawer chose a pair of shoes that had been worn but which were stout and serviceable and taking one in his hand knelt down before the child lets see how good a guesser i am he said loosening the strings and turning back the tongue imitating goodhumouredly the deferential manner of a salesman of footwear as he slipped on the shoe why it fits as if it were made for you now for the other one yes your feet are matesi know a man who wears a whole size larger on his left foot the dazed expression remained on the boys face the experience was beyond him thats better said insall as he finished the lacing keep out of the snow marcus all you can wet feet arent good for a cough you know and when you come in to supper a nice doctor will be here and well see if we cant get rid of the cough  the boy nodded he got to his feet stared down at the shoes and walked slowly toward the door where he turned  thank you mister insall he said  and insall still sitting on his heels waved his hand  it is not to mention it he replied perhaps you may have a clothing store of your own some daywho knows he looked up at janet amusedly and then with a spring stood upright his easy unconscious pose betokening command of soul and body i ought to have kept a store he observed i missed my vocation  it seems to me that you missed a great many vocations she replied commonplaces alone seemed possible adequate i suppose you made all those drawers yourself  he bowed in acknowledgment of her implied tribute with his fine nose and keen eyesset at a slightly downward angle creased at the cornerswith his thick greying hair despite his comparative youth he had the look one associates with portraits of earlier patriarchal americans these calls of janets were never of long duration she had fallen into the habit of taking her lunch between one and two and usually arrived when the last installment of youngsters were finishing their meal sometimes they were filing out stopping to form a group around insall who always managed to say something amusingsomething pertinent and goodnaturedly personal for he knew most of them by name and had acquired a knowledge of certain individual propensities and idiosyncrasies that delighted their companions  whats the trouble stepanswallowed your spoon stepan was known to be greedy or he would suddenly seize an unusually solemn boy from behind and tickle him until the child screamed with laughter it was indeed something of an achievement to get on terms of confidence with these alien children of the tenements and the streets who from their earliest years had been forced to shift for themselves and many of whom had acquired a precocious suspicion of greeks bearing gifts insall himself had used the phrase and explained it to janet that sense of caveat donor was perhaps their most pathetic characteristic but he broke it down broke down too the shyness accompanying it the shyness and solemnity emphasized in them by contact with hardship and poverty with the stark side of life they faced at home he had made themmrs maturin once illuminatingly remarkedmore like children sometimes he went to see their parentsas in the case of marcusto suggest certain hygienic precautions in his humorous way and his accounts of these visits too were always humorous yet through that humour ran a strain of pathos that clutcheddespite her smileat janets heartstrings this gift of emphasizing and heightening tragedy while apparently dealing in comedy she never ceased to wonder at she too knew that tragedy of the tenements of the poor its sordidness and cruelty all her days she had lived precariously near it and lately she had visited these people had been torn by the sight of what they endured but insalls jokes while they stripped it of sentimentality of which she had an instinctive dislikemade it for her even more poignant one would have thought to have such an insight into it that he too must have lived it must have been brought up in some dirty alley of a street that gift of course must be a writers gift  when she saw the waifs trooping after him down the stairs mrs maturin called him the pied piper of hampton  as time went on janet sometimes wondered over the quiet manner in which these two people insall and mrs maturin took her visits as though they were matters of course and gave her their friendship there was really no obvious excuse for her coming not even that of the waifs for foodand yet she came to be fed the sustenance they gave her would have been hard to define it flowed not so much from what they said as from what they were it was in the atmosphere surrounding them sometimes she looked at mrs maturin to ask herself what this lady would say if she knew her history her relationship with ditmarwhich had been her real reason for entering the ranks of the strikers and was it fair for her janet to permit mrs maturin to bestow her friendship without revealing this she could not make up her mind as to what this lady would say janet had had no difficulty in placing ditmar not much trouble after her first surprise was over in classifying rolfe and the itinerant band of syndicalists who had descended upon her restricted world but insall and mrs maturin were not to be ticketed what chiefly surprised her in addition to their kindliness to their taking her on faith without the formality of any recommendation or introduction was their lack of intellectual narrowness she did not of course so express it but she sensed in their presence from references casually let fall in their conversation a wider culture of which they were in possession a culture at once puzzling and exciting one that she despaired of acquiring for herself though it came from reading it did not seem literary according to the notion she had conceived of the term her speculations concerning it must be focussed and interpreted it was a culture in the first place not harnessed to an obvious cause something like that struck her it was a culture that contained tolerance and charity that did not label a portion of mankind as its enemy but seemed by understanding all to forgive all it had no prejudices nor did it boast as the syndicalists boasted of its absence of convention and little by little janet connected it with silliston  it must be wonderful to live in such a place as that she exclaimed when the academy was mentioned on this occasion insall had left for a moment and she was in the little room he called his store alone with mrs maturin helping to sort out a batch of garments just received  it was there you first met brooks wasnt it she always spoke of him as brooks he told me about it how you walked out there and asked him about a place to lunch mrs maturin laughed you didnt know what to make of him did you  i thought he was a carpenter said janet ii never should have taken him for an author but of course i dont know any other authors  well hes not like any of them hes just like himself you cant put a tag on people who are really big  janet considered this i never thought of that i suppose not she agreed  mrs maturin glanced at her so you liked sflliston she said  i liked it better than any place i ever saw i havent seen many places but im sure that few can be nicer  what did you like about it janet mrs maturin was interested  its hard to say janet replied after a moment it gave me such a feeling of peaceof having come home although i lived in hampton i cant express it  i think youre expressing it rather well said mrs maturin  it was so beautiful in the spring janet continued dropping the coat she held into the drawer and it wasnt just the trees and the grass with the yellow dandelions it was the houses tooive often wondered why those houses pleased me so much i wanted to live in every one of them do you know that feeling mrs maturin nodded they didnt hurt your eyes when you looked at them and they seemed to be so much at home there even the new ones the new ones were like the children of the old  ill tell the architect hell be pleased said mrs maturin  janet flushed  am i being silly she asked  no my dear mrs maturin replied youve expressed what i feel about silliston what do you intend to do when the strike is over  i hadnt thought janet started at the question but mrs maturin did not seem to notice the dismay in her tone you dont intend toto travel around with the i w w people do you  ii hadnt thought janet faltered it was the first time mrs maturin had spoken of her connection with syndicalism and she surprised herself by adding i dont see how i could they can get stenographers anywhere and thats all im good for and the question occurred to herdid she really wish to  what i was going to suggest continued mrs maturin quietly was that you might try silliston theres a chance for a good stenographer there and im sure you are a good one so many of the professors send to boston  janet stood stock still then she said but you dont know anything about me mrs maturin  kindliness burned in the ladys eyes as she replied i know more nowsince youve told me i know nothing of course theres much i dont know how you a stenographer became involved in this strike and joined the i w w but you shall tell me or not as you wish when we become better friends  janet felt the blood beating in her throat and an impulse to confess everything almost mastered her from the first she had felt drawn toward mrs maturin who seemed to hold out to her the promise of a womans friendshipfor which she had felt a lifelong need a woman friend who would understand the insatiate yearning in her that gave her no rest in her search for a glittering essence never found that had led her only to new depths of bitterness and despair it would destroy her if indeed it had not already done so mrs maturin insall seemed to possess the secret that would bring her peaceand yet in spite of something urging her to speak she feared the risk of losing them perhaps after all they would not understand perhaps it was too late  you do not believe in the industrial workers of the world was what she said  mrs maturin herself who had been moved and excited as she gazed at janet was taken by surprise a few moments elapsed before she could gather herself to reply and then she managed to smile  i do not believe that wisdom will die with them my dear theirtheir doctrine is too simple it does not seem as if life the social order is to be so easily solved  but you must sympathize with them with the strikers janets gesture implied that the soup kitchen was proof of this  ah replied mrs maturin gently that is different to understand them there is one philosophy for the lamb and another for the wolf  you mean said janet trembling that what happens to us makes us inclined to believe certain things  precisely agreed mrs maturin in admiration but i must be honest with you it was brooks who made me see it  buthe never said that to me and i asked him once almost the same question  he never said it to me either mrs maturin confessed he doesnt tell you what he believes i simply gathered that this is his idea and apparently the workers can only improve their condition by strikes by sufferingit seems to be the only manner in which they can convince the employers that the conditions are bad it isnt the employers fault  not their fault janet repeated  not in a large sense said mrs maturin when people grow up to look at life in a certain way from a certain viewpoint it is difficult almost impossible to change them itsits their religion they are convinced that if the world doesnt go on in their way according to their principles everything will be destroyed they arent inhuman within limits everybody is more than willing to help the world along if only they can be convinced that what they are asked to do will help  janet breathed deeply she was thinking of ditmar  and mrs maturin regarding her tactfully changed the subject  i didnt intend to give you a lecture on sociology or psychology my dear she said i know nothing about them although we have a professor who does think over what ive said about coming to silliston it will do you goodyou are working too hard here i know you would enjoy silliston and brooks takes such an interest in you she added impulsively it is quite a compliment  but why janet demanded bewildered  perhaps its because you havepossibilities you may be typewriting his manuscripts and then i am a widow and often rather lonelyyou could come in and read to me occasionally  butive never read anything  how fortunate said insall who had entered the doorway in time to hear janets exclamation more than half of modern culture depends on what one shouldnt read  mrs maturin laughed but insall waved his hand deprecatingly  that isnt my own he confessed i cribbed it from a clever englishman but i believe its true  i think ill adopt her said mrs maturin to insall when she had repeated to him the conversation i know you are always convicting me of enthusiasms brooks and i suppose i do get enthusiastic  well you adopt herand ill marry her replied insall with a smile as he cut the string from the last bundle of clothing  you might do worse it would be a joke if you did  his friend paused to consider this preposterous possibility one never can tell whom a man like you an artist will marry  weve no business to marry at all said insall laughing i often wonder where that romantic streak will land you augusta but you do have a delightful time  dont begrudge it me it makes life so much more interesting mrs maturin begged returning his smile i havent the faintest idea that you will marry her or any one else but i insist on saying shes your typeshes the kind of a person artists do dig up and marryonly better than most of them far better  dig up said insall  well you know im not a snobi only mean that she seems to be one of the surprising anomalies that sometimes occur inwhat shall i sayin the workingclasses i do feel like a snob when i say that but what is it where does that spark come from is it in our modern air that discontent that desire that thrusting forth toward a new lightsomething as yet unformulated but which we all feel even at small institutions of learning like silliston  now youre getting beyond me  oh no im not mrs maturin retorted confidently if you wont talk about it i will i have no shame and this girl has itthis thing im trying to express shes modern to her finger tips and yet shes extraordinarily americanin spite of her modernity she embodies in some queer way our tradition she loves our old houses at sillistonthey make her feel at homethats her own expression  did she say that  exactly and i know shes of new england ancestry she told me so what i cant make out is why she joined the iww that seems so contradictory  perhaps she was searching for light there insall hazarded why dont you ask her  i dont know replied mrs maturin thoughtfully i want to my curiosity almost burns me alive and yet i dont she isnt the kind you can ask personal questions ofthats part of her charm part of her individuality one is a little afraid to intrude and yet she keeps coming hereof course you are a sufficient attraction brooks but i must give her the credit of not flirting with you  ive noticed that too said insall comically  shes searching for light mrs maturin went on struck by the phrase she has an instinct we can give it to her because we come from an institution of learning i felt something of the kind when i suggested her establishing herself in silliston well shes more than worth while experimenting on she must have lived and breathed what you call the movie atmosphere all her life and yet she never seems to have read and absorbed any sentimental literature or cheap religion she doesnt suggest the tawdry that part of her the intellectual part is a clear page to be written upon  theres my chance said insall  no its my chancesince youre so cynical  im not cynical he protested  i dont believe you really are and if you are there may be a judgment upon you she added playfully i tell you shes the kind of woman artists go mad about she has what sentimentalists call temperament and after all we havent any better word to express dynamic desires shed keep you stirred up stimulated and you could educate her  no thanks ill leave that to you he who educates a woman is lost but how about syndicalism and all the mysticism that goes with it theres an intellectual over at headquarters whos been talking to her about bergson the lifeforce and the worldweourselvescreate  mrs maturin laughed  well we go wrong when we dont go right thats just it we must go some way and im sure from what i gather that she isnt wholly satisfied with syndicalism  what is right demanded insall  oh i dont intend to turn her over to mr worrall and make a sociologist and a militant suffragette out of her she isnt that kind anyhow but i could give her good literature to readyours for instance she added maliciously  youre preposterous augusta insall exclaimed  i may be but youve got to indulge me ive taken this fancy to herof course i mean to see more of her butyou know how hard it is for me sometimes since ive been left alone  insall laid his hand affectionately on her shoulder  i remember what you said the first day i saw her that the strike was in her mrs maturin continued well i see now that she does express and typify itand i dont mean the labour movement alone or this strike in rampton which is symptomatic but crude i mean something biggerand i suppose you dothe protest the revolt the struggle for selfrealization that is beginning to be felt all over the nation all over the world today that is not yet focussed and selfconscious but groping its way clothing itself in any philosophy that seems to fit it i can imagine myself how such a strike as this might appeal to a girl with a sense of rebellion against sordidness and lack of opportunityespecially if she has had a tragic experience and sometimes i suspect she has had one  well its an interesting theory insall admitted indulgently  im merely amplifying your suggestions only you wont admit that they are yours and she was your protegee and you are going to take her off my hands im not so sure said mrs maturin     chapter xix  the hampton strike had reached the state of grim deadlock characteristic of all stubborn wars there were aggressions retaliations on both sides the antagonism grew more intense the older labour unions were accused by the strikers of playing the employers game and thus grew to be hated even more than the capitalists these organizations of the skilled had entered but halfheartedly into a struggle that now began to threaten indeed their very existence and when it was charged that the textile workers had been attempting to secure recruits from the ranks of the strikers and had secretly offered the millowners a scale of demands in the hope that a sufficient number of operatives would return to work and so break the strike a serious riot was barely averted scabhunting agencies the unions were called one morning when it was learned that the loomfixers almost to a man had gone back to the mills a streetcar was stopped near the power house at the end of faber street and in a twinkling before the militia or police could interfere motorman conductor and passengers were dragged from it and the trolley pole removed this and a number of similar aggressive acts aroused the millowners and their agents to appeal with renewed vigour to the public through the newspapers which it was claimed they owned or subsidized then followed a series of arraignments of the strike leaders calculated to stir the wildest prejudices and fears of the citizens of hampton antonelli and jastroso rumour had itin various nightly speeches had advised their followers to sleep in the daytime and prowl like wild animals at night urged the power house employees to desert and leave the city in darkness made the declaration we will win if we raise scaffolds on every street insisted that the strikers too should have gun permits since the police hirelings carried arms and the fact that the millowners replied with pamphlets whose object was proclaimed to be one of discrediting their leaders in the eyes of the public still further infuriated the strikers such charges of course had to be vehemently refuted the motives behind them made clear and counteraccusations laid at the door of the millowners  the atmosphere at headquarters daily grew more tense at any moment the spark might be supplied to precipitate an explosion that would shake the earth the hungry made more desperate by their own sufferings or the spectacle of starving families were increasingly difficult to control many wished to return to work others clamoured for violence nor were these wholly discouraged by a portion of the leaders a riot seemed imminenta riot antonelli feared and firmly opposed since it would alienate the sympathy of that wider public in the country on which the success of the strike depended watchful yet apparently unconcerned unmoved by the quarrels the fierce demands for action he sat on the little stage smoking his cigars and reading his newspapers  janets nerves were taut there had been times during the past weeks when she had been aware of new and vaguely disquieting portents inexperience had led her to belittle them and the absorbing nature of her work the excitement due to the strange life of conflict of new ideas into which she had so unreservedly flung herself the resentment that galvanized herall these had diverted her from worry at night hers had been the oblivious slumber of the weary and then as a desperate wayfarer pressing on feels a heavy drop of rain and glances up to perceive the clouds that have long been gathering she awoke in the black morning hours and fear descended upon her suddenly her brain became hideously active as she lay dryupped staring into the darkness striving to convince herself that it could not be but the thing had its advocate also to summon ingeniously in cumulative array those omens she had ignored to cause her to piece together in this moment of torture portions of the knowledge of sexual facts that prudery banishes from education a smattering of which reaches the ears of such young women as janet in devious roundabout ways several times in the month just past she had had unwonted attacks of dizziness of faintness and on one occasion anna mower alarmed had opened the window of the bibliotheque and thrust her into the cold air now with a pang of fear she recalled what anna had saidyoure working too hardyou hadnt ought to stay here nights if it was some girls ive met id know what to think  strange that the significance of this sentence had failed to penetrate her consciousness until now if it was some girls ive met id know what to think it had come into her mind abruptly and always when she sought to reassure herself to declare her terror absurd it returned to confront her heat waves pulsed through her she grew intolerably warm perspiration started from her pores and she flung off the blankets the rain from the roofs was splashing on the bricks of the passage what would mr insall say if he knew and mrs maturin she could never see them again now there was no one to whom to turn she was cut off utterly from humanity an outcast like lise and only a little while ago she and lise had lain in that bed together was there not somebodygod other people believed in god prayed to him she tried to say oh god deliver me from this thing but the words seemed a mockery after all it was mechanical it had either happened or it hadnt happened a lifelong experience in an environment where only unpleasant things occurred where miracles were unknown had effaced a fleeting childhood belief in miracles cause and effect were the rule and if there were a god who did interfere why hadnt he interfered before this thing happened then would have been the logical time why hadnt he informed her that in attempting to escape from the treadmill in which he had placed her in seeking happiness she had been courting destruction why had he destroyed lise and if there were a god would he comfort her now convey to her some message of his sympathy and love no such message alas seemed to come to her through the darkness  after a whilea seemingly interminable whilethe siren shrieked the bells jangled loudly in the wet air another day had come could she face iteven the murky grey light of this that revealed the ashes and litter of the back yard under the downpour the act of dressing brought a slight relief and then at breakfast a numbness stole over hersuggested and conveyed perchance by the apathy of her mother something had killed suffering in hannah perhaps she herself would mercifully lose the power to suffer but the thought made her shudder she could not like her mother find a silly refuge in shining dishes in cleaning pots and pans or sit idle vacantminded for long hours in a spotless kitchen what would happen to her howbeit the ache that had tortured her became a dull leaden pain like that she had known at another timehow long agowhen the suffering caused by ditmars deception had dulled when she had sat in the train on her way back to hampton from boston after seeing lise the pain would throb again unsupportably and she would wake and this time it would drive hershe knew not where  she was certain now that the presage of the night was true  she reached francobelgian hall to find it in an uproar anna mower ran up to her with the news that dynamite had been discovered by the police in certain tenements of the syrian quarter that the tenants had been arrested and taken to the police station where bewildered and terrified they had denied any knowledge of the explosive dynamite had also been found under the power house and in the millsthe sources of hamptons prosperity and hampton believed of course that this was the inevitable result of the anarchistic preaching of such enemies of society as jastro and antonelli if these indeed had not incited the syrians to the deed but it was a plot of the millowners anna insistedthey themselves had planted the explosive adroitly started the rumours told the police where the dynamite was to be found such was the view that prevailed at headquarters pervaded the angrily buzzing crowd that stood outsideheedless of the rainand animated the stormy conferences in the salle de reunion  the day wore on in the middle of the afternoon as she was staring out of the window anna mower returned with more news dynamite had been discovered in hawthorne street and it was rumoured that antonelli and jastro were to be arrested  you ought to go home and rest janet she said kindly  janet shook her head  rolfes back anna informed her after a moment hes talking to antonelli about another proclamation to let people know whos to blame for this dynamite business i guess hell be in here in a minute to dictate the draft say hadnt you better let minnie take it and go home  im not sick janet repeated and anna reluctantly left her  rolfe had been absent for a week in new york consulting with some of the iww leaders with lockhart the chief protagonist of syndicalism in america just returned from colorado to whom he had given a detailed account of the hampton strike and lockhart next week was coming to hampton to make a great speech and look over the ground for himself all this rolfe told janet eagerly when he entered the bibliotheque he was glad to get back he had missed her  but you are pale he exclaimed as he seized her hand and how your eyes burn you do not take care of yourself when i am not here to watch you his air of solicitude his assumption of a peculiar right to ask might formerly have troubled and offended her now she was scarcely aware of his presence you feel too muchthat is it you are like a torch that consumes itself in burning but this will soon be over we shall have them on their knees the capitalists before very long when it is known what they have done today it is too muchthey have overreached themselves with this plot of the dynamite  you have missed me a little  i have been busy she said releasing her hand and sitting down at her desk and taking up her notebook  you are not well he insisted  im all right she replied  he lit a cigarette and began to pace the roomhis customary manner of preparing himself for the creative mood after a while he began to dictatebut haltingly he had come here from antonelli all primed with fervour and indignation but it was evident that this feeling had ebbed that his mind refused to concentrate on what he was saying despite the magnificent opportunity to flay the capitalists which their most recent tactics afforded him he paused repeated himself and began again glancing from time to time reproachfully almost resentfully at janet usually on these occasions he was transported almost inebriated by his own eloquence but now he chafed at her listlessness he was at a loss to account for the withdrawal of the enthusiasm he had formerly been able to arouse lacking the feminine stimulus his genius limped for rolfe there had been a woman in every strikesometimes two what had happened during his absence to alienate the most promising of all neophytes he had ever encountered  the eyes of the world are fixed on the workers of hampton they must be true to the trust their fellows have placed in them today the millowners the masters are at the end of their tether always unscrupulous they have descended to the most despicable of tactics in order to deceive the public but truth will prevail rolfe lit another cigarette began a new sentence and broke it off suddenly he stood over her its you he said you dont feel it you dont help me youre not in sympathy  he bent over her his red lips gleaming through his beard a terrible hunger in his lustrous eyesthe eyes of a soul to which selfdenial was unknown his voice was thick with uncontrolled passion his hand was cold  janet what has happened i love you you must love mei cannot believe that you do not come with me we shall work together for the workersit is all nothing without you  for a moment she sat still and then a pain shot through her a pain as sharp as a dagger thrust she drew her hand away  i cant lovei can only hate she said  but you do not hate me rolfe repudiated so gross a fact his voice caught as in a sob i who love you who have taught you  she dismissed thiswhat he had taught herwith a gesture which though slight was allexpressive he drew back from her  shall i tell you who has planned and carried out this plot he cried it is ditmar he is the one and he used janes the livery stable keeper the politician who brought the dynamite to hampton as his tool half an hour before janes got to the station in boston he was seen by a friend of ours talking to ditmar in front of the chippering offices and janes had the satchel with him then ditmar walked to the corner with him  janet too had risen  i dont believe it she said  ah i thought you wouldnt but we have the proof that dynamite was in the satchel weve found the contractor from whom it was bought i was a fooli might have known that you loved ditmar  i hate him said janet  it is the same thing said rolfe  she did not answer he watched her in silence as she put on her hat and coat and left the room  the early dusk was gathering when she left the hall and made her way toward the city the huge bottleshaped chimneys of the power plant injected heavy black smoke into the wet air in faber street the once brilliant signs above the tenfoot buildings seemed dulled the telegraph poles starker nakeder than ever their wires scarcely discernible against the smeared sky the pedestrians were sombrely garbed and went about in rubbersthe most depressing of all articles worn by man sodden piles of snow still hid the curb and gutters but the pavements were trailed with mud that gleamed in the light from the shop windows and janet lingering unconsciously in front of that very emporium where lisehad been incarcerated the bagatelle stared at the finery displayed there at the blue tulle dress that might be purchased she read for 2299 she found herself repeating in meaningless subdued tones the words twentytwo ninetynine she even triedjust to see if it were possibleto concentrate her mind on that dress on the fur muffs and tippets in the next window to act as if this were just an ordinary sad february afternoon and she herself once more just an ordinary stenographer leading a monotonous uneventful existence but she knew that this was not true because later on she was going to do somethingto commit some act she didnt know what this act would be her head was hot her temples throbbed  night had fallen the electric arcs burned blue overhead she was in another streetwas it stanley sounds of music reached her the rumble of marching feet dark massed figures were in the distance swimming toward her along the glistening line of the car tracks and she heard the shrill whistling of the doffer boys who acted as a sort of fife corps in these paradeswhich by this time had become familiar to the citizens of hampton and janet remembered when the little red book that contained the songs had arrived at headquarters from the west and had been distributed by thousands among the strikers she recalled the words of this song though the procession was as yet too far away for her to distinguish them         the peoples flag is deepest red         it shrouded oft our martyred dead         and ere their limbs grew stiff and cold         their lifeblood dyed its every fold  the song ceased and she stood still waiting for the procession to reach her a group of heavy belgian women were marching together suddenly as by a simultaneous impulse their voices rang out in the internationalethe terrible marseillaise of the workers         arise ye prisoners of starvation         arise ye wretched of the earth  and the refrain was taken up by hundreds of throats         tis the final conflict         let each stand in his place  the walls of the street flung it back on the sidewalk pressed against the houses men and women heard it with white faces but janet was carried on the scene changed now she was gazing at a mass of human beings hemmed in by a line of soldiers behind the crowd was a row of oldfashioned brick houses on the walls of which were patterned by the cold electric light the branches of the bare elms ranged along the sidewalk people leaned out of the windows like theatregoers at a play the light illuminated the red and white bars of the ensign upheld by the standard bearer of the regiment the smaller flags flaunted by the strikerseach side clinging hardily to the emblem of human liberty the light fell too harshly and brilliantly on the workers in the front rank confronting the bayonets and these seemed strangely indifferent as though waiting for the flash of a photograph a little farther on a group of boys hands in pockets stared at the soldiers with bravado from the rear came that indescribable booing which those who have heard never forget mingled with curses and criesvive la greve  to hell with the cossacks  kahm onshoot  the backs of the soldiers determined unyielding were covered with heavy brown capes that fell below the waist as janets glance wandered down the line it was arrested by the face of a man in a visored woollen capa face that was almost sepia in which large white eyeballs struck a note of hatred and what she seemed to see in it confronting her were the hatred and despair of her own soul the man might have been a hungarian or a pole the breadth of his chin was accentuated by a wide black moustache his attitude was tensethat of a maddened beast ready to spring at the soldier in front of him he was plainly one of those who had reached the mental limit of endurance  in contrast with this foreigner confronting him a young lieutenant stood motionless his head cocked on one side his hand grasping the club held a little behind him his glance meeting the others squarely but with a different quality of defiance all his faculties were on the alert he wore no overcoat and the uniform fitting close to his figure the broadbrimmed campaign hat of felt served to bring into relief the physical characteristics of the american anglosaxon of the individualist who became the fighting pioneer but janet save to register the presence of the intense antagonism between the two scarcely noticed her fellow countryman every moment she expected to see the black man springand yet movement would have marred the drama of that consuming hatred  then by one of those bewildering kaleidoscopic shifts to which crowds are subject the scene changed more troops arrived little by little the people were dispersed to drift together again by chancein smaller numbersseveral blocks away perhaps a hundred and fifty were scattered over the space formed by the intersection of two streets where three or four special policemen with night sticks urged them on not a riot or anything approaching it the police were jeered but the groups apparently had already begun to scatter when from the triangular vestibule of a saloon on the corner darted a flame followed by an echoing report a woman bundled up in a shawl screamed and sank on the snow for an instant the little frenchcanadian policeman whom the shot had missed gazed stupidly down at her  as janet ran along the dark pavements the sound of the shot and of the womans shriek continued to ring in her ears at last she stopped in front of the warehouse beyond mr tiernans shop staring at the darkened windows of the flatof the front room in which her mother now slept alone for a minute she stood looking at these windows as though hypnotized by some message they conveyedthe answer to a question suggested by the incident that had aroused and terrified her they drew her as in a trance across the street she opened the glasspanelled door remembering mechanically the trick it had of not quite closing turned and pushed it to and climbed the stairs in the diningroom the metal lamp brightly polished was burning as usual its light falling on the chequered red tablecloth on her fathers empty chair on that somewhat battered heirloom the horsehair sofa all was so familiar and yet so amazingly unfamiliar so silent at this time edward should be reading the banner her mother bustling in and out setting the table for supper but not a dish was set the ticking of the ancient clock only served to intensify the silence janet entered almost on tiptoe made her way to the kitchen door and looked in the stove was polished the pans bright upon the wall and hannah was seated in a corner her hands folded across a spotless apron her scant hair was now pure white her dress seemed to have fallen away from her wasted neck which was like a trefoil column  is that you janet you haint seen anything of your father  the night before janet had heard this question and she had been puzzled as to its meaningwhether in the course of the day she had seen her father or whether hannah thought he was coming home  hes at the mill mother you know he has to stay there  i know replied hannah in a tone faintly reminiscent of the old aspersion but ive got everything ready for him in case he should comeany timeif the strikers haint killed him  but hes safe where he is  i presume they will try to kill him before they get through hannah continued evenly but in case he should come at any time and im not here you tell him all those bumpus papers are put away in the drawer of that old chest in the corner i cant think what hed do without those papers that is she added if youre here yourself  why shouldnt you be here asked janet rather sharply  i dunno i seem to have got through she glanced helplessly around the kitchen there dont seem to be much left to keep me alive i guess youll be wanting your supper wont you you haint often home these dayswhatever it is youre doing i didnt expect you  janet did not answer at once  ii have to go out again mother she said  hannah accepted the answer as she had accepted every other negative in life great and small  well i guessed you would  janet made a step toward her  mother she said but hannah gazed at her uncomprehendingly janet stooped convulsively and kissed her straightening up she stood looking down at her mother for a few moments and went out of the room pausing in the diningroom to listen but hannah apparently had not stirred she took the box of matches from its accustomed place on the shelf beside the clock entered the dark bedroom in the front of the flat closing the door softly behind her the ghostly blue light from a distant arc came slanting in at the window glinting on the brass knobs of the chest of drawersanother bumpus heirloom she remembered that chest from early childhood it was one of the few pieces that following them in all their changes of residence had been faithful to the end she knew everything in it and the place for everything drawing a match from the box she was about to turn on the gasbut the light from the arc would suffice as she made her way around the walnut bed she had a premonition of poignant anguish as yet unrealized of anguish being held at bay by a stronger fiercer more imperative emotion now demanding expression refusing at last to be denied she opened the top drawer of the chest the drawer in which hannah breaking tradition had put the bumpus genealogy edward had never kept it there would the other things be in place groping with her hands in the lefthand corner her fingers clasped exultantly something heavy something wrapped carefully in layers of flannel she had feared her father might have taken it to the mill she drew it out unwound the flannel and held to the light an oldfashioned revolver the grease glistening along its barrel she remembered too that the cartridges had lain beside it and thrusting her hand once more into the drawer found the box extracting several and replacing the rest closed the drawer and crept through the diningroom to her bedroom where she lit the gas in order to examine the weaponfinally contriving more by accident than skill to break it the cartridges of course fitted into the empty cylinder but before inserting them she closed the pistol once more cocked it and held it out her arm trembled violently as she pulled the trigger could she do it as though to refute this doubt of her ability to carry out an act determined upon she broke the weapon once more loaded and closed it and thrust it in the pocket of her coat then washing the grease from her hands she put on her gloves and was about to turn out the light when she saw reflected in the glass the red button of the iww still pinned on her coat this she tore off and flung on the bureau  when she had kissed her mother when she had stood hesitatingly in the darkness of the familiar front bedroom in the presence of unsummoned memories of a home she had believed herself to resent and despise she had nearly faltered but once in the street this weakness suddenly vanished was replaced by a sense of wrong that now took complete and furious possession of her driving her like a gale at her back she scarcely felt on her face the fine rain that had begun to fall once more her feet were accustomed to the way when she had turned down west street and almost gained the canal it was with a shock of surprise that she found herself confronted by a man in a long cape who held a rifle and barred her path she stared at him as at an apparition  you cant get by here he said dont you know that  she did not reply he continued to look at her and presently asked in a gentler tonewhere did you wish to go lady  into the mill she replied to the offices  but there cant anybody go through here unless they have a pass im sorry but thats the order  her answer came so readily as to surprise her  i was mr ditmars private stenographer i have to see him  the sentry hesitated and then addressed another soldier who was near the bridge  hi sergeant he called the sergeant came upa conscientious boston clerk who had joined the militia from a sense of duty and a need for exercise while the sentry explained the matter he gazed at janet then he said politelyim sorry miss but i cant disobey orders  but cant you send word to mr ditmar and tell him i want to see him she asked  why i guess so he answered after a moment what name shall i say  miss bumpus  bumpus he repeated thats the gatekeepers name  im his daughterbut i want to see mr ditmar  well said the sergeant im sure its all right but ill have to send in anyway orders are orders you understand  she nodded as he departed she saw him cross the bridge like a ghost through the white mist rising from the canal and through the mist she could make out the fortresslike mass of the mill itself and the blurred distorted lights in the paymasters offices smeared on the white curtain of the vapour  nasty weather the sentry remarked in friendly fashion he appeared now despite his uniform as a goodnatured ungainly youth  janet nodded  youd ought to have brought an umbrella he said i guess itll rain harder before it gets through but its better than ten below zero anyhow  she nodded again but he did not seem to resent her silence he talked about the hardship of patrolling in winter until the sergeant came back  its all right miss bumpus he said and touched his hat as he escorted her to the bridge she crossed the canal and went through the vestibule without replying to the greeting of the nightwatchman or noticing his curious glance she climbed the steelclad stairway passed the paymasters offices and mr orcutts and gained the outer office where she had worked as a stenographer it was dark but sufficient light came through ditmars open door to guide her beside the rail he had heard her step and as she entered his room he had put his hands heavily on his desk in the act of rising from his chair  janet he said and started toward her but got no farther than the corner of the desk the sight of her heaving breast of the peculiar light that flashed from beneath her lashes stopped him suddenly her hands were in her pockets what is it he demanded stupidly  but she continued to stand there breathing so heavily that she could not speak it was then that he became aware of an acute danger he did not flinch  what is it he repeated  still she was silent one hand was thrust deeper into its pocket he saw a shudder run through her and suddenly she burst into hysterical weeping sinking into a chair he stood for some moments helplessly regarding her before he gained the presence of mind to go to the door and lock it returning to bend over her  dont touch me she said shrinking from him  for gods sake tell me whats the matter he begged  she looked up at him and tried to speak struggling against the sobs that shook her  ii came here toto kill youonly i cant do it  to kill me he said after a pause in spite of the fact that he had half divined her intention the words shocked him whatever else may be said of him he did not lack courage his alarm was not of a physical nature mingled with it were emotions he himself did not understand caused by the unwonted sight of her loss of selfcontrol of her anger and despair why did you want to kill me  and again he had to wait for an answer  because youve spoiled my lifebecause im going to have a child  what do you mean are you it cant be possible  it is possible its trueits true ive waited and waited ive suffered ive almost gone crazyand now i know and i said id kill you if it were so id kill myselfonly i cant im a coward her voice was drowned again by weeping  a child he had never imagined such a contingency and as he leaned back against the desk his emotions became chaotic the sight of her even as she appeared crazed by anger had set his passion aflamefor the intensity and fierceness of her nature had always made a strong appeal to dominant qualities in ditmars nature and thenthis announcement momentarily it turned his heart to water now that he was confronted by an exigency that had once vicariously yet deeply disturbed him in a similar affair of a friend of his the code and habit of a lifetime gained an immediate ascendencysince then he had insisted that this particular situation was to be avoided above all others and his mind leaped to possibilities she had wished to kill himwould she remain desperate enough to ruin him even though he were not at a crisis in his affairs a scandal of this kind would be fatal  i didnt know he said desperately i couldnt guess do you think i would have had this thing happen to you i was carried awaywe were both carried away  you planned it she replied vehemently without looking up you didnt care for me you onlywanted me  that isnt soi swear that isnt so i loved you i love you  oh do you think i believe that she exclaimed  i swear itill prove it he protested still under the influence of an acute anxiety he was finding it difficult to gather his wits to present his case when you left me that day the strike beganwhen you left me without giving me a chanceyoull never know how that hurt me  youll never know how it hurt me she interrupted  then why in gods name did you do it i wasnt myself then you ought to have seen that and when i heard from caldwell here that youd joined those anarchists  theyre no worse than you arethey only want what youve got she said  he waved this aside i couldnt believe iti wouldnt believe it until somebody saw you walking with one of them to their headquarters why did you do it  because i know how they feel i sympathize with the strikers i want them to winagainst you she lifted her head and looked at him and in spite of the state of his feelings he felt a twinge of admiration at her defiance  because you love me he said  because i hate you she answered  and yet a spark of exultation leaped within him at the thought that love had caused this apostasy he had had that suspicion before though it was a poor consolation when he could not reach her now she had made it vivid a womans logic or lack of logicher logic  listen he pleaded i tried to forget youi tried to keep myself going all the time that i mightnt think of you but i couldnt help thinking of you wanting you longing for you i never knew why you left me except that you seemed to believe i was unkind to you and that something had happened it wasnt my fault he pulled himself up abruptly  i found out what men were like she said a man made my sister a woman of the streetsthats what youve done to me  he winced and the calmness she had regained which was so characteristic of her struck him with a new fear  im not that kind of a man he said  but she did not answer his predicament became more trying  ill take care of you he assured her after a moment if youll only trust me if youll only come to me ill see that no harm comes to you  she regarded him with a sort of wondera look that put a fine edge of dignity and scorn to her words when they came  i told you i didnt want to be taken care ofi wanted to kill you and kill myself i dont know why i cant what prevents me she rose but im not going to trouble you any moreyoull never hear of me again  she would not trouble him she was going away he would never hear of her again suddenly with the surge of relief he experienced came a pang he could not let her goit was impossible it seemed that he had never understood his need of her his love for her until now that he had brought her to this supreme test of selfrevelation she had wanted to kill him yes to kill herselfbut how could he ever have believed that she would stoop to another method of retaliation as she stood before him the light in her eyes still wet with tearstransfigured her  i love you janet he said i want you to marry me  you dont understand she answered you never did if i had married you id feel just the samebut it isnt really as bad as if we had been married  not as bad he exclaimed  if we were married youd think you had rights over me she explained slowly now you havent any i can go away i couldnt live with you i know what happened to me ive thought it all out i wanted to get away from the life i was leadingi hated it so i was crazy to have a chance to see the world to get nearer some of the beautiful things i knew were there but couldnt reach and you came along i did love you i would have done anything for youit was only when i saw that you didnt really love me that i began to hate you that i wanted to get away from you when i saw that you only wanted me until you should get tired of me thats your nature you cant help it and it would have been the same if we were married only worse i couldnt have stood it any more than i can nowid have left you you say youll marry me now but thats because youre sorry for mesince ive said im not going to trouble you any more youll be glad ive gone you maywant me now but that isnt love when you say you love me i cant believe you  you must believe me and the child janetour child  if the world was right she said i could have this child and nobody would say anything i could support iti guess i can anyway and when im not half crazy i want it maybe thats the reason i couldnt do what i tried to do just now its natural for a woman to want a childespecially a woman like me who hasnt anybody or anything  ditmars state of mind was too complicated to be wholly described as the fact had been gradually brought home to him that she had not come as a supplicant that even in her misery she was free and he helpless there revived in him wild memories of her body of the kisses he had wrung from herand yet this physical desire was accompanied by a realization of her personality never before achieved and because he had hitherto failed to achieve it she had escaped him this belated surpassing glimpse of what she essentially was and the thought of the child their childpermeating his passion transformed it into a feeling hitherto unexperienced and unimagined he hovered over her pitifully his hands feeling for her yet not daring to touch her  cant you see that i love you he cried that im ready to marry you now tonight you must love me i wont believe that you dont afterafter all we have been to each other  but even then she could not believe something in her made hard by the intensity of her suffering refused to melt and her head was throbbing and she scarcely heard him  i cant stay any longer she said getting to her feet i cant bear it  janet i swear ill care for you as no woman was ever cared for for gods sake listen to me give me a chance forgive me he seized her arm she struggled gently but persistently to free herself from his hold  let me go please all the passionate anger had gone out of her and she spoke in a monotone as one under hypnosis dominated by a resolution which for the present at least he was powerless to shake  but tomorrow he pleaded youll let me see you tomorrow when youve had time to think it over when you realize that i love you and want you that i havent meant to be cruelthat youve misjudged methought i was a different kind of a man i dont blame you for that i guess something happened to make you believe it ive got enemies for the sake of the child janet if for nothing else youll come back to me youreyoure tired tonight youre not yourself i dont wonder after all youve been through if youd only come to me before god knows what ive suffered too  let me go please she repeated and this time despairingly he obeyed her a conviction of her incommunicability overwhelming him he turned and fumbling with the key unlocked the door and opened it ill see you tomorrow he faltered once more and watched her as she went through the darkened outer room until she gained the lighted hallway beyond and disappeared her footsteps died away into silence he was trembling for several minutes he stood where she had left him tortured by a sense of his inability to act to cope with this the great crisis of his life when suddenly the real significance of that strange last look in her eyes was borne home to him and he had allowed her to go out into the streets alone seizing his hat and coat he fairly ran out of the office and down the stairs and across the bridge  which way did that young lady go he demanders of the sergeant  whyuh west street mr ditmar  he remembered where fillmore street was he had indeed sought it out one evening in the hope of meeting her he hurried toward it now his glance strained ahead to catch sight of her figure under a lamp but he reached fillmore street without overtaking her and in the rain he stood gazing at the mean houses there wondering in which of them she lived and whether she had as yet come home  after leaving ditmar janet probably from force of habit had indeed gone through west street and after that she walked on aimlessly it was better to walk than to sit alone in torment to be gnawed by that thing from which she had so desperately attempted to escape and failed she tried to think why she had failed though the rain fell on her cheeks her mouth was parched and this dryness of her palate this physical sense of lightness almost of dizziness were intimately yet incomprehensibly part and parcel of the fantastic moods into which she floated it was as though in trying to solve a problem she caught herself from time to time falling off to sleep in her waking moments she was terrorstricken scarce an hour had passed since in a terrible exaltation at having found a solution she had gone to ditmars office in the mill what had happened to stay her it was when she tried to find the cause of the weakness that so abruptly had overtaken her or to cast about for a plan to fit the new predicament to which her failure had sentenced her that the fantasies intruded she heard ditmar speaking the arguments were curiously familiarbut they were not ditmars they were her fathers and now it was edwards voice to which she listened he was telling her how eminently proper it was that she should marry ditmar because of her bumpus blood and this made her laugh again ditmar was kissing her hair he had often praised it she had taken it down and combed it out for him it was like a cloud he saidso fine its odour made him faintand then the odour changed became that of the detested perfume of miss lottie myers even that made janet smile but ditmar was strong he was powerful he was a fact why not go back to him and let him absorb and destroy her that annihilation would be joy  it could not have been much later than seven oclock when she found herself opposite the familiar mulberryshingled protestant church the light from its vestibule made a gleaming square on the wet sidewalk and into this area from the surrounding darkness came silhouetted figures of men and women holding up umbrellas some paused for a moments chat their voices subdued by an awareness of the tabernacle at the sight of this tiny congregation something stirred within her she experienced a twinge of surprise at the discovery that other people in the world in hampton were still leading tranquil untormented existences they were contented prosperous stupid beyond any need of help from god and yet they were going to prayermeeting to ask something he refused to find her in the dark streets would she find him if she went in there and would he help her  the bell in the tower began to clang with heavy relentless strokeslike physical blows from which she flinchedeach stirring her reluctant drowsy soul to a quicker agony from the outer blackness through which she fled she gazed into bright rooms of homes whose blinds were left undrawn as though to taunt and mock the wanderer she was an outcast who henceforth would receive her save those unconformed and unconformable sentenced to sin in this realm of blackness henceforth from all warmth and love she was banished in the middle of the stanley street bridge she stopped to lean against the wet rail the mill lights were scattered dancing points of fire over the invisible swift waters and she raised her eyes presently to the lights themselves seeking one unconsciouslyditmars yes it was his she sought though it was so distant sometimes it seemed to burn like a red star and then to flicker and disappear she could not be sure something chill and steely was in the pocket of her coatit made a heavy splash in the water when she dropped it the river could not be so very cold she wished she could go down like that into forgetfulness but she couldnt where was lise now it would be so easy just to drop over that parapet and be whirled away and down and down why couldnt she well it was becausebecauseshe was going to have a child well if she had a child to take care of she would not be so lonelyshe would have something to love she loved it now as though she felt it quickening within her she wanted it to lavish on it all of a starved affection she seemed actually to feel in her arms its soft little body pressed against her claude ditmars child and she suddenly recalled as an incident of the remote past that she had told him she wanted it  this tense craving for it she felt now was somehow the answer to an expressed wish which had astonished her perhaps that was the reason why she had failed to do what she had tried to do to shoot ditmar and herself it was ditmars child ditmars and hers he had loved her long ago and just nowwas it just nowhe had said he loved her still he had wanted to marry her then why had she run away from him why had she taken the child into outer darkness to be born without a fatherwhen she loved ditmar wasnt that one reason why she wanted the child why even in her moments of passionate hatred she recalled having been surprised by some such yearning as now came over her and for an interval a brief interval she viewed him with startling clarity not because he embodied any ideal did she love him but because he was what he was because he had overcome her will dominated and possessed her left his mark upon her indelibly he had been cruel to her willing to sacrifice her to his way of life to his own desires but he loved her for she had seen if not heeded in his eyes the look that a woman never mistakes she remembered it now and the light in his window glowed again like a star to guide her back to him it was drawing her irresistibly  the sentry recognized her as she came along the canal  mr ditmars gone he told her  gone she repeated gone  why yes about five minutes after you left he was looking for youhe asked the sergeant about you  andhe wont be back  i guess not answered the man sympathetically he said goodnight  she turned away dully the strength and hope with which she had been so unexpectedly infused while gazing from the bridge at his window had suddenly ebbed her legs ached her feet were wet and she shivered though her forehead burned the world became distorted people flitted past her like weird figures of a dream the myriad lights of faber street were blurred and whirled in company with the electric signs seeking to escape from their confusion she entered a side street leading north only to be forcibly seized by some one who darted after her from the sidewalk  excuse me but you didnt see that automobile he said as he released her  shaken she went on through several streets to find herself at length confronted by a pair of shabby doors that looked familiar and pushing one of them open baited at the bottom of a stairway to listen the sound of cheerful voices camp to her from above she started to climbeven with the help of the rail it seemed as if she would never reach the top of that stairway but at last she stood in a loft where long tables were set and at the end of one of these sorting out spoons and dishes three women and a man were chatting and laughing together janet was troubled because she could not remember who the man was although she recognized his bold profile his voice and gestures at length one of the women said something in a low tone and he looked around quickly and crossed the room  why its you he said and suddenly she recalled his name  mr insall  but his swift glance had noticed the expression in her eyes the sagged condition of her clothes the attitude that proclaimed exhaustion he took her by the arm and led her to the little storeroom turning on the light and placing her in a chair darkness descended on her  mrs maturin returning from an errand paused for an instant in the doorway and ran forward and bent over janet  oh brooks what is itwhats happened to her  i dont know he replied i didnt have a chance to ask her im going for a doctor  leave her to me and call miss hay mrs maturin was instantly competent  and when insall came back from the drug store where he had telephoned she met him at the head of the stairs weve done everything we can edith hay has given her brandy and gone off for dry clothes and weve taken all the childrens things out of the drawers and laid her on the floor but she hasnt come to poor childwhat can have happened to her is the doctor coming  right away said insall and mrs maturin went back into the storeroom miss hay brought the dry clothes before the physician arrived  its probably pneumonia he explained to insall a little later she must go to the hospitalbut the trouble is all our hospitals are pretty full owing to the sickness caused by the strike he hesitated of course if she has friends she could have better care in a private institution just now  oh she has friends said mrs maturin couldnt we take her to our little hospital at silliston doctor its only four milesthat isnt much in an automobile and the roads are good now  well the risk isnt much greater if you have a closed car and she would of course be better looked after the physician consented  ill see to it at once said insall     chapter xx  the martha wootton memorial hospital was the hobby of an angel alumnus of silliston it was situated in hoveys lane but from the window of the whiteenameled room in which she lay janet could see the bare branches of the common elms quivering to the spring gusts could watch day by day the grass changing from yellowbrown to vivid green in the white sunlight in the morning when the nurse opened the blinds that sunlight swept radiantly into the room lavish with its caresses always spending always giving the symbol of a loving care that had been poured out on her unasked and unsought it was sweet to rest to sleep and instead of the stringent monstercry of the siren of the discordant clamour of the mill bells it was sweet yet strange to be awakened by silvertoned chimes proclaiming peaceful hours at first she surrendered to the spell and had no thought of the future for a little while every day mrs maturin read aloud usually from books of poetry and knowing many of the verses by heart she would watch janets face framed in the soft dark hair that fell in two long plaits over her shoulders for janet little guessed the thought that went into the choosing of these books nor could she know of the hours spent by this lady pondering over library shelves or consulting eagerly with brooks insall sometimes augusta maturin thought of janet as a wildflowerone of the rare shy ones hiding under its leaves sprung up in hampton of all places crushed by a heedless foot yet miraculously not destroyed and already pushing forth new and eager tendrils and she had transplanted it to find the proper nourishment to give it a chance to grow in a native congenial soil such was her breathless task and so she had selected the childs garden of verses         i should like to rise and go         where the golden apples grow  when she laid down her book it was to talk perhaps of silliston established here before the birth of the republic its roots were bedded in the soil of a racial empire to a larger vision of which augusta maturin clung an empire of anglosaxon tradition which despite disagreements and conflictsnay through themdeveloped imperceptibly toward a sublimer union founded not on dominion but on justice and right she spoke of the england she had visited on her wedding journey of the landmarks and literature that also through generations have been american birthrights and of that righteous selfassertion and independence which by protest and even by war america had contributed to the democracy of the future silliston indifferent to cults and cataclysms undisturbed by the dark tides flung westward to gather in deposits in other parts of the land had held fast to the old tradition stood ready to do her share to transform it into something even nobler when the time should come simplicity and worth and beautythese elements at least of the older republic should not perish but in the end prevail  she spoke simply of these things connecting them with a silliston whose spirit appealed to all that was inherent and abiding in the girl all was not chaos here at least a beacon burned with a bright and steady flame and she spoke of andrew silliston the sturdy colonial prototype of the american culture who had fought against his king who had spent his modest fortune to found this seat of learning believing as he did that education is the cornerstone of republics divining that lasting unity is possible alone by the transformation of the individual into the citizen through voluntary bestowal of service and the fruits of labour samuel wootton the boston merchant who had given the hospital was andrews true descendant imbued with the same halfconscious intuition that builds even better that it reeks and andrew could he have returns to earth in his laced coat and long silk waistcoat would still recognize his own soul in silliston academy the soul of his creed and race         away down the river         a hundred miles or more         other little children         shall bring my boats ashore  janet drew in a great breath involuntarily these were moments when it seemed that she could scarcely contain what she felt of beauty and significance when the ecstasy and pain were not to be borne and sometimes as she listened to mrs maturins voice she wept in silence again a strange peace descended on her the peace of an exile come home if not to remain at least to know her own land and people before faring forth she would not think of that faring yet awhile but strive to live and taste the presentand yet as life flowed back into her veins that past arose to haunt her she yearned to pour it out to her new friend to confess all that had happened to her why couldnt she but she was grateful because mrs maturin betrayed no curiosity janet often lay watching her puzzled under the spell of a frankness an ingenuousness a simplicity she had least expected to find in one who belonged to such a learned place as that of silliston but even learning she was discovering could be amazingly simple freely and naturally mrs maturin dwelt on her own past on the little girl of six taken from her the year after her husband died on her husband himself once a professor here and who just before his last illness had published a brilliant book on russian literature which resulted in his being called to harvard they had gone to switzerland instead and augusta maturin had come back to silliston she told janet of the loonhaunted lake hemmed in by the laurentian hills besieged by forests where she had spent her girlhood summers with her father professor wishart of the university of toronto there in search of health gifford maturin had come at her fathers suggestion to camp  janet of course could not know all of that romance though she tried to picture it from what her friend told her augusta wishart at six and twenty had been one of those magnificent canadian women who are most at home in the open she could have carried gifford maturinout of the wilderness on her back she was five feet seven modelled in proportion endowed by some celtic ancestor with that dark chestnut hair which because of its abundance she wore braided and caught up in a heavy knot behind her head tanned by the northern sun kneeling upright in a canoe she might at a little distance have been mistaken for one of the race to which the forests and waters had once belonged the instinct of mothering was strong in her and from the beginning she had taken the shy and delicate student under her wing recognizing in him one of the physically helpless dedicated to a supreme function he was forever catching colds his food disagreed with him and on her own initiative she discharged his habitant cook and supplied him with one of her own choosing when overtaken by one of his indispositions she paddled him about the lake with lusty strokes first placing a blanket over his knees and he submitted he had no pride of that sort he was utterly indifferent to the figure he cut beside his amazon his gentleness of disposition his brilliant conversations with those whom like her father he knew and trusted captivated augusta at this period of her life she was awakening to the glories of literature and taking a special course in that branch he talked to her of gogol turgenief and dostoievsky and seated on the log piazza read in excellent french dead souls peres et enfants and the brothers karamazoff at the end of august he went homeward almost gaily quite ignorant of the arrow in his heart until he began to miss augusta wisharts ministrationsand augusta wishart herself then had followed that too brief period of intensive happiness  the idea of remarriage had never occurred to her at eight and thirty though tragedy had left its mark it had been powerless to destroy the sweetness of a nature of such vitality as hers the innate necessity of loving remained and as time went on had grown more wistful and insistent insall and her silliston neighbours were wont indeed gently to rally her on her enthusiasms while understanding and sympathizing with this need in her a creature of intuition janet had appealed to her from the beginning arousing first her curiosity and then the maternal instinct that craved a mind to mould a soul to respond to her touch  mrs maturin often talked to janet of insall who had in a way long been connected with silliston in his early wandering days when tramping over new england he used unexpectedly to turn up at dr ledyards the principals remain for several weeks and disappear again even then he had been a sort of institution a professor emeritus in botany bird lore and woodcraft taking the boys on long walks through the neighbouring hills and suddenly he had surprised everybody by fancying the tumbledown farmhouse in judiths lane which he had restored with his own hands into the quaintest of old world dwellings behind it he had made a dam in the brook and put in a water wheel that ran his workshop in play hours the place was usually overrun by boys but sometimes the old craving for tramping would overtake him one day his friends would find the house shut up and he would be absent for a fortnight perhaps for a monthone never knew when he was going or when he would return he went like his hero silas simpkins through the byways of new england stopping at night at the farmhouses or often sleeping out under the stars and then perhaps he would write another book he wrote only when he felt like writing  it was this book of insalls the travels of silas simpkins rather than his epworth green or the hermit of blue mountain that mrs maturin chose to read to janet unlike the sage of walden than whom he was more gregarious instead of a log house for his castle silas simpkins chose a cart which he drove in a most leisurely manner from the sea to the mountains penetrating even to hamlets beside the silent lakes on the canadian border and then went back to the sea again two chunky grey horses with wide foreheads and sagacious eyes propelled him at the rate of three miles an hour for these as their master had learned the lesson that if life is to be fully savoured it is not to be bolted silas cooked and ate and sometimes read under the maples beside the stone walls usually he slept in the cart in the midst of the assortment of goods that proclaimed him to the astute an expert in applied psychology at first you might have thought silos merely a peddler but if you knew your thoreau you would presently begin to perceive that peddling was the paltry price he paid for liberty silos was in a way a sagebut such a human sage he never intruded with theories he never even hinted at the folly of the mortals who bought or despised his goods or with whom he chatted by the wayside though he may have had his ideas on the subject it is certain that presently one began to have ones own nor did he exclaim with george sand il ny a rien de plus betement mechant que lhabitant des petites villes somehow the meannesses and jealousies were accounted for if not excused to understand is to pardon  it was so like insall this book in its whimsicality in its feeling of space and freedom in its hidden wisdom that gradually revealed itself as one thought it over before falling off to sleep new england in the early summer here beside the tender greens of the ipswich downs was the sparkling cobalt of the sea and she could almost smell its cool salt breath mingling with the warm odours of hay and the pungent scents of roadside flowers weathered grey cottages were scattered over the landscape and dark copses of cedars while oceanward the eye was caught by the gleam of a lighthouse or a lonely sail  even in that sandy plain covered with sickly stunted pines and burned patches stretching westward from the merrimac silas saw beauty and colour life in the once prosperous houses not yet abandoned presently the hills all hyacinth blue rise up against the sunset and the horses feet are on the boston roador rud according to the authorized pronunciation of that land hardly indeed in many places a rud today reverting picturesquely into the forest trail over which the early inland settlers rode their horses or drove their oxen with upcountry produce to the sea they were not a people who sought the easiest way and the boston road reflects their characters few valleys are deep enough to turn it aside few mountains can appal it railroads have given it a wide berth here and there the forest opens out to reveal on a knoll or flat a forgotten village or tavernstand over the high shelf of washington town it runs where the air is keen and the lakes are blue where longstemmed wild flowers nod on its sunny banks to reach at length the rounded classic hills and sentinel mountain that mark the sheep country of the connecticut  it was before janets convalescence began that mrs maturin had consulted insall concerning her proposed experiment in literature afterwards he had left silliston for a lumber camp on a remote river in northern maine abruptly to reappear on a mild afternoon late in april in augusta maturins garden the crocuses and tulips were in bloom and his friend in a gardening apron was on her knees trowel in hand assisting a hired man to set out marigolds and snapdragons  well its time you were home again she exclaimed as she rose to greet him and led him to a chair on the little flagged terrace beside the windows of her library ive got so much to tell you about our invalid  our invalid insall retorted  of course i look to you to divide the responsibility with me and youve shirked by running off to maine you found her you knowand shes really remarkable  now see here augusta you cant expect me to share the guardianship of an attractive andwell a dynamic young woman if she affects you this way what will she do to me im much too susceptible  susceptible she scoffed but you cant get out of it i need you ive never been so interested and so perplexed in my life  how is she insall asked  frankly im worried said mrs maturin at first she seemed to be getting along beautifully i read to her a little every day and it was wonderful how she responded to it ill tell you about that ive got so much to tell you young dr trent is puzzled too it seems there are symptoms in the case for which he cannot account some three weeks ago he asked me what i made out of her and i cant make anythingthats the trouble except that she seems pathetically grateful and that ive grown absurdly fond of her but she isnt improving as fast as she should and dr trent doesnt know whether or not to suspect functional complications her constitution seems excellent her vitality unusual trents impressed by her he inclines to the theory that she has something on her mind and if this is so she should get rid of it tell it to somebodyin short tell it to me i know shes fond of me but shes so maddeningly selfcontained and at moments when i look at her she baffles me she makes me feel like an atom twenty times at least ive almost screwed up my courage to ask her but when it comes to the point i simply cant do it  you ought to be able to get at it if any one can said insall  ive a notion it may be connected with the strike augusta maturin continued i never could account for her being mixed up in that plunging into syndicalism it seemed so foreign to her nature i wish id waited a little longer before telling her about the strike but one day she asked me how it had come outand she seemed to be getting along so nicely i didnt see any reason for not telling her i said that the strike was over that the millowners had accepted the iww terms but that antonelli and jastro had been sent to jail and were awaiting trial because they had been accused of instigating the murder of a woman who was shot by a striker aiming at a policeman it seems that she had seen that she told me so quite casually but she was interested and i went on to mention how greatly the strikers were stirred by the arrests how they paraded in front of the jail singing and how the feeling was mostly directed against mr ditmar because he was accused of instigating the placing of dynamite in the tenements  and you spoke of mr ditmars death insall inquired  why yes i told her how he had been shot in dover street by a demented italian and if it hadnt been proved that the italian was insane and not a mill worker the result of the strike might have been different  how did she take it  well she was shocked of course she sat up in bed staring at me and then leaned back on the pillows again i pretended not to notice itbut i was sorry id said anything about it  she didnt say anything  not a word  didnt you know that before the strike she was ditmars private stenographer  no augusta maturin exclaimed why didnt you tell me  it never occurred to me to tell you insall replied  that must have something to do with it said mrs maturin  insall got up and walked to the end of the terrace gazing at a bluebird on the edge of the lawn  well not necessarily he said after a while did you ever find out anything about her family  oh yes i met the father once hes been out two or three times on sunday and came over here to thank me for what id done the mother doesnt comeshe has some trouble i dont know exactly what brooks i wish you could see the father hes so typically uniqueif one may use the expression a gatekeeper at the chippering mills  a gatekeeper  yes and im quite sure he doesnt understand to this day how he became one or why hes delightfully naive on the subject of genealogy and i had the bumpus family by heart before he left thats the form his remnant of the intellectual curiosity of his ancestors takes he was born in dolton which was settled by the original bumpus back in the plymouth colony days and if he were rich hed have a library stuffed with gritty yellowbacked books and be a leading light in the historical society he speaks with that nicety of pronunciation of the old new englander never slurring his syllables and he has a really fine face the kind of face one doesnt often see nowadays i kept looking at it wondering what was the matter with it and at last i realized what it lackedwill desire ambitionit was what a secondrate sculptor might have made of bradford for instance but there is a remnant of fire in him once when he spoke of the strike of the foreigners he grew quite indignant  he didnt tell you why his daughter had joined the strikers insall asked  he was just as much at sea about that as you and i are of course i didnt ask himhe asked me if i knew its only another proof of her amazing reticence and i can imagine an utter absence of sympathy between them he accounts for her of course hes probably the unconscious transmitter of qualities the puritans possessed and tried to smother certainly the fires are alight in her and yet its almost incredible that he should have conveyed them of course i havent seen the mother  its curious he didnt mention her having been ditmars stenographer insall put in was that reticence  i hardly think so augusta maturin replied it may have been but the impression i got was of an incapacity to feel the present all his emotions are in the past most of his conversation was about bumpuses who are dead and buried and his pride in janetfor he has a prideseems to exist because she is their representative its extraordinary but he sees her present situation her future with extraordinary optimism he apparently regards her coming to silliston even in the condition in which we found her as a piece of deserved fortune for which she has to thank some virtue inherited from her ancestors well perhaps hes right if she were not unique i shouldnt want to keep her here its pure selfishness i told mr bumpus i expected to find work for her  mrs maturin returned insalls smile i suppose youre too polite to say that im carried away by my enthusiasms but you will at least do me the justice to admit that they are rare anddiscriminating as a connoisseurs should be i think even you will approve of her  oh i have approved of herthats the trouble  mrs maturin regarded him for a moment in silence  i wish you could have seen her when i began to read those verses of stevensons it was an inspirations your thinking of them  did i think of them  you know you did you cant escape your responsibility well i felt likelike a gambler as though i were staking everything on a throw and after i began as if i were playing on some rare instrument she lay there listening without uttering a word but somehow she seemed to be interpreting them for me giving them a meaning and a beauty i hadnt imagined another time i told her about silliston and how this little community for over a century and a half had tried to keep its standard flying to carry on the work begun by old andrew and i thought of those lines         other little children         shall bring my boats ashore  that particular application just suddenly occurred to me but she inspired it  youre a born schoolmaam insall laughed  im much too radical for a schoolmam she declared no board of trustees would put up with menot even sillistons weve kept the faith but we do move slowly brooks even tradition grows and sometimes our blindness here to changes to modern scientific facts fairly maddens me i read her that poem of moodysyou know it         here where the moors stretch free         in the high blue afternoon         are the marching sun and the talking sea  and those last lines         but thou vast outbound ship of souls         what harbour town for thee         what shapes when thy arriving tolls         shall crowd the banks to see         shall all the happy shipmates then         stand singing brotherly         or shall a haggard ruthless few         warp her over and bring her to         while the many broken souls of me         fester down in the slavers pen         and nothing to say or do  i was sorry afterwards i could see that she was tremendously excited and she made me feel as if i too had been battened down in that hold and bruised and almost strangled i often wonder whether she has got out of it into the lightwhether we can rescue her mrs maturin paused  what do you mean insall asked  well its difficult to describe what i feelshes such a perplexing mixture of old new england and modernity of a fatalism and an aliveness that fairly vibrates at first when she began to recover i was conscious only of the vitalitybut lately i feel the other quality it isnt exactly the old puritan fatalism or even the greek its oddly modern too almost agnostic i should saya calm acceptance of the hazards of life of nature of sun and rain and storm alikevery different from the cheap optimism one finds everywhere now she isnt exactly resignedi dont say thati know she can be rebellious and shes grateful for the sun yet she seems to have a conviction that the clouds will gather again the doctor says she may leave the hospital on monday and im going to bring her over here for awhile then she added insinuatingly we can collaborate  i think ill go back to maine insall exclaimed  if you desert me i shall never speak to you again said mrs maturin  janet said mrs maturin the next day as she laid down the book from which she was reading do you remember that i spoke to you once in hampton of coming here to silliston well now weve got you here we dont want to lose you ive been making inquiries quite a number of the professors have typewriting to be done and they will be glad to give their manuscripts to you instead of sending them to boston and theres brooks insall tooif he ever takes it into his head to write another book you wouldnt have any trouble reading his manuscript its like script of course it has to be copied you can board with mrs caseive arranged that too but on monday im going to take you to my house and keep you until youre strong enough to walk  janets eyes were suddenly bright with tears  youll stay  i cant answered janet i couldnt  but why not have you any other plans  no i havent any plans buti havent the right to stay here presently she raised her face to her friend oh mrs maturin im so sorry i didnt want to bring any sadness hereits all so bright and beautiful and now ive made you sad  it was a moment before augusta maturin could answer her  what are friends for janet she asked if not to share sorrow with and do you suppose theres any place however bright where sorrow has not come do you think ive not known it too and janet i havent sat here all these days with you without guessing that something worries you ive been waiting all this time for you to tell me in order that i might help you  i wanted to said janet every day i wanted to but i couldnt i couldnt bear to trouble you with it i didnt mean ever to tell you and thenits so terrible i dont know what youll think  i think i know you janet answered mrs maturin nothing human nothing natural is terrible in the sense you mean at least im one of those who believe so  presently janet said im going to have a child  mrs maturin sat very still something closed in her throat preventing her immediate reply  i too had a child my dear she answered i lost her she felt the girls clasp tighten on her fingers  but youyou had a right to ityou were married children are sacred things said augusta maturin  sacred could it be that a woman like mrs maturity thought that this child which was coming to her was sacred too  however they come asked janet oh i tried to believe that too at firstat first i didnt want it and when i knew it was coming i was driven almost crazy and then all at once when i was walking in the rain i knew i wanted it to haveto keep all to myself you understand  augusta maturity inclined her head  but the father she managed to ask after a moment i dont wish to pry my dear but does hedoes he realize cant he help you  it was mr ditmar  perhaps it will help you to tell me about it janet  idid like to ive been so unhappy since you told me he was deadand i felt like a cheat you see he promised to marry me and i know now that he loved me that he really wanted to marry me but something happened to make me believe he wasnt going to i sawanother girl whod got into trouble and then i thought hed only been playing with me and i couldnt stand it i joined the strikersi just had to do something  augusta maturity nodded and waited  i was only a stenographer and we were very poor and he was rich and lived in a big house the most important man in hampton it seemed too good to be truei suppose i never really thought it could happen please dont think im putting all the blame on him mrs maturityit was my fault just as much as his i ought to have gone away from hampton but i didnt have the strength and i shouldnt have janet stopped  butyou loved him  yes i did for a long time after i left him i thought i didnt i thought i hated him and when i found out what had happened to methat night i came to youi got my fathers pistol and went to the mill to shoot him i was going to shoot myself too  oh mrs maturity gasped she gave a quick glance of sheer amazement at janet who did not seem to notice it who was speaking objectively apparently with no sense of the drama in her announcement  but i couldnt she went on at the time i didnt know why i couldnt but when i went out i understood it was because i wanted the child because it was his child and though he was almost out of his head he seemed so glad because id come back to him and said hed marry me right away  and you refused exclaimed mrs maturity  well you see i was out of my head too i still thought i hated himbut id loved him all the time it was funny he had lots of faults and he didnt seem to understand or care much about how poor people feel though he was kind to them in the mills he might have come to understandi dont knowit wasnt because he didnt want to but because he was so separated from them i guess and he was so interested in what he was doing he had ambition he thought everything of that mill hed made it i dont know why i loved him it wasnt because he was fine like mr insall but he was strong and brave and he needed me and just took me  one never knows augusta maturity murmured  i went back that night to tell him id marry himand hed gone then i came to you to the soup kitchen i didnt mean to bother you ive never quite understood how i got there i dont care so much what happens to me now that ive told you janet added it was mean not to tell you but id never had anything like thiswhat you were giving meand i wanted all i could get  im thankful you did come to us augusta maturin managed to reply  you mean janet exclaimed  i mean that we who have been morefortunate dont look at these things quite as we used to that the world is less censorious is growing to understand situations it formerly condemned andi dont know what kind of a monster you supposed me to be janet  oh mrs maturin  i mean that im a woman too my dear although my life has been sheltered otherwise what has happened to you might have happened to me and besides i am what is called unconventional i have little theories of my own about life and now that you have told me everything i understand you and love you even more than i did before  save that her breath came fast janet lay still against the cushions of the armchair she was striving to grasp the momentous and unlookedfor fact of her friends unchanged attitude then she askedmrs maturin do you believe in god  augusta maturin was startled by the question i like to think of him as light janet and that we are plants seeking to grow toward himno matter from what dark crevice we may spring even in our mistakes and sins we are seeking him for these are ignorances and as the world learns more we shall know him better and better it is natural to long for happiness and happiness is selfrealization and selfrealization is knowledge and light  that is beautiful said janet at length  it is all we can know about god said mrs maturin but it is enough she had been thinking rapidly and now she went on we shall have to consider what is to be done i dont pretend that the future will be easy but it will not be nearly as hard for you as it might have been since i am your friend and i do not intend to desert you im sure you will not let it crush you in the first place you will have something to go on withmental resources i mean for which you have a natural craving books and art and nature the best thoughts and the best interpretations we can give you these and you will have your child and work to do for im sure youre industrious and of course ill keep your secret my dear  buthow janet exclaimed  ive arranged it all youll stay here this spring youll come to my house on monday just as we planned and later on you may go to mrs cases if it will make you feel more independent and do typewriting until the spring term is over ive told you about my little camp away up in canada in the heart of the wilderness where i go in summer well stay there until the autumn until your baby comes and after that i know it wont be difficult to get you a position in the west where you can gain your living and have your child i have a good friend in california who im sure will help you and even if your secret should eventually be discoveredwhich is not probableyou will have earned respect and society is not as stern as it used to be and you will always have me for a friend there thats the bright side of it of course it isnt a bed of roses but ive lived long enough to observe that the people who lie on roses dont always have the happiest lives whenever you want help and advice i shall always be here and from time to time ill be seeing you isnt that sensible  oh mrs maturinif you really want mestill  i do want you janet even more than i didbefore because you need me more mrs maturin replied with a sincerity that could not fail to bring conviction     chapter xxi  as the spring progressed janet grew stronger became well again and through the kindness of dr ledyard the principal was presently installed with a typewriter in a little room in an old building belonging to the academy in what was called bramble street and not far from the common here during the day she industriously copied manuscripts or from her notebook letters dictated by various members of the faculty and she was pleased when they exclaimed delightedly at the flawless copies and failed to suspect her of frequent pilgrimages to the dictionary in the library in order to familiarize herself with the meaning and manner of spelling various academic words at first it was almost bewildering to find herself in some degree thus sharing the silliston community life and an unpremeditated attitude toward these learned ones high priests of the muses she had so long ignorantly worshipped accounted perhaps for a great deal in their attitude toward her her fervour repressed yet palpable was like a flame burning before their altarsa flattery to which the learned being human are quick to respond besides something of her history was known and she was of a type to incite a certain amount of interest amongst these discerning ones often after she had taken their dictation or brought their manuscripts home they detained her in conversation in short silliston gave its approval to this particular experiment of augusta maturin as for mrs maturin herself her feeling was one of controlled pride not unmixed with concern always conscious as she was of the hidden element of tragedy in the play she had so lovingly staged not that she had any compunction in keeping janets secret even from insall but sometimes as she contemplated it the strings of her heart grew tight silliston was so obviously where janet belonged she could not bear the thought of the girl going out again from this sheltered spot into a chaotic world of smoke and struggle  janets own feelings were a medley it was not of course contentment she knew continually nor even peace although there were moments when these stole over her there were moments despite her incredible good fortune of apprehension when she shrank from the future when fear assailed her moments of intense sadness at the thought of leaving her friends of leaving this enchanted place now that miraculously she had found it moments of stimulation of exaltation when she forgot her prevailing sense as she found herself again was of thankfulness and gratitude of determination to take advantage of to drink in all of this wonderful experience lest any precious memory be lost  like a jewel gleaming with many facets each sunny day was stored and treasured as she went from mrs cases boardinghouse forth to her work the sweet sharp air of these spring mornings was filled with delicious smells of new things of new flowers and new grass and tender new leaves of myriad shades bronze and crimson fuzzy white primrose and emerald green and sometimes it seemed as though the pink and white clouds of the little orchards were wafted into swooning scents she loved best the moment when the common came in view when through the rows of elms the lineaments of those old houses rose before her lineaments seemingly long familiar as of old and trusted friends and yet ever stirring new harmonies and new visions here in their midst she belonged and here had the world been otherwise ordained she might have lived on in one continuous shining spring at the corner of the common foursquare ample painted a straw colour trimmed with white with its high chimneys and fanshaped stairway window its balustraded terrace porch open to the sky was the eighteenth century mansion occupied by dr ledyard what was the secret of its flavour and how account for the sense of harmony inspired by another dwelling built during the term of the second adams set in a frame of maples and shining white in the morning sun its curved portico was capped by a wroughtiron railing its long windows were touched with purple and its low garretset like a deckhouse on the wide roofsuggested hidden secrets of the past here a motley or a longfellow might have dwelt a bryant penned his thanatopsis farther on chequered by shade stood the quaint brick row of professors houses with sloping eaves and recessed entrances of granitea subject for an old english print along the border of the common were interspersed among the ancient dormitories and halls the new and dignified buildings of plumcoloured brick that still preserved the soul of silliston and to it the soul of janet responded  in the late afternoon when her tasks were finished janet would cross the common to mrs maturinsa dwelling typical of the new england of the past with the dimensions of a cottage and something of the dignity of a mansion fluted white pilasters adorned the corners the windows were protected by tiny eaves the roof was guarded by a rail the classically porched entrance was approached by a path between high clipped hedges of hemlock and through the library on the right you reached the flagged terrace beside a garden rioting in the carnival colours of spring by september it would have changed for there is one glory of the hyacinth of the tulip and narcissus and the jonquil and another of the michaelmas daisy and the aster  insall was often there and on saturdays and sundays he took mrs maturin and janet on long walks into the country there were afternoons when the world was flooded with silver light when the fields were lucent in the sun and afternoons stained with bluethe landscape like a tapestry woven in delicate grins on a ground of indigo the arbutus all aglow and fragrant beneath its leaves the purple fringed polygala were past but they found the pale gold lily of the bellwort the rustred bloom of the ginger in the open spaces under the sky were clouds of bluets wild violets and white strawberry flowers clustering beside the star moss all ashimmer with new green the canada mayflower spread a carpet under the pines and in the hollows where the mists settled where the brooks flowed where the air was heavy with the damp ineffable odour of growing things they gathered drooping adderstongues whitestarred bloodroots and foamflowers from insalls quick eye nothing seemed to escape he would point out to them the hummingbird that hovered a bright blur above the columbine the woodpecker glued to the trunk of a maple high above their heads the red gleam of a tanager flashing through sunlit foliage the oriole and vireo where they hid and his was the ear that first caught the exquisite distant note of the hermit once he stopped them startled to listen to the cock partridge drumming to its mate  sometimes of an evening when janet was helping mrs maturin in her planting or weeding insall would join them rolling up the sleeves of his flannel shirt and kneeling beside them in the garden paths mrs maturin was forever asking his advice though she did not always follow it  now brooks she would say youve just got to suggest something to put in that border to replace the hyacinths  i had larkspur last yearyou rememberand it looked like a chromo in a railroad folder  let me seedid i advise larkspur he would ask  oh im sure you must havei always do what you tell me it seems to me ive thought of every possible flower in the catalogue you know too only youre so afraid of committing yourself  insalls comic spirit betrayed by his expressions by the quizzical intonations of his voice never failed to fill janet with joy while it was somehow suggestive too of the vast fund of his resource mrs maturin was right he could have solved many of her questions offhand if he had so wished but he had his own method of dealing with appeals his head tilted on one side apparently in deep thought over the problem he never answered outright but by some process of suggestion unfathomable to janet and by eliminating not too deprecatingly mrs maturins impatient proposals brought her to a point where she blurted out the solution herself  oriental poppies how stupid of me not to think of them  how stupid of me insall echoedand janet bending over her weeding made sure they had been in his mind all the while  augusta maturins chief extravagance was books she could not bear to await her turn at the library and if she liked a book she wished to own it subscribing to several reviews three english and one american she scanned them eagerly every week and sent in orders to her boston bookseller as a consequence the carved walnut racks on her library table were constantly being strained a good book she declared ought to be read aloud and discussed even during its perusal and thus janet after an elementary and decidedly unique introduction to worthwhile literature in the hospital was suddenly plunged into the vortex of modern thought the dictum insall quoted that modern culture depended largely upon what one had not read was applied to her a child of the new environment fallen into skilful hands she was spared the boredom of wading through the socalled classics which though useful as milestones as landmarks for future reference are largely mere reminders of an absolute universe now vanished the arrival of a novel play or treatise by one of that small but growing nucleus of twentieth century seers was an event and often a volume begun in the afternoon was taken up again after supper while mrs maturin sat sewing on the other side of the lamp janet had her turn at reading from the first she had been quick to note mrs maturins inflections and the relics of a highschool manner were rapidly eliminated the essence of latterday realism and pragmatism its courageous determination to tear away a veil of which she had always been dimly aware to look the facts of human nature in the face refreshed her an increasing portion of it she understood and she was constantly under the spell of the excitement that partially grasps that hovers on the verge of inspiring discoveries this excitement whenever insall chanced to be present was intensified as she sat a silent but often quivering listener to his amusing and pungent comments on these new ideas his method of discussion never failed to illuminate and delight her and often when she sat at her typewriter the next day she would recall one of his quaint remarks that suddenly threw a bright light on some matter hitherto obscure occasionally a novel or a play was the subject of their talk and then they took a delight in drawing her out in appealing to a spontaneous judgment unhampered by pedagogically implanted preconceptions janet would grow hot from shyness  say what you think my dear mrs maturin would urge her and remember that your own opinion is worth more than shakespeares or napoleons  insall would escort her home to mrs cases boarding house  one afternoon early in june janet sat in her little room working at her letters when brooks insall came in i dont mean to intrude in business hours but i wanted to ask if you would do a little copying for me he said and he laid on her desk a parcel bound with characteristic neatness  something youve written she exclaimed blushing with pleasure and surprise he was actually confiding to her one of his manuscripts  wellyes he replied comically eyeing her  ill be very careful with it ill do it right away  theres no particular hurry he assured her the editors waited six months for itanother month or so wont matter  another month or so she ejaculatedbut he was gone of course she couldnt have expected him to remain and talk about it but this unexpected exhibition of shyness concerning his workso admired by the worlds choicer spiritsthrilled yet amused her and made her glow with a new understanding with eager fingers she undid the string and sat staring at the regular script without taking in at first the meaning of a single sentence it was a comparatively short sketch entitled the exile in which shining winged truths and elusive beauties flitted continually against a darkbackground of puritan oppression the story of one basil grelott a dreamer of miltons day oxford nurtured who casting off the shackles of dogma and manmade decrees sailed with his books to the new england wilderness across the sea there he lived among the savages in peace and freedom until the arrival of winthrop and his devotees to encounter persecution from those who themselves had fled from it the lords brethren he averred were worse than the lords bishopsblackstones phrase janet of course had never heard of blackstone some of whose experiences insall had evidently used and the puritans dealt with grelott even as they would have served the author of paradise lost himself especially if he had voiced among them the opinions set forth in his pamphlet on divorce a portrait of a stern divine with his infallible book gave janet a vivid conception of the character of her ancestors and early boston with yellow candlelight gleaming from the lanternlike windows of the wooden elizabethan houses was unforgettably etched there was an inquisition in a freezing barn of a church and basil grelott banished to perish amid the forest in his renewed quest for freedom after reading the manuscript janet sat typewriting into the night taking it home with her and placing it besides her bed lest it be lost to posterity by five the next evening she had finished the copy  a gentle rain had fallen during the day but had ceased as she made her way toward insalls house the place was familiar now she had been there to supper with mrs maturin a supper cooked and served by martha vesey an elderly efficient and appallingly neat widow whom insall had discovered somewhere in his travels and installed as his housekeeper janet paused with her hand on the gate latch to gaze around her at the picket fence on which he had been working when she had walked hither the year before it was primly painted now its posts crowned with the carved pineapples behind the fence oldfashioned flowers were in bloom lupins and false indigo and the retaining wall of bluegrey slaty stone which he had laid that spring was finished a wind stirred the maple releasing a shower of heavy drops and she opened the gate and went up the path and knocked at the door there was no responseeven martha must be absent in the village janet was disappointed she had looked forward to seeing him to telling him how great had been her pleasure in the story he had written at the same time doubting her courage to do so she had never been able to speak to him about his work and what did her opinion matter to him as she turned away the stillness was broken by a humming sound gradually rising to a crescendo so she ventured slowly around the house and into the orchard of gnarled apple trees on the slope until she came insight of a little white building beside the brook the weathervane perched on the gable and veering in the wet breeze seemed like a live fish swimming in its own element and through the open window she saw insall bending over a lathe from which the chips were flying she hesitated then he looked up and seeing her reached above his head to pull the lever that shut off the power  come in he called out and met her at the doorway he was dressed in a white duck shirt open at the neck and a pair of faded corduroy trousers i wasnt looking for this honour he told her with a gesture of selfdeprecation or id have put on a dinner coat  and despite her eagerness and excitement she laughed  i didnt dare to leave this in the house she explained mrs vesey wasnt home and i thought you might be here  you havent made the copy already  oh i loved doing it she replied and paused flushing she might have known that it would be simply impossible to talk to him about it so she laid it down on the workbench and overcome by a sudden shyness retreated toward the door  youre not going he exclaimed  i mustand youre busy  not at all he declared not at all i was just killing time until supper sit down and he waved her to a magisteriallooking chair of jacobean design with turned legs sandpapered and immaculate that stood in the middle of the shop  oh not in that janet protested and besides id spoil itim sure my skirt is wet  but he insisted thrusting it under her youve come along just in time i wanted a woman to test itmen are no judges of chairs theres a vacuum behind the small of your back isnt there augusta will have to put a cushion in it  did you make it for mrs maturin she will be pleased exclaimed janet as she sat down i dont think its uncomfortable  i copied it from an old one in the boston art museum augusta saw it there and said she wouldnt be happy until she had one like it but dont tell her  not for anything janet got to her feet again i really must be going  going where  i told mrs maturin id read that new book to her i couldnt go yesterdayi didnt want to go she added fearing he might think his work had kept her  well ill walk over with you she asked me to make a little design for a fountain you know and ill have to get some measurements  as they emerged from the shop and climbed the slope janet tried to fight off the sadness that began to invade her soon she would have to be leaving all this her glance lingered wistfully on the old farmhouse with its great centre chimney from which the smoke was curling with its diamondpaned casements insall had put into the tiny frames  what queer windows she said but they seem to go with the house beautifully  you think so his tone surprised her it had a touch more of earnestness than she had ever before detected they belong to that type of house the old settlers brought the leaded glass with them some people think theyre cold but ive arranged to make them fairly tight you see ive tried to restore it as it must have been when it was built  and these she asked pointing to the millstones of different diameters that made the steps leading down to the garden  oh thats an old custom but they are nice he agreed ill just put this precious manuscript inside and get my foot rule he added opening the door and she stood awaiting him on the threshold confronted by the steep little staircase that disappeared into the wall half way up at her left was the room where he worked and which once had been the farmhouse kitchen she took a few steps into it and while he was searching in the table drawer she halted before the great chimney over which against the panel an old bellmouthed musket hung insall came over beside her  those were trees he said that panels over four feet across i measured it once i dare say the pine it was cut from grew right where we are standing before the land was cleared to build the house  but the gun she questioned you didnt have it the night we came to supper  no i ran across it at a sale in boston the old settler must have owned one like that i like to think of him away off here in the wilderness in those early days  she thought of how insall had made those early days live for her in his story of basil grelott but to save her soul when with such an opening she could not speak of it  he had to work pretty hard of course insall continued but i dare say he had a fairly happy life no movies no sunday supplements no automobiles or gypsy moths his only excitement was to trudge ten miles to dorset and listen to a three hour sermon on everlasting fire and brimstone by a man who was supposed to know no wonder he slept soundly and lived to be over ninety  insall was standing with his head thrown back his eyes stilt seemingly fixed on the musket that had suggested his remarka pose eloquent she thought of the mental and physical balance of the man she wondered what belief gave him the free mastery of soul and body he possessed some firm conviction she was sure must energise him yet she respected him the more for concealing it  its hard to understand such a terrible religion she cried i dont see how those old settlers could believe in it when there are such beautiful things in the world if we only open our eyes and look for them oh mr insall i wish i could tell you how i felt when i read your story and when mrs maturin read me those other books of yours  she stopped breathlessly aghast at her boldnessand then suddenly a barrier between them seemed to break down and for the first time since she had known him she felt near to him he could not doubt the sincerity of her tribute  you like them as much as that janet he said looking at her  i cant tell you how much i cant express myself and i want to tell you something else mr insall while i have the chancehow just being with you and mrs maturin has changed me i can face life now you have shown me so much in it i never saw before  while you have the chance he repeated  yes she strove to go on cheerfully now ive said it i feel better i promise not to mention it again i knewyou didnt think me ungrateful its funny she added the more people have done for youwhen theyve given you everything life and hopethe harder it is to thank them she turned her face away lest he might see that her eyes were wet mrs maturin will be expecting us  not yet she heard him say and felt his hand on her arm you havent thought of what youre doing for me  what im doing for you she echoed what hurts me most when i think about it is that ill never be able to do anything  why do you say that he asked  if i only could believe that some day i might be able to help youjust a littlei should be happier all i have all i am i owe to you and mrs maturin  no janet he answered what you are is you and its more real than anything we could have put into you what you have to give isyourself his fingers trembled on her arm but she saw him smile a little before he spoke again augusta maturin was right when she said that you were the woman i needed i didnt realize it then perhaps she didntbut now im sure of it will you come to me  she stood staring at him as in terror suddenly penetrated by a dismay that sapped her strength and she leaned heavily against the fireplace clutching the mantelshelf  dont she pleaded please donti cant  you cant perhaps after a while you may come to feel differentlyi didnt mean to startle you she heard him reply gently this humility in him was unbearable  oh it isnt thatit isnt that if i could id be willing to serve you all my lifei wouldnt ask for anything more i never thought that this would happen i oughtnt to have stayed in silliston  you didnt suspect that i loved you  how could i oh i might have loved you if id been fortunateif id deserved it but i never thought i always looked up to youyou are so far above me she lifted her face to him in agony im sorryim sorry for youill never forgive myself  itssome one else he asked  i wasgoing to be married toto mr ditmar she said slowly despairingly  but even then insall began  you dont understand she cried what will you think of memrs maturin was to have told you after id gone itsits the same as if i were married to himonly worse  worse insall repeated uncomprehendingly and then she was aware that he had left her side he was standing by the window  a thrush began to sing in the maple she stole silently toward the door and paused to look back at him once to meet his glance he had turned  i canti cant let you go like this she heard him say but she fled from him out of the gate and toward the common  when janet appeared augusta maturin was in her garden with an instant perception that something was wrong she went to the girl and led her to the sofa in the library there the confession was made  i never guessed it janet sobbed oh mrs maturin youll believe mewont you  of course i believe you janet augusta maturity replied trying to hide her pity her own profound concern and perplexity i didnt suspect it either if i had  you wouldnt have brought me here you wouldnt have asked me to stay with you but i was to blame i oughtnt to have stayed i knew all along that something would happensomething terrible that i hadnt any right to stay  who could have foreseen it her friend exclaimed helplessly brooks isnt like any other man ive ever knownone can never tell what he has in mind not that im surprised as i look back upon it all  ive hurt him  augusta maturity was silent awhile remember my dear she begged you havent only yourself to think about from now on  but comfort was out of the question the task of calming the girl impossible finally the doctor was sent for and she was put to bed  augusta maturity spent an agonized sleepless night a prey of many emotions of selfreproach seeing now that she had been wrong in not telling brooks insall of the girls secret of sorrow and sympathy for him of tenderness toward the girl despite the suffering she had brought of unwonted rebellion against a world that cheated her of this cherished human tie for which she had longed the first that had come into her life since her husband and child had gone and there was her own responsibility for insalls unhappinesswhen she recalled with a pang her innocent sayings that janet was the kind of woman he an artist should marry and it was trueif he must marry he himself had seen it did janet love him or did she still remember ditmar again and again during the summer that followed this query was on her lips but remained unspoken  the next day insall disappeared no one knew where he had gone but his friends in silliston believed he had been seized by one of his sudden capricious fancies for wandering for many months his name was not mentioned between augusta maturity and janet by the middle of june they had gone to canada  in order to reach the camp on lac du sablier from the tiny railroad station at saint hubert a trip of some eight miles up the decharge was necessary the day had been when augusta maturity had done her share of paddling and poling with an habitant guide in the bow she had foreseen all the needs of this occasion warm clothes for janet who was wrapped in blankets and placed on cushions in the middle of a canoe while she herself followed in a second from time to time exclaiming in a reassuring voice that one had nothing to fear in the hands of delphin and herve whom she had known intimately for more than twenty years it was indeed a wonderful exciting and at moments seemingly perilous journey up the forested aisle of the river at sight of the first roaring reach of rapids janet held her breathso incredible did it appear that any human power could impel and guide a boat up the white stairway between the boulders was it not courting destruction yet she felt a strange wild delight in the sense of danger of amazement at the woodsmans eye that found and followed the crystal paths through the waste of foam there were long quiet stretches hemmed in by alders where the canoes dodging the fallen trees glided through the still water no such silent exhilarating motion janet had ever known even the dipping paddles made no noise though sometimes there was a gurgle as though a fish had broken the water behind them sometimes in the shining pools ahead she saw the trout leap out at every startling flop delphin would exclaim un gros from an upper branch of a spruce a kingfisher darted like an arrow into the water making a splash like a falling stone once after they had passed through the breach of a beaver dam herve nodded his head toward a mound of twigs by the bank and muttered something augusta maturin laughed  cabane de castor he saysa beaver cabin and the beavers made the dam we just passed did you notice janet how beautifully clean those logs had been cut by their sharp teeth  at moments she conversed rapidly with delphin in the same patois janet had heard on the streets of hampton how long ago that seemed  on two occasions when the falls were sheer they had to disembark and walk along little portages through the green raspberry bushes the prints of great hooves in the black silt betrayed where wild animals had paused to drink they stopped for lunch on a warm rock beside a singing waterfall and at last they turned an elbow in the stream and with suddenly widened vision beheld the lakes sapphire expanse and the distant circle of hills les montagnes herve called them as he flung out his pipe and this janet could translate for herself eastward they lay lucent in the afternoon light westward behind the generous log camp standing on a natural terrace above the landing they were in shadow here indeed seemed peace if remoteness if nature herself might bestow it  janet little suspected that special preparations had been made for her comfort early in april while the wilderness was still in the grip of winter delphin had been summoned from a faraway lumber camp to saint hubert where several packingcases and two rolls of lead pipe from montreal lay in a shed beside the railroad siding he had superintended the transportation of these on dog sledges up the frozen decharge accompanied on his last trip by a plumber of sorts from beaupre thirty miles down the line and between them they had improvised a bathroom and attached a boiler to the range only a week before the arrival of madame the spring on the hillside above the camp had been tapped and the pipe laid securely underground besides this unheardof luxury for the lac du sablier there were iron beds and mattresses and little wood stoves to go in the four bedrooms which were more securely chinked with moss the traditions of that camp had been hospitable in professor wisharts day many guests had come and gone or pitched their tents nearby and augusta maturin until this summer had rarely been here alone although she had no fears of the wilderness and delphin brought his daughter delphine to do the housework and cooking the land for miles round about was owned by a toronto capitalist who had been a friend of her father and who could afford as a hobby the sparing of the forest by his permission a few sportsmen came to fish or shoot and occasionally their campfires could be seen across the water starlike glows in the darkness of the night at morning and evening little blue threads of smoke that rose against the forest bocane delphin called it and janet found a sweet strange magic in these words of the pioneer  the lake was a large one shaped like an hourglass as its name implied and augusta maturin sometimes paddled janet through the wide shallow channel to the northern end even as she had once paddled gifford her genius was for the helpless one day when the waters were high and the portages could be dispensed with they made an excursion through the riviere des peres to the lake of that name the next in the chain above for luncheon they ate the trout augusta caught and in the afternoon when they returned to the mouth of the outlet herve softly checking the canoe with his paddle whispered the word arignal thigh deep in the lush grasses of the swamp was an animal with a huge grey head like a donkeys staring foolishly in their directiona cow moose with a tremendous commotion that awoke echoes in the forest she tore herself from the mud and disappeared followed by her panicstricken offspring a caricature of herself  by september the purple fireweed that springs up beside old camps and in the bois brute had bloomed and scattered its myriad impalpable thistledowns over crystal floors autumn came to the laurentians in the morning the lake lay like a quicksilver pool under the rising mists through which the sun struck blinding flashes of light a little later when the veil had lifted it became a mirror for the hills and crags the blue reaches of the sky the stinging air was spiced with balsam revealed was the incredible brilliance of another daythe arsenicgreen of the spruce the red and gold of the maples the yellow of the alders bathing in the shallows of the birches whose white limbs could be seen gleaming in the twilight of the thickets early too early the sun fell down behind the serrated forestedge of the western hill a ball of orange fire one evening delphin and herve followed by two other canoes paddled up to the landing new visitors had arrived dr mcleod who had long been an intimate of the wishart family and with him a buxom freshcomplexioned canadian woman a trained nurse whom he had brought from toronto  there in natures wilderness janet knew the supreme experience of women the agony the renewal and joy symbolic of nature herself when the child was bathed and dressed in the clothes augusta maturin herself had made for it she brought it into the room to the mother  its a daughter she announced  janet regarded the child wistfully i hoped it would be a boy she said he would have hada better chance but she raised her arms and the child was laid in the bed beside her  well see that she has a chance my dear augusta maturin replied as she kissed her  ten days went by dr mcleod lingered at lac du sablier and janet was still in bed even in this lifegiving air she did not seem to grow stronger sometimes when the child was sleeping in its basket on the sunny porch mrs maturin read to her but often when she was supposed to rest she lay gazing out of the open window into silver space listening to the mocking laughter of the loons watching the ducks flying across the sky or as evening drew on marking in the waters a steely angle that grew and grewthe wake of a beaver swimming homeward in the twilight in the cold nights the timbers cracked to the frost she heard the owls calling to one another from the fastnesses of the forest and thought of lifes inscrutable mystery then the child would be brought to her it was a strange unimagined happiness she knew when she felt it clutching at her breasts at her heart a happiness not unmixed with yearning with sadness as she pressed it to her why could it not remain there always to comfort her to be nearer her than any living thing reluctantly she gave it back to the nurse wistfully her eyes followed it  twice a week now delphin and herve made the journey to saint hubert and one evening after janet had watched them paddling across the little bay that separated the camp from the outlets mouth mrs maturin appeared with an envelope in her hand  ive got a letter from brooks insall janet she said with a welldisguised effort to speak naturally its not the first one hes sent me but i havent mentioned the others hes in sillistonand i wrote him about the daughter  yes said janet  wellhe wants to come up here to see you before we go away he asks me to telegraph your permission  oh no he mustnt mrs maturin  you dont care to see him  it isnt that id like to see him if things had been different but now that ive disappointed himhurt him i couldnt stand it i know its only his kindness  after a moment augusta maturin handed janet a sealed envelope she held in her hand  he asked me to give you this she said and left the room janet read it and let it fall on the bedspread where it was still lying when her friend returned and began tidying the room from the direction of the guides cabin on the point came the sounds of talk and laughter broken by snatches of habitant songs augusta maturin smiled she pretended not to notice the tears in janets eyes and strove to keep back her own  delphin and herve saw a moose in the decharge she explained of course it was a big one it always is theyre telling the doctor about it  mrs maturin said janet id like to talk to you i think i ought to tell you what mr insall says  yes my dear her friend replied a little faintly sitting down on the bed  he asks me to believe whative done makes no difference to him of course he doesnt put it in so many words but he says he doesnt care anything about conventions janet continued slowly what i told him when he asked me to marry him in silliston was a shock to him it was soso unexpected he went away to maine but as soon as he began to think it all over he wanted to come and tell me that he loved me in spite of it but he felt he couldnt under the circumstances that he had to wait untilnow although i didnt give him any explanation he wants me to know that he trusts me he understandsits because he says i am what i am he still wishes to marry me to take care of me and the child we could live in california at firsthes always been anxious to go there he says  well my dear augusta maturin forced herself to say at last  its so generousso like him janet exclaimed but of course i couldnt accept such a sacrifice even if she paused oh its made me so sad all summer to think that hes unhappy because of me  i know janet but you should realize as i told you in silliston that it isnt by any deliberate act of your own its just one of those things that occur in this world and that cant be foreseen or avoided augusta maturin spoke with an effort in spite of janets apparent calm she had never been more acutely aware of the girls inner suffering  i know said janet but its terrible to think that those things we unintentionally do perhaps because of faults we have previously committed should have the same effect as acts that are intentional  the world is very stupid all suffering i think is brought about by stupidity if we only could learn to look at ourselves as we are its a stupid unenlightened society that metes out most of our punishments and usually demands a senseless expiation augusta maturin waited and presently janet spoke again  ive been thinking all summer mrs maturin there was so much i wanted to talk about with you but i wanted to be sure of myself first and now since the baby came and i know im not going to get well i seem to see things much more clearly  why do you say youre not going to get well janet in this air and with the child to live for  i know it dr mcleod knows it or he wouldnt be staying here and youve both been too kind to tell me youve been so kind mrs maturini cant talk about it but im sure im going to die ive really known it ever since we left silliston somethings gone out of me the thing that drove me that made me want to livei cant express what i mean any other way perhaps its this child the new lifeperhaps ive just been broken i dont know you did your best to mend me and thats one thing that makes me sad and the thought of mr insalls another in some ways it would have been worse to livei couldnt have ruined his life and even if things had been different i hadnt come to love him in that wayits queer because hes such a wonderful person id like to live for the child if only i had the strength the will left in mebut thats gone and maybe i could save her fromwhat ive been through  augusta maturin took janets hand in hers  janet she said ive been a lonely woman as you know with nothing to look forward to ive always wanted a child since my little edith went i wanted you my dear i want your child your daughteras i want nothing else in the world i will take her i will try to bring her up in the light and brooks insall will help me   pg editors bookmarks     anger and revolt against a life so precarious and sordid    but when you get to a point where private affairs become a public menace    exorbitant price for joys otherwise more reasonably to be obtained    foreigners i never could see why the government lets em all come    hitherto he had held rigidly to that relativity    janet resented that pity    love is nothing but attraction between the sexes    mercifully however she had little leisure to reflect    perhaps she feared to break the charm of that memory    she resented being prayed for    struggled against her womans desire to give    tested the limits of janets ingenuity and powers of resistance    the seventh commandment was only relative    there had been something sorrowful in that kiss    too much reason in the world too little impulse and feeling
