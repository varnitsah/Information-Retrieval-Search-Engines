roost  to the editor of the knickerbocker  sir i have observed that as a man advances in life he is subject to a kind of plethora of the mind doubtless occasioned by the vast accumulation of wisdom and experience upon the brain hence he is apt to become narrative and admonitory that is to say fond of telling long stories and of doling out advice to the small profit and great annoyance of his friends as i have a great horror of becoming the oracle or more technically speaking the bore of the domestic circle and would much rather bestow my wisdom and tediousness upon the world at large i have always sought to ease off this surcharge of the intellect by means of my pen and hence have inflicted divers gossiping volumes upon the patience of the public i am tired however of writing volumes they do not afford exactly the relief i require there is too much preparation arrangement and parade in this set form of coming before the public i am growing too indolent and unambitious for any thing that requires labor or display i have thought therefore of securing to myself a snug corner in some periodical work where i might as it were loll at my ease in my elbowchair and chat sociably with the public as with an old friend on any chance subject that might pop into my brain  in looking around for this purpose upon the various excellent periodicals with which our country abounds my eye was struck by the title of your workthe knickerbocker my heart leaped at the sight diedrich knickerbocker sir was one of my earliest and most valued friends and the recollection of him is associated with some of the pleasantest scenes of my youthful days to explain this and to show how i came into possession of sundry of his posthumous works which i have from time to time given to the world permit me to relate a few particulars of our early intercourse i give them with the more confidence as i know the interest you take in that departed worthy whose name and effigy are stamped upon your titlepage and as they will be found important to the better understanding and relishing divers communications i may have to make to you  my first acquaintance with that great and good man for such i may venture to call him now that the lapse of some thirty years has shrouded his name with venerable antiquity and the popular voice has elevated him to the rank of the classic historians of yore my first acquaintance with him was formed on the banks of the hudson not far from the wizard region of sleepy hollow he had come there in the course of his researches among the dutch neighborhoods for materials for his immortal history for this purpose he was ransacking the archives of one of the most ancient and historical mansions in the country it was a lowly edifice built in the time of the dutch dynasty and stood on a green bank overshadowed by trees from which it peeped forth upon the great tappan zee so famous among early dutch navigators a bright pure spring welled up at the foot of the green bank a wild brook came babbling down a neighboring ravine and threw itself into a little woody cove in front of the mansion it was indeed as quiet and sheltered a nook as the heart of man could require in which to take refuge from the cares and troubles of the world and as such it had been chosen in old times by wolfert acker one of the privy councillors of the renowned peter stuyvesant  this worthy but illstarred man had led a weary and worried life throughout the stormy reign of the chivalric peter being one of those unlucky wights with whom the world is ever at variance and who are kept in a continual fume and fret by the wickedness of mankind at the time of the subjugation of the province by the english he retired hither in high dudgeon with the bitter determination to bury himself from the world and live here in peace and quietness for the remainder of his days in token of this fixed resolution he inscribed over his door the favorite dutch motto lust in rust pleasure in repose the mansion was thence called wolferts rustwolferts rest but in process of time the name was vitiated into wolferts roost probably from its quaint cockloft look or from its having a weathercock perched on every gable this name it continued to bear long after the unlucky wolfert was driven forth once more upon a wrangling world by the tongue of a termagant wife for it passed into a proverb through the neighborhood and has been handed down by tradition that the cock of the roost was the most henpecked bird in the country  this primitive and historical mansion has since passed through many changes and trials which it may be my lot hereafter to notice at the time of the sojourn of diedrich knickerbocker it was in possession of the gallant family of the van tassels who have figured so conspicuously in his writings what appears to have given it peculiar value in his eyes was the rich treasury of historical facts here secretly hoarded up like buried gold for it is said that wolfert acker when he retreated from new amsterdam carried off with him many of the records and journals of the province pertaining to the dutch dynasty swearing that they should never fall into the hands of the english these like the lost books of livy had baffled the research of former historians but these did i find the indefatigable diedrich diligently deciphering he was already a sage in years and experience i but an idle stripling yet he did not despise my youth and ignorance but took me kindly by the hand and led me gently into those paths of local and traditional lore which he was so fond of exploring i sat with him in his little chamber at the roost and watched the antiquarian patience and perseverance with which he deciphered those venerable dutch documents worse than herculanean manuscripts i sat with him by the spring at the foot of the green bank and listened to his heroic tales about the worthies of the olden time the paladins of new amsterdam i accompanied him in his legendary researches about tarrytown and singsing and explored with him the spellbound recesses of sleepy hollow i was present at many of his conferences with the good old dutch burghers and their wives from whom he derived many of those marvelous facts not laid down in books or records and which give such superior value and authenticity to his history over all others that have been written concerning the new netherlands  but let me check my proneness to dilate upon this favorite theme i may recur to it hereafter suffice it to say the intimacy thus formed continued for a considerable time and in company with the worthy diedrich i visited many of the places celebrated by his pen the currents of our lives at length diverged he remained at home to complete his mighty work while a vagrant fancy led me to wander about the world many many years elapsed before i returned to the parent soil in the interim the venerable historian of the new netherlands had been gathered to his fathers but his name had risen to renown his native city that city in which he so much delighted had decreed all manner of costly honors to his memory i found his effigy imprinted upon newyear cakes and devoured with eager relish by holiday urchins a great oysterhouse bore the name of knickerbocker hall and i narrowly escaped the pleasure of being run over by a knickerbocker omnibus  proud of having associated with a man who had achieved such greatness i now recalled our early intimacy with tenfold pleasure and sought to revisit the scenes we had trodden together the most important of these was the mansion of the van tassels the roost of the unfortunate wolfert time which changes all things is but slow in its operations upon a dutchmans dwelling i found the venerable and quaint little edifice much as i had seen it during the sojourn of diedrich there stood his elbowchair in the corner of the room he had occupied the oldfashioned dutch writingdesk at which he had pored over the chronicles of the manhattoes there was the old wooden chest with the archives left by wolfert acker many of which however had been fired off as wadding from the long duck gun of the van tassels the scene around the mansion was still the same the green bank the spring beside which i had listened to the legendary narratives of the historian the wild brook babbling down to the woody cove and the overshadowing locust trees half shutting out the prospect of the great tappan zee  as i looked round upon the scene my heart yearned at the recollection of my departed friend and i wistfully eyed the mansion which he had inhabited and which was fast mouldering to decay the thought struck me to arrest the desolating hand of time to rescue the historic pile from utter ruin and to make it the closing scene of my wanderings a quiet home where i might enjoy lust in rust for the remainder of my days it is true the fate of the unlucky wolfert passed across my mind but i consoled myself with the reflection that i was a bachelor and that i had no termagant wife to dispute the sovereignty of the roost with me  i have become possessor of the roost i have repaired and renovated it with religious care in the genuine dutch style and have adorned and illustrated it with sundry reliques of the glorious days of the new netherlands a venerable weathercock of portly dutch dimensions which once battled with the wind on the top of the stadthouse of new amsterdam in the time of peter stuyvesant now erects its crest on the gable end of my edifice a gilded horse in full gallop once the weathercock of the great vander heyden palace of albany now glitters in the sunshine and veers with every breeze on the peaked turret over my portal my sanctum sanctorum is the chamber once honored by the illustrious diedrich and it is from his elbowchair and his identical old dutch writingdesk that i pen this rambling epistle  here then have i set up my rest surrounded by the recollections of early days and the mementoes of the historian of the manhattoes with that glorious river before me which flows with such majesty through his works and which has ever been to me a river of delight  i thank god i was born on the banks of the hudson i think it an invaluable advantage to be born and brought up in the neighborhood of some grand and noble object in nature a river a lake or a mountain we make a friendship with it we in a manner ally ourselves to it for life it remains an object of our pride and affections a rallying point to call us home again after all our wanderings the things which we have learned in our childhood says an old writer grow up with our souls and unite themselves to it so it is with the scenes among which we have passed our early days they influence the whole course of our thoughts and feelings and i fancy i can trace much of what is good and pleasant in my own heterogeneous compound to my early companionship with this glorious river in the warmth of my youthful enthusiasm i used to clothe it with moral attributes and almost to give it a soul i admired its frank bold honest character its noble sincerity and perfect truth here was no specious smiling surface covering the dangerous sandbar or perfidious rock but a stream deep as it was broad and bearing with honorable faith the bark that trusted to its waves i gloried in its simple quiet majestic epic flow ever straight forward once indeed it turns aside for a moment forced from its course by opposing mountains but it struggles bravely through them and immediately resumes its straightforward march behold thought i an emblem of a good mans course through life ever simple open and direct or if overpowered by adverse circumstances he deviate into error it is but momentary he soon recovers his onward and honorable career and continues it to the end of his pilgrimage  excuse this rhapsody into which i have been betrayed by a revival of early feelings the hudson is in a manner my first and last love and after all my wanderings and seeming infidelities i return to it with a heartfelt preference over all the other rivers in the world i seem to catch new life as i bathe in its ample billows and inhale the pure breezes of its hills it is true the romance of youth is past that once spread illusions over every scene i can no longer picture an arcadia in every green valley nor a fairy land among the distant mountains nor a peerless beauty in every villa gleaming among the trees but though the illusions of youth have faded from the landscape the recollections of departed years and departed pleasures shed over it the mellow charm of evening sunshine  permit me then mr editor through the medium of your work to hold occasional discourse from my retreat with the busy world i have abandoned i have much to say about what i have seen heard felt and thought through the course of a varied and rambling life and some lucubrations that have long been encumbering my portfolio together with divers reminiscences of the venerable historian of the new netherlands that may not be unacceptable to those who have taken an interest in his writings and are desirous of any thing that may cast a light back upon our early history let your readers rest assured of one thing that though retired from the world i am not disgusted with it and that if in my communings with it i do not prove very wise i trust i shall at least prove very goodnatured  which is all at present from  yours etc  geoffrey crayon                                       to the editor of the knickerbocker  worthy sir in a preceding communication i have given you some brief notice of wolferts roost the mansion where i first had the good fortune to become acquainted with the venerable historian of the new netherlands as this ancient edifice is likely to be the place whence i shall date many of my lucubrations and as it is really a very remarkable little pile intimately connected with all the great epochs of our local and national history i have thought it but right to give some farther particulars concerning it fortunately in rummaging a ponderous dutch chest of drawers which serves as the archives of the roost and in which are preserved many inedited manuscripts of mr knickerbocker together with the precious records of newamsterdam brought hither by wolfert acker at the downfall of the dutch dynasty as has been already mentioned i found in one corner among dried pumpkinseeds bunches of thyme and pennyroyal and crumbs of newyear cakes a manuscript carefully wrapped up in the fragment of an old parchment deed but much blotted and the ink grown foxy by time which on inspection i discovered to be a faithful chronicle of the roost the handwriting and certain internal evidences leave no doubt in my mind that it is a genuine production of the venerable historian of the newnetherlands written very probably during his residence at the roost in gratitude for the hospitality of its proprietor as such i submit it for publication as the entire chronicle is too long for the pages of your magazine and as it contains many minute particulars which might prove tedious to the general reader i have abbreviated and occasionally omitted some of its details but may hereafter furnish them separately should they seem to be required by the curiosity of an enlightened and documenthunting public respectfully yours geoffrey crayon                                       a chronicle of wolferts roost  found among the papers of the late diedrich knickerbocker  about fiveandtwenty miles from the ancient and renowned city of manhattan formerly called newamsterdam and vulgarly called newyork on the eastern bank of that expansion of the hudson known among dutch mariners of yore as the tappan zee being in fact the great mediterranean sea of the newnetherlands stands a little oldfashioned stone mansion all made up of gableends and as full of angles and corners as an old cocked hat though but of small dimensions yet like many small people it is of mighty spirit and values itself greatly on its antiquity being one of the oldest edifices for its size in the whole country it claims to be an ancient seat of empire i may rather say an empire in itself and like all empires great and small has had its grand historical epochs in speaking of this doughty and valorous little pile i shall call it by its usual appellation of the roost though that is a name given to it in modern days since it became the abode of the white man  its origin in truth dates far back in that remote region commonly called the fabulous age in which vulgar fact becomes mystified and tinted up with delectable fiction the eastern shore of the tappan sea was inhabited in those days by an unsophisticated race existing in all the simplicity of nature that is to say they lived by hunting and fishing and recreated themselves occasionally with a little tomahawking and scalping each stream that flows down from the hills into the hudson had its petty sachem who ruled over a handsbreadth of forest on either side and had his seat of government at its mouth the chieftain who ruled at the roost was not merely a great warrior but a medicineman or prophet or conjurer for they all mean the same thing in indian parlance of his fighting propensities evidences still remain in various arrowheads of flint and stone battleaxes occasionally digged up about the roost of his wizard powers we have a token in a spring which wells up at the foot of the bank on the very margin of the river which it is said was gifted by him with rejuvenating powers something like the renowned fountain of youth in the floridas so anxiously but vainly sought after by the veteran ponce de leon this story however is stoutly contradicted by an old dutch matteroffact tradition which declares that the spring in question was smuggled over from holland in a churn by femmetie van slocum wife of goosen garret van slocum one of the first settlers and that she took it up by night unknown to her husband from beside their farmhouse near rotterdam being sure she should find no water equal to it in the new countryand she was right  the wizard sachem had a great passion for discussing territorial questions and settling boundary lines this kept him in continual feud with the neighboring sachems each of whom stood up stoutly for his handbreadth of territory so that there is not a petty stream nor ragged hill in the neighborhood that has not been the subject of long talks and hard battles the sachem however as has been observed was a medicineman as well as warrior and vindicated his claims by arts as well as arms so that by dint of a little hard fighting here and hocuspocus there he managed to extend his boundaryline from field to field and stream to stream until he found himself in legitimate possession of that region of hills and valleys bright fountains and limpid brooks locked in by the mazy windings of the neperan and the pocantico footnote as every one may not recognize these boundaries by their original indian names it may be well to observe that the neperan is that beautiful stream vulgarly called the sawmill river which after winding gracefully for many miles through a lovely valley shrouded by groves and dotted by dutch farmhouses empties itself into the hudson at the ancient drop of yonkers the pocantico is that hitherto nameless brook that rising among woody hills winds in many a wizard maze through the sequestered banks of sleepy hollow we owe it to the indefatigable researches of mr knickerbocker that those beautiful streams are rescued from modern commonplace and reinvested with their ancient indian names the correctness of the venerable historian may be ascertained by reference to the records of the original indian grants to the herr frederick philipsen preserved in the county clerks office at white plains  this lastmentioned stream or rather the valley through which it flows was the most difficult of all his acquisitions it lay half way to the stronghold of the redoubtable sachem of singsing and was claimed by him as an integral part of his domains many were the sharp conflicts between the rival chieftains for the sovereignty of this valley and many the ambuscades surprisals and deadly onslaughts that took place among its fastnesses of which it grieves me much that i cannot furnish the details for the gratification of those gentle but bloodyminded readers of both sexes who delight in the romance of the tomahawk and scalpingknife suffice it to say that the wizard chieftain was at length victorious though his victory is attributed in indian tradition to a great medicine or charm by which he laid the sachem of singsing and his warriors asleep among the rocks and recesses of the valley where they remain asleep to the present day with their bows and warclubs beside them this was the origin of that potent and drowsy spell which still prevails over the valley of the pocantico and which has gained it the wellmerited appellation of sleepy hollow often in secluded and quiet parts of that valley where the stream is overhung by dark woods and rocks the ploughman on some calm and sunny day as he shouts to his oxen is surprised at hearing faint shouts from the hillsides in reply being it is said the spellbound warriors who half start from their rocky couches and grasp their weapons but sink to sleep again  the conquest of the pocantico was the last triumph of the wizard sachem notwithstanding all his medicine and charms he fell in battle in attempting to extend his boundary line to the east so as to take in the little wild valley of the sprain and his grave is still shown near the banks of that pastoral stream he left however a great empire to his successors extending along the tappan zee from yonkers quite to sleepy hollow all which delectable region if every one had his right would still acknowledge allegiance to the lord of the roostwhoever he might be footnote in recording the contest for the sovereignty of sleepy hollow i have called one sachem by the modern name of his castle or stronghold viz singsing this i would observe for the sake of historical exactness is a corruption of the old indian name osinsing or rather osinsong that is to say a place where any thing may be had for a songa great recommendation for a market town the modern and melodious alteration of the name to singsing is said to have been made in compliment to an eminent methodist singingmaster who first introduced into the neighborhood the art of singing through the nose d k  the wizard sachem was succeeded by a line of chiefs of whom nothing remarkable remains on record the last who makes any figure in history is the one who ruled here at the time of the discovery of the country by the white man this sachem is said to have been a renowned trencherman who maintained almost as potent a sway by dint of good feeding as his warlike predecessor had done by hard fighting he diligently cultivated the growth of oysters along the aquatic borders of his territories and founded those great oysterbeds which yet exist along the shores of the tappan zee did any dispute occur between him and a neighboring sachem he invited him and all his principal sages and fightingmen to a solemn banquet and seldom failed of feeding them into terms enormous heaps of oystershells which encumber the lofty banks of the river remain as monuments of his gastronomical victories and have been occasionally adduced through mistake by amateur geologists from town as additional proofs of the deluge modern investigators who are making such indefatigable researches into our early history have even affirmed that this sachem was the very individual on whom master hendrick hudson and his mate robert juet made that sage and astounding experiment so gravely recorded by the latter in his narrative of the voyage our master and his mate determined to try some of the cheefe men of the country whether they had any treacherie in them so they took them down into the cabin and gave them so much wine and aqua vitae that they were all very merrie one of them had his wife with him which sate so modestly as any of our countrywomen would do in a strange place in the end one of them was drunke and that was strange to them for they could not tell how to take it footnote see juets journal purchas pilgrim  how far master hendrick hudson and his worthy mate carried their experiment with the sachems wife is not recorded neither does the curious robert juet make any mention of the afterconsequences of this grand moral test tradition however affirms that the sachem on landing gave his modest spouse a hearty ribroasting according to the connubial discipline of the aboriginals it farther affirms that he remained a hard drinker to the day of his death trading away all his lands acre by acre for aqua vitae by which means the roost and all its domains from yonkers to sleepy hollow came in the regular course of trade and by right of purchase into the possession of the dutchmen  never has a territorial right in these new countries been more legitimately and tradefully established yet i grieve to say the worthy government of the new netherlands was not suffered to enjoy this grand acquisition unmolested for in the year 1654 the local yankees of connecticutthose swapping bargaining squatting enemies of the manhattoesmade a daring inroad into this neighborhood and founded a colony called westchester or as the ancient dutch records term it vest dorp in the right of one thomas pell who pretended to have purchased the whole surrounding country of the indians and stood ready to argue their claims before any tribunal of christendom  this happened during the chivalrous reign of peter stuyvesant and it roused the ire of that gunpowder old hero who without waiting to discuss claims and titles pounced at once upon the nest of nefarious squatters carried off twentyfive of them in chains to the manhattoes nor did he stay his hand nor give rest to his wooden leg until he had driven every yankee back into the bounds of connecticut or obliged him to acknowledge allegiance to their high mightinesses he then established certain outposts far in the indian country to keep an eye over these debateable lands one of these borderholds was the roost being accessible from new amsterdam by water and easily kept supplied the yankees however had too great a hankering after this delectable region to give it up entirely some remained and swore allegiance to the manhattoes but while they kept this open semblance of fealty they went to work secretly and vigorously to intermarry and multiply and by these nefarious means artfully propagated themselves into possession of a wide tract of those open arable parts of westchester county lying along the sound where their descendants may be found at the present day while the mountainous regions along the hudson with the valleys of the neperan and the pocantico are tenaciously held by the lineal descendants of the copperheads                                       the chronicle of the venerable diedrich here goes on to relate how that shortly after the abovementioned events the whole province of the new netherlands was subjugated by the british how that wolfert acker one of the wrangling councillors of peter stuyvesant retired in dudgeon to this fastness in the wilderness determining to enjoy lust in rust for the remainder of his days whence the place first received its name of wolferts roost as these and sundry other matters have been laid before the public in a preceding article i shall pass them over and resume the chronicle where it treats of matters not hitherto recorded  like many men who retire from a worrying world says diedrich knickerbocker to enjoy quiet in the country wolfert acker soon found himself up to the ears in trouble he had a termagant wife at home and there was what is profanely called the deuce to pay abroad the recent irruption of the yankees into the bounds of the new netherlands had left behind it a doleful pestilence such as is apt to follow the steps of invading armies this was the deadly plague of witchcraft which had long been prevalent to the eastward the malady broke out at vest dorp and threatened to spread throughout the country the dutch burghers along the hudson from yonkers to sleepy hollow hastened to nail horseshoes to their doors which have ever been found of sovereign virtue to repel this awful visitation this is the origin of the horseshoes which may still be seen nailed to the doors of barns and farmhouses in various parts of this sage and soberthoughted region  the evil however bore hard upon the roost partly perhaps from its having in old times been subject to supernatural influences during the sway of the wizard sachem but it has always in fact been considered a fated mansion the unlucky wolfert had no rest day nor night when the weather was quiet all over the country the wind would howl and whistle round his roof witches would ride and whirl upon his weathercocks and scream down his chimneys his cows gave bloody milk and his horses broke bounds and scampered into the woods there were not wanting evil tongues to whisper that wolferts termagant wife had some tampering with the enemy and that she even attended a witches sabbath in sleepy hollow nay a neighbor who lived hard by declared that he saw her harnessing a rampant broomstick and about to ride to the meeting though others presume it was merely flourished in the course of one of her curtain lectures to give energy and emphasis to a period certain it is that wolfert acker nailed a horseshoe to the front door during one of her nocturnal excursions to prevent her return but as she reentered the house without any difficulty it is probable she was not so much of a witch as she was represented footnote historical notethe annexed extracts from the early colonial records relate to the irruption of witchcraft into westchester county as mentioned in the chronicle  july 7 1670katharine harryson accused of witchcraft on complaint of thomas hunt and edward waters in behalf of the town who pray that she may be driven from the town of westchester the woman appears before the council she was a native of england and had lived a year in weathersfield connecticut where she had been tried for witchcraft found guilty by the jury acquitted by the bench and released out of prison upon condition she would remove affair adjourned  august 24affair taken up again when being heard at large it was referred to the general court of assize woman ordered to give security for good behavior etc  in another place is the following entry  order given for katharine harryson charged with witchcraft to leave westchester as the inhabitants are uneasy at her residing there and she is ordered to go off  after the time of wolfert acker a long interval elapses about which but little is known it is hoped however that the antiquarian researches so diligently making in every part of this new country may yet throw some light upon what may be termed the dark ages of the roost  the next period at which we find this venerable and eventful pile rising to importance and resuming its old belligerent character is during the revolutionary war it was at that time owned by jacob van tassel or van texel as the name was originally spelled after the place in holland which gave birth to this heroic line he was strongbuilt longlimbed and as stout in soul as in body a fit successor to the warrior sachem of yore and like him delighting in extravagant enterprises and hardy deeds of arms but before i enter upon the exploits of this worthy cock of the boost it is fitting i should throw some light upon the state of the mansion and of the surrounding country at the time  the situation of the roost is in the very heart of what was the debateable ground between the american and british lines during the war the british held possession of the city of new york and the island of manhattan on which it stands the americans drew up toward the highlands holding their headquarters at peekskill the intervening country from croton river to spiting devil creek was the debateable land subject to be harried by friend and foe like the scottish borders of yore it is a rugged country with a line of rocky hills extending through it like a back bone sending ribs on either side but among these rude hills are beautiful winding valleys like those watered by the pocantico and the neperan in the fastnesses of these hills and along these valleys exist a race of hardheaded hardhanded stouthearted dutchmen descendants of the primitive nederlanders most of these were strong whigs throughout the war and have ever remained obstinately attached to the soil and neither to be fought nor bought out of their paternal acres others were tories and adherents to the old kingly rule some of whom took refuge within the british lines joined the royal bands of refugees a name odious to the american ear and occasionally returned to harass their ancient neighbors  in a little while this debateable land was overrun by predatory bands from either side sacking henroosts plundering farmhouses and driving off cattle hence arose those two great orders of border chivalry the skinners and the cowboys famous in the heroic annals of westchester county the former fought or rather marauded under the american the latter under the british banner but both in the hurry of their military ardor were apt to err on the safe side and rob friend as well as foe neither of them stopped to ask the politics of horse or cow which they drove into captivity nor when they wrung the neck of a rooster did they trouble their heads to ascertain whether he were crowing for congress or king george  while this marauding system prevailed on shore the great tappan sea which washes this belligerent region was domineered over by british frigates and other vessels of war anchored here and there to keep an eye upon the river and maintain a communication between the various military posts stout galleys also armed with eighteenpounders and navigated with sails and oars cruised about like hawks ready to pounce upon their prey  all these were eyed with bitter hostility by the dutch yeomanry along shore who were indignant at seeing their great mediterranean ploughed by hostile prows and would occasionally throw up a mud breastwork on a point or promontory mount an old iron fieldpiece and fire away at the enemy though the greatest harm was apt to happen to themselves from the bursting of their ordnance nay there was scarce a dutchman along the river that would hesitate to fire with his long duck gun at any british cruiser that came within reach as he had been accustomed to fire at waterfowl  i have been thus particular in my account of the times and neighborhood that the reader might the more readily comprehend the surrounding dangers in this the heroic age of the roost  it was commanded at the time as i have already observed by the stout jacob van tassel as i wish to be extremely accurate in this part of my chronicle i beg that this jacob van tassel of the roost may not be confounded with another jacob van tassel commonly known in border story by the name of clumpfooted jake a noted tory and one of the refugee band of spiting devil on the contrary he of the roost was a patriot of the first water and if we may take his own word for granted a thorn in the side of the enemy as the roost from its lonely situation on the waters edge might be liable to attack he took measures for defence on a row of hooks above his fireplace reposed his great piece of ordnance ready charged and primed for action this was a duck or rather goosegun of unparalleled longitude with which it was said he could kill a wild goose though halfway across the tappan sea indeed there are as many wonders told of this renowned gun as of the enchanted weapons of the heroes of classic story  in different parts of the stone walls of his mansion he had made loopholes through which he might fire upon an assailant his wife was stouthearted as himself and could load as fast as he could fire and then he had an ancient and redoubtable sister nochie van wurmer a match as he said for the stoutest man in the country thus garrisoned the little roost was fit to stand a siege and jacob van tassel was the man to defend it to the last charge of powder  he was as i have already hinted of pugnacious propensities and not content with being a patriot at home and fighting for the security of his own fireside he extended his thoughts abroad and entered into a confederacy with certain of the bold hardriding lads of tarrytown petticoat lane and sleepy hollow who formed a kind of holy brotherhood scouring the country to clear it of skinner and cowboy and all other border vermin the roost was one of their rallying points did a band of marauders from manhattan island come sweeping through the neighborhood and driving off cattle the stout jacob and his compeers were soon clattering at their heels and fortunate did the rogues esteem themselves if they could but get a part of their booty across the lines or escape themselves without a rough handling should the mosstroopers succeed in passing with their cavalcade with thundering tramp and dusty whirlwind across kingsbridge the holy brotherhood of the roost would rein up at that perilous pass and wheeling about would indemnify themselves by foraging the refugee region of morrisania  when at home at the roost the stout jacob was not idle but was prone to carry on a petty warfare of his own for his private recreation and refreshment did he ever chance to espy from his lookout place a hostile ship or galley anchored or becalmed near shore he would take down his long goosegun from the hooks over the fireplace sally out alone and lurk along shore dodging behind rocks and trees and watching for hours together like a veteran mouser intent on a rathole so sure as a boat put off for shore and came within shot bang went the great goosegun a shower of slugs and buckshot whistled about the ears of the enemy and before the boat could reach the shore jacob had scuttled up some woody ravine and left no trace behind about this time the roost experienced a vast accession of warlike importance in being made one of the stations of the waterguard this was a kind of aquatic corps of observation composed of long sharp canoeshaped boats technically called whaleboats that lay lightly on the water and could be rowed with great rapidity they were manned by resolute fellows skilled at pulling an oar or handling a musket these lurked about in nooks and bays and behind those long promontories which run out into the tappan sea keeping a lookout to give notice of the approach or movements of hostile ships they roved about in pairs sometimes at night with muffled oars gliding like spectres about frigates and guardships riding at anchor cutting off any boats that made for shore and keeping the enemy in constant uneasiness these mosquitocruisers generally kept aloof by day so that their harboring places might not be discovered but would pull quietly along under shadow of the shore at night to take up their quarters at the roost hither at such time would also repair the hardriding lads of the hills to hold secret councils of war with the ocean chivalry and in these nocturnal meetings were concerted many of those daring forays by land and water that resounded throughout the border                                       the chronicle here goes on to recount divers wonderful stories of the wars of the roost from which it would seem that this little warrior nest carried the terror of its arms into every sea from spiting devil creek to antonys nose that it even bearded the stout island of manhattan invading it at night penetrating to its centre and burning down the famous delancey house the conflagration of which makes such a blaze in revolutionary history nay more in their extravagant daring these cocks of the roost meditated a nocturnal descent upon new york itself to swoop upon the british commanders howe and clinton by surprise bear them off captive and perhaps put a triumphant close to the war  all these and many similar exploits are recorded by the worthy diedrich with his usual minuteness and enthusiasm whenever the deeds in arms of his kindred dutchmen are in question but though most of these warlike stories rest upon the best of all authority that of the warriors themselves and though many of them are still current among the revolutionary patriarchs of this heroic neighborhood yet i dare not expose them to the incredulity of a tamer and less chivalric age suffice it to say the frequent gatherings at the roost and the hardy projects set on foot there at length drew on it the fiery indignation of the enemy and this was quickened by the conduct of the stout jacob van tassel with whose valorous achievements we resume the course of the chronicle                                       this doughty dutchman continues the sage diedrich knickerbocker was not content with taking a share in all the magnanimous enterprises concocted at the roost but still continued his petty warfare along shore a series of exploits at length raised his confidence in his prowess to such a height that he began to think himself and his goosegun a match for any thing unluckily in the course of one of his prowlings he descried a british transport aground not far from shore with her stern swung toward the land within pointblank shot the temptation was too great to be resisted bang as usual went the great goosegun shivering the cabin windows and driving all hands forward bang bang the shots were repeated the reports brought several sharpshooters of the neighborhood to the spot before the transport could bring a gun to bear or land a boat to take revenge she was soundly peppered and the coast evacuated this was the last of jacobs triumphs he fared like some heroic spider that has unwittingly ensnared a hornet to his immortal glory perhaps but to the utter ruin of his web  it was not long after this during the absence of jacob van tassel on one of his forays and when no one was in garrison but his stouthearted spouse his redoubtable sister nochie van wurmer and a strapping negro wench called dinah that an armed vessel came to anchor off the roost and a boat full of men pulled to shore the garrison flew to arms that is to say to mops broomsticks shovels tongs and all kinds of domestic weapons for unluckily the great piece of ordnance the goosegun was absent with its owner above all a vigorous defence was made with that most potent of female weapons the tongue never did invaded henroost make a more vociferous outcry it was all in vain the house was sacked and plundered fire was set to each corner and in a few moments its blaze shed a baleful light far over the tappan sea the invaders then pounced upon the blooming laney van tassel the beauty of the roost and endeavored to bear her off to the boat but here was the real tug of war the mother the aunt and the strapping negro wench all flew to the rescue the struggle continued down to the very waters edge when a voice from the armed vessel at anchor ordered the spoilers to let go their hold they relinquished their prize jumped into their boats and pulled off and the heroine of the roost escaped with a mere rumpling of the feathers  the fear of tiring my readers who may not take such an interest as myself in these heroic themes induces me to close here my extracts from this precious chronicle of the venerable diedrich suffice it briefly to say that shortly after the catastrophe of the roost jacob van tassel in the course of one of his forays fell into the hands of the british was sent prisoner to new york and was detained in captivity for the greater part of the war in the mean time the roost remained a melancholy ruin its stone walls and brick chimneys alone standing blackened by fire and the resort of bats and owlets it was not until the return of peace when this belligerent neighborhood once more resumed its quiet agricultural pursuits that the stout jacob sought the scene of his triumphs and disasters rebuilt the roost and reared again on high its glittering weathercocks  does any one want further particulars of the fortunes of this eventful little pile let him go to the fountainhead and drink deep of historic truth reader the stout jacob van tassel still lives a venerable grayheaded patriarch of the revolution now in his ninetyfifth year he sits by his fireside in the ancient city of the manhattoes and passes the long winter evenings surrounded by his children and grandchildren and greatgrandchildren all listening to his tales of the border wars and the heroic days of the roost his great goosegun too is still in existence having been preserved for many years in a hollow tree and passed from hand to hand among the dutch burghers as a precious relique of the revolution it is now actually in possession of a contemporary of the stout jacob one almost his equal in years who treasures it up at his house in the bowerie of newamsterdam hard by the ancient rural retreat of the chivalric peter stuyvesant i am not without hopes of one day seeing this formidable piece of ordinance restored to its proper station in the arsenal of the roost before closing this historic document i cannot but advert to certain notions and traditions concerning the venerable pile in question oldtime edifices are apt to gather odd fancies and superstitions about them as they do moss and weatherstains and this is in a neighborhood a little given to oldfashioned notions and who look upon the roost as somewhat of a fated mansion a lonely rambling downhill lane leads to it overhung with trees with a wild brook dashing along and crossing and recrossing it this lane i found some of the good people of the neighborhood shy of treading at night why i could not for a long time ascertain until i learned that one or two of the rovers of the tappan sea shot by the stout jacob during the war had been buried hereabout in unconsecrated ground  another local superstition is of a less gloomy kind and one which i confess i am somewhat disposed to cherish the tappan sea in front of the roost is about three miles wide bordered by a lofty line of waving and rocky hills often in the still twilight of a summer evening when the sea is like glass with the opposite hills throwing their purple shadows half across it a low sound is heard as of the steady vigorous pull of oars far out in the middle of the stream though not a boat is to be descried this i should have been apt to ascribe to some boat rowed along under the shadows of the western shore for sounds are conveyed to a great distance by water at such quiet hours and i can distinctly hear the baying of the watchdogs at night from the farms on the sides of the opposite mountains the ancient traditionists of the neighborhood however religiously ascribed these sounds to a judgment upon one rumbout van dam of spiting devil who danced and drank late one saturday night at a dutch quilting frolic at kakiat and set off alone for home in his boat on the verge of sunday morning swearing he would not land till he reached spiting devil if it took him a month of sundays he was never seen afterward but is often heard plying his oars across the tappan sea a flying dutchman on a small scale suited to the size of his cruisingground being doomed to ply between kakiat and spiting devil till the day of judgment but never to reach the land  there is one room in the mansion which almost overhangs the river and is reputed to be haunted by the ghost of a young lady who died of love and green apples i have been awakened at night by the sound of oars and the tinkling of guitars beneath the window and seeing a boat loitering in the moonlight have been tempted to believe it the flying dutchman of spiting devil and to try whether a silver bullet might not put an end to his unhappy cruisings but happening to recollect that there was a living young lady in the haunted room who might be terrified by the report of firearms i have refrained from pulling trigger  as to the enchanted fountain said to have been gifted by the wizard sachem with supernatural powers it still wells up at the foot of the bank on the margin of the river and goes by the name of the indian spring but i have my doubts as to its rejuvenating powers for though i have drank oft and copiously of it i cannot boast that i find myself growing younger  geoffrey crayon                                       sleepy hollow  by geoffrey crayon gent  having pitched my tent probably for the remainder of my days in the neighborhood of sleepy hollow i am tempted to give some few particulars concerning that spellbound region especially as it has risen to historic importance under the pen of my revered friend and master the sage historian of the new netherlands beside i find the very existence of the place has been held in question by many who judging from its odd name and from the odd stories current among the vulgar concerning it have rashly deemed the whole to be a fanciful creation like the lubber land of mariners i must confess there is some apparent cause for doubt in consequence of the coloring given by the worthy diedrich to his descriptions of the hollow who in this instance has departed a little from his usually sober if not severe style beguiled very probably by his predilection for the haunts of his youth and by a certain lurking taint of romance whenever any thing connected with the dutch was to be described i shall endeavor to make up for this amiable error on the part of my venerable and venerated friend by presenting the reader with a more precise and statistical account of the hollow though i am not sure that i shall not be prone to lapse in the end into the very error i am speaking of so potent is the witchery of the theme  i believe it was the very peculiarity of its name and the idea of something mystic and dreamy connected with it that first led me in my boyish ramblings into sleepy hollow the character of the valley seemed to answer to the name the slumber of past ages apparently reigned over it it had not awakened to the stir of improvement which had put all the rest of the world in a bustle here reigned good old longforgotten fashions the men were in homespun garbs evidently the product of their own farms and the manufacture of their own wives the women were in primitive short gowns and petticoats with the venerable sunbonnets of holland origin the lower part of the valley was cut up into small farms each consisting of a little meadow and cornfield an orchard of sprawling gnarled appletrees and a garden where the rose the marigold and the hollyhock were permitted to skirt the domains of the capacious cabbage the aspiring pea and the portly pumpkin each had its prolific little mansion teeming with children with an old hat nailed against the wall for the housekeeping wren a motherly hen under a coop on the grassplot clucking to keep around her a brood of vagrant chickens a cool stone well with the mosscovered bucket suspended to the long balancingpole according to the antediluvian idea of hydraulics and its spinningwheel humming within doors the patriarchal music of home manufacture  the hollow at that time was inhabited by families which had existed there from the earliest times and which by frequent intermarriage had become so interwoven as to make a kind of natural commonwealth as the families had grown larger the farms had grown smaller every new generation requiring a new subdivision and few thinking of swarming from the native hive in this way that happy golden mean had been produced so much extolled by the poets in which there was no gold and very little silver one thing which doubtless contributed to keep up this amiable mean was a general repugnance to sordid labor the sage inhabitants of sleepy hollow had read in their bible which was the only book they studied that labor was originally inflicted upon man as a punishment of sin they regarded it therefore with pious abhorrence and never humiliated themselves to it but in cases of extremity there seemed in fact to be a league and covenant against it throughout the hollow as against a common enemy was any one compelled by dire necessity to repair his house mend his fences build a barn or get in a harvest he considered it a great evil that entitled him to call in the assistance or his friend he accordingly proclaimed a bee or rustic gathering whereupon all his neighbors hurried to his aid like faithful allies attacked the task with the desperate energy of lazy men eager to overcome a job and when it was accomplished fell to eating and drinking fiddling and dancing for very joy that so great an amount of labor had been vanquished with so little sweating of the brow  yet let it not be supposed that this worthy community was without its periods of arduous activity let but a flock of wild pigeons fly across the valley and all sleepy hollow was wide awake in an instant the pigeon season had arrived every gun and net was forthwith in requisition the flail was thrown down on the barn floor the spade rusted in the garden the plough stood idle in the furrow every one was to the hillside and stubblefield at daybreak to shoot or entrap the pigeons in their periodical migrations  so likewise let but the word be given that the shad were ascending the hudson and the worthies of the hollow were to be seen launched in boats upon the river setting great stakes and stretching their nets like gigantic spiderwebs half across the stream to the great annoyance of navigators such are the wise provisions of nature by which she equalizes rural affairs a laggard at the plough is often extremely industrious with the fowlingpiece and fishingnet and whenever a man is an indifferent farmer he is apt to be a firstrate sportsman for catching shad and wild pigeons there were none throughout the country to compare with the lads of sleepy hollow  as i have observed it was the dreamy nature of the name that first beguiled me in the holiday rovings of boyhood into this sequestered region i shunned however the populous parts of the hollow and sought its retired haunts far in the foldings of the hills where the pocantico winds its wizard stream sometimes silently and darkly through solemn woodlands sometimes sparkling between grassy borders in fresh green meadows sometimes stealing along the feet of rugged heights under the balancing sprays of beech and chestnut trees a thousand crystal springs with which this neighborhood abounds sent down from the hillsides their whimpering rills as if to pay tribute to the pocantico in this stream i first essayed my unskilful hand at angling i loved to loiter along it with rod in hand watching my float as it whirled amid the eddies or drifted into dark holes under twisted roots and sunken logs where the largest fish are apt to lurk i delighted to follow it into the brown accesses of the woods to throw by my fishinggear and sit upon rocks beneath towering oaks and clambering grapevines bathe my feet in the cool current and listen to the summer breeze playing among the treetops my boyish fancy clothed all nature around me with ideal charms and peopled it with the fairy beings i had read of in poetry and fable here it was i gave full scope to my incipient habit of day dreaming and to a certain propensity to weave up and tint sober realities with my own whims and imaginings which has sometimes made life a little too much like an arabian tale to me and this workingday world rather like a region of romance  the great gatheringplace of sleepy hollow in those days was the church it stood outside of the hollow near the great highway on a green bank shaded by trees with the pocantico sweeping round it and emptying itself into a spacious millpond at that time the sleepy hollow church was the only place of worship for a wide neighborhood it was a venerable edifice partly of stone and partly of brick the latter having been brought from holland in the early days of the province before the arts in the new netherlands could aspire to such a fabrication on a stone above the porch were inscribed the names of the founders frederick filipsen a mighty patroon of the olden time who reigned over a wide extent of this neighborhood and held his seat of power at yonkers and his wife katrina van courtlandt of the no less potent line of the van courtlandts of croton who lorded it over a great part of the highlands  the capacious pulpit with its widespreading soundingboard were likewise early importations from holland as also the communiontable of massive form and curious fabric the same might be said of a weathercock perched on top of the belfry and which was considered orthodox in all windy matters until a small pragmatical rival was set up on the other end of the church above the chancel this latter bore and still bears the initials of frederick filipsen and assumed great airs in consequence the usual contradiction ensued that always exists among church weathercocks which can never be brought to agree as to the point from which the wind blows having doubtless acquired from their position the christian propensity to schism and controversy  behind the church and sloping up a gentle acclivity was its capacious buryingground in which slept the earliest fathers of this rural neighborhood here were tombstones of the rudest sculpture on which were inscribed in dutch the names and virtues of many of the first settlers with their portraitures curiously carved in similitude of cherubs long rows of gravestones side by side of similar names but various dates showed that generation after generation of the same families had followed each other and been garnered together in this last gatheringplace of kindred  let me speak of this quiet graveyard with all due reverence for i owe it amends for the heedlessness of my boyish days i blush to acknowledge the thoughtless frolic with which in company with other whipsters i have sported within its sacred bounds during the intervals of worship chasing butterflies plucking wild flowers or vying with each other who could leap over the tallest tombstones until checked by the stern voice of the sexton  the congregation was in those days of a really rural character city fashions were as yet unknown or unregarded by the country people of the neighborhood steamboats had not as yet confounded town with country a weekly marketboat from tarry town the farmers daughter navigated by the worthy gabriel requa was the only communication between all these parts and the metropolis a rustic belle in those days considered a visit to the city in much the same light as one of our modern fashionable ladies regards a visit to europe an event that may possibly take place once in the course of a lifetime but to be hoped for rather than expected hence the array of the congregation was chiefly after the primitive fashions existing in sleepy hollow or if by chance there was a departure from the dutch sunbonnet or the apparition of a bright gown of flowered calico it caused quite a sensation throughout the church as the dominie generally preached by the hour a bucket of water was providently placed on a bench near the door in summer with a tin cup beside it for the solace of those who might be athirst either from the heat of the weather or the drouth of the sermon  around the pulpit and behind the communiontable sat the elders of the church reverend grayheaded leathernvisaged men whom i regarded with awe as so many apostles they were stern in their sanctity kept a vigilant eye upon my giggling companions and myself and shook a rebuking finger at any boyish device to relieve the tediousness of compulsory devotion vain however were all their efforts at vigilance scarcely had the preacher held forth for half an hour on one of his interminable sermons than it seemed as if the drowsy influence of sleepy hollow breathed into the place one by one the congregation sank into slumber the sanctified elders leaned back in their pews spreading their handkerchiefs over their faces as if to keep off the flies while the locusts in the neighboring trees would spin out their sultry summer notes as if in imitation of the sleepprovoking tones of the dominie  i have thus endeavored to give an idea of sleepy hollow and its church as i recollect them to have been in the days of my boyhood it was in my stripling days when a few years had passed over my head that i revisited them in company with the venerable diedrich i shall never forget the antiquarian reverence with which that sage and excellent man contemplated the church it seemed as if all his pious enthusiasm for the ancient dutch dynasty swelled within his bosom at the sight the tears stood in his eyes as he regarded the pulpit and the communiontable even the very bricks that had come from the mother country seemed to touch a filial chord within his bosom he almost bowed in deference to the stone above the porch containing the names of frederick filipsen and katrina van courtlandt regarding it as the linking together of those patronymic names once so famous along the banks of the hudson or rather as a keystone binding that mighty dutch family connexion of yore one foot of which rested on yonkers and the other on the groton nor did he forbear to notice with admiration the windy contest which had been carried on since time immemorial and with real dutch perseverance between the two weathercocks though i could easily perceive he coincided with the one which had come from holland  together we paced the ample churchyard with deep veneration would he turn down the weeds and brambles that obscured the modest brown gravestones half sunk in earth on which were recorded in dutch the names of the patriarchs of ancient days the ackers the van tassels and the van warts as we sat on one of the tombstones he recounted to me the exploits of many of these worthies and my heart smote me when i heard of their great doings in days of yore to think how heedlessly i had once sported over their graves  from the church the venerable diedrich proceeded in his researches up the hollow the genius of the place seemed to hail its future historian all nature was alive with gratulation the quail whistled a greeting from the cornfield the robin carolled a song of praise from the orchard the loquacious catbird flew from bush to bush with restless wing proclaiming his approach in every variety of note and anon would whisk about and perk inquisitively into his face as if to get a knowledge of his physiognomy the woodpecker also tapped a tattoo on the hollow appletree and then peered knowingly round the trunk to see how the great diedrich relished his salutation while the groundsquirrel scampered along the fence and occasionally whisked his tail over his head by way of a huzza  the worthy diedrich pursued his researches in the valley with characteristic devotion entering familiarly into the various cottages and gossiping with the simple folk in the style of their own simplicity i confess my heart yearned with admiration to see so great a man in his eager quest after knowledge humbly demeaning himself to curry favor with the humblest sitting patiently on a threelegged stool patting the children and taking a purring grimalkin on his lap while he conciliated the goodwill of the old dutch housewife and drew from her long ghost stories spun out to the humming accompaniment of her wheel  his greatest treasure of historic lore however was discovered in an old goblinlooking mill situated among rocks and waterfalls with clanking wheels and rushing streams and all kinds of uncouth noises a horseshoe nailed to the door to keep off witches and evil spirits showed that this mill was subject to awful visitations as we approached it an old negro thrust his head all dabbled with flour out of a hole above the waterwheel and grinned and rolled his eyes and looked like the very hobgoblin of the place the illustrious diedrich fixed upon him at once as the very one to give him that invaluable kind of information never to be acquired from books he beckoned him from his nest sat with him by the hour on a broken millstone by the side of the waterfall heedless of the noise of the water and the clatter of the mill and i verily believe it was to his conference with this african sage and the precious revelations of the good dame of the spinningwheel that we are indebted for the surprising though true history of ichabod crane and the headless horseman which has since astounded and edified the world  but i have said enough of the good old times of my youthful days let me speak of the hollow as i found it after an absence of many years when it was kindly given me once more to revisit the haunts of my boyhood it was a genial day as i approached that fated region the warm sunshine was tempered by a slight haze so as to give a dreamy effect to the landscape not a breath of air shook the foliage the broad tappan sea was without a ripple and the sloops with drooping sails slept on its grassy bosom columns of smoke from burning brushwood rose lazily from the folds of the hills on the opposite side of the river and slowly expanded in midair the distant lowing of a cow or the noontide crowing of a cock coming faintly to the ear seemed to illustrate rather than disturb the drowsy quiet of the scene  i entered the hollow with a beating heart contrary to my apprehensions i found it but little changed the march of intellect which had made such rapid strides along every river and highway had not yet apparently turned down into this favored valley perhaps the wizard spell of ancient days still reigned over the place binding up the faculties of the inhabitants in happy contentment with things as they had been handed down to them from yore there were the same little farms and farmhouses with their old hats for the housekeeping wren their stone wells mosscovered buckets and long balancing poles there were the same little rills whimpering down to pay their tributes to the pocantico while that wizard stream still kept on its course as of old through solemn woodlands and fresh green meadows nor were there wanting joyous holiday boys to loiter along its banks as i have done throw their pinhooks in the stream or launch their mimic barks i watched them with a kind of melancholy pleasure wondering whether they were under the same spell of the fancy that once rendered this valley a fairy land to me alas alas to me every thing now stood revealed in its simple reality the echoes no longer answered with wizard tongues the dream of youth was at an end the spell of sleepy hollow was broken  i sought the ancient church on the following sunday there it stood on its green bank among the trees the pocantico swept by it in a deep dark stream where i had so often angled there expanded the millpond as of old with the cows under the willows on its margin kneedeep in water chewing the cud and lashing the flies from their sides with their tails the hand of improvement however had been busy with the venerable pile the pulpit fabricated in holland had been superseded by one of modern construction and the front of the semigothic edifice was decorated by a semigrecian portico fortunately the two weathercocks remained undisturbed on their perches at each end of the church and still kept up a diametrical opposition to each other on all points of windy doctrine  on entering the church the changes of time continued to be apparent the elders round the pulpit were men whom i had left in the gamesome frolic of their youth but who had succeeded to the sanctity of station of which they once had stood so much in awe what most struck my eye was the change in the female part of the congregation instead of the primitive garbs of homespun manufacture and antique dutch fashion i beheld french sleeves french capes and french collars and a fearfulfluttering of french ribbands  when the service was ended i sought the churchyard in which i had sported in my unthinking days of boyhood several of the modest brown stones on which were recorded in dutch the names and virtues of the patriarchs had disappeared and had been succeeded by others of white marble with urns and wreaths and scraps of english tombstone poetry marking the intrusion of taste and literature and the english language in this once unsophisticated dutch neighborhood  as i was stumbling about among these silent yet eloquent memorials of the dead i came upon names familiar to me of those who had paid the debt of nature during the long interval of my absence some i remembered my companions in boyhood who had sported with me on the very sod under which they were now mouldering others who in those days had been the flower of the yeomanry figuring in sunday finery on the church green others the whitehaired elders of the sanctuary once arrayed in awful sanctity around the pulpit and ever ready to rebuke the illtimed mirth of the wanton stripling who now a man sobered by years and schooled by vicissitudes looked down pensively upon their graves our fathers thought i where are theyand the prophets can they live for ever  i was disturbed in my meditations by the noise of a troop of idle urchins who came gambolling about the place where i had so often gambolled they were checked as i and my playmates had often been by the voice of the sexton a man staid in years and demeanor i looked wistfully in his face had i met him any where else i should probably have passed him by without remark but here i was alive to the traces of former times and detected in the demure features of this guardian of the sanctuary the lurking lineaments of one of the very playmates i have alluded to we renewed our acquaintance he sat down beside me on one of the tombstones over which we had leaped in our juvenile sports and we talked together about our boyish days and held edifying discourse on the instability of all sublunary things as instanced in the scene around us he was rich in historic lore as to the events of the last thirty years and the circumference of thirty miles and from him i learned the appalling revolution that was taking place throughout the neighborhood all this i clearly perceived he attributed to the boasted march of intellect or rather to the allpervading influence of steam he bewailed the times when the only communication with town was by the weekly marketboat the farmers daughter which under the pilotage of the worthy gabriel requa braved the perils of the tappan sea alas gabriel and the farmers daughter slept in peace two steamboats now splashed and paddled up daily to the little rural port of tarrytown the spirit of speculation and improvement had seized even upon that once quiet and unambitious little dorp the whole neighborhood was laid out into town lots instead of the little tavern below the hill where the farmers used to loiter on market days and indulge in cider and gingerbread an ambitious hotel with cupola and verandas now crested the summit among churches built in the grecian and gothic styles showing the great increase of piety and polite taste in the neighborhood as to dutch dresses and sunbonnets they were no longer tolerated or even thought of not a farmers daughter but now went to town for the fashions nay a city milliner had recently set up in the village who threatened to reform the heads of the whole neighborhood  i had heard enough i thanked my old playmate for his intelligence and departed from the sleepy hollow church with the sad conviction that i had beheld the last lingerings of the good old dutch times in this once favored region if any thing were wanting to confirm this impression it would be the intelligence which has just reached me that a bank is about to be established in the aspiring little port just mentioned the fate of the neighborhood is therefore sealed i see no hope of averting it the golden mean is at an end the country is suddenly to be deluged with wealth the late simple farmers are to become bank directors and drink claret and champagne and their wives and daughters to figure in french hats and feathers for french wines and french fashions commonly keep pace with paper money how can i hope that even sleepy hollow can escape the general inundation in a little while i fear the slumber of ages will be at endthe strum of the piano will succeed to the hum of the spinningwheel the trill of the italian opera to the nasal quaver of ichabod crane and the antiquarian visitor to the hollow in the petulance of his disappointment may pronounce all that i have recorded of that once favored region a fable                                        the birds of spring  by geoffrey crayon gent  my quiet residence in the country aloof from fashion politics and the money market leaves me rather at a loss for important occupation and drives me to the study of nature and other low pursuits having few neighbors also on whom to keep a watch and exercise my habits of observation i am fain to amuse myself with prying into the domestic concerns and peculiarities of the animals around me and during the present season have derived considerable entertainment from certain sociable little birds almost the only visitors we have during this early part of the year  those who have passed the winter in the country are sensible of the delightful influences that accompany the earliest indications of spring and of these none are more delightful than the first notes of the birds there is one modest little sadcolored bird much resembling a wren which came about the house just on the skirts of winter when not a blade of grass was to be seen and when a few prematurely warm days had given a flattering foretaste of soft weather he sang early in the dawning long before sunrise and late in the evening just before the closing in of night his matin and his vesper hymns it is true he sang occasionally throughout the day but at these still hours his song was more remarked he sat on a leafless tree just before the window and warbled forth his notes free and simple but singularly sweet with something of a plaintive tone that heightened their effect the first morning that he was heard was a joyous one among the young folks of my household the long deathlike sleep of winter was at an end nature was once more awakening they now promised themselves the immediate appearance of buds and blossoms i was reminded of the tempesttossed crew of columbus when after their long dubious voyage the field birds came singing round the ship though still far at sea rejoicing them with the belief of the immediate proximity of land a sharp return of winter almost silenced my little songster and dashed the hilarity of the household yet still he poured forth now and then a few plaintive notes between the frosty pipings of the breeze like gleams of sunshine between wintry clouds  i have consulted my book of ornithology in vain to find out the name of this kindly little bird who certainly deserves honor and favor far beyond his modest pretensions he comes like the lowly violet the most unpretending but welcomest of flowers breathing the sweet promise of the early year  another of our feathered visitors who follows close upon the steps of winter is the pewit or pewee or phoebebird for he is called by each of these names from a fancied resemblance to the sound of his monotonous note he is a sociable little being and seeks the habitation of man a pair of them have built beneath my porch and have reared several broods there for two years past their nest being never disturbed they arrive early in the spring just when the crocus and the snowdrop begin to peep forth their first chirp spreads gladness through the house the phoebebirds have come is heard on all sides they are welcomed back like members of the family and speculations are made upon where they have been and what countries they have seen during their long absence their arrival is the more cheering as it is pronounced by the old weatherwise people of the country the sure sign that the severe frosts are at an end and that the gardener may resume his labors with confidence  about this time too arrives the bluebird so poetically yet truly described by wilson his appearance gladdens the whole landscape you hear his soft warble in every field he sociably approaches your habitation and takes up his residence in your vicinity but why should i attempt to describe him when i have wilsons own graphic verses to place him before the reader    when winters cold tempests and snows are no more   green meadows and brown furrowed fields reappearing   the fishermen hauling their shad to the shore   and cloudcleaving geese to the lakes are asteering   when first the lone butterfly flits on the wing   when red glow the maples so fresh and so pleasing   o then comes the bluebird the herald of spring   and hails with his warblings the charms of the season    the loudpiping frogs make the marshes to ring   then warm glows the sunshine and warm glows the weather   the blue woodland flowers just beginning to spring   and spicewood and sassafras budding together   o then to your gardens ye housewives repair   your walks border up sow and plant at your leisure   the bluebird will chant from his box such an air   that all your hard toils will seem truly a pleasure    he flits through the orchard he visits each tree   the red flowering peach and the apples sweet blossoms   he snaps up destroyers wherever they be   and seizes the caitiffs that lurk in their bosoms   he drags the vile grub from the corn it devours   the worms from the webs where they riot and welter   his song and his services freely are ours   and all that he asks is in summer a shelter    the ploughman is pleased when he gleams in his train   now searching the furrows now mounting to cheer him   the gardner delights in his sweet simple strain   and leans on his spade to survey and to hear him   the slow lingering schoolboys forget theyll be chid   while gazing intent as he warbles before them   in mantle of skyblue and bosom so red   that each little loiterer seems to adore him  the happiest bird of our spring however and one that rivals the european lark in my estimation is the boblincon or boblink as he is commonly called he arrives at that choice portion of our year which in this latitude answers to the description of the month of may so often given by the poets with us it begins about the middle of may and lasts until nearly the middle of june earlier than this winter is apt to return on its traces and to blight the opening beauties of the year and later than this begin the parching and panting and dissolving heats of summer but in this genial interval nature is in all her freshness and fragrance the rains are over and gone the flowers appear upon the earth the time of the singing of birds is come and the voice of the turtle is heard in the land the trees are now in their fullest foliage and brightest verdure the woods are gay with the clustered flowers of the laurel the air is perfumed by the sweetbriar and the wild rose the meadows are enamelled with cloverblossoms while the young apple the peach and the plum begin to swell and the cherry to glow among the green leaves  this is the chosen season of revelry of the boblink he comes amidst the pomp and fragrance of the season his life seems all sensibility and enjoyment all song and sunshine he is to be found in the soft bosoms of the freshest and sweetest meadows and is most in song when the clover is in blossom he perches on the topmost twig of a tree or on some long flaunting weed and as he rises and sinks with the breeze pours forth a succession of rich tinkling notes crowding one upon another like the outpouring melody of the skylark and possessing the same rapturous character sometimes he pitches from the summit of a tree begins his song as soon as he gets upon the wing and flutters tremulously down to the earth as if overcome with ecstasy at his own music sometimes he is in pursuit of his paramour always in full song as if he would win her by his melody and always with the same appearance of intoxication and delight  of all the birds of our groves and meadows the boblink was the envy of my boyhood he crossed my path in the sweetest weather and the sweetest season of the year when all nature called to the fields and the rural feeling throbbed in every bosom but when i luckless urchin was doomed to be mewed up during the livelong day in that purgatory of boyhood a schoolroom it seemed as if the little varlet mocked at me as he flew by in full song and sought to taunt me with his happier lot oh how i envied him no lessons no tasks no hateful school nothing but holiday frolic green fields and fine weather had i been then more versed in poetry i might have addressed him in the words of logan to the cuckoo    sweet bird thy bower is ever green   thy sky is ever clear   thou hast no sorrow in thy note   no winter in thy year    oh could i fly id fly with thee   wed make on joyful wing   our annual visit round the globe   companions of the spring  farther observation and experience have given me a different idea of this little feathered voluptuary which i will venture to impart for the benefit of my schoolboy readers who may regard him with the same unqualified envy and admiration which i once indulged i have shown him only as i saw him at first in what i may call the poetical part of his career when he in a manner devoted himself to elegant pursuits and enjoyments and was a bird of music and song and taste and sensibility and refinement while this lasted he was sacred from injury the very schoolboy would not fling a stone at him and the merest rustic would pause to listen to his strain but mark the difference as the year advances as the cloverblossoms disappear and the spring fades into summer his notes cease to vibrate on the ear he gradually gives up his elegant tastes and habits doffs his poetical and professional suit of black assumes a russet or rather dusty garb and enters into the gross enjoyments of common vulgar birds he becomes a bonvivant a mere gourmand thinking of nothing but good cheer and gormandizing on the seeds of the long grasses on which he lately swung and chaunted so musically he begins to think there is nothing like the joys of the table if i may be allowed to apply that convivial phrase to his indulgences he now grows discontented with plain everyday fare and sets out on a gastronomical tour in search of foreign luxuries he is to be found in myriads among the reeds of the delaware banqueting on their seeds grows corpulent with good feeding and soon acquires the unlucky renown of the ortolan whereever he goes pop pop pop the rusty firelocks of the country are cracking on every side he sees his companions falling by the thousands around him he is the reedbird the muchsoughtfor titbit of the pennsylvanian epicure  does he take warning and reform not he he wings his flight still farther south in search of other luxuries we hear of him gorging himself in the rice swamps filling himself with rice almost to bursting he can hardly fly for corpulency last stage of his career we hear of him spitted by dozens and served up on the table of the gourmand the most vaunted of southern dainties the ricebird of the carolinas  such is the story of the once musical and admired but finally sensual and persecuted boblink it contains a moral worthy the attention of all little birds and little boys warning them to keep to those refined and intellectual pursuits which raised him to so high a pitch of popularity during the early part of his career but to eschew all tendency to that gross and dissipated indulgence which brought this mistaken little bird to an untimely end  which is all at present from the wellwisher of little boys and little birds  geoffrey crayon                                       recollections of the alhambra  by the author of the sketchbook  during a summers residence in the old moorish palace of the alhambra of which i have already given numerous anecdotes to the public i used to pass much of my time in the beautiful hall of the abencerrages beside the fountain celebrated in the tragic story of that devoted race here it was that thirtysix cavaliers of that heroic line were treacherously sacrificed to appease the jealousy or allay the fears of a tyrant the fountain which now throws up its sparkling jet and sheds a dewy freshness around ran red with the noblest blood of granada and a deep stain on the marble pavement is still pointed out by the cicerones of the pile as a sanguinary record of the massacre i have regarded it with the same determined faith with which i have regarded the traditional stains of rizzios blood on the floor of the chamber of the unfortunate mary at holyrood i thank no one for endeavoring to enlighten my credulity on such points of popular belief it is like breaking up the shrine of the pilgrim it is robbing a poor traveller of half the reward of his toils for strip travelling of its historical illusions and what a mere fag you make of it  for my part i gave myself up during my sojourn in the alhambra to all the romantic and fabulous traditions connected with the pile i lived in the midst of an arabian tale and shut my eyes as much as possible to every thing that called me back to everyday life and if there is any country in europe where one can do so it is in poor wild legendary proudspirited romantic spain where the old magnificent barbaric spirit still contends against the utilitarianism of modern civilization  in the silent and deserted halls of the alhambra surrounded with the insignia of regal sway and the still vivid though dilapidated traces of oriental voluptuousness i was in the stronghold of moorish story and every thing spoke and breathed of the glorious days of granada when under the dominion of the crescent when i sat in the hall of the abencerrages i suffered my mind to conjure up all that i had read of that illustrious line in the proudest days of moslem domination the abencerrages were the soul of every thing noble and chivalrous the veterans of the family who sat in the royal council were the foremost to devise those heroic enterprises which carried dismay into the territories of the christians and what the sages of the family devised the young men of the name were the foremost to execute in all services of hazard in all adventurous forays and hairbreadth hazards the abencerrages were sure to win the brightest laurels in those noble recreations too which bear so close an affinity to war in the tilt and tourney the riding at the ring and the daring bullfight still the abencerrages carried off the palm none could equal them for the splendor of their array the gallantry of their devices for their noble bearing and glorious horsemanship their openhanded munificence made them the idols of the populace while their lofty magnanimity and perfect faith gained them golden opinions from the generous and highminded never were they known to decry the merits of a rival or to betray the confidings of a friend and the word of an abencerrage was a guarantee that never admitted of a doubt  and then their devotion to the fair never did moorish beauty consider the fame of her charms established until she had an abencerrage for a lover and never did an abencerrage prove recreant to his vows lovely granada city of delights who ever bore the favors of thy dames more proudly on their casques or championed them more gallantly in the chivalrous tilts of the vivarambla or who ever made thy moonlit balconies thy gardens of myrtles and roses of oranges citrons and pomegranates respond to more tender serenades  i speak with enthusiasm on this theme for it is connected with the recollection of one of the sweetest evenings and sweetest scenes that ever i enjoyed in spain one of the greatest pleasures of the spaniards is to sit in the beautiful summer evenings and listen to traditional ballads and tales about the wars of the moors and christians and the buenas andanzas and grandes hechos the good fortunes and great exploits of the hardy warriors of yore it is worthy of remark also that many of these songs or romances as they are called celebrate the prowess and magnanimity in war and the tenderness and fidelity in love of the moorish cavaliers once their most formidable and hated foes but centuries have elapsed to extinguish the bigotry of the zealot and the once detested warriors of granada are now held up by spanish poets as the mirrors of chivalric virtue  such was the amusement of the evening in question a number of us were seated in the hall of the abencerrages listening to one of the most gifted and fascinating beings that i had ever met with in my wanderings she was young and beautiful and light and ethereal full of fire and spirit and pure enthusiasm she wore the fanciful andalusian dress touched the guitar with speaking eloquence improvised with wonderful facility and as she became excited by her theme or by the rapt attention of her auditors would pour forth in the richest and most melodious strains a succession of couplets full of striking description or stirring narration and composed as i was assured at the moment most of these were suggested by the place and related to the ancient glories of granada and the prowess of her chivalry the abencerrages were her favorite heroes she felt a womans admiration of their gallant courtesy and highsouled honor and it was touching and inspiring to hear the praises of that generous but devoted race chanted in this fated hall of their calamity by the lips of spanish beauty  among the subjects of which she treated was a tale of moslem honor and oldfashioned spanish courtesy which made a strong impression on me she disclaimed all merit of invention however and said she had merely dilated into verse a popular tradition and indeed i have since found the main facts inserted at the end of condes history of the domination of the arabs and the story itself embodied in the form of an episode in the diana of montemayor from these sources i have drawn it forth and endeavored to shape it according to my recollection of the version of the beautiful minstrel but alas what can supply the want of that voice that look that form that action which gave magical effect to her chant and held every one rapt in breathless admiration should this mere travestie of her inspired numbers ever meet her eye in her stately abode at granada may it meet with that indulgence which belongs to her benignant nature happy should i be if it could awaken in her bosom one kind recollection of the lonely stranger and sojourner for whose gratification she did not think it beneath her to exert those fascinating powers which were the delight of brilliant circles and who will ever recall with enthusiasm the happy evening passed in listening to her strains in the moonlit halls of the alhambra                                       geoffrey crayon  the abencerrage  a spanish tale  on the summit of a craggy hill a spur of the mountains of ronda stands the castle of allora now a mere ruin infested by bats and owlets but in old times one of the strong border holds of the christians to keep watch upon the frontiers of the warlike kingdom of granada and to hold the moors in check it was a post always confided to some welltried commander and at the time of which we treat was held by rodrigo de narvaez a veteran famed both among moors and christians not only for his hardy feats of arms but also for that magnanimous courtesy which should ever be entwined with the sterner virtues of the soldier  the castle of allora was a mere part of his command he was alcayde or military governor of antiquera but he passed most of his time at this frontier post because its situation on the borders gave more frequent opportunity for those adventurous exploits which were the delight of the spanish chivalry his garrison consisted of fifty chosen cavaliers all well mounted and well appointed with these he kept vigilant watch upon the moslems patrolling the roads and paths and defiles of the mountains so that nothing could escape his eye and now and then signalizing himself by some dashing foray into the very vega of granada  on a fair and beautiful night in summer when the freshness of the evening breeze had tempered the heat of day the worthy alcayde sallied forth with nine of his cavaliers to patrol the neighborhood and seek adventures they rode quietly and cautiously lest they should be overheard by moorish scout or traveller and kept along ravines and hollow ways lest they should be betrayed by the glittering of the full moon upon their armor coming to where the road divided the alcayde directed five of his cavaliers to take one of the branches while he with the remaining four would take the other should either party be in danger the blast of a horn was to be the signal to bring their comrades to their aid  the party of five had not proceeded far when in passing through a defile overhung with trees they heard the voice of a man singing they immediately concealed themselves in a grove on the brow of a declivity up which the stranger would have to ascend the moonlight which left the grove in deep shadow lit up the whole person of the wayfarer as he advanced and enabled them to distinguish his dress and appearance with perfect accuracy he was a moorish cavalier and his noble demeanor graceful carriage and splendid attire showed him to be of lofty rank he was superbly mounted on a dapplegray steed of powerful frame and generous spirit and magnificently caparisoned his dress was a marlota or tunic and an albernoz of crimson damask fringed with gold his tunisian turban of many folds was of silk and cotton striped and bordered with golden fringe at his girdle hung a scimitar of damascus steel with loops and tassels of silk and gold on his left arm he bore an ample target and his right hand grasped a long doublepointed lance thus equipped he sat negligently on his steed as one who dreamed of no danger gazing on the moon and singing with a sweet and manly voice a moorish love ditty  just opposite the place where the spanish cavaliers were concealed was a small fountain in the rock beside the road to which the horse turned to drink the rider threw the reins on his neck and continued his song  the spanish cavaliers conferred together they were all so pleased with the gallant and gentle appearance of the moor that they resolved not to harm but to capture him which in his negligent mood promised to be an easy task rushing therefore from their concealment they thought to surround and seize him never were men more mistaken to gather up his reins wheel round his steed brace his buckler and couch his lance was the work of an instant and there he sat fixed like a castle in his saddle beside the fountain  the christian cavaliers checked their steeds and reconnoitered him warily loth to come to an encounter which must end in his destruction  the moor now held a parley if you be true knights said he and seek for honorable fame come on singly and i am ready to meet each in succession but if you be mere lurkers of the road intent on spoil come all at once and do your worst  the cavaliers communed for a moment apart when one advancing singly exclaimed although no law of chivalry obliges us to risk the loss of a prize when clearly in our power yet we willingly grant as a courtesy what we might refuse as a right valiant moor defend thyself so saying he wheeled took proper distance couched his lance and putting spurs to his horse made at the stranger the latter met him in mid career transpierced him with his lance and threw him headlong from his saddle a second and a third succeeded but were unhorsed with equal facility and thrown to the earth severely wounded the remaining two seeing their comrades thus roughly treated forgot all compact of courtesy and charged both at once upon the moor he parried the thrust of one but was wounded by the other in the thigh and in the shock and confusion dropped his lance thus disarmed and closely pressed he pretended to fly and was hotly pursued having drawn the two cavaliers some distance from the spot he suddenly wheeled short about with one of those dexterous movements for which the moorish horsemen are renowned passed swiftly between them swung himself down from his saddle so as to catch up his lance then lightly replacing himself turned to renew the combat  seeing him thus fresh for the encounter as if just issued from his tent one of the cavaliers put his lips to his horn and blew a blast that soon brought the alcayde and his four companions to the spot  the valiant narvaez seeing three of his cavaliers extended on the earth and two others hotly engaged with the moor was struck with admiration and coveted a contest with so accomplished a warrior interfering in the fight he called upon his followers to desist and addressing the moor with courteous words invited him to a more equal combat the latter readily accepted the challenge for some time their contest was fierce and doubtful and the alcayde had need of all his skill and strength to ward off the blows of his antagonist the moor however was exhausted by previous fighting and by loss of blood he no longer sat his horse firmly nor managed him with his wonted skill collecting all his strength for a last assault he rose in his stirrups and made a violent thrust with his lance the alcayde received it upon his shield and at the same time wounded the moor in the right arm then closing in the shock he grasped him in his arms dragged him from his saddle and fell with him to the earth when putting his knee upon his breast and his dagger to his throat cavalier exclaimed he render thyself my prisoner for thy life is in my hands  kill me rather replied the moor for death would be less grievous than loss of liberty the alcayde however with the clemency of the truly brave assisted the moor to rise ministered to his wounds with his own hands and had him conveyed with great care to the castle of allora his wounds were slight and in a few days were nearly cured but the deepest wound had been inflicted on his spirit he was constantly buried in a profound melancholy  the alcayde who had conceived a great regard for him treated him more as a friend than a captive and tried in every way to cheer him but in vain he was always sad and moody and when on the battlements of the castle would keep his eyes turned to the south with a fixed and wistful gaze  how is this exclaimed the alcayde reproachfully that you who were so hardy and fearless in the field should lose all spirit in prison if any secret grief preys on your heart confide it to me as to a friend and i promise you on the faith of a cavalier that you shall have no cause to repent the disclosure  the moorish knight kissed the hand of the alcayde noble cavalier said he that i am cast down in spirit is not from my wounds which are slight nor from my captivity for your kindness has robbed it of all gloom nor from my defeat for to be conquered by so accomplished and renowned a cavalier is no disgrace but to explain to you the cause of my grief it is necessary to give you some particulars of my story and this i am moved to do by the great sympathy you have manifested toward me and the magnanimity that shines through all your actions  know then that my name is abendaraez and that i am of the noble but unfortunate line of the abencerrages of granada you have doubtless heard of the destruction that fell upon our race charged with treasonable designs of which they were entirely innocent many of them were beheaded the rest banished so that not an abencerrages was permitted to remain in granada excepting my father and my uncle whose innocence was proved even to the satisfaction of their persecutors it was decreed however that should they have children the sons should be educated at a distance from granada and the daughters should be married out of the kingdom  conformably to this decree i was sent while yet an infant to be reared in the fortress of cartama the worthy alcayde of which was an ancient friend of my father he had no children and received me into his family as his own child treating me with the kindness and affection of a father and i grew up in the belief that he really was such a few years afterward his wife gave birth to a daughter but his tenderness toward me continued undiminished i thus grew up with xarisa for so the infant daughter of the alcayde was called as her own brother and thought the growing passion which i felt for her was mere fraternal affection i beheld her charms unfolding as it were leaf by leaf like the morning rose each moment disclosing fresh beauty and sweetness  at this period i overheard a conversation between the alcayde and his confidential domestic and found myself to be the subject it is time said he to apprise him of his parentage that he may adopt a career in life i have deferred the communication as long as possible through reluctance to inform him that he is of a proscribed and an unlucky race  this intelligence would have overwhelmed me at an earlier period but the intimation that xarisa was not my sister operated like magic and in an instant transformed my brotherly affection into ardent love  i sought xarisa to impart to her the secret i had learned i found her in the garden in a bower of jessamines arranging her beautiful hair by the mirror of a crystal fountain the radiance of her beauty dazzled me i ran to her with open arms and she received me with a sisters embraces when we had seated ourselves beside the fountain she began to upbraid me for leaving her so long alone  in reply i informed her of the conversation i had overheard the recital shocked and distressed her alas cried she then is our happiness at an end  how exclaimed i wilt thou cease to love me because i am not thy brother  not so replied she but do you not know that when it is once known we are not brother and sister we can no longer be permitted to be thus always together  in fact from that moment our intercourse took a new character we met often at the fountain among the jessamines but xarisa no longer advanced with open arms to meet me she became reserved and silent and would blush and cast down her eyes when i seated myself beside her my heart became a prey to the thousand doubts and fears that ever attend upon true love i was restless and uneasy and looked back with regret to the unreserved intercourse that had existed between us when we supposed ourselves brother and sister yet i would not have had the relationship true for the world  while matters were in this state between us an order came from the king of granada for the alcayde to take command of the fortress of coyn which lies directly on the christian frontier he prepared to remove with all his family but signified that i should remain at cartama i exclaimed against the separation and declared that i could not be parted from xarisa that is the very cause said he why i leave thee behind it is time abendaraez that thou shouldst know the secret of thy birth that thou art no son of mine neither is xarisa thy sister i know it all exclaimed i and i love her with tenfold the affection of a brother you have brought us up together you have made us necessary to each others happiness our hearts have entwined themselves with our growth do not now tear them asunder fill up the measure of your kindness be indeed a father to me by giving me xarisa for my wife  the brow of the alcayde darkened as i spoke have i then been deceived said he have those nurtured in my very bosom been conspiring against me is this your return for my paternal tendernessto beguile the affections of my child and teach her to deceive her father it was cause enough to refuse thee the hand of my daughter that thou wert of a proscribed race who can never approach the walls of granada this however i might have passed over but never will i give my daughter to a man who has endeavored to win her from me by deception  all my attempts to vindicate myself and xarisa were unavailing i retired in anguish from his presence and seeking xarisa told her of this blow which was worse than death to me xarisa said i we part for ever i shall never see thee more thy father will guard thee rigidly thy beauty and his wealth will soon attract some happier rival and i shall be forgotten  xarisa reproached me with my want of faith and promised me eternal constancy i still doubted and desponded until moved by my anguish and despair she agreed to a secret union our espousals made we parted with a promise on her part to send me word from coyn should her father absent himself from the fortress the very day after our secret nuptials i beheld the whole train of the alcayde depart from cartama nor would he admit me to his presence or permit me to bid farewell to xarisa i remained at cartama somewhat pacified in spirit by this secret bond of union but every thing around me fed my passion and reminded me of xarisa i saw the windows at which i had so often beheld her i wandered through the apartment she had inhabited the chamber in which she had slept i visited the bower of jessamines and lingered beside the fountain in which she had delighted every thing recalled her to my imagination and filled my heart with tender melancholy  at length a confidential servant brought me word that her father was to depart that day for granada on a short absence inviting me to hasten to coyn describing a secret portal at which i should apply and the signal by which i would obtain admittance  if ever you have loved most valiant alcayde you may judge of the transport of my bosom that very night i arrayed myself in my most gallant attire to pay due honor to my bride and arming myself against any casual attack issued forth privately from cartama you know the rest and by what sad fortune of war i found myself instead of a happy bridegroom in the nuptial bower of coyn vanquished wounded and a prisoner withing the walls of allora the term of absence of the father of xarisa is nearly expired within three days he will return to coyn and our meeting will no longer be possible judge then whether i grieve without cause and whether i may not well be excused for showing impatience under confinement  don rodrigo de narvaez was greatly moved by this recital for though more used to rugged war than scenes of amorous softness he was of a kind and generous nature  abendaraez said he i did not seek thy confidence to gratify an idle curiosity it grieves me much that the good fortune which delivered thee into my hands should have marred so fair an enterprise give me thy faith as a true knight to return prisoner to my castle within three days and i will grant thee permission to accomplish thy nuptials  the abencerrage would have thrown himself at his feet to pour out protestations of eternal gratitude but the alcayde prevented him calling in his cavaliers he took the abencerrage by the right hand in their presence exclaiming solemnly you promise on the faith of a cavalier to return to my castle of allora within three days and render yourself my prisoner and the abencerrage said i promise  then said the alcayde go and may good fortune attend you if you require any safeguard i and my cavaliers are ready to be your companions  the abencerrage kissed the hand of the alcayde in grateful acknowledgment give me said he my own armor and my steed and i require no guard it is not likely that i shall again meet with so valorous a foe  the shades of night had fallen when the tramp of the dapplegray steed sounded over the drawbridge and immediately afterward the light clatter of hoofs along the road bespoke the fleetness with which the youthful lover hastened to his bride it was deep night when the moor arrived at the castle of coyn he silently and cautiously walked his panting steed under its dark walls and having nearly passed round them came to the portal denoted by xarisa he paused and looked around to see that he was not observed and then knocked three times with the butt of his lance in a little while the portal was timidly unclosed by the duenna of xarisa alas senor said she what has detained you thus long every night have i watched for you and my lady is sick at heart with doubt and anxiety  the abencerrage hung his lance and shield and scimitar against the wall and then followed the duenna with silent steps up a winding staircase to the apartment of xarisa vain would be the attempt to describe the raptures of that meeting time flew too swiftly and the abencerrage had nearly forgotten until too late his promise to return a prisoner to the alcayde of allora the recollection of it came to him with a pang and suddenly awoke him from his dream of bliss xarisa saw his altered looks and heard with alarm his stifled sighs but her countenance brightened when she heard the cause let not thy spirit be cast down said she throwing her white arms around him i have the keys of my fathers treasures send ransom more than enough to satisfy the christian and remain with me  no said abendaraez i have given my word to return in person and like a true knight must fulfil my promise after that fortune must do with me as it pleases  then said xarisa i will accompany thee never shall you return a prisoner and i remain at liberty  the abencerrage was transported with joy at this new proof of devotion in his beautiful bride all preparations were speedily made for their departure xarisa mounted behind the moor on his powerful steed they left the castle walls before daybreak nor did they pause until they arrived at the gate of the castle of allora which was flung wide to receive them  alighting in the court the abencerrage supported the steps of his trembling bride who remained closely veiled into the presence of rodrigo de narvaez behold valiant alcayde said he the way in which an abencerrage keeps his word i promised to return to thee a prisoner but i deliver two captives into your power behold xarisa and judge whether i grieved without reason over the loss of such a treasure receive us as your own for i confide my life and her honor to your hands  the alcayde was lost in admiration of the beauty of the lady and the noble spirit of the moor i know not said he which of you surpasses the other but i know that my castle is graced and honored by your presence enter into it and consider it your own while you deign to reside with me  for several days the lovers remained at allora happy in each others love and in the friendship of the brave alcayde the latter wrote a letter full of courtesy to the moorish king of granada relating the whole event extolling the valor and good faith of the abencerrage and craving for him the royal countenance  the king was moved by the story and was pleased with an opportunity of showing attention to the wishes of a gallant and chivalrous enemy for though he had often suffered from the prowess of don rodigro de narvaez he admired the heroic character he had gained throughout the land calling the alcayde of coyn into his presence he gave him the letter to read the alcayde turned pale and trembled with rage on the perusal restrain thine anger said the king there is nothing that the alcayde of allora could ask that i would not grant if in my power go thou to allora pardon thy children take them to thy home i receive this abencerrage into my favor and it will be my delight to heap benefits upon you all  the kindling ire of the alcayde was suddenly appeased he hastened to allora and folded his children to his bosom who would have fallen at his feet the gallant rodrigo de narvaez gave liberty to his prisoner without ransom demanding merely a promise of his friendship he accompanied the youthful couple and their father to coyn where their nuptials were celebrated with great rejoicings when the festivities were over don rodrigo de narvaez returned to his fortress of allora  after his departure the alcayde of coyn addressed his children to your hands said he i confide the disposition of my wealth one of the first things i charge you is not to forget the ransom you owe to the alcayde of allora his magnanimity you can never repay but you can prevent it from wronging him of his just dues give him moreover your entire friendship for he merits it fully though of a different faith  the abencerrage thanked him for his generous proposition which so truly accorded with his own wishes he took a large sum of gold and enclosed it in a rich coffer and on his own part sent six beautiful horses superbly caparisoned with six shields and lances mounted and embossed with gold the beautiful xarisa at the same time wrote a letter to the alcayde filled with expressions of gratitude and friendship and sent him a box of fragrant cypresswood containing linen of the finest quality for his person the valiant alcayde disposed of the present in a characteristic manner the horses and armor he shared among the cavaliers who had accompanied him on the night of the skirmish the box of cypresswood and its contents he retained for the sake of the beautiful xarisa and sent her by the hands of a messenger the sum of gold paid as a ransom entreating her to receive it as a wedding present this courtesy and magnanimity raised the character of the alcayde rodrigo de narvaez still higher in the estimation of the moors who extolled him as a perfect mirror of chivalric virtue and from that time forward there was a continual exchange of good offices between them                                       the enchanted island  by the author of the sketchbook    break phantsie from thy cave of cloud   and wave thy purple wings   now all thy figures are allowed   and various shapes of things   create of airy forms a stream   it must have blood and nought of phlegm   and though it be a walking dream   yet let it like an odor rise   to all the senses here   and fall like sleep upon their eyes   or music on their earben jonson  there are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamed of in our philosophy and among these may be placed that marvel and mystery of the seas the island of st brandan every schoolboy can enumerate and call by name the canaries the fortunate islands of the ancients which according to some ingenious speculative minds are mere wrecks and remnants of the vast island of atalantis mentioned by plato as having been swallowed up by the ocean whoever has read the history of those isles will remember the wonders told of another island still more beautiful seen occasionally from their shores stretching away in the clear bright west with long shadowy promontories and high sungilt peaks numerous expeditions both in ancient and modern days have launched forth from the canaries in quest of that island but on their approach mountain and promontory have gradually faded away until nothing has remained but the blue sky above and the deep blue water below hence it was termed by the geographers of old aprositus or the inaccessible while modern navigators have called its very existence in question pronouncing it a mere optical illusion like the fata morgana of the straits of messina or classing it with those unsubstantial regions known to mariners as cape flyaway and the coast of cloud land  let not however the doubts of the worldlywise sceptics of modern days rob us of all the glorious realms owned by happy credulity in days of yore be assured o reader of easy faiththou for whom i delight to laborbe assured that such an island does actually exist and has from time to time been revealed to the gaze and trodden by the feet of favored mortals nay though doubted by historians and philosophers its existence is fully attested by the poets who being an inspired race and gifted with a kind of second sight can see into the mysteries of nature hidden from the eyes of ordinary mortals to this gifted race it has ever been a region of fancy and romance teeming with all kinds of wonders here once bloomed and perhaps still blooms the famous garden of the hesperides with its golden fruit here too was the enchanted garden of armida in which that sorceress held the christian paladin rinaldo in delicious but inglorious thraldom as is set forth in the immortal lay of tasso it was on this island also that sycorax the witch held sway when the good prospero and his infant daughter miranda were wafted to its shores the isle was then    full of noises   sounds and sweet airs that give delight and hurt not  who does not know the tale as told in the magic page of shakspeare  in fact the island appears to have been at different times under the sway of different powers genii of earth and air and ocean who made it their shadowy abode or rather it is the retiring place of old wornout deities and dynasties that once ruled the poetic world but are now nearly shorn of all their attributes here neptune and amphitrite hold a diminished court like sovereigns in exile their oceanchariot lies bottom upward in a cave of the island almost a perfect wreck while their pursy tritons and haggard nereids bask listlessly like seals about the rocks sometimes they assume a shadow of their ancient pomp and glide in state about the glassy sea while the crew of some tall indiaman that lies becalmed with flapping sails hear with astonishment the mellow note of the tritons shell swelling upon the ear as the invisible pageant sweeps by sometimes the quondam monarch of the ocean is permitted to make himself visible to mortal eyes visiting the ships that cross the line to exact a tribute from newcomers the only remnant of his ancient rule and that alas performed with tattered state and tarnished splendor  on the shores of this wondrous island the mighty kraken heaves his bulk and wallows many a rood here too the seaserpent lies coiled up during the intervals of his muchcontested revelations to the eyes of true believers and here it is said even the flying dutchman finds a port and casts his anchor and furls his shadowy sail and takes a short repose from his eternal wanderings  here all the treasures lost in the deep are safely garnered the caverns of the shores are piled with golden ingots hexes of pearls rich bales of oriental silks and their deep recesses sparkle with diamonds or flame with carbuncles here in deep bays and harbors lies many a spellbound ship long given up as lost by the ruined merchant here too its crew long bewailed as swallowed up in ocean lie sleeping in mossy grottoes from age to age or wander about enchanted shores and groves in pleasing oblivion of all things  such are some of the marvels related of this island and which may serve to throw some light on the following legend of unquestionable truth which i recommend to the entire belief of the reader                                       the adelantado of the seven cities  a legend of st brandan  in the early part of the fifteenth century when prince henry of portugal of worthy memory was pushing the career of discovery along the western coast of africa and the world was resounding with reports of golden regions on the main land and newfound islands in the ocean there arrived at lisbon an old bewildered pilot of the seas who had been driven by tempests he knew not whither and who raved about an island far in the deep on which he had landed and which he had found peopled with christians and adorned with noble cities  the inhabitants he said gathered round and regarded him with surprise having never before been visited by a ship they told him they were descendants of a band of christians who fled from spain when that country was conquered by the moslems they were curious about the state of their fatherland and grieved to hear that the moslems still held possession of the kingdom of granada they would have taken the old navigator to church to convince him of their orthodoxy but either through lack of devotion or lack of faith in their words he declined their invitation and preferred to return on board of his ship he was properly punished a furious storm arose drove him from his anchorage hurried him out to sea and he saw no more of the unknown island  this strange story caused great marvel in lisbon and elsewhere those versed in history remembered to have read in an ancient chronicle that at the time of the conquest of spain in the eighth century when the blessed cross was cast down and the crescent erected in its place and when christian churches were turned into moslem mosques seven bishops at the head of seven bands of pious exiles had fled from the peninsula and embarked in quest of some ocean island or distant land where they might found seven christian cities and enjoy their faith unmolested  the fate of these pious saints errant had hitherto remained a mystery and their story had faded from memory the report of the old tempesttossed pilot however revived this longforgotten theme and it was determined by the pious and enthusiastic that the island thus accidentally discovered was the identical place of refuge whither the wandering bishops had been guided by a protecting providence and where they had folded their flocks  this most excitable of worlds has always some darling object of chimerical enterprise the island of the seven cities now awakened as much interest and longing among zealous christians as has the renowned city of timbuctoo among adventurous travellers or the northeast passage among hardy navigators and it was a frequent prayer of the devout that these scattered and lost portions of the christian family might be discovered and reunited to the great body of christendom  no one however entered into the matter with half the zeal of don fernando de ulmo a young cavalier of high standing in the portuguese court and of most sanguine and romantic temperament he had recently come to his estate and had run the round of all kinds of pleasures and excitements when this new theme of popular talk and wonder presented itself the island of the seven cities became now the constant subject of his thoughts by day and his dreams by night it even rivalled his passion for a beautiful girl one of the greatest belles of lisbon to whom he was betrothed at length his imagination became so inflamed on the subject that he determined to fit out an expedition at his own expense and set sail in quest of this sainted island it could not be a cruise of any great extent for according to the calculations of the tempesttossed pilot it must be somewhere in the latitude of the canaries which at that time when the new world was as yet undiscovered formed the frontier of ocean enterprise don fernando applied to the crown for countenance and protection as he was a favorite at court the usual patronage was readily extended to him that is to say he received a commission from the king don ioam ii constituting him adelantado or military governor of any country he might discover with the single proviso that he should bear all the expenses of the discovery and pay a tenth of the profits to the crown  don fernando now set to work in the true spirit of a projector he sold acre after acre of solid land and invested the proceeds in ships guns ammunition and seastores even his old family mansion in lisbon was mortgaged without scruple for he looked forward to a palace in one of the seven cities of which he was to be adelantado this was the age of nautical romance when the thoughts of all speculative dreamers were turned to the ocean the scheme of don fernando therefore drew adventurers of every kind the merchant promised himself new marts of opulent traffic the soldier hoped to sack and plunder some one or other of those seven cities even the fat monk shook off the sleep and sloth of the cloister to join in a crusade which promised such increase to the possessions of the church  one person alone regarded the whole project with sovereign contempt and growling hostility this was don ramiro alvarez the father of the beautiful serafina to whom don fernando was betrothed he was one of those perverse matteroffact old men who are prone to oppose every thing speculative and romantic he had no faith in the island of the seven cities regarded the projected cruise as a crackbrained freak looked with angry eye and internal heartburning on the conduct of his intended soninlaw chaffering away solid lands for lands in the moon and scoffingly dubbed him adelantado of lubberland in fact he had never really relished the intended match to which his consent had been slowly extorted by the tears and entreaties of his daughter it is true he could have no reasonable objections to the youth for don fernando was the very flower of portuguese chivalry no one could excel him at the tilting match or the riding at the ring none was more bold and dexterous in the bullfight none composed more gallant madrigals in praise of his ladys charms or sang them with sweeter tones to the accompaniment of her guitar nor could any one handle the castanets and dance the bolero with more captivating grace all these admirable qualities and endowments however though they had been sufficient to win the heart of serafina were nothing in the eyes of her unreasonable father o cupid god of love why will fathers always be so unreasonable  the engagement to serafina had threatened at first to throw an obstacle in the way of the expedition of don fernando and for a time perplexed him in the extreme he was passionately attached to the young lady but he was also passionately bent on this romantic enterprise how should he reconcile the two passionate inclinations a simple and obvious arrangement at length presented itself marry serafina enjoy a portion of the honeymoon at once and defer the rest until his return from the discovery of the seven cities  he hastened to make known this most excellent arrangement to don ramiro when the longsmothered wrath of the old cavalier burst forth in a storm about his ears he reproached him with being the dupe of wandering vagabonds and wild schemers and of squandering all his real possessions in pursuit of empty bubbles don fernando was too sanguine a projector and too young a man to listen tamely to such language he acted with what is technically called becoming spirit a high quarrel ensued don ramiro pronounced him a mad man and forbade all farther intercourse with his daughter until he should give proof of returning sanity by abandoning this madcap enterprise while don fernando flung out of the house more bent than ever on the expedition from the idea of triumphing over the incredulity of the graybeard when he should return successful  don ramiro repaired to his daughters chamber the moment the youth had departed he represented to her the sanguine unsteady character of her lover and the chimerical nature of his schemes showed her the propriety of suspending all intercourse with him until he should recover from his present hallucination folded her to his bosom with parental fondness kissed the tear that stole down her cheek and as he left the chamber gently locked the door for although he was a fond father and had a high opinion of the submissive temper of his child he had a still higher opinion of the conservative virtues of lock and key whether the damsel had been in any wise shaken in her faith as to the schemes of her lover and the existence of the island of the seven cities by the sage representations of her father tradition does not say but it is certain that she became a firm believer the moment she heard him turn the key in the lock  notwithstanding the interdict of don ramiro therefore and his shrewd precautions the intercourse of the lovers continued although clandestinely don fernando toiled all day hurrying forward his nautical enterprise while at night he would repair beneath the grated balcony of his mistress to carry on at equal pace the no less interesting enterprise of the heart at length the preparations for the expedition were completed two gallant caravels lay anchored in the tagus ready to sail with the morning dawn while late at night by the pale light of a waning moon don fernando sought the stately mansion of alvarez to take a last farewell of serafina the customary signal of a few low touches of a guitar brought her to the balcony she was sad at heart and full of gloomy forebodings but her lover strove to impart to her his own buoyant hope and youthful confidence a few short months said he and i shall return in triumph thy father will then blush at his incredulity and will once more welcome me to his house when i cross its threshold a wealthy suitor and adelantado of the seven cities  the beautiful serafina shook her head mournfully it was not on those points that she felt doubt or dismay she believed most implicitly in the island of the seven cities and trusted devoutly in the success of the enterprise but she had heard of the inconstancy of the seas and the inconstancy of those who roam them now let the truth be spoken don fernando if he had any fault in the world it was that he was a little too inflammable that is to say a little too subject to take fire from the sparkle of every bright eye he had been somewhat of a rover among the sex on shore what might he not be on sea might he not meet with other loves in foreign ports might he not behold some peerless beauty in one or other of those seven cities who might efface the image of serafina from his thoughts  at length she ventured to hint her doubts but don fernando spurned at the very idea never could his heart be false to serafina never could another be captivating in his eyesnevernever repeatedly did he bend his knee and smite his breast and call upon the silver moon to witness the sincerity of his vows but might not serafina herself be forgetful of her plighted faith might not some wealthier rival present while he was tossing on the sea and backed by the authority of her father win the treasure of her hand alas how little did he know serafinas heart the more her father should oppose the more would she be fixed in her faith though years should pass before his return he would find her true to her vows even should the salt seas swallow him up and her eyes streamed with salt tears at the very thought never would she be the wife of anothernevernever she raised her beautiful white arms between the iron bars of the balcony and invoked the moon as a testimonial of her faith  thus according to immemorial usage the lovers parted with many a vow of eternal constancy but will they keep those vows perish the doubt have they not called the constant moon to witness  with the morning dawn the caravels dropped down the tagus and put to sea they steered for the canaries in those days the regions of nautical romance scarcely had they reached those latitudes when a violent tempest arose don fernando soon lost sight of the accompanying caravel and was driven out of all reckoning by the fury of the storm for several weary days and nights he was tossed to and fro at the mercy of the elements expecting each moment to be swallowed up at length one day toward evening the storm subsided the clouds cleared up as though a veil had suddenly been withdrawn from the face of heaven and the setting sun shone gloriously upon a fair and mountainous island that seemed close at hand the tempesttossed mariners rubbed their eyes and gazed almost incredulously upon this land that had emerged so suddenly from the murky gloom yet there it lay spread out in lovely landscapes enlivened by villages and towers and spires while the late stormy sea rolled in peaceful billows to its shores about a league from the sea on the banks of a river stood a noble city with lofty walls and towers and a protecting castle don fernando anchored off the mouth of the river which appeared to form a spacious harbor in a little while a barge was seen issuing from the river it was evidently a barge of ceremony for it was richly though quaintly carved and gilt and decorated with a silken awning and fluttering streamers while a banner bearing the sacred emblem of the cross floated to the breeze the barge advanced slowly impelled by sixteen oars painted of a bright crimson the oarsmen were uncouth or rather antique in their garb and kept stroke to the regular cadence of an old spanish ditty beneath the awning sat a cavalier in a rich though oldfashioned doublet with an enormous sombrero and feather when the barge reached the caravel the cavalier stepped on board he was tall and gaunt with a long spanish visage and lacklustre eyes and an air of lofty and somewhat pompous gravity his mustaches were curled up to his ears his beard was forked and precise he wore gauntlets that reached to his elbows and a toledo blade that strutted out behind while in front its huge baskethilt might have served for a porringer  thrusting out a long spindle leg and taking off his sombrero with a grave and stately sweep he saluted don fernando by name and welcomed him in old castilian language and in the style of old castilian courtesy  don fernando was startled at hearing himself accosted by name by an utter stranger in a strange land as soon as he could recover from his surprise he inquired what land it was at which he had arrived  the island of the seven cities  could this be true had he indeed been thus tempestdriven upon the very land of which he was in quest it was even so the other caravel from which he had been separated in the storm had made a neighboring port of the island and announced the tidings of this expedition which came to restore the country to the great community of christendom the whole island he was told was given up to rejoicings on the happy event and they only awaited his arrival to acknowledge allegiance to the crown of portugal and hail him as adelantado of the seven cities a grand fête was to be solemnized that very night in the palace of the alcayde or governor of the city who on beholding the most opportune arrival of the caravel had despatched his grand chamberlain in his barge of state to conduct the future adelantado to the ceremony  don fernando could scarcely believe but that this was all a dream he fixed a scrutinizing gaze upon the grand chamberlain who having delivered his message stood in buckram dignity drawn up to his full stature curling his whiskers stroking his beard and looking down upon him with inexpressible loftiness through his lacklustre eyes there was no doubting the word of so grave and ceremonious a hidalgo  don fernando now arrayed himself in gala attire he would have launched his boat and gone on shore with his own men but he was informed the barge of state was expressly provided for his accommodation and after the fête would bring him back to his ship in which on the following day he might enter the harbor in befitting style he accordingly stepped into the barge and took his seat beneath the awning the grand chamberlain seated himself on the cushion opposite the rowers bent to their oars and renewed their mournful old ditty and the gorgeous but unwieldy barge moved slowly and solemnly through the water  the night closed in before they entered the river they swept along past rock and promontory each guarded by its tower the sentinels at every post challenged them as they passed by  who goes there  the adelantado of the seven cities  he is welcome pass on  on entering the harbor they rowed close along an armed galley of the most ancient form soldiers with crossbows were stationed on the deck  who goes there was again demanded  the adelantado of the seven cities  he is welcome pass on  they landed at a broad flight of stone steps leading up between two massive towers to the watergate of the city at which they knocked for admission a sentinel in an ancient steel casque looked over the wall who is there  the adelantado of the seven cities  the gate swung slowly open grating upon its rusty hinges they entered between two rows of ironclad warriors in battered armor with crossbows battleaxes and ancient maces and with faces as oldfashioned and rusty as their armor they saluted don fernando in military style but with perfect silence as he passed between their ranks the city was illuminated but in such manner as to give a more shadowy and solemn effect to its oldtime architecture there were bonfires in the principal streets with groups about them in such oldfashioned garbs that they looked like the fantastic figures that roam the streets in carnival time even the stately dames who gazed from the balconies which they had hung with antique tapestry looked more like effigies dressed up for a quaint mummery than like ladies in their fashionable attire every thing in short bore the stamp of former ages as if the world had suddenly rolled back a few centuries nor was this to be wondered at had not the island of the seven cities been for several hundred years cut off from all communication with the rest of the world and was it not natural that the inhabitants should retain many of the modes and customs brought here by their ancestors  one thing certainly they had conserved the oldfashioned spanish gravity and stateliness though this was a time of public rejoicing and though don fernando was the object of their gratulations every thing was conducted with the most solemn ceremony and wherever he appeared instead of acclamations he was received with profound silence and the most formal reverences and swayings of their sombreros  arrived at the palace of the alcayde the usual ceremonial was repeated the chamberlain knocked for admission  who is there demanded the porter  the adelantado of the seven cities  he is welcome pass on  the grand portal was thrown open the chamberlain led the way up a vast but heavily moulded marble staircase and so through one of those interminable suites of apartments that are the pride of spanish palaces all were furnished in a style of obsolete magnificence as they passed through the chambers the title of don fernando was forwarded on by servants stationed at every door and every where produced the most profound reverences and courtesies at length they reached a magnificent saloon blazing with tapers in which the alcayde and the principal dignitaries of the city were waiting to receive their illustrious guest the grand chamberlain presented don fernando in due form and falling back among the other officers of the household stood as usual curling his whiskers and stroking his forked beard  don fernando was received by the alcayde and the other dignitaries with the same stately and formal courtesy that he had every where remarked in fact there was so much form and ceremonial that it seemed difficult to get at any thing social or substantial nothing but bows and compliments and oldfashioned courtesies the alcayde and his courtiers resembled in face and form those quaint worthies to be seen in the pictures of old illuminated manuscripts while the cavaliers and dames who thronged the saloon might have beep taken for the antique figures of gobelin tapestry suddenly vivified and put in motion  the banquet which had been kept back until the arrival of don fernando was now announced and such a feast such unknown dishes and obsolete dainties with the peacock that bird of state and ceremony served up in full plumage in a golden dish at the head of the table and then as don fernando cast his eyes over the glittering board what a vista of odd heads and headdresses of formal bearded dignitaries and stately dames with castellated locks and towering plumes  as fate would have it on the other side of don fernando was seated the daughter of the alcayde she was arrayed it is true in a dress that might have been worn before the flood but then she had a melting black andalusian eye that was perfectly irresistible her voice too her manner her movements all smacked of andalusia and showed how female fascination may be transmitted from age to age and clime to clime without ever losing its power or going out of fashion those who know the witchery of the sex in that most amorous region of old spain may judge what must have been the fascination to which don fernando was exposed when seated beside one of the most captivating of its descendants he was as has already been hinted of an inflammable temperament with a heart ready to get in a light blaze at every instant and then he had been so wearied by pompous tedious old cavaliers with their formal bows and speeches is it to be wondered at that he turned with delight to the alcaydes daughter all smiles and dimples and melting looks and melting accents beside for i wish to give him every excuse in my power he was in a particularly excitable mood from the novelty of the scene before him and his head was almost turned with this sudden and complete realization of all his hopes and fancies and then in the flurry of the moment he had taken frequent draughts at the winecup presented him at every instant by officious pages and all the world knows the effect of such draughts in giving potency to female charms in a word there is no concealing the matter the banquet was not half over before don fernando was making love outright to the alcaydes daughter it was his cold habitude contracted long before his matrimonial engagement the young lady hung her head coyly her eye rested upon a ruby heart sparkling in a ring on the hand of don fernando a parting gage of love from serafina a blush crimsoned her very temples she darted a glance of doubt at the ring and then at don fernando he read her doubt and in the giddy intoxication of the moment drew off the pledge of his affianced bride and slipped it on the finger of the alcaydes daughter  at this moment the banquet broke up the chamberlain with his lofty demeanor and his lacklustre eyes stood before him and announced that the barge was waiting to conduct him back to the caravel don fernando took a formal leave of the alcayde and his dignitaries and a tender farewell of the alcaydes daughter with a promise to throw himself at her feet on the following day he was rowed back to his vessel in the same slow and stately manner to the cadence of the same mournful old ditty he retired to his cabin his brain whirling with all that he had seen and his heart now and then giving him a twinge as he recollected his temporary infidelity to the beautiful serafina he flung himself on his bed and soon fell into a feverish sleep his dreams were wild and incoherent how long he slept he knew not but when he awoke he found himself in a strange cabin with persons around him of whom he had no knowledge he rubbed his eyes to ascertain whether he were really awake in reply to his inquiries he was informed that he was on board of a portuguese ship bound to lisbon having been taken senseless from a wreck drifting about the ocean  don fernando was confounded and perplexed he retraced every thing distinctly that had happened to him in the island of the seven cities and until he had retired to rest on board of the caravel had his vessel been driven from her anchors and wrecked during his sleep the people about him could give him no information on the subject he talked to them of the island of the seven cities and of all that had befallen him there they regarded his words as the ravings of delirium and in their honest solicitude administered such rough remedies that he was fain to drop the subject and observe a cautious taciturnity  at length they arrived in the tagus and anchored before the famous city of lisbon don fernando sprang joyfully on shore and hastened to his ancestral mansion to his surprise it was inhabited by strangers and when he asked about his family no one could give him any information concerning them  he now sought the mansion of don ramiro for the temporary flame kindled by the bright eyes of the alcaydes daughter had long since burnt itself out and his genuine passion for serafina had revived with all its fervor he approached the balcony beneath which he had so often serenaded her did his eyes deceive him no there was serafina herself at the balcony an exclamation of rapture burst from him as he raised his arms toward her she cast upon him a look of indignation and hastily retiring closed the casement could she have heard of his flirtation with the alcaydes daughter he would soon dispel every doubt of his constancy the door was open he rushed upstairs and entering the room threw himself at her feet she shrank back with affright and took refuge in the arms of a youthful cavalier  what mean you sir cried the latter by this intrusion  what right have you replied don fernando to ask the question  the right of an affianced suitor  don fernando started and turned pale oh serafina serafina cried he in a tone of agony is this thy plighted constancy  serafinawhat mean you by serafina if it be this young lady you intend her name is maria  is not this serafina alvarez and is not that her portrait cried don fernando pointing to a picture of his mistress  holy virgin cried the young lady he is talking of my greatgrandmother  an explanation ensued if that could be called an explanation which plunged the unfortunate fernando into tenfold perplexity if he might believe his eyes he saw before him his beloved serafina if he might believe his ears it was merely her hereditary form and features perpetuated in the person of her greatgranddaughter  his brain began to spin he sought tho office of the minister of marine and made a report of his expedition and of the island of the seven cities which he had so fortunately discovered no body knew any thing of such an expedition or such an island he declared that he had undertaken the enterprise under a formal contract with the crown and had received a regular commission constituting him adelantado this must be matter of record and he insisted loudly that the books of the department should be consulted the wordy strife at length attracted the attention of an old grayheaded clerk who sat perched on a high stool at a high desk with ironrimmed spectacles on the top of a thin pinched nose copying records into an enormous folio he had wintered and summered in the department for a great part of a century until he had almost grown to be a piece of the desk at which he sat his memory was a mere index of official facts and documents and his brain was little better than red tape and parchment after peering down for a time from his lofty perch and ascertaining the matter in controversy he put his pen behind his ear and descended he remembered to have heard something from his predecessor about an expedition of the kind in question but then it had sailed during the reign of don ioam ii and he had been dead at least a hundred years to put the matter beyond dispute however the archives of the torve do tombo that sepulchre of old portuguese documents were diligently searched and a record was found of a contract between the crown and one fernando de ulmo for the discovery of the island of the seven cities and of a commission secured to him as adelantado of the country he might discover  there cried don fernando triumphantly there you have proof before your own eyes of what i have said i am the fernando de ulmo specified in that record i have discovered the island of the seven cities and am entitled to be adelantado according to contract  the story of don fernando had certainly what is pronounced the best of historical foundation documentary evidence but when a man in the bloom of youth talked of events that had taken place above a century previously as having happened to himself it is no wonder that he was set down for a mad man  the old clerk looked at him from above and below his spectacles shrugged his shoulders stroked his chin reascended his lofty stool took the pen from behind his ears and resumed his daily and eternal task copying records into the fiftieth volume of a series of gigantic folios the other clerks winked at each other shrewdly and dispersed to their several places and poor don fernando thus left to himself flung out of the office almost driven wild by these repeated perplexities  in the confusion of his mind he instinctively repaired to the mansion of alvarez but it was barred against him to break the delusion under which the youth apparently labored and to convince him that the serafina about whom he raved was really dead he was conducted to her tomb there she lay a stately matron cut out in alabaster and there lay her husband beside her a portly cavalier in armor and there knelt on each side the effigies of a numerous progeny proving that she had been a fruitful vine even the very monument gave proof of the lapse of time for the hands of her husband which were folded as if in prayer had lost their fingers and the face of the once lovely serafina was noseless  don fernando felt a transient glow of indignation at beholding this monumental proof of the inconstancy of his mistress but who could expect a mistress to remain constant during a whole century of absence and what right had he to rail about constancy after what had passed between him and the alcaydes daughter the unfortunate cavalier performed one pious act of tender devotion he had the alabaster nose of serafina restored by a skilful statuary and then tore himself from the tomb  he could now no longer doubt the fact that somehow or other he had skipped over a whole century during the night he had spent at the island of the seven cities and he was now as complete a stranger in his native city as if he had never been there a thousand times did he wish himself back to that wonderful island with its antiquated banquet halls where he had been so courteously received and now that the once young and beautiful serafina was nothing but a greatgrandmother in marble with generations of descendants a thousand times would he recall the melting black eyes of the alcaydes daughter who doubtless like himself was still flourishing in fresh juvenility and breathe a secret wish that he were seated by her side  he would at once have set on foot another expedition at his own expense to cruise in search of the sainted island but his means were exhausted he endeavored to rouse others to the enterprise setting forth the certainty of profitable results of which his own experience furnished such unquestionable proof alas no one would give faith to his tale but looked upon it as the feverish dream of a shipwrecked man he persisted in his efforts holding forth in all places and all companies until he became an object of jest and jeer to the lightminded who mistook his earnest enthusiasm for a proof of insanity and the very children in the streets bantered him with the title of the adelantado of the seven cities  finding all his efforts in vain in his native city of lisbon he took shipping for the canaries as being nearer the latitude of his former cruise and inhabited by people given to nautical adventure here he found ready listeners to his story for the old pilots and mariners of those parts were notorious islandhunters and devout believers in all the wonders of the seas indeed one and all treated his adventure as a common occurrence and turning to each other with a sagacious nod of the head observed he has been at the island of st brandan  they then went on to inform him of that great marvel and enigma of the ocean of its repeated appearance to the inhabitants of their islands and of the many but ineffectual expeditions that had been made in search of it they took him to a promontory of the island of palma from whence the shadowy st brandan had oftenest been descried and they pointed out the very tract in the west where its mountains had been seen  don fernando listened with rapt attention he had no longer a doubt that this mysterious and fugacious island must be the same with that of the seven cities and that there must be some supernatural influence connected with it that had operated upon himself and made the events of a night occupy the space of a century  he endeavored but in vain to rouse the islanders to another attempt at discovery they had given up the phantom island as indeed inaccessible fernando however was not to be discouraged the idea wore itself deeper and deeper in his mind until it became the engrossing subject of his thoughts and object of his being every morning he would repair to the promontory of palma and sit there throughout the livelong day in hopes of seeing the fairy mountains of st brandan peering above the horizon every evening he returned to his home a disappointed man but ready to resume his post on the following morning  his assiduity was all in vain he grew gray in his ineffectual attempt and was at length found dead at his post his grave is still shown in the island of palma and a cross is erected on the spot where he used to sit and look out upon the sea in hopes of the reappearance of the enchanted island                                       national nomenclature  to the editor of the knickerbocker  sir i am somewhat of the same way of thinking in regard to names with that profound philosopher mr shandy the elder who maintained that some inspired high thoughts and heroic aims while others entailed irretrievable meanness and vulgarity insomuch that a man might sink under the insignificance of his name and be absolutely nicodemused into nothing i have ever therefore thought it a great hardship for a man to be obliged to struggle through life with some ridiculous or ignoble christian name as it is too often falsely called inflicted on him in infancy when he could not choose for himself and would give him free liberty to change it for one more to his taste when he had arrived at years of discretion  i have the same notion with respect to local names some at once prepossess us in favor of a place others repel us by unlucky associations of the mind and i have known scenes worthy of being the very haunt of poetry and romance yet doomed to irretrievable vulgarity by some illchosen name which not even the magic numbers of a halleck or a bryant could elevate into poetical acceptation  this is an evil unfortunately too prevalent throughout our country nature has stamped the land with features of sublimity and beauty but some of our noblest mountains and loveliest streams are in danger of remaining for ever unhonored and unsung from bearing appellations totally abhorrent to the muse in the first place our country is deluged with names taken from places in the old world and applied to places having no possible affinity or resemblance to their namesakes this betokens a forlorn poverty of invention and a secondhand spirit content to cover its nakedness with borrowed or castoff clothes of europe  then we have a shallow affectation of scholarship the whole catalogue of ancient worthies is shaken out from the back of lemprieres classical dictionary and a wide region of wild country sprinkled over with the names of the heroes poets and sages of antiquity jumbled into the most whimsical juxtaposition then we have our political godfathers topographical engineers perhaps or persons employed by government to survey and lay out townships these forsooth glorify the patrons that give them bread so we have the names of the great official men of the day scattered over the land as if they were the real salt of the earth with which it was to be seasoned well for us is it when these official great men happen to have names of fair acceptation but wo unto us should a tubbs or a potts be in power we are sure in a little while to find tubbsvilles and pottsylvanias springing up in every direction  under these melancholy dispensations of taste and loyalty therefore mr editor it is with a feeling of dawning hope that i have lately perceived the attention of persons of intelligence beginning to be awakened on this subject i trust if the matter should once be taken up it will not be readily abandoned we are yet young enough as a country to remedy and reform much of what has been done and to release many of our rising towns and cities and our noble streams from names calculated to vulgarize the land  i have on a former occasion suggested the expediency of searching out the original indian names of places and wherever they are striking and euphonious and those by which they have been superseded are glaringly objectionable to restore them they would have the merit of originality and of belonging to the country and they would remain as reliques of the native lords of the soil when every other vestige had disappeared many of these names may easily be regained by reference to old title deeds and to the archives of states and counties in my own case by examining the records of the county clerks office i have discovered the indian names of various places and objects in the neighborhood and have found them infinitely superior to the trite povertystricken names which had been given by the settlers a beautiful pastoral stream for instance which winds for many a mile through one of the loveliest little valleys in the state has long been known by the commonplace name of the sawmill river in the old indian grants it is designated as the neperan another a perfectly wizard stream which winds through the wildest recesses of sleepy hollow bears the humdrum name of mill creek in the indian grants it sustains the euphonious title of the pocantico  similar researches have released longisland from many of those paltry and vulgar names which fringed its beautiful shores their cow bays and cow necks and oyster ponds and mosquito coves which spread a spell of vulgarity over the whole island and kept persons of taste and fancy at a distance  it would be an object worthy the attention of the historical societies which are springing up in various parts of the union to have maps executed of their respective states or neighborhoods in which all the indian local names should as far as possible be restored in fact it appears to me that the nomenclature of the country is almost of sufficient importance for the foundation of a distinct society or rather a corresponding association of persons of taste and judgment of all parts of the union such an association if properly constituted and composed comprising especially all the literary talent of the country though it might not have legislative power in its enactments yet would have the allpervading power of the press and the changes in nomenclature which it might dictate being at once adopted by elegant writers in prose and poetry and interwoven with the literature of the country would ultimately pass into popular currency  should such a reforming association arise i beg to recommend to its attention all those mongrel names that have the adjective new prefixed to them and pray they may be one and all kicked out of the country i am for none of these secondhand appellations that stamp us a secondhand people and that are to perpetuate us a new country to the end of time odds my life mr editor i hope and trust we are to live to be an old nation as well as our neighbors and have no idea that our cities when they shall have attained to venerable antiquity shall still be dubbed newyork and newlondon and new this and new that like the pontneuf the new bridge at paris which is the oldest bridge in that capital or like the vicar of wakefields horse which continued to be called the colt until he died of old age  speaking of newyork reminds me of some observations which i met with some time since in one of the public papers about the name of our state and city the writer proposes to substitute for the present names those of the state of ontario and the city of manhattan i concur in his suggestion most heartily though born and brought up in the city of newyork and though i love every stick and stone about it yet i do not nor ever did relish its name i like neither its sound nor its significance as to its significance the very adjective new gives to our great commercial metropolis a secondhand character as if referring to some older more dignified and important place of which it was a mere copy though in fact if i am rightly informed the whole name commemorates a grant by charles ii to his brother the duke of york made in the spirit of royal munificence of a tract of country which did not belong to him as to the sound what can you make of it either in poetry or prose newyork why sir if it were to share the fate of troy itself to suffer a ten years siege and be sacked and plundered no modern homer would ever be able to elevate the name to epic dignity  now sir ontario would be a name worthy of the empire state it bears with it the majesty of that internal sea which washes our northwestern shore or if any objection should be made from its not being completely embraced within our boundaries there is the mohegan one of the indian names for that glorious river the hudson which would furnish an excellent state appellation so also newyork might be called manhatta as it is named in some of the early records and manhattan used as the adjective manhattan however stands well as a substantive and manhattanese which i observe mr cooper has adopted in some of his writings would be a very good appellation for a citizen of the commercial metropolis  a word or two more mr editor and i have done we want a national name we want it poetically and we want it politically with the poetical necessity of the case i shall not trouble myself i leave it to our poets to tell how they manage to steer that collocation of words the united states of north america down the swelling tide of song and to float the whole raft out upon the sea of heroic poesy i am now speaking of the mere purposes of common life how is a citizen of this republic to designate himself as an american there are two americas each subdivided into various empires rapidly rising in importance as a citizen of the united states it is a clumsy lumbering title yet still it is not distinctive for we have now the united states of central america and heaven knows how many united states may spring up under the proteus changes of spanish america  this may appear matter of small concernment but any one that has travelled in foreign countries must be conscious of the embarrassment and circumlocution sometimes occasioned by the want of a perfectly distinct and explicit national appellation in france when i have announced myself as an american i have been supposed to belong to one of the french colonies in spain to be from mexico or peru or some other spanishamerican country repeatedly have i found myself involved in a long geographical and political definition of my national identity  now sir meaning no disrespect to any of our coheirs of this great quarter of the world i am for none of this coparceny in a name that is to mingle us up with the riffraff colonies and offsets of every nation of europe the title of american may serve to tell the quarter of the world to which i belong the same as a frenchman or an englishman may call himself a european but i want my own peculiar national name to rally under i want an appellation that shall tell at once and in a way not to be mistaken that i belong to this very portion of america geographical and political to which it is my pride and happiness to belong that i am of the anglosaxon race which founded this anglosaxon empire in the wilderness and that i have no part or parcel with any other race or empire spanish french or portuguese in either of the americas such an appellation sir would have magic in it it would bind every part of the confederacy together as with a keystone it would be a passport to the citizen of our republic throughout the world  we have it in our power to furnish ourselves with such a national appellation from one of the grand and eternal features of our country from that noble chain of mountains which formed its backbone and ran through the old confederacy when it first declared our national independence i allude to the appalachian or alleghany mountains we might do this without any very inconvenient change in our present titles we might still use the phrase the united states substituting appalachia or alleghania i should prefer the latter in place of america the title of appalachian or alleghanian would still announce us as americans but would specify us as citizens of the great republic even our old national cypher of u s a might remain unaltered designating the united states of alleghania  these are crude ideas mr editor hastily thrown out to elicit the ideas of others and to call attention to a subject of more national importance than may at first be supposed  very respectfully yours  geoffrey crayon                                       desultory thoughts on criticism  let a man write never so well there are nowadays a sort of persons they call critics that egad have no more wit in them than so many hobbyhorses but theyll laugh at you sir and find fault and censure things that egad im sure they are not able to do themselves a sort of envious persons that emulate the glories of persons of parts and think to build their fame by calumniation of persons that egad to my knowledge of all persons in the world are in nature the persons that do as much despise all that asain fine ill say no more of em rehearsal  all the world knows the story of the tempesttossed voyager who coming upon a strange coast and seeing a man hanging in chains hailed it with joy as the sign of a civilized country in like manner we may hail as a proof of the rapid advancement of civilization and refinement in this country the increasing number of delinquent authors daily gibbeted for the edification of the public  in this respect as in every other we are going ahead with accelerated velocity and promising to outstrip the superannuated countries of europe it is really astonishing to see the number of tribunals incessantly springing up for the trial of literary offences independent of the high courts of oyer and terminer the great quarterly reviews we have innumerable minor tribunals monthly and weekly down to the piepoudre courts in the daily papers insomuch that no culprit stands so little chance of escaping castigation as an unlucky author guilty of an unsuccessful attempt to please the public  seriously speaking however it is questionable whether our national literature is sufficiently advanced to bear this excess of criticism and whether it would not thrive better if allowed to spring up for some time longer in the freshness and vigor of native vegetation when the worthy judge coulter of virginia opened court for the first time in one of the upper counties he was for enforcing all the rules and regulations that had grown into use in the old longsettled counties this is all very well said a shrewd old farmer but let me tell you judge coulter you set your coulter too deep for a new soil  for my part i doubt whether either writer or reader is benefited by what is commonly called criticism the former is rendered cautious and distrustful he fears to give way to those kindling emotions and brave sallies of thought which bear him up to excellence the latter is made fastidious and cynical or rather he surrenders his own independent taste and judgment and learns to like and dislike at second hand  let us for a moment consider the nature of this thing called criticism which exerts such a sway over the literary world the pronoun we used by critics has a most imposing and delusive sound the reader pictures to himself a conclave of learned men deliberating gravely and scrupulously on the merits of the book in question examining it page by page comparing and balancing their opinions and when they have united in a conscientious verdict publishing it for the benefit of the world whereas the criticism is generally the crude and hasty production of an individual scribbling to while away an idle hour to oblige a bookseller or to defray current expenses how often is it the passing notion of the hour affected by accidental circumstances by indisposition by peevishness by vapors or indigestion by personal prejudice or party feeling sometimes a work is sacrificed because the reviewer wishes a satirical article sometimes because he wants a humorous one and sometimes because the author reviewed has become offensively celebrated and offers high game to the literary marksman  how often would the critic himself if a conscientious man reverse his opinion had he time to revise it in a more sunny moment but the press is waiting the printers devil is at his elbow the article is wanted to make the requisite variety for the number of the review or the author has pressing occasion for the sum he is to receive for the article so it is sent off all blotted and blurred with a shrug of the shoulders and the consolatory ejaculation pshaw curse it its nothing but a review  the critic too who dictates thus oracularly to the world is perhaps some dingy illfavored illmannered varlet who were he to speak by word of mouth would be disregarded if not scoffed at but such is the magic of types such the mystic operation of anonymous writing such the potential effect of the pronoun we that his crude decisions fulminated through the press become circulated far and wide control the opinions of the world and give or destroy reputation  many readers have grown timorous in their judgments since the allpervading currency of criticism they fear to express a revised frank opinion about any new work and to relish it honestly and heartily lest it should be condemned in the next review and they stand convicted of bad taste hence they hedge their opinions like a gambler his bets and leave an opening to retract and retreat and qualify and neutralise every unguarded expression of delight until their very praise declines into a faintness that is damning  were every one on the contrary to judge for himself and speak his mind frankly and fearlessly we should have more true criticism in the world than at present whenever a person is pleased with a work he may be assured that it has good qualities an author who pleases a variety of readers must possess substantial powers of pleasing or in other words intrinsic merits for otherwise we acknowledge an effect and deny the cause the reader therefore should not suffer himself to be readily shaken from the conviction of his own feelings by the sweeping censures of pseudo critics the author he has admired may be chargeable with a thousand faults but it is nevertheless beauties and excellencies that have excited his admiration and he should recollect that taste and judgment are as much evinced in the perception of beauties among defects as in a detection of defects among beauties for my part i honor the blessed and blessing spirit that is quick to discover and extol all that is pleasing and meritorious give me the honest bee that extracts honey from the humblest weed but save me from the ingenuity of the spider which traces its venom even in the midst of a flowergarden  if the mere fact of being chargeable with faults and imperfections is to condemn an author who is to escape the greatest writers of antiquity have in this way been obnoxious to criticism aristotle himself has been accused of ignorance aristophanes of impiety and buffoonery virgil of plagiarism and a want of invention horace of obscurity cicero has been said to want vigor and connexion and demosthenes to be deficient in nature and in purity of language yet these have all survived the censures of the critic and flourished on to a glorious immortality every now and then the world is startled by some new doctrines in matters of taste some levelling attacks on established creeds some sweeping denunciations of whole generations or schools of writers as they are called who had seemed to be embalmed and canonized in public opinion such has been the case for instance with pope and dryden and addison who for a time have almost been shaken from their pedestals and treated as false idols  it is singular also to see the fickleness of the world with respect to its favorites enthusiasm exhausts itself and prepares the way for dislike the public is always for positive sentiments and new sensations when wearied of admiring it delights to censure thus coining a double set of enjoyments out of the same subject scott and byron are scarce cold in their graves and already we find criticism beginning to call in question those powers which held the world in magic thraldom even in our own country one of its greatest geniuses has had some rough passages with the censors of the press and instantly criticism begins to unsay all that it has repeatedly said in his praise and the public are almost led to believe that the pen which has so often delighted them is absolutely destitute of the power to delight  if then such reverses in opinion as to matters of taste can be so readily brought about when may an author feel himself secure where is the anchoringground of popularity when he may thus be driven from his moorings and foundered even in harbor the reader too when he is to consider himself safe in admiring when he sees longestablished altars overthrown and his household deities dashed to the ground  there is one consolatory reflection every abuse carries with it its own remedy or palliation thus the excess of crude and hasty criticism which has of late prevailed throughout the literary world and threatened to overrun our country begins to produce its own antidote where there is a multiplicity of contradictory paths a man must make his choice in so doing he has to exercise his judgment and that is one great step to mental independence he begins to doubt all where all differ and but one can be in the right he is driven to trust to his own discernment and his natural feelings and here he is most likely to be safe the author too finding that what is condemned at one tribunal is applauded at another though perplexed for a time gives way at length to the spontaneous impulse of his genius and the dictates of his taste and writes in the way most natural to himself it is thus that criticism which by its severity may have held the little world of writers in check may by its very excess disarm itself of its terrors and the hardihood of talent become restored  gc                                       spanish romance  to the editor of the knickerbocker  sir i have already given you a legend or two drawn from ancient spanish sources and may occasionally give you a few more i love these old spanish themes especially when they have a dash of the morisco in them and treat of the times when the moslems maintained a foothold in the peninsula they have a high spicy oriental flavor not to be found in any other themes that are merely european in fact spain is a country that stands alone in the midst of europe severed in habits manners and modes of thinking from all its continental neighbors it is a romantic country but its romance has none of the sentimentality of modern european romance it is chiefly derived from the brilliant regions of the east and from the highminded school of saracenic chivalry  the arab invasion and conquest brought a higher civilization and a nobler style of thinking into gothic spain the arabs were a quickwitted sagacious proudspirited and poetical people and were imbued with oriental science and literature wherever they established a seat of power it became a rallying place for the learned and ingenious and they softened and refined the people whom they conquered by degrees occupancy seemed to give them a hereditary right to their foothold in the land they ceased to be looked upon as invaders and were regarded as rival neighbors the peninsula broken up into a variety of states both christian and moslem became for centuries a great campaigning ground where the art of war seemed to be the principal business of man and was carried to the highest pitch of romantic chivalry the original ground of hostility a difference of faith gradually lost its rancor neighboring states of opposite creeds were occasionally linked together in alliances offensive and defensive so that the cross and crescent were to be seen side by side fighting against some common enemy in times of peace too the noble youth of either faith resorted to the same cities christian or moslem to school themselves in military science even in the temporary truces of sanguinary wars the warriors who had recently striven together in the deadly conflicts of the field laid aside their animosity met at tournaments jousts and other military festivities and exchanged the courtesies of gentle and generous spirits thus the opposite races became frequently mingled together in peaceful intercourse or if any rivalry took place it was in those high courtesies and nobler acts which bespeak the accomplished cavalier warriors of opposite creeds became ambitious of transcending each other in magnanimity as well as valor indeed the chivalric virtues were refined upon to a degree sometimes fastidious and constrained but at other times inexpressibly noble and affecting the annals of the times teem with illustrious instances of highwrought courtesy romantic generosity lofty disinterestedness and punctilious honor that warm the very soul to read them these have furnished themes for national plays and poems or have been celebrated in those allpervading ballads which are as the lifebreath of the people and thus have continued to exercise an influence on the national character which centuries of vicissitude and decline have not been able to destroy so that with all their faults and they are many the spaniards even at the present day are on many points the most highminded and proudspirited people of europe it is true the romance of feeling derived from the sources i have mentioned has like all other romance its affectations and extremes it renders the spaniard at times pompous and grandiloquent prone to carry the pundonor or point of honor beyond the bounds of sober sense and sound morality disposed in the midst of poverty to affect the grande caballero and to look down with sovereign disdain upon arts mechanical and all the gainful pursuits of plebeian life but this very inflation of spirit while it fills his brain with vapors lifts him above a thousand meannesses and though it often keeps him in indigence ever protects him from vulgarity  in the present day when popular literature is running into the low levels of life and luxuriating on the vices and follies of mankind and when the universal pursuit of gain is trampling down the early growth of poetic feeling and wearing out the verdure of the soul i question whether it would not be of service for the reader occasionally to turn to these records of prouder times and loftier modes of thinking and to steep himself to the very lips in old spanish romance  for my own part i have a shelf or two of venerable parchmentbound tomes picked up here and there about the peninsula and filled with chronicles plays and ballads about moors and christians which i keep by me as mental tonics in the same way that a provident housewife has her cupboard of cordials whenever i find my mind brought below par by the commonplace of everyday life or jarred by the sordid collisions of the world or put out of tune by the shrewd selfishness of modern utilitarianism i resort to these venerable tomes as did the worthy hero of la mancha to his books of chivalry and refresh and tone up my spirit by a deep draught of their contents they have some such effect upon me as falstaff ascribes to a good sherris sack warming the blood and filling the brain with fiery and delectable shapes  i here subjoin mr editor a small specimen of the cordials i have mentioned just drawn from my spanish cupboard which i recommend to your palate if you find it to your taste you may pass it on to your readers    your correspondent and wellwisher   geoffrey crayon                                       legend of don munio sancho de hinojosa  by the author of the sketchbook  in the cloisters of the ancient benedictine convent of san domingo at silos in castile are the mouldering yet magnificent monuments of the once powerful and chivalrous family of hinojosa among these reclines the marble figure of a knight in complete armor with the hands pressed together as if in prayer on one side of his tomb is sculptured in relief a band of christian cavaliers capturing a cavalcade of male and female moors on the other side the same cavaliers are represented kneeling before an altar the tomb like most of the neighboring monuments is almost in ruins and the sculpture is nearly unintelligible excepting to the keen eye of the antiquary the story connected with the sepulchre however is still preserved in the old spanish chronicles and is to the following purport                                       in old times several hundred years ago there was a noble castilian cavalier named don munio sancho de hinojosa lord of a border castle which had stood the brunt of many a moorish foray he had seventy horsemen as his household troops all of the ancient castilian proof stark warriors hard riders and men of iron with these he scoured the moorish lands and made his name terrible throughout the borders his castle hall was covered with banners and scimitars and moslem helms the trophies of his prowess don munio was moreover a keen huntsman and rejoiced in hounds of all kinds steeds for the chase and hawks for the towering sport of falconry when not engaged in warfare his delight was to beat up the neighboring forests and scarcely ever did he ride forth without hound and horn a boarspear in his hand or a hawk upon his fist and an attendant train of huntsmen  his wife donna maria palacin was of a gentle and timid nature little fitted to be the spouse of so hardy and adventurous a knight and many a tear did the poor lady shed when he sallied forth upon his daring enterprises and many a prayer did she offer up for his safety  as this doughty cavalier was one day hunting he stationed himself in a thicket on the borders of a green glade of the forest and dispersed his followers to rouse the game and drive it toward his stand he had not been here long when a cavalcade of moors of both sexes came prankling over the forest lawn they were unarmed and magnificently dressed in robes of tissue and embroidery rich shawls of india bracelets and anklets of gold and jewels that sparkled in the sun  at the head of this gay cavalcade rode a youthful cavalier superior to the rest in dignity and loftiness of demeanor and in splendor of attire beside him was a damsel whose veil blown aside by the breeze displayed a face of surpassing beauty and eyes cast down in maiden modesty yet beaming with tenderness and joy  don munio thanked his stars for sending him such a prize and exulted at the thought of bearing home to his wife the glittering spoils of these infidels putting his huntinghorn to his lips he gave a blast that rung through the forest his huntsmen came running from all quarters and the astonished moors were surrounded and made captives  the beautiful moor wrung her hands in despair and her female attendants uttered the most piercing cries the young moorish cavalier alone retained selfpossession he inquired the name of the christian knight who commanded this troop of horsemen when told that it was don munio sancho de hinojosa his countenance lighted up approaching that cavalier and kissing his hand don munio sancho said he i have heard of your fame as a true and valiant knight terrible in arms but schooled in the noble virtues of chivalry such do i trust to find you in me you behold abadil son of a moorish alcayde i am on the way to celebrate my nuptials with this lady chance has thrown us in your power but i confide in your magnanimity take all our treasure and jewels demand what ransom you think proper for our person but suffer us not to be insulted or dishonored  when the good knight heard this appeal and beheld the beauty of the youthful pair his heart was touched with tenderness and courtesy god forbid said he that i should disturb such happy nuptials my prisoners in troth shall ye be for fifteen days and immured within my castle where i claim as conqueror the right of celebrating your espousals  so saying he despatched one of his fleetest horsemen in advance to notify donna maria palacin of the coming of this bridal party while he and his huntsmen escorted the cavalcade not as captors but as a guard of honor as they drew near to the castle the banners were hung out and the trumpets sounded from the battlements and on their nearer approach the drawbridge was lowered and donna maria came forth to meet them attended by her ladies and knights her pages and her minstrels she took the young bride allifra in her arms kissed her with the tenderness of a sister and conducted her into the castle in the mean time don munio sent forth missives in every direction and had viands and dainties of all kinds collected from the country round and the wedding of the moorish lovers was celebrated with all possible state and festivity for fifteen days the castle was given up to joy and revelry there were tiltings and jousts at the ring and bullfights and banquets and dances to the sound of minstrelsy when the fifteen days were at an end he made the bride and bridegroom magnificent presents and conducted them and their attendants safely beyond the borders such in old times were the courtesy and generosity of a spanish cavalier  several years after this event the king of castile summoned his nobles to assist him in a campaign against the moors don munio sancho was among the first to answer to the call with seventy horsemen all staunch and welltried warriors his wife donna maria hung about his neck alas my lord exclaimed she how often wilt thou tempt thy fate and when will thy thirst for glory be appeased  one battle more replied don munio one battle more for the honor of castile and i here make a vow that when this is over i will lay by my sword and repair with my cavaliers in pilgrimage to the sepulchre of our lord at jerusalem the cavaliers all joined with him in the vow and donna maria felt in some degree soothed in spirit still she saw with a heavy heart the departure of her husband and watched his banner with wistful eyes until it disappeared among the trees of the forest  the king of castile led his army to the plains of almanara where they encountered the moorish host near to ucles the battle was long and bloody the christians repeatedly wavered and were as often rallied by the energy of their commanders don munio was covered with wounds but refused to leave the field the christians at length gave way and the king was hardly pressed and in danger of being captured  don munio called upon his cavaliers to follow him to the rescue now is the time cried he to prove your loyalty fall to like brave men we fight for the true faith and if we lose our lives here we gain a better life hereafter  rushing with his men between the king and his pursuers they checked the latter in their career and gave time for their monarch to escape but they fell victims to their loyalty they all fought to the last gasp don munio was singled out by a powerful moorish knight but having been wounded in the right arm he fought to disadvantage and was slain the battle being over the moor paused to possess himself of the spoils of this redoubtable christian warrior when he unlaced the helmet however and beheld the countenance of don munio he gave a great cry and smote his breast woe is me cried he i have slain my benefactor the flower of knightly virtue the most magnanimous of cavaliers                                       while the battle had been raging on the plain of salmanara donna maria palacin remained in her castle a prey to the keenest anxiety her eyes were ever fixed on the road that led from the country of the moors and often she asked the watchman of the tower what seest thou  one evening at the shadowy hour of twilight the warden sounded his horn i see cried he a numerous train winding up the valley there are mingled moors and christians the banner of my lord is in the advance joyful tidings exclaimed the old seneschal my lord returns in triumph and brings captives then the castle courts rang with shouts of joy and the standard was displayed and the trumpets were sounded and the drawbridge was lowered and donna maria went forth with her ladies and her knights and her pages and her minstrels to welcome her lord from the wars but as the train drew nigh she beheld a sumptuous bier covered with black velvet and on it lay a warrior as if taking his repose he lay in his armor with his helmet on his head and his sword in his hand as one who had never been conquered and around the bier were the escutcheons of the house of hinojosa  a number of moorish cavaliers attended the bier with emblems of mourning and with dejected countenances and their leader cast himself at the feet of donna maria and hid his face in his hands she beheld in him the gallant abadil whom she had once welcomed with his bride to her castle but who now came with the body of her lord whom he had unknowingly slain in battle  the sepulchre erected in the cloisters of the convent of san domingo was achieved at the expense of the moor abadil as a feeble testimony of his grief for the death of the good knight don munio and his reverence for his memory the tender and faithful donna maria soon followed her lord to the tomb on one of the stones of a small arch beside his sepulchre is the following simple inscription hic jacet maria palacin uxor munonis sancij de finojosa here lies maria palacin wife of munio sancho de hinojosa  the legend of don munio sancho does not conclude with his death on the same day on which the battle took place on the plain of salmanara a chaplain of the holy temple at jerusalem while standing at the outer gate beheld a train of christian cavaliers advancing as if in pilgrimage the chaplain was a native of spain and as the pilgrims approached he knew the foremost to be don munio sancho de hinojosa with whom he had been well acquainted in former times hastening to the patriarch he told him of the honorable rank of the pilgrims at the gate the patriarch therefore went forth with a grand procession of priests and monks and received the pilgrims with all due honor there were seventy cavaliers beside their leader all stark and lofty warriors they carried their helmets in their hands and their faces were deadly pale they greeted no one nor looked either to the right or to the left but entered the chapel and kneeling before the sepulchre of our saviour performed their orisons in silence when they had concluded they rose as if to depart and the patriarch and his attendants advanced to speak to them but they were no more to be seen every one marvelled what could be the meaning of this prodigy the patriarch carefully noted down the day and sent to castile to learn tidings of don munio sancho de hinojosa he received for reply that on the very day specified that worthy knight with seventy of his followers had been slain in battle these therefore must have been the blessed spirits of those christian warriors come to fulfil their vow of a pilgrimage to the holy sepulchre at jerusalem such was castilian faith in the olden time which kept its word even beyond the grave  if any one should doubt of the miraculous apparition of these phantom knights let him consult the history of the kings of castile and leon by the learned and pious fray prudencio de sandoval bishop of pamplona where he will find it recorded in the history of the king don alonzo vi on the hundred and second page it is too precious a legend to be lightly abandoned to the doubter                                       communipaw  to the editor of the knickerbocker  sir i observe with pleasure that you are performing from time to time a pious duty imposed upon you i may say by the name you have adopted as your titular standard in following in the footsteps of the venerable knickerbocker and gleaning every fact concerning the early times of the manhattoes which may have escaped his hand i trust therefore a few particulars legendary and statistical concerning a place which figures conspicuously in the early pages of his history will not be unacceptable i allude sir to the ancient and renowned village of communipaw which according to the veracious diedrich and to equally veracious tradition was the first spot where our evertobelamented dutch progenitors planted their standard and cast the seeds of empire and from whence subsequently sailed the memorable expedition under oloffe the dreamer which landed on the opposite island of manhatta and founded the present city of newyork the city of dreams and speculations  communipaw therefore may truly be called the parent of newyork yet it is an astonishing fact that though immediately opposite to the great city it has produced from whence its red roofs and tin weathercocks can actually be descried peering above the surrounding apple orchards it should be almost as rarely visited and as little known by the inhabitants of the metropolis as if it had been locked up among the rocky mountains sir i think there is something unnatural in this especially in these times of ramble and research when our citizens are antiquityhunting in every part of the world curiosity like charity should begin at home and i would enjoin it on our worthy burghers especially those of the real knickerbocker breed before they send their sons abroad to wonder and grow wise among the remains of greece and rome to let them make a tour of ancient pavonia from weehawk even to the kills and meditate with filial reverence on the mossgrown mansions of communipaw sir i regard this much neglected village as one of the most remarkable places in the country the intelligent traveller as he looks down upon it from the bergen heights modestly nestled among its cabbagegardens while the great flaunting city it has begotten is stretching far and wide on the opposite side of the bay the intelligent traveller i say will be filled with astonishment not sir at the village of communipaw which in truth is a very small village but at the almost incredible fact that so small a village should have produced so great a city it looks to him indeed like some squat little dame with a tall grenadier of a son strutting by her side or some simplehearted hen that has unwittingly hatched out a longlegged turkey  but this is not all for which communipaw is remarkable sir it is interesting on another account it is to the ancient province of the newnetherlands and the classic era of the dutch dynasty what herculaneum and pompeii are to ancient rome and the glorious days of the empire here every thing remains in statu quo as it was in the days of oloffe the dreamer walter the doubter and the other worthies of the golden age the same broadbrimmed hats and broadbottomed breeches the same kneebuckles and shoebuckles the same closequilled caps and linseywoolsey shortgowns and petticoats the same implements and utensils and forms and fashions in a word communipaw at the present day is a picture of what newamsterdam was before the conquest the intelligent traveller aforesaid as he treads its streets is struck with the primitive character of every thing around him instead of grecian temples for dwellinghouses with a great column of pine boards in the way of every window he beholds high peaked roofs gable ends to the street with weathercocks at top and windows of all sorts and sizes large ones for the grownup members of the family and little ones for the little folk instead of cold marble porches with closelocked doors and brass knockers he sees the doors hospitably open the worthy burgher smoking his pipe on the oldfashioned stoop in front with his vrouw knitting beside him and the cat and her kittens at their feet sleeping in the sunshine  astonished at the obsolete and old world air of every thing around him the intelligent traveller demands how all this has come to pass herculaneum and pompeii remain it is true unaffected by the varying fashions of centuries but they were buried by a volcano and preserved in ashes what charmed spell has kept this wonderful little place unchanged though in sight of the most changeful city in the universe has it too been buried under its cabbagegardens and only dug out in modern days for the wonder and edification of the world the reply involves a point of history worthy of notice and record and reflecting immortal honor on communipaw  at the time when newamsterdam was invaded and conquered by british foes as has been related in the history of the venerable diedrich a great dispersion took place among the dutch inhabitants many like the illustrious peter stuyvesant buried themselves in rural retreats in the bowerie others like wolfert acker took refuge in various remote parts of the hudson but there was one staunch unconquerable band that determined to keep together and preserve themselves like seed corn for the future fructification and perpetuity of the knickerbocker race these were headed by one garret van horne a gigantic dutchman the pelayo of the newnetherlands under his guidance they retreated across the bay and buried themselves among the marshes of ancient pavonia as did the followers of pelayo among the mountains of asturias when spain was overrun by its arabian invaders  the gallant van horne set up his standard at communipaw and invited all those to rally under it who were true nederlanders at heart and determined to resist all foreign intermixture or encroachment a strict nonintercourse was observed with the captured city not a boat ever crossed to it from communipaw and the english language was rigorously tabooed throughout the village and its dependencies every man was sworn to wear his hat cut his coat build his house and harness his horses exactly as his father had done before him and to permit nothing but the dutch language to be spoken in his household  as a citadel of the place and a stronghold for the preservation and defence of every thing dutch the gallant van horne erected a lordly mansion with a chimney perched at every corner which thence derived the aristocratical name of the house of the four chimneys hither he transferred many of the precious reliques of newamsterdam the great roundcrowned hat that once covered the capacious head of walter the doubter and the identical shoe with which peter the headstrong kicked his pusillanimous councillors downstairs st nicholas it is said took this loyal house under his especial protection and a dutch soothsayer predicted that as long as it should stand communipaw would be safe from the intrusion either of briton or yankee  in this house would the gallant van home and his compeers hold frequent councils of war as to the possibility of reconquering the province from the british and here would they sit for hours nay days together smoking their pipes and keeping watch upon the growing city of newyork groaning in spirit whenever they saw a new house erected or ship launched and persuading themselves that admiral van tromp would one day or other arrive to sweep out the invaders with the broom which he carried at his masthead  years rolled by but van tromp never arrived the british strengthened themselves in the land and the captured city flourished under their domination still the worthies of communipaw would not despair something or other they were sure would turn up to restore the power of the hogen mogens the lord statesgeneral so they kept smoking and smoking and watching and watching and turning the same few thoughts over and over in a perpetual circle which is commonly called deliberating in the mean time being hemmed up within a narrow compass between the broad bay and the bergen hills they grew poorer and poorer until they had scarce the wherewithal to maintain their pipes in fuel during their endless deliberations  and now must i relate a circumstance which will call for a little exertion of faith on the part of the reader but i can only say that if he doubts it he had better not utter his doubts in communipaw as it is among the religious beliefs of the place it is in fact nothing more nor less than a miracle worked by the blessed st nicholas for the relief and sustenance of this loyal community  it so happened in this time of extremity that in the course of cleaning the house of the four chimneys by an ignorant housewife who knew nothing of the historic value of the reliques it contained the old hat of walter the doubter and the executive shoe of peter the headstrong were thrown out of doors as rubbish but mark the consequence the good st nicholas kept watch over these precious reliques and wrought out of them a wonderful providence  the hat of walter the doubter falling on a stercoraceous heap of compost in the rear of the house began forthwith to vegetate its broad brim spread forth grandly and exfoliated and its round crown swelled and crimped and consolidated until the whole became a prodigious cabbage rivalling in magnitude the capacious head of the doubter in a word it was the origin of that renowned species of cabbage known by all dutch epicures by the name of the governors head and which is to this day the glory of communipaw  on the other hand the shoe of peter stuyvesant being thrown into the river in front of the house gradually hardened and concreted and became covered with barnacles and at length turned into a gigantic oyster being the progenitor of that illustrious species known throughout the gastronomical world by the name of the governors foot  these miracles were the salvation of communipaw the sages of the place immediately saw in them the hand of st nicholas and understood their mystic signification they set to work with all diligence to cultivate and multiply these great blessings and so abundantly did the gubernatorial hat and shoe fructify and increase that in a little time great patches of cabbages were to be seen extending from the village of communipaw quite to the bergen hills while the whole bottom of the bay in front became a vast bed of oysters ever since that time this excellent community has been divided into two great classes those who cultivate the land and those who cultivate the water the former have devoted themselves to the nurture and edification of cabbages rearing them in all their varieties while the latter have formed parks and plantations under water to which juvenile oysters are transplanted from foreign parts to finish their education  as these great sources of profit multiplied upon their hands the worthy inhabitants of communipaw began to long for a market at which to dispose of their superabundance this gradually produced once more an intercourse with newyork but it was always carried on by the old people and the negroes never would they permit the young folks of either sex to visit the city lest they should get tainted with foreign manners and bring home foreign fashions even to this day if you see an old burgher in the market with hat and garb of antique dutch fashion you may be sure he is one of the old unconquered race of the bitter blood who maintain their stronghold at communipaw  in modern days the hereditary bitterness against the english has lost much of its asperity or rather has become merged in a new source of jealousy and apprehension i allude to the incessant and widespreading irruptions from newengland word has been continually brought back to communipaw by those of the community who return from their trading voyages in cabbages and oysters of the alarming power which the yankees are gaining in the ancient city of newamsterdam elbowing the genuine knickerbockers out of all civic posts of honor and profit bargaining them out of their hereditary homesteads pulling down the venerable houses with crowstep gables which have stood since the time of the dutch rule and erecting instead granite stores and marble banks in a word evincing a deadly determination to obliterate every vestige of the good old dutch times  in consequence of the jealousy thus awakened the worthy traders from communipaw confine their dealings as much as possible to the genuine dutch families if they furnish the yankees at all it is with inferior articles never can the latter procure a real governors head or governors foot though they have offered extravagant prices for the same to grace their table on the annual festival of the newengland society  but what has carried this hostility to the yankees to the highest pitch was an attempt made by that allpervading race to get possession of communipaw itself yes sir during the late mania for land speculation a daring company of yankee projectors landed before the village stopped the honest burghers on the public highway and endeavored to bargain them out of their hereditary acres displayed lithographic maps in which their cabbagegardens were laid out into town lots their oysterparks into docks and quays and even the house of the four chimneys metamorphosed into a bank which was to enrich the whole neighborhood with paper money  fortunately the gallant van hornes came to the rescue just as some of the worthy burghers were on the point of capitulating the yankees were put to the rout with signal confusion and have never since dared to show their faces in the place the good people continue to cultivate their cabbages and rear their oysters they know nothing of banks nor joint stock companies but treasure up their money in stockingfeet at the bottom of the family chest or bury it in iron pots as did their fathers and grandfathers before them  as to the house of the four chimneys it still remains in the great and tall family of the van hornes here are to be seen ancient dutch corner cupboards chests of drawers and massive clothespresses quaintly carved and carefully waxed and polished together with divers thick blackletter volumes with brass clasps printed of yore in leydon and amsterdam and handed down from generation to generation in the family but never read they are preserved in the archives among sundry old parchment deeds in dutch and english bearing the seals of the early governors of the province  in this house the primitive dutch holidays of paas and pinxter are faithfully kept up and newyear celebrated with cookies and cherrybounce nor is the festival of the blessed st nicholas forgotten when all the children are sure to hang up their stockings and to have them filled according to their deserts though it is said the good saint is occasionally perplexed in his nocturnal visits which chimney to descend  of late this portentous mansion has begun to give signs of dilapidation and decay some have attributed this to the visits made by the young people to the city and their bringing thence various modern fashions and to their neglect of the dutch language which is gradually becoming confined to the older persons in the community the house too was greatly shaken by high winds during the prevalence of the speculation mania especially at the time of the landing of the yankees seeing how mysteriously the fate of communipaw is identified with this venerable mansion we cannot wonder that the older and wiser heads of the community should be filled with dismay whenever a brick is toppled down from one of the chimneys or a weathercock is blown off from a gableend  the present lord of this historic pile i am happy to say is calculated to maintain it in all its integrity he is of patriarchal age and is worthy of the days of the patriarchs he has done his utmost to increase and multiply the true race in the land his wife has not been inferior to him in zeal and they are surrounded by a goodly progeny of children and grandchildren and greatgrandchildren who promise to perpetuate the name of van horne until time shall be no more so be it long may the horn of the van hornes continue to be exalted in the land tall as they are may their shadows never be less may the house of the four chimneys remain for ages the citadel of communipaw and the smoke of its chimneys continue to ascend a sweetsmelling incense in the hose of st nicholas  with great respect mr editor  your obt servant  hermanus vanderdonk                                       conspiracy of the cocked hats  to the editor of the knickerbocker  sir i have read with great satisfaction the valuable paper of your correspondent mr hermanus vanderdonk who i take it is a descendant of the learned adrian vanderdonk one of the early historians of the nieuwnederlands giving sundry particulars legendary and statistical touching the venerable village of communipaw and its fatebound citadel the house of the four chimneys it goes to prove what i have repeatedly maintained that we live in the midst of history and mystery and romance and that there is no spot in the world more rich in themes for the writer of historic novels heroic melodramas and roughshod epics than this same businesslooking city of the manhattoes and its environs he who would find these elements however must not seek them among the modern improvements and modern people of this moneyed metropolis but must dig for them as for kidd the pirates treasures in outoftheway places and among the ruins of the past  poetry and romance received a fatal blow at the overthrow of the ancient dutch dynasty and have ever since been gradually withering under the growing domination of the yankees they abandoned our hearths when the old dutch tiles were superseded by marble chimneypieces when brass andirons made way for polished grates and the crackling and blazing fire of nutwood gave place to the smoke and stench of liverpool coal and on the downfall of the last gableend house their requiem was tolled from the tower of the dutch church in nassaustreet by the old bell that came from holland but poetry and romance still live unseen among us or seen only by the enlightened few who are able to contemplate this city and its environs through the medium of tradition and clothed with the associations of foregone ages  would you seek these elements in the country mr editor avoid all turnpikes railroads and steamboats those abominable inventions by which the usurping yankees are strengthening themselves in the land and subduing every thing to utility and commonplace avoid all towns and cities of white clapboard palaces and grecian temples studded with academics seminaries and institutes which glisten along our bays and rivers these are the strongholds of yankee usurpation but if haply you light upon some rough rambling road winding between stone fences gray with moss and overgrown with elder pokeberry mullein and sweetbriar with here and there a low redroofed whitewashed farmhouse cowering among apple and cherry trees an old stone church with elms willows and buttonwoods as oldlooking as itself and tombstones almost buried in their own graves and peradventure a small log schoolhouse at a crossroad where the english is still taught with a thickness of the tongue instead of a twang of the nose should you i say light upon such a neighborhood mr editor you may thank your stars that you have found one of the lingering haunts of poetry and romance  your correspondent sir has touched upon that sublime and affecting feature in the history of communipaw the retreat of the patriotic band of nederlanders led by van horne whom he justly terms the pelayo of the newnetherlands he has given you a picture of the manner in which they ensconced themselves in the house of the four chimneys and awaited with heroic patience and perseverance the day that should see the flag of the hogen mogens once more floating on the fort of newamsterdam  your correspondent sir has but given you a glimpse over the threshold i will now let you into the heart of the mystery of this most mysterious and eventful village    yes sir i will nowunclasp a secret book   and to your quick conceiving discontents   ill read you matter deep and dangerous   as full of peril and adventurous spirit   as to oer walk a current roaring loud   on the unsteadfast footing of a spear  sir it is one of the most beautiful and interesting facts connected with the history of communipaw that the early feeling of resistance to foreign rule alluded to by your correspondent is still kept up yes sir a settled secret and determined conspiracy has been going on for generations among this indomitable people the descendants of the refugees from newamsterdam the object of which is to redeem their ancient seat of empire and to drive the losel yankees out of the land  communipaw it is true has the glory of originating this conspiracy and it was hatched and reared in the house of the four chimneys but it has spread far and wide over ancient pavonia surmounted the heights of bergen hoboken and weehawk crept up along the banks of the passaic and the hackensack until it pervades the whole chivalry of the country from tappan slote in the north to piscataway in the south including the pugnacious village of rahway more heroically denominated spanktown  throughout all these regions a great inandin confederacy prevails that is to say a confederacy among the dutch families by dint of diligent and exclusive intermarriage to keep the race pure and to multiply if ever mr editor in the course of your travels between spanktown and tappan slote you should see a cosey loweaved farmhouse teeming with sturdy broadbuilt little urchins you may set it down as one of the breeding places of this grand secret confederacy stocked with the embryo deliverers of newamsterdam  another step in the progress of this patriotic conspiracy is the establishment in various places within the ancient boundaries of the nieuwnederlands of secret or rather mysterious associations composed of the genuine sons of the nederlanders with the ostensible object of keeping up the memory of old times and customs but with the real object of promoting the views of this dark and mighty plot and extending its ramifications throughout the land  sir i am descended from a long line of genuine nederlanders who though they remained in the city of newamsterdam after the conquest and throughout the usurpation have never in their hearts been able to tolerate the yoke imposed upon them my worthy father who was one of the last of the cocked hats had a little knot of cronies of his own stamp who used to meet in our wainscoted parlor round a nutwood fire talk over old times when the city was ruled by its native burgomasters and groan over the monopoly of all places of power and profit by the yankees i well recollect the effect upon this worthy little conclave when the yankees first instituted then newengland society held their national festival toasted their father land and sang their foreign songs of triumph within the very precincts of our ancient metropolis sir from that day my father held the smell of codfish and potatoes and the sight of pumpkin pie in utter abomination and whenever the annual dinner of the newengland society came round it was a sore anniversary for his children he got up in an ill humor grumbled and growled throughout the day and not one of us went to bed that night without having had his jacket well trounced to the tune of the pilgrim fathers  you may judge then mr editor of the exaltation of all true patriots of this stamp when the society of saint nicholas was set up among us and intrepidly established cheek by jole alongside of the society of the invaders never shall i forget the effect upon my father and his little knot of brother groaners when tidings were brought them that the ancient banner of the manhattoes was actually floating from the window of the city hotel sir they nearly jumped out of their silverbuckled shoes for joy they took down their cocked hats from the pegs on which they had hanged them as the israelites of yore hung their harps upon the willows in token of bondage clapped them resolutely once more upon their heads and cocked them in the face of every yankee they met on the way to the banquetingroom  the institution of this society was hailed with transport throughout the whole extent of the newnetherlands being considered a secret foothold gained in newamsterdam and a flattering presage of future triumph whenever that society holds its annual feast a sympathetic hilarity prevails throughout the land ancient pavonia sends over its contributions of cabbages and oysters the house of the four chimneys is splendidly illuminated and the traditional song of st nicholas the mystic bond of union and conspiracy is chaunted with closed doors in every genuine dutch family  i have thus i trust mr editor opened your eyes to some of the grand moral poetical and political phenomena with which you are surrounded you will now be able to read the signs of the times you will now understand what is meant by those knickerbocker halls and knickerbocker hotels and knickerbocker lunches that are daily springing up in our city and what all these knickerbocker omnibuses are driving at you will see in them so many clouds before a storm so many mysterious but sublime intimations of the gathering vengeance of a great though oppressed people above all you will now contemplate our bay and its portentous borders with proper feelings of awe and admiration talk of the bay of naples and its volcanic mountains why sir little communipaw sleeping among its cabbage gardens quiet as gunpowder yet with this tremendous conspiracy brewing in its bosom is an object ten times as sublime in a moral point of view mark me as vesuvius in repose though charged with lava and brimstone and ready for an eruption  let me advert to a circumstance connected with this theme which cannot but be appreciated by every heart of sensibility you must have remarked mr editor on summer evenings and on sunday afternoons certain grave primitivelooking personages walking the battery in close confabulation with their canes behind their backs and ever and anon turning a wistful gaze toward the jersey shore these sir are the sons of saint nicholas the genuine nederlanders who regard communipaw with pious reverence not merely as the progenitor but the destined regenerator of this great metropolis yes sir they are looking with longing eyes to the green marshes of ancient pavonia as did the poor conquered spaniards of yore toward the stern mountains of asturias wondering whether the day of deliverance is at hand many is the time when in my boyhood i have walked with my father and his confidential compeers on the battery and listened to their calculations and conjectures and observed the points of their sharp cocked hats evermore turned toward pavonia nay sir i am convinced that at this moment if i were to take down the cocked hat of my lamented father from the peg on which it has hung for years and were to carry it to the battery its centre point true as the needle to the pole would turn to communipaw  mr editor the great historic drama of newamsterdam is but half acted the reigns of walter the doubter william the testy and peter the headstrong with the rise progress and decline of the dutch dynasty are but so many parts of the main action the triumphant catastrophe of which is yet to come yes sir the deliverance of the newnederlands from yankee domination will eclipse the farfamed redemption of spain from the moors and the oftsung conquest of granada will fade before the chivalrous triumph of newamsterdam would that peter stuyvesant could rise from his grave to witness that day  your humble servant  roloff van ripper                                       p s just as i had concluded the foregoing epistle i received a piece of intelligence which makes me tremble for the fate of communipaw i fear mr editor the grand conspiracy is in danger of being countermined and counteracted by those allpervading and indefatigable yankees would you think it sir one of them has actually effected an entry in the place by covered way or in other words under cover of the petticoats finding every other mode ineffectual he secretly laid siege to a dutch heiress who owns a great cabbagegarden in her own right being a smoothtongued varlet he easily prevailed on her to elope with him and they were privately married at spanktown the first notice the good people of communipaw had of this awful event was a lithographed map of the cabbage garden laid out in town lots and advertised for sale on the night of the wedding the main weathercock of the house of the four chimneys was carried away in a whirlwind the greatest consternation reigns throughout the village                                       a legend of communipaw  to the editor of the knickerbocker magazine  sir i observed in your last months periodical a communication from a mr vanderdonk giving some information concerning communipaw i herewith send you mr editor a legend connected with that place and am much surprised it should have escaped the researches of your very authentic correspondent as it relates to an edifice scarcely less fated than the house of the four chimneys i give you the legend in its crude and simple state as i heard it related it is capable however of being dilated inflated and dressed up into very imposing shape and dimensions should any of your ingenious contributors in this line feel inclined to take it in hand they will find ample materials collateral and illustrative among the papers of the late reinier skaats many years since crier of the court and keeper of the city hall in the city of the manhattoes or in the library of that important and utterly renowned functionary mr jacob hays long time high constable who in the course of his extensive researches has amassed an amount of valuable facts to be rivalled only by that great historical collection the newgate calendar  your humble servant  barent van schaick                                       guests from gibbetisland  a legend of communipaw  whoever has visited the ancient and renowned village of communipaw may have noticed an old stone building of most ruinous and sinister appearance the doors and windowshutters are ready to drop from their hinges old clothes are stuffed in the broken panes of glass while legions of halfstarved dogs prowl about the premises and rush out and bark at every passerby for your beggarly house in a village is most apt to swarm with profligate and illconditioned dogs what adds to the sinister appearance of this mansion is a tall frame in front not a little resembling a gallows and which looks as if waiting to accommodate some of the inhabitants with a wellmerited airing it is not a gallows however but an ancient signpost for this dwelling in the golden days of communipaw was one of the most orderly and peaceful of village taverns where all the public affairs of communipaw were talked and smoked over in fact it was in this very building that oloffe the dreamer and his companions concerted that great voyage of discovery and colonization in which they explored buttermilk channel were nearly shipwrecked in the strait of hellgate and finally landed on the island of manhattan and founded the great city of newamsterdam  even after the province had been cruelly wrested from the sway of their high mightinesses by the combined forces of the british and yankees this tavern continued its ancient loyalty it is true the head of the prince of orange disappeared from the sign a strange bird being painted over it with the explanatory legend of die wilde gans or the wild goose but this all the world knew to be a sly riddle of the landlord the worthy teunis van gieson a knowing man in a small way who laid his finger beside his nose and winked when any one studied the signification of his sign and observed that his goose was hatching but would join the flock whenever they flew over the water an enigma which was the perpetual recreation and delight of the loyal but fatheaded burghers of communipaw  under the sway of this patriotic though discreet and quiet publican the tavern continued to flourish in primeval tranquillity and was the resort of all truehearted nederlanders from all parts of pavonia who met here quietly and secretly to smoke and drink the downfall of briton and yankee and success to admiral van tromp  the only drawback on the comfort of the establishment was a nephew of mine host a sisters son yan yost vanderscamp by name and a real scamp by nature this unlucky whipster showed an early propensity to mischief which he gratified in a small way by playing tricks upon the frequenters of the wild goose putting gunpowder in their pipes or squibs in their pockets and astonishing them with an explosion while they sat nodding round the fireplace in the barroom and if perchance a worthy burgher from some distant part of pavonia had lingered until dark over his potation it was odds but that young vanderscamp would slip a briar under his horses tail as he mounted and send him clattering along the road in neckornothing style to his infinite astonishment and discomfiture  it may be wondered at that mine host of the wild goose did not turn such a graceless varlet out of doors but teunis van gieson was an easytempered man and having no child of his own looked upon his nephew with almost parental indulgence his patience and goodnature were doomed to be tried by another inmate of his mansion this was a crossgrained curmudgeon of a negro named pluto who was a kind of enigma in communipaw where he came from nobody knew he was found one morning after a storm cast like a seamonster on the strand in front of the wild goose and lay there more dead than alive the neighbors gathered round and speculated on this production of the deep whether it were fish or flesh or a compound of both commonly yclept a merman the kindhearted teunis van gieson seeing that he wore the human form took him into his house and warmed him into life by degrees he showed signs of intelligence and even uttered sounds very much like language but which no one in communipaw could understand some thought him a negro just from guinea who had either fallen overboard or escaped from a slaveship nothing however could ever draw from him any account of his origin when questioned on the subject he merely pointed to gibbetisland a small rocky islet which lies in the open bay just opposite to communipaw as if that were his native place though every body knew it had never been inhabited  in the process of time he acquired something of the dutch language that is to say he learnt all its vocabulary of oaths and maledictions with just words sufficient to string them together donder en blicksen thunder and lightning was the gentlest of his ejaculations for years he kept about the wild goose more like one of those familiar spirits or household goblins that we read of than like a human being he acknowledged allegiance to no one but performed various domestic offices when it suited his humor waiting occasionally on the guests grooming the horses cutting wood drawing water and all this without being ordered lay any command on him and the stubborn seaurchin was sure to rebel he was never so much at home however as when on the water plying about in skiff or canoe entirely alone fishing crabbing or grabbing for oysters and would bring home quantities for the larder of the wild goose which he would throw down at the kitchen door with a growl no wind nor weather deterred him from launching forth on his favorite element indeed the wilder the weather the more he seemed to enjoy it if a storm was brewing he was sure to put off from shore and would be seen far out in the bay his light skiff dancing like a feather on the waves when sea and sky were all in a turmoil and the stoutest ships were fain to lower their sails sometimes on such occasions he would be absent for days together how he weathered the tempest and how and where he subsisted no one could divine nor did any one venture to ask for all had an almost superstitious awe of him some of the communipaw oystermen declared that they had more than once seen him suddenly disappear canoe and all as if they plunged beneath the waves and after a while come up again in quite a different part of the bay whence they concluded that he could live under water like that notable species of wild duck commonly called the helldiver all began to consider him in the light of a foulweather bird like the mother careys chicken or stormy petrel and whenever they saw him putting far out in his skiff in cloudy weather made up their minds for a storm  the only being for whom he seemed to have any liking was yan yost vanderscamp and him he liked for his very wickedness he in a manner took the boy under his tutelage prompted him to all kinds of mischief aided him in every wild harumscarum freak until the lad became the complete scapegrace of the village a pest to his uncle and to every one else nor were his pranks confined to the land he soon learned to accompany old pluto on the water together these worthies would cruise about the broad bay and all the neighboring straits and rivers poking around in skiffs and canoes robbing the setnets of the fishermen landing on remote coasts and laying waste orchards and watermelon patches in short carrying on a complete system of piracy on a small scale piloted by pluto the youthful vanderscamp soon became acquainted with all the bays rivers creeks and inlets of the watery world around him could navigate from the hook to spitingdevil on the darkest night and learned to set even the terrors of hellgate at defiance  at length negro and boy suddenly disappeared and days and weeks elapsed but without tidings of them some said they must have run away and gone to sea others jocosely hinted that old pluto being no other than his namesake in disguise had spirited away the boy to the nether regions all however agreed in one thing that the village was well rid of them  in the process of time the good teunis van gieson slept with his fathers and the tavern remained shut up waiting for a claimant for the next heir was yan yost vanderscamp and he had not been heard of for years at length one day a boat was seen pulling for the shore from a long black rakishlooking schooner that lay at anchor in the bay the boats crew seemed worthy of the craft from which they debarked never had such a set of noisy roistering swaggering varlets landed in peaceful communipaw they were outlandish in garb and demeanor and were headed by a rough burly bully ruffian with fiery whiskers a copper nose a scar across his face and a great flaunderish beaver slouched on one side of his head in whom to their dismay the quiet inhabitants were made to recognize their early pest yan yost vanderscamp the rear of this hopeful gang was brought up by old pluto who had lost an eye grown grizzlyheaded and looked more like a devil than ever vanderscamp renewed his acquaintance with the old burghers much against their will and in a manner not at all to their taste he slapped them familiarly on the back gave them an iron grip of the hand and was hail fellow well met according to his own account he had been all the world over had made money by bags full had ships in every sea and now meant to turn the wild goose into a country seat where he and his comrades all rich merchants from foreign parts might enjoy themselves in the interval of their voyages sure enough in a little while there was a complete metamorphose of the wild goose from being a quiet peaceful dutch public house it became a most riotous uproarious private dwelling a complete rendezvous for boisterous men of the seas who came here to have what they called a blow out on dry land and might be seen at all hours lounging about the door or lolling out of the windows swearing among themselves and cracking rough jokes on every passerby the house was fitted up too in so strange a manner hammocks slung to the walls instead of bedsteads odd kinds of furniture of foreign fashion bamboo couches spanish chairs pistols cutlasses and blunderbusses suspended on every peg silver crucifixes on the mantelpieces silver candlesticks and porringers on the tables contrasting oddly with the pewter and delf ware of the original establishment and then the strange amusements of these seamonsters pitching spanish dollars instead of quoits firing blunderbusses out of the window shooting at a mark or at any unhappy dog or cat or pig or barndoor fowl that might happen to come within reach  the only being who seemed to relish their rough waggery was old pluto and yet he led but a dogs life of it for they practised all kinds of manual jokes upon him kicked him about like a football shook him by his grizzly mop of wool and never spoke to him without coupling a curse by way of adjective to his name and consigning him to the infernal regions the old fellow however seemed to like them the better the more they cursed him though his utmost expression of pleasure never amounted to more than the growl of a petted bear when his ears are rubbed  old pluto was the ministering spirit at the orgies of the wild goose and such orgies as took place there such drinking singing whooping swearing with an occasional interlude of quarrelling and fighting the noisier grew the revel the more old pluto plied the potations until the guests would become frantic in their merriment smashing every thing to pieces and throwing the house out of the windows sometimes after a drinking bout they sallied forth and scoured the village to the dismay of the worthy burghers who gathered their women within doors and would have shut up the house vanderscamp however was not to be rebuffed he insisted on renewing acquaintance with his old neighbors and on introducing his friends the merchants to their families swore he was on the lookout for a wife and meant before he stopped to find husbands for all their daughters so willye nilye sociable he was swaggered about their best parlors with his hat on one side of his head sat on the good wifes nicelywaxed mahogany table kicking his heels against the carved and polished legs kissed and tousled the young vrouws and if they frowned and pouted gave them a gold rosary or a sparkling cross to put them in good humor again  sometimes nothing would satisfy him but he must have some of his old neighbors to dinner at the wild goose there was no refusing him for he had got the complete upperhand of the community and the peaceful burghers all stood in awe of him but what a time would the quiet worthy men have among these rakehells who would delight to astound them with the most extravagant gunpowder tales embroidered with all kinds of foreign oaths clink the can with them pledge them in deep potations bawl drinking songs in their ears and occasionally fire pistols over their heads or under the table and then laugh in their faces and ask them how they liked the smell of gunpowder  thus was the little village of communipaw for a time like the unfortunate wight possessed with devils until vanderscamp and his brother merchants would sail on another trading voyage when the wild goose would be shut up and every thing relapse into quiet only to be disturbed by his next visitation  the mystery of all these proceedings gradually dawned upon the tardy intellects of communipaw these were the times of the notorious captain kidd when the american harbors were the resorts of piratical adventurers of all kinds who under pretext of mercantile voyages scoured the west indies made plundering descents upon the spanish main visited even the remote indian seas and then came to dispose of their booty have their revels and fit out new expeditions in the english colonies  vanderscamp had served in this hopeful school and having risen to importance among the bucaniers had pitched upon his native village and early home as a quiet outoftheway unsuspected place where he and his comrades while anchored at new york might have their feasts and concert their plans without molestation  at length the attention of the british government was called to these piratical enterprises that were becoming so frequent and outrageous vigorous measures were taken to check and punish them several of the most noted freebooters were caught and executed and three of vanderscamps chosen comrades the most riotous swashbucklers of the wild goose were hanged in chains on gibbetisland in full sight of their favorite resort as to vanderscamp himself he and his man pluto again disappeared and it was hoped by the people of communipaw that he had fallen in some foreign brawl or been swung on some foreign gallows  for a time therefore the tranquillity of the village was restored the worthy dutchmen once more smoked their pipes in peace eying with peculiar complacency their old pests and terrors the pirates dangling and drying in the sun on gibbetisland  this perfect calm was doomed at length to be ruffled the fiery persecution of the pirates gradually subsided justice was satisfied with the examples that had been made and there was no more talk of kidd and the other heroes of like kidney on a calm summer evening a boat somewhat heavily laden was seen pulling into communipaw what was the surprise and disquiet of the inhabitants to see yan yost vanderscamp seated at the helm and his man pluto tugging at the oars vanderscamp however was apparently an altered man he brought home with him a wife who seemed to be a shrew and to have the upperhand of him he no longer was the swaggering bully ruffian but affected the regular merchant and talked of retiring from business and settling down quietly to pass the rest of his days in his native place  the wild goose mansion was again opened but with diminished splendor and no riot it is true vanderscamp had frequent nautical visitors and the sound of revelry was occasionally overheard in his house but every thing seemed to be done under the rose and old pluto was the only servant that officiated at these orgies the visitors indeed were by no means of the turbulent stamp of their predecessors but quiet mysterious traders full of nods and winks and hieroglyphic signs with whom to use their cant phrase every thing was smug their ships came to anchor at night in the lower bay and on a private signal vanderscamp would launch his boat and accompanied solely by his man pluto would make them mysterious visits sometimes boats pulled in at night in front of the wild goose and various articles of merchandise were landed in the dark and spirited away nobody knew whither one of the more curious of the inhabitants kept watch and caught a glimpse of the features of some of these night visitors by the casual glance of a lantern and declared that he recognized more than one of the freebooting frequenters of the wild goose in former times from whence he concluded that vanderscamp was at his old game and that this mysterious merchandise was nothing more nor less than piratical plunder the more charitable opinion however was that vanderscamp and his comrades having been driven from their old line of business by the oppressions of government had resorted to smuggling to make both ends meet  be that as it may i come now to the extraordinary fact which is the buttend of this story it happened late one night that yan yost vanderscamp was returning across the broad bay in his light skiff rowed by his man pluto he had been carousing on board of a vessel newly arrived and was somewhat obfuscated in intellect by the liquor he had imbibed it was a still sultry night a heavy mass of lurid clouds was rising in the west with the low muttering of distant thunder vanderscamp called on pluto to pull lustily that they might get home before the gathering storm the old negro made no reply but shaped his course so as to skirt the rocky shores of gibbetisland a faint creaking overhead caused vanderscamp to cast up his eyes when to his horror he beheld the bodies of his three pot companions and brothers in iniquity dangling in the moonlight their rags fluttering and their chains creaking as they were slowly swung backward and forward by the rising breeze  what do you mean you blockhead cried vanderscamp by pulling so close to the island  i thought youd be glad to see your old friends once more growled the negro you were never afraid of a living man what do you fear from the dead  whos afraid hiccupped vanderscamp partly heated by liquor partly nettled by the jeer of the negro whos afraid hang me but i would be glad to see them once more alive or dead at the wild goose come my lads in the wind continued he taking a draught and flourishing the bottle above his head heres fair weather to you in the other world and if you should be walking the rounds tonight odds fish but ill be happy if you will drop in to supper  a dismal creaking was the only reply the wind blew loud and shrill and as it whistled round the gallows and among the bones sounded as if there were laughing and gibbering in the air old pluto chuckled to himself and now pulled for home the storm burst over the voyagers while they were yet far from shore the rain fell in torrents the thunder crashed and pealed and the lightning kept up an incessant blaze it was stark midnight before they landed at communipaw  dripping and shivering vanderscamp crawled homeward he was completely sobered by the storm the water soaked from without having diluted and cooled the liquor within arrived at the wild goose he knocked timidly and dubiously at the door for he dreaded the reception he was to experience from his wife he had reason to do so she met him at the threshold in a precious ill humor  is this a time said she to keep people out of their beds and to bring home company to turn the house upside down  company said vanderscamp meekly i have brought no company with me wife  no indeed they have got here before you but by your invitation and blessedlooking company they are truly  vanderscamps knees smote together for the love of heaven where are they wife  wherewhy in the blueroom upstairs making themselves as much at home as if the house were their own  vanderscamp made a desperate effort scrambled up to the room and threw open the door sure enough there at a table on which burned a light as blue as brimstone sat the three guests from gibbetisland with halters round their necks and bobbing their cups together as if they were hobornobbing and trolling the old dutch freebooters glee since translated into english   for three merry lads be we   and three merry lads be we   i on the land and thou on the sand   and jack on the gallowstree  vanderscamp saw and heard no more starting back with horror he missed his footing on the landingplace and fell from the top of the stairs to the bottom he was taken up speechless and either from the fall or the fright was buried in the yard of the little dutch church at bergen on the following sunday  from that day forward the fate of the wild goose was sealed it was pronounced a haunted house and avoided accordingly no one inhabited it but vanderscamps shrew of a widow and old pluto and they were considered but little better than its hobgoblin visitors pluto grew more and more haggard and morose and looked more like an imp of darkness than a human being he spoke to no one but went about muttering to himself or as some hinted talking with the devil who though unseen was ever at his elbow now and then he was seen pulling about the bay alone in his skiff in dark weather or at the approach of nightfall nobody could tell why unless on an errand to invite more guests from the gallows indeed it was affirmed that the wild goose still continued to be a house of entertainment for such guests and that on stormy nights the blue chamber was occasionally illuminated and sounds of diabolical merriment were overheard mingling with the howling of the tempest some treated these as idle stories until on one such night it was about the time of the equinox there was a horrible uproar in the wild goose that could not be mistaken it was not so much the sound of revelry however as strife with two or three piercing shrieks that pervaded every part of the village nevertheless no one thought of hastening to the spot on the contrary the honest burghers of communipaw drew their nightcaps over their ears and buried their heads under the bedclothes at the thoughts of vanderscamp and his gallows companions  the next morning some of the bolder and more curious undertook to reconnoitre all was quiet and lifeless at the wild goose the door yawned wide open and had evidently been open all night for the storm had beaten into the house gathering more courage from the silence and apparent desertion they gradually ventured over the threshold the house had indeed the air of having been possessed by devils every thing was topsyturvy trunks had been broken open and chests of drawers and corner cupboards turned inside out as in a time of general sack and pillage but the most woful sight was the widow of yan yost vanderscamp extended a corpse on the floor of the bluechamber with the marks of a deadly gripe on the windpipe  all now was conjecture and dismay at communipaw and the disappearance of old pluto who was no where to be found gave rise to all kinds of wild surmises some suggested that the negro had betrayed the house to some of vanderscamps bucaniering associates and that they had decamped together with the booty others surmised that the negro was nothing more nor less than a devil incarnate who had now accomplished his ends and made off with his dues events however vindicated the negro from this last imputation his skiff was picked up drifting about the bay bottom upward as if wrecked in a tempest and his body was found shortly afterward by some communipaw fishermen stranded among the rocks of gibbetisland near the foot of the pirates gallows the fishermen shook their heads and observed that old pluto had ventured once too often to invite guests from gibbetisland                                       the bermudas  a shaksperian research by the author of the sketchbook  who did not think till within these foure yeares but that these islands had been rather a habitation for divells than fit for men to dwell in who did not hate the name when hee was on land and shun the place when he was on the seas but behold the misprision and conceits of the world for true and large experience hath now told us it is one of the sweetest paradises that be upon eartha plaine descript of the barmudas 1613  in the course of a voyage home from england our ship had been struggling for two or three weeks with perverse headwinds and a stormy sea it was in the month of may yet the weather had at times a wintry sharpness and it was apprehended that we were in the neighborhood of floating islands of ice which at that season of the year drift out of the gulf of saint lawrence and sometimes occasion the wreck of noble ships  wearied out by the continued opposition of the elements our captain at length bore away to the south in hopes of catching the expiring breath of the tradewinds and making what is called the southern passage a few days wrought as it were a magical sea change in every thing around us we seemed to emerge into a different world the late dark and angry sea lashed up into roaring and swashing surges became calm and sunny the rude winds died away and gradually a light breeze sprang up directly aft filling out every sail and wafting us smoothly along on an even keel the air softened into a bland and delightful temperature dolphins began to play about us the nautilus came floating by like a fairy ship with its mimic sail and rainbow tints and flyingfish from time to time made their short excursive flights and occasionally fell upon the deck the cloaks and overcoats in which we had hitherto wrapped ourselves and moped about the vessel were thrown aside for a summer warmth had succeeded to the late wintry chills sails were stretched as awnings over the quarterdeck to protect us from the midday sun under these we lounged away the day in luxurious indolence musing with halfshut eyes upon the quiet ocean the night was scarcely less beautiful than the day the rising moon sent a quivering column of silver along the undulating surface of the deep and gradually climbing the heaven lit up our towering topsails and swelling mainsails and spread a pale mysterious light around as our ship made her whispering way through this dreamy world of waters every boisterous sound on board was charmed to silence and the low whistle or drowsy song of a sailor from the forecastle or the tinkling of a guitar and the soft warbling of a female voice from the quarterdeck seemed to derive a witching melody from the scene and hour i was reminded of oberons exquisite description of music and moonlight on the ocean   thou rememberest   since once i sat upon a promontory   and heard a mermaid on a dolphins back   uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath   that the rude sea grew civil at her song   and certain stars shot madly from their spheres   to hear the seamaids music  indeed i was in the very mood to conjure up all the imaginary beings with which poetry has peopled old ocean and almost ready to fancy i heard the distant song of the mermaid or the mellow shell of the triton and to picture to myself neptune and amphitrite with all their pageant sweeping along the dim horizon  a day or two of such fanciful voyaging brought us in sight of the bermudas which first looked like mere summer clouds peering above the quiet ocean all day we glided along in sight of them with just wind enough to fill our sails and never did land appear more lovely they were clad in emerald verdure beneath the serenest of skies not an angry wave broke upon their quiet shores and small fishing craft riding on the crystal waves seemed as if hung in air it was such a scene that fletcher pictured to himself when he extolled the halcyon lot of the fisherman    ah would thou knewest how much it better were   to bide among the simple fisherswains   no shrieking owl no nightcrow lodgeth here   nor is our simple pleasure mixed with pains   our sports begin with the beginning year   in calms to pull the leaping fish to land   in roughs to sing and dance along the yellow sand  in contemplating these beautiful islands and the peaceful sea around them i could hardly realize that these were the still vexed bermoothes of shakspeare once the dread of mariners and infamous in the narratives of the early discoverers for the dangers and disasters which beset them such however was the case and the islands derived additional interest in my eyes from fancying that i could trace in their early history and in the superstitious notions connected with them some of the elements of shakspeares wild and beautiful drama of the tempest i shall take the liberty of citing a few historical facts in support of this idea which may claim some additional attention from the american reader as being connected with the first settlement of virginia  at the time when shakspeare was in the fulness of his talent and seizing upon everything that could furnish aliment to his imagination the colonization of virginia was a favorite object of enterprise among people of condition in england and several of the courtiers of the court of queen elizabeth were personally engaged in it in the year 1609 a noble armament of nine ships and five hundred men sailed for the relief of the colony it was commanded by sir george somers as admiral a gallant and generous gentleman above sixty years of age and possessed of an ample fortune yet still bent upon hardy enterprise and ambitious of signalizing himself in the service of his country  on board of his flagship the seavulture sailed also sir thomas gates lieutenantgeneral of the colony the voyage was long and boisterous on the twentyfifth of july the admirals ship was separated from the rest in a hurricane for several days she was driven about at the mercy of the elements and so strained and racked that her seams yawned open and her hold was half filled with water the storm subsided but left her a mere foundering wreck the crew stood in the hold to their waists in water vainly endeavoring to bail her with kettles buckets and other vessels the leaks rapidly gained on them while their strength was as rapidly declining they lost all hope of keeping the ship afloat until they should reach the american coast and wearied with fruitless toil determined in their despair to give up all farther attempt shut down the hatches and abandon themselves to providence some who had spirituous liquors or comfortable waters as the old record quaintly terms them brought them forth and shared them with their comrades and they all drank a sad farewell to one another as men who were soon to part company in this world  in this moment of extremity the worthy admiral who kept sleepless watch from the high stern of the vessel gave the thrilling cry of land all rushed on deck in a frenzy of joy and nothing now was to be seen or heard on board but the transports of men who felt as if rescued from the grave it is true the land in sight would not in ordinary circumstances have inspired much selfgratulation it could be nothing else but the group of islands called after their discoverer one juan bermudas a spaniard but stigmatized among the mariners of those days as the islands of devils for the islands of the bermudas says the old narrative of this voyage as every man knoweth that hath heard or read of them were never inhabited by any christian or heathen people but were ever esteemed and reputed a most prodigious and inchanted place affording nothing but gusts stormes and foul weather which made every navigator and mariner to avoide them as scylla and charybdis or as they would shun the divell himself footnote a plaine description of the barmudas  sir george somers and his tempesttossed comrades however hailed them with rapture as if they had been a terrestrial paradise every sail was spread and every exertion made to urge the foundering ship to land before long she struck upon a rock fortunately the late stormy winds had subsided and there was no surf a swelling wave lifted her from off the rock and bore her to another and thus she was borne on from rock to rock until she remained wedged between two as firmly as if set upon the stocks the boats were immediately lowered and though the shore was above a mile distant the whole crew were landed in safety  every one had now his task assigned him some made all haste to unload the ship before she should go to pieces some constructed wigwams of palmetto leaves and others ranged the island in quest of wood and water to their surprise and joy they found it far different from the desolate and frightful place they had been taught by seamens stories to expect it was wellwooded and fertile there were birds of various kinds and herds of swine roaming about the progeny of a number that had swam ashore in former years from a spanish wreck the island abounded with turtle and great quantities of their eggs were to be found among the rocks the bays and inlets were full of fish so tame that if any one stepped into the water they would throng around him sir george somers in a little while caught enough with hook and line to furnish a meal to his whole ships company some of them were so large that two were as much as a man could carry crawfish also were taken in abundance the air was soft and salubrious and the sky beautifully serene waller in his summer islands has given us a faithful picture of the climate    for the kind spring which but salutes us here   inhabits these and courts them all the year   ripe fruits and blossoms on the same trees live   at once they promise and at once they give   so sweet the air so moderate the clime   none sickly lives or dies before his time   heaven sure has kept this spot of earth uncursed   to shew how all things were created first  we may imagine the feelings of the shipwrecked marines on finding themselves cast by stormy seas upon so happy a coast where abundance was to be had without labor where what in other climes constituted the costly luxuries of the rich were within every mans reach and where life promised to be a mere holiday many of the common sailors especially declared they desired no better lot than to pass the rest of their lives on this favored island  the commanders however were not so ready to console themselves with mere physical comforts for the severance from the enjoyment of cultivated life and all the objects of honorable ambition despairing of the arrival of any chance ship on these shunned and dreaded islands they fitted out the longboat making a deck of the ships hatches and having manned her with eight picked men despatched her under the command of an able and hardy mariner named raven to proceed to virginia and procure shipping to be sent to their relief  while waiting in anxious idleness for the arrival of the lookedfor aid dissensions arose between sir george somers and sir thomas gates originating very probably in jealousy of the lead which the nautical experience and professional station of the admiral gave him in the present emergency each commander of course had his adherents these dissensions ripened into a complete schism and this handful of shipwrecked men thus thrown together on an uninhabited island separated into two parties and lived asunder in bitter feud as men rendered fickle by prosperity instead of being brought into brotherhood by a common calamity  weeks and months elapsed without bringing the lookedfor aid from virginia though that colony was within but a few days sail fears were now entertained that the longboat had been either swallowed up in the sea or wrecked on some savage coast one or other of which most probably was the case as nothing was ever heard of raven and his comrades  each party now set to work to build a vessel for itself out of the cedar with which the island abounded the wreck of the seavulture furnished rigging and various other articles but they had no iron for bolts and other fastenings and for want of pitch and tar they payed the seams of their vessels with lime and turtles oil which soon dried and became as hard as stone  on the tenth of may 1610 they set sail having been about nine months on the island they reached virginia without farther accident but found the colony in great distress for provisions the account they gave of the abundance that reigned in the bermudas and especially of the herds of swine that roamed the island determined lord delaware the governor of virginia to send thither for supplies sir george somers with his wonted promptness and generosity offered to undertake what was still considered a dangerous voyage accordingly on the nineteenth of june he set sail in his own cedar vessel of thirty tons accompanied by another small vessel commanded by captain argall  the gallant somers was doomed again to be tempesttossed his companion vessel was soon driven back to port but he kept the sea and as usual remained at his post on deck in all weathers his voyage was long and boisterous and the fatigues and exposures which he underwent were too much for a frame impaired by age and by previous hardships he arrived at bermudas completely exhausted and broken down  his nephew captain mathew somers attended him in his illness with affectionate assiduity finding his end approaching the veteran called his men together and exhorted them to be true to the interests of virginia to procure provisions with all possible despatch and hasten back to the relief of the colony  with this dying charge he gave up the ghost leaving us nephew and crew overwhelmed with grief and consternation their first thought was to pay honor to his remains opening the body they took out the heart and entrails and buried them erecting a cross over the grave they then embalmed the body and set sail with it for england thus while paying empty honors to their deceased commander neglecting his earnest wish and dying injunction that they should return with relief to virginia  the little bark arrived safely at whitechurch in dorsetshire with its melancholy freight the body of the worthy somers was interred with the military honors due to a brave soldier and many volleys were fired over his grave the bermudas have since received the name of the somer islands as a tribute to his memory  the accounts given by captain mathew somers and his crew of the delightful climate and the great beauty fertility and abundance of these islands excited the zeal of enthusiasts and the cupidity of speculators and a plan was set on foot to colonize them the virginia company sold their right to the islands to one hundred and twenty of their own members who erected themselves into a distinct corporation under the name of the somer island society and mr richard more was sent out in 1612 as governor with sixty men to found a colony and this leads me to the second branch of this research                                       the three kings of bermuda  and their treasure of ambergris  at the time that sir george somers was preparing to launch his cedarbuilt bark and sail for virginia there were three culprits among his men who had been guilty of capital offences one of them was shot the others named christopher carter and edward waters escaped waters indeed made a very narrow escape for he had actually been tied to a tree to be executed but cut the rope with a knife which he had concealed about his person and fled to the woods where he was joined by carter these two worthies kept themselves concealed in the secret parts of the island until the departure of the two vessels when sir george somers revisited the island in quest of supplies for the virginia colony these culprits hovered about the landingplace and succeeded in persuading another seaman named edward chard to join them giving him the most seductive pictures of the ease and abundance in which they revelled  when the bark that bore sir georges body to england had faded from the watery horizon these three vagabonds walked forth in their majesty and might the lords and sole inhabitants of these islands for a time their little commonwealth went on prosperously and happily they built a house sowed corn and the seeds of various fruits and having plenty of hogs wild fowl and fish of all kinds with turtle in abundance carried on their tripartite sovereignty with great harmony and much feasting all kingdoms however are doomed to revolution convulsion or decay and so it fared with the empire of the three kings of bermuda albeit they were monarchs without subjects in an evil hour in their search after turtle among the fissures of the rocks they came upon a great treasure of ambergris which had been cast on shore by the ocean beside a number of pieces of smaller dimensions there was one great mass the largest that had ever been known weighing eighty pounds and which of itself according to the market value of ambergris in those days was worth about nine or ten thousand pounds  from that moment the happiness and harmony of the three kings of bermuda were gone for ever while poor devils with nothing to share but the common blessings of the island which administered to present enjoyment but had nothing of convertible value they were loving and united but here was actual wealth which would make them rich men whenever they could transport it to a market  adieu the delights of the island they now became flat and insipid each pictured to himself the consequence he might now aspire to in civilized life could he once get there with this mass of ambergris no longer a poor jack tar frolicking in the low taveriis of wapping he might roll through london in his coach and perchance arrive like whittington at the dignity of lord mayor  with riches came envy and covetousness each was now for assuming the supreme power and getting the monopoly of the ambergris a civil war at length broke out chard and waters defied each other to mortal combat and the kingdom of the bermudas was on the point of being deluged with royal blood fortunately carter took no part in the bloody feud ambition might have made him view it with secret exultation for if either or both of his brother potentates were slain in the conflict he would be a gainer in purse and ambergris but he dreaded to be left alone in this uninhabited island and to find himself the monarch of a solitude so he secretly purloined and hid the weapons of the belligerent rivals who having no means of carrying on the war gradually cooled down into a sullen armistice  the arrival of governor more with an overpowering force of sixty men put an end to the empire he took possession of the kingdom in the name of the somer island company and forthwith proceeded to make a settlement the three kings tacitly relinquished their sway but stood up stoutly for their treasure it was determined however that they had been fitted out at the expense and employed in the service of the virginia company that they had found the ambergis while in the service of that company and on that companys land that the ambergis therefore belonged to that company or rather to the somer island company in consequence of their recent purchase of the island and all their appurtenances having thus legally established their right and being moreover able to back it by might the company laid the lions paw upon the spoil and nothing more remains on historic record of the three kings of bermuda and their treasure of ambergris                                       the reader will now determine whether i am more extravagant than most of the commentators on shakspeare in my surmise that the story of sir george somers shipwreck and the subsequent occurrences that took place on the uninhabited island may have furnished the bard with some of the elements of his drama of the tempest the tidings of the shipwreck and of the incidents connected with it reached england not long before the production of this drama and made a great sensation there a narrative of the whole matter from which most of the foregoing particulars are extracted was published at the time in london in a pamphlet form and could not fail to be eagerly perused by shakspeare and to make a vivid impression on his fancy his expression in the tempest of the still vext bermoothes accords exactly with the stormbeaten character of those islands the enchantments too with which he has clothed the island of prospero may they not be traced to the wild and superstitious notions entertained about the bermudas i have already cited two passages from a pamphlet published at the time showing that they were esteemed a most prodigious and inchanted place and the habitation of divells and another pamphlet published shortly afterward observes and whereas it is reported that this land of the barmudas with the islands about which are many at least a hundred are inchanted and kept with evil and wicked spirits it is a most idle and false report footnote newes from the barmudas 1612  the description too given in the same pamphlets of the real beauty and fertility of the bermudas and of their serene and happy climate so opposite to the dangerous and inhospitable character with which they had been stigmatized accords with the eulogium of sebastian on the island of prospero  though this island seem to be desert uninhabitable and almost inaccessible it must needs be of subtle tender and delicate temperance the air breathes upon us here most sweetly here is every thing advantageous to life how lush and lusty the grass looks how green  i think too in the exulting consciousness of ease security and abundance felt by the late tempesttossed mariners while revelling in the plenteousness of the island and their inclination to remain there released from the labors the cares and the artificial restraints of civilized life i can see something of the golden commonwealth of honest gonzalo    had i plantation of this isle my lord   and were the king of it what would i do   i the commonwealth i would by contraries   execute all things for no kind of traffic   would i admit no name of magistrate   letters should not be known riches poverty   and use of service none contract succession   bourn bound of land tilth vineyard none   no use of metal corn or wine or oil   no occupation all men idle all    all things in common nature should produce   without sweat or endeavor treason felony   sword pike knife gun or need of any engine   would i not have but nature should bring forth   of its own kind all foizon all abundance   to feed my innocent people  but above all in the three fugitive vagabonds who remained in possession of the island of bermuda on the departure of their comrades and in their squabbles about supremacy on the finding of their treasure i see typified sebastian trinculo and their worthy companion caliban    trinculo the king and all our company being drowned we will inherit here    monster i will kill this man his daughter and i will be king and queen save our graces and trinculo and thyself shall be viceroys  i do not mean to hold up the incidents and characters in the narrative and in the play as parallel or as being strikingly similar neither would i insinuate that the narrative suggested the play i would only suppose that shakspeare being occupied about that time on the drama of the tempest the main story of which i believe is of italian origin had many of the fanciful ideas of it suggested to his mind by the shipwreck of sir george somers on the still vext bermothes and by the popular superstitions connected with these islands and suddenly put in circulation by that event                                       pelayo and the merchants daughter  by the author of the sketchbook  it is the common lamentation of spanish historiographers that for an obscure and melancholy space of time immediately succeeding the conquest of their country by the moslems its history is a mere wilderness of dubious facts groundless fables and rash exaggerations learned men in cells and cloisters have worn out their lives in vainly endeavoring to connect incongruous events and to account for startling improbabilities recorded of this period the worthy jesuit padre abarca declares that for more than forty years during which he had been employed in theological controversies he had never found any so obscure and inexplicable as those which rise out of this portion of spanish history and that the only fruit of an indefatigable prolix and even prodigious study of the subject was a melancholy and mortifying state of indecision footnote padre pedro abarca anales de aragon anti regno f2 during this apocryphal period flourished pelayo the deliverer of spain whose name like that of william wallace will ever be linked with the glory of his country but linked in like manner by a bond in which fact and fiction are inextricably interwoven  the quaint old chronicle of the moor rasis which though wild and fanciful in the extreme is frequently drawn upon for early facts by spanish historians professes to give the birth parentage and whole course of fortune of pelayo without the least doubt or hesitation it makes him a son of the duke of cantabria and descended both by father and mothers side from the gothic kings of spain i shall pass over the romantic story of his childhood and shall content myself with a scene of his youth which was spent in a castle among the pyrenees under the eye of his widowed and nobleminded mother who caused him to be instructed in everything befitting a cavalier of gentle birth while the sons of the nobility were revelling amid the pleasures of a licentious court and sunk in that vicious and effeminate indulgence which led to the perdition of unhappy spain the youthful pelayo in his rugged mountain school was steeled to all kinds of hardy exercise a great part of his time was spent in hunting the bears the wild boars and the wolves with which the pyrenees abounded and so purely and chastely was he brought up by his good lady mother that if the ancient chronicle from which i draw my facts may be relied on he had attained his oneandtwentieth year without having once sighed for woman  nor were his hardy contests confined to the wild beasts of the forest occasionally he had to contend with adversaries of a more formidable character the skirts and defiles of these border mountains were often infested by marauders from the gallic plains of gascony the gascons says an old chronicler were a people who used smooth words when expedient but force when they had power and were ready to lay their hands on every thing they met though poor they were proud for there was not one who did not pride himself on being a hijodalgo or the son of somebody  at the head of a band of these needy hijodalgos of gascony was one arnaud a brokendown cavalier he and four of his followers were well armed and mounted the rest were a set of scampergrounds on foot furnished with darts and javelins they were the terror of the border here today and gone tomorrow sometimes in one pass sometimes in another they would make sudden inroads into spain scour the roads plunder the country and were over the mountains and far away before a force could be collected to pursue them  now it happened one day that a wealthy burgher of bordeaux who was a merchant trading with biscay set out on a journey for that province as he intended to sojourn there for a season he took with him his wife who was a goodly dame and his daughter a gentle damsel of marriageable age and exceeding fair to look upon he was attended by a trusty clerk from his comptoir and a man servant while another servant led a hackney laden with bags of money with which he intended to purchase merchandise  when the gascons heard of this wealthy merchant and his convoy passing through the mountains they thanked their stars for they considered all peaceful men of traffic as lawful spoil sent by providence for the benefit of hidalgos like themselves of valor and gentle blood who lived by the sword placing themselves in ambush in a lonely defile by which the travellers had to pass they silently awaited their coming in a little while they beheld them approaching the merchant was a fair portly man in a buff surcoat and velvet cap his looks bespoke the good cheer of his native city and he was mounted on a stately wellfed steed while his wife and daughter paced gently on palfreys by his side  the travellers had advanced some distance in the defile when the bandoleros rushed forth and assailed them the merchant though but little used to the exercise of arms and unwieldy in his form yet made valiant defence having his wife and daughter and moneybags at hazard he was wounded in two places and overpowered one of his servants was slain the other took to flight  the freebooters then began to ransack for spoil but were disappointed at not finding the wealth they had expected putting their swords to the breast of the trembling merchant they demanded where he had concealed his treasure and learned from him of the hackney that was following laden with money overjoyed at this intelligence they bound their captives to trees and awaited the arrival of the golden spoil  on this same day pelayo was out with his huntsmen among the mountains and had taken his stand on a rock at a narrow pass to await the sallying forth of a wild boar close by him was a page conducting a horse and at the saddlebow hung his armor for he was always prepared for fight among these border mountains while thus posted the servant of the merchant came flying from the robbers on beholding pelayo he fell on his knees and implored his life for he supposed him to be one of the band it was some time before he could be relieved from his terror and made to tell his story when pelayo heard of the robbers he concluded they were the crew of gascon hidalgos upon the scamper taking his armor from the page he put on his helmet slung his buckler round his neck took lance in hand and mounting his steed compelled the trembling servant to guide him to the scene of action at the same time he ordered the page to seek his huntsmen and summon them to his assistance  when the robbers saw pelayo advancing through the forest with a single attendant on foot and beheld his rich armor sparkling in the sun they thought a new prize had fallen into their hands and arnaud and two of his companions mounting their horses advanced to meet him as they approached pelayo stationed himself in a narrow pass between two rocks where he could only be assailed in front and bracing his buckler and lowering his lance awaited their coming  who and what are ye cried he and what seek ye in this land  we are huntsmen replied arnaud and lo our game runs into our toils  by my faith replied pelayo thou wilt find the game more readily roused than taken have at thee for a villain  so saying he put spurs to his horse and ran full speed upon him the gascon not expecting so sudden an attack from a single horseman was taken by surprise he hastily couched his lance but it merely glanced on the shield of pelayo who sent his own through the middle of his breast and threw him out of his saddle to the earth one of the other robbers made at pelayo and wounded him slightly in the side but received a blow from the sword of the latter which cleft his skullcap and sank into his brain his companion seeing him fall put spurs to his steed and galloped off through the forest  beholding several other robbers on foot coming up pelayo returned to his station between the rocks where he was assailed by them all at once he received two of their darts on his buckler a javelin razed his cuirass and glancing down wounded his horse pelayo then rushed forth and struck one of the robbers dead the others beholding several huntsmen advancing took to flight but were pursued and several of them taken  the good merchant of bordeaux and his family beheld this scene with trembling and amazement for never had they looked upon such feats of arms they considered don pelayo as a leader of some rival band of robbers and when the bonds were loosed by which they were tied to the trees they fell at his feet and implored mercy the females were soonest undeceived especially the daughter for the damsel was struck with the noble countenance and gentle demeanor of pelayo and said to herself surely nothing evil can dwell in so goodly and gracious a form  pelayo now sounded his horn which echoed from rock to rock and was answered by shouts and horns from various parts of the mountains the merchants heart misgave him at these signals and especially when he beheld more than forty men gathering from glen and thicket they were clad in hunters dresses and armed with boarspears darts and huntingswords and many of them led hounds in long leashes all this was a new and wild scene to the astonished merchant nor were his fears abated when he saw his servant approaching with the hackney laden with moneybags for of a certainty said he to himself this will be too tempting a spoil for these wild hunters of the mountains  pelayo however took no more notice of the gold than if it had been so much dross at which the honest burgher marvelled exceedingly he ordered that the wounds of the merchant should be dressed and his own examined on taking off his cuirass his wound was found to be but slight but his men were so exasperated at seeing his blood that they would have put the captive robbers to instant death had he not forbidden them to do them any harm  the huntsmen now made a great fire at the foot of a tree and bringing a boar which they had killed cut off portions and roasted them or broiled them on the coals then drawing forth loaves of bread from their wallets they devoured their food half raw with the hungry relish of huntsmen and mountaineers the merchant his wife and daughter looked at all this and wondered for they had never beheld so savage a repast  pelayo then inquired of them if they did not desire to eat they were too much in awe of him to decline though they felt a loathing at the thought of partaking of this hunters fare but he ordered a linen cloth to be spread under the shade of a great oak on the grassy margin of a clear running stream and to their astonishment they were served not with the flesh of the boar but with dainty cheer such as the merchant had scarcely hoped to find out of the walls of his native city of bordeaux  the good burgher was of a community renowned for gastronomic prowess his fears having subsided his appetite was now awakened and he addressed himself manfully to the viands that were set before him his daughter however could not eat her eyes were ever and anon stealing to gaze on pelayo whom she regarded with gratitude for his protection and admiration for his valor and now that he had laid aside his helmet and she beheld his lofty countenance glowing with manly beauty she thought him something more than mortal the heart of the gentle donzella says the ancient chronicler was kind and yielding and had pelayo thought fit to ask the greatest boon that love and beauty could bestowdoubtless meaning her fair handshe could not have had the cruelty to say him nay pelayo however had no such thoughts the love of woman had never yet entered his heart and though he regarded the damsel as the fairest maiden he had ever beheld her beauty caused no perturbation in his breast  when the repast was over pelayo offered to conduct the merchant and his family through the defiles of the mountains lest they should be molested by any of the scattered band of robbers the bodies of the slain marauders were buried and the corpse of the servant was laid upon one of the horses captured in the battle having formed their cavalcade they pursued their way slowly up one of the steep and winding passes of the pyrenees  toward sunset they arrived at the dwelling of a holy hermit it was hewn out of the living rock there was a cross over the door and before it was a great spreading oak with a sweet spring of water at its foot the body of the faithful servant who had fallen in the defence of his lord was buried close by the wall of this sacred retreat and the hermit promised to perform masses for the repose of his soul then pelayo obtained from the holy father consent that the merchants wife and daughter should pass the night within his cell and the hermit made beds of moss for them and gave them his benediction but the damsel found little rest so much were her thoughts occupied by the youthful champion who had rescued her from death or dishonor  pelayo however was visited by no such wandering of the mind but wrapping himself in his mantle slept soundly by the fountain under the tree at midnight when every thing was buried in deep repose he was awakened from his sleep and beheld the hermit before him with the beams of the moon shining upon his silver hair and beard  this is no time said the latter to be sleeping arise and listen to my words and hear of the great work for which thou art chosen  then pelayo arose and seated himself on a rock and the hermit continued his discourse  behold said he the ruin of spain is at hand it will be delivered into the hands of strangers and will become a prey to the spoiler its children will be slain or carried into captivity or such as may escape these evils will harbor with the beasts of the forest or the eagles of the mountain the thorn and bramble will spring up where now are seen the cornfield the vine and the olive and hungry wolves will roam in place of peaceful flocks and herds but thou my son tarry not thou to see these things for thou canst not prevent them depart on a pilgrimage to the sepulchre of our blessed lord in palestine purify thyself by prayer enroll thyself in the order of chivalry and prepare for the great work of the redemption of thy country for to thee it will be given to raise it from the depth of its affliction  pelayo would have inquired farther into the evils thus foretold but the hermit rebuked his curiosity  seek not to know more said he than heaven is pleased to reveal clouds and darkness cover its designs and prophecy is never permitted to lift up but in part the veil that rests upon the future  the hermit ceased to speak and pelayo laid himself down again to take repose but sleep was a stranger to his eyes  when the first rays of the rising sun shone upon the tops of the mountains the travellers assembled round the fountain beneath the tree and made their mornings repast then having received the benediction of the hermit they departed in the freshness of the day and descended along the hollow defiles leading into the interior of spain the good merchant was refreshed by sleep and by his mornings meal and when he beheld his wife and daughter thus secure by his side and the hackney laden with his treasure close behind him his heart was light in his bosom and he carolled a chanson as he went and the woodlands echoed to his song but pelayo rode in silence for he revolved in his mind the portentous words of the hermit and the daughter of the merchant ever and anon stole looks at him full of tenderness and admiration and deep sighs betrayed the agitation of her bosom  at length they came to the foot of the mountains where the forests and the rocks terminated and an open and secure country lay before the travellers here they halted for their roads were widely different when they came to part the merchant and his wife were loud in thanks and benedictions and the good burgher would fain have given pelayo the largest of his sacks of gold but the young man put it aside with a smile silver and gold said he need i not but if i have deserved aught at thy hands give me thy prayers for the prayers of a good man are above all price  in the mean time the daughter had spoken never a word at length she raised her eyes which were filled with tears and looked timidly at pelayo and her bosom throbbed and after a violent struggle between strong affection and virgin modesty her heart relieved itself by words  senor said she i know that i am unworthy of the notice of so noble a cavalier but suffer me to place this ring upon a finger of that hand which has so bravely rescued us from death and when you regard it you may consider it as a memorial of your own valor and not of one who is too humble to be remembered by you  with these words she drew a ring from her finger and put it upon the finger of pelayo and having done this she blushed and trembled at her own boldness and stood as one abashed with her eyes cast down upon the earth  pelayo was moved at the words of the simple maiden and at the touch of her fair hand and at her beauty as she stood thus trembling and in tears before him but as yet he knew nothing of woman and his heart was free from the snares of love amiga friend said he i accept thy present and will wear it in remembrance of thy goodness so saying he kissed her on the cheek  the damsel was cheered by these words and hoped that she had awakened some tenderness in his bosom but it was no such thing says the grave old chronicler for his heart was devoted to higher and more sacred matters yet certain it is that he always guarded well that ring  when they parted pelayo remained with his huntsmen on a cliff watching that no evil befell them until they were far beyond the skirts of the mountain and the damsel often turned to look at him until she could no longer discern him for the distance and the tears that dimmed her eyes  and for that he had accepted her ring says the ancient chronicler she considered herself wedded to him in her heart and would never marry nor could she be brought to look with eyes of affection upon any other man but for the true love which she bore pelayo she lived and died a virgin and she composed a book which treated of love and chivalry and the temptations of this mortal life and one part discoursed of celestial matters and it was called the contemplations of love because at the time she wrote it she thought of pelayo and of his having accepted her jewel and called her by the gentle appellation of amiga and often thinking of him in tender sadness and of her never having beheld him more she would take the book and would read it as if in his stead and while she repeated the words of love which it contained she would endeavor to fancy them uttered by pelayo and that he stood before her                                       the knight of malta  to the editor of the knickerbocker   sir in the course of a tour which i made in sicily in the days of my juvenility i passed some little time at the ancient city of catania at the foot of mount Ætna here i became acquainted with the chevalier l an old knight of malta it was not many years after the time that napoleon had dislodged the knights from their island and he still wore the insignia of his order he was not however one of those reliques of that once chivalrous body who had been described was a few wornout old men creeping about certain parts of europe with the maltese cross on their breasts on the contrary though advanced in life his form was still light and vigorous he had a pale thin intellectual visage with a high forehead and a bright visionary eye he seemed to take a fancy to me as i certainly did to him and we soon became intimate i visited him occasionally at his apartments in the wing of an old palace looking toward mount Ætna he was an antiquary a virtuoso and a connoisseur his rooms were decorated with mutilated statues dug up from grecian and roman ruins old vases lachrymals and sepulchral lamps he had astronomical and chemical instruments and blackletter books in various languages i found that he had dipped a little in chimerical studies and had a hankering after astrology and alchymy he affected to believe in dreams and visions and delighted in the fanciful rosicrucian doctrines i cannot persuade myself however that he really believed in all these i rather think he loved to let his imagination carry him away into the boundless fairy land which they unfolded  in company with the chevalier i took several excursions on horseback about the environs of catania and the picturesque skirts of mount etna one of these led through a village which had sprung up on the very tract of an ancient eruption the houses being built of lava at one time we passed for some distance along a narrow lane between two high dead convent walls it was a cutthroatlooking place in a country where assassinations are frequent and just about midway through it we observed blood upon the pavement and the walls as if a murder had actually been committed there  the chevalier spurred on his horse until he had extricated himself completely from this suspicious neighborhood he then observed that it reminded him of a similar blind alley in malta infamous on account of the many assassinations that had taken place there concerning one of which he related a long and tragical story that lasted until we reached catania it involved various circumstances of a wild and supernatural character but which he assured me were handed down in tradition and generally credited by the old inhabitants of malta  as i like to pick up strange stories and as i was particularly struck with several parts of this i made a minute of it on my return to my lodgings the memorandum was lost with several others of my travelling papers and the story had faded from my mind when recently in perusing a french memoir i came suddenly upon it dressed up it is true in a very different manner but agreeing in the leading facts and given upon the word of that famous adventurer the count cagliostro  i have amused myself during a snowy day in the country by rendering it roughly into english for the entertainment of a youthful circle round the christmas fire it was well received by my auditors who however are rather easily pleased one proof of its merits is that it sent some of the youngest of them quaking to their beds and gave them very fearful dreams hoping that it may have the same effect upon your ghosthunting readers i offer it mr editor for insertion in your magazine i would observe that wherever i have modified the french version of the story it has been in conformity to some recollection of the narrative of my friend the knight of malta  your obt servt  geoffrey crayon                                       the grand prior of minorca  a veritable ghost story    keep my wits heaven they say spirits appear   to melancholy minds and the graves openfletcher  about the middle of the last century while the knights of saint john of jerusalem still maintained something of their ancient state and sway in the island of malta a tragical event took place there which is the groundwork of the following narrative  it may be as well to premise that at the time we are treating of the order of saint john of jerusalem grown excessively wealthy had degenerated from its originally devout and warlike character instead of being a hardy body of monkknights sworn soldiers of the cross fighting the paynim in the holy land or scouring the mediterranean and scourging the barbary coasts with their galleys or feeding the poor and attending upon the sick at their hospitals they led a life of luxury and libertinism and were to be found in the most voluptuous courts of europe the order in fact had become a mode of providing for the needy branches of the catholic aristocracy of europe a commandery we are told was a splendid provision for a younger brother and men of rank however dissolute provided they belonged to the highest aristocracy became knights of malta just as they did bishops or colonels of regiments or court chamberlains after a brief residence at malta the knights passed the rest of their time in their own countries or only made a visit now and then to the island while there having but little military duty to perform they beguiled their idleness by paying attentions to the fair  there was one circle of society however into which they could not obtain currency this was composed of a few families of the old maltese nobility natives of the island these families not being permitted to enroll any of their members in the order affected to hold no intercourse with its chevaliers admitting none into their exclusive coteries but the grand master whom they acknowledged as their sovereign and the members of the chapter which composed his council  to indemnify themselves for this exclusion the chevaliers carried their gallantries into the next class of society composed of those who held civil administrative and judicial situations the ladies of this class were called honorate or honorables to distinguish them from the inferior orders and among them were many of superior grace beauty and fascination  even in this more hospitable class the chevaliers were not all equally favored those of germany had the decided preference owing to their fair and fresh complexions and the kindliness of their manners next to these came the spanish cavaliers on account of their profound and courteous devotion and most discreet secrecy singular as it may seem the chevaliers of france fared the worst the maltese ladies dreaded their volatility and their proneness to boast of their amours and shunned all entanglement with them they were forced therefore to content themselves with conquests among females of the lower orders they revenged themselves after the gay french manner by making the honorate the objects of all kinds of jests and mystifications by prying into their tender affairs with the more favored chevaliers and making them the theme of song and epigram  about this time a french vessel arrived at malta bringing out a distinguished personage of the order of saint john of jerusalem the commander de foulquerre who came to solicit the post of commanderinchief of the galleys he was descended from an old and warrior line of french nobility his ancestors having long been seneschals of poitou and claiming descent from the first counts of angouleme  the arrival of the commander caused a little uneasiness among the peaceably inclined for he bore the character in the island of being fiery arrogant and quarrelsome he had already been three times at malta and on each visit had signalized himself by some rash and deadly affray  as he was now thirtyfive years of age however it was hoped that time might have taken off the fiery edge of his spirit and that he might prove more quiet and sedate than formerly the commander set up an establishment befitting his rank and pretensions for he arrogated to himself an importance greater even than that of the grand master his house immediately became the rallying place of all the young french chevaliers they informed him of all the slights they had experienced or imagined and indulged their petulant and satirical vein at the expense of the honorate and their admirers the chevaliers of other nations soon found the topics and tone of conversation at the commanders irksome and offensive and gradually ceased to visit there the commander remained the head of a national clique who looked up to him as their model if he was not as boisterous and quarrelsome as formerly he had become haughty and overbearing he was fond of talking over his past affairs of punctilio and bloody duel when walking the streets he was generally attended by a ruffling train of young french cavaliers who caught his own air of assumption and bravado these he would conduct to the scenes of his deadly encounters point out the very spot where each fatal lunge had been given and dwell vaingloriously on every particular  under his tuition the young french chevaliers began to add bluster and arrogance to their former petulance and levity they fired up on the most trivial occasions particularly with those who had been most successful with the fair and would put on the most intolerable drawcansir airs the other chevaliers conducted themselves with all possible forbearance and reserve but they saw it would be impossible to keep on long in this manner without coming to an open rupture  among the spanish cavaliers was one named don luis de lima vasconcellos he was distantly related to the grand master and had been enrolled at an early age among his pages but had been rapidly promoted by him until at the age of twentysix he had been given the richest spanish commandery in the order he had moreover been fortunate with the fair with one of whom the most beautiful honorata of malta he had long maintained the most tender correspondence  the character rank and connexions of don luis put him on a par with the imperious commander de foulquerre and pointed him out as a leader and champion to his countrymen the spanish chevaliers repaired to him therefore in a body represented all the grievances they had sustained and the evils they apprehended and urged him to use his influence with the commander and his adherents to put a stop to the growing abuses  don luis was gratified by this mark of confidence and esteem on the part of his countrymen and promised to have an interview with the commander de foulquerre on the subject he resolved to conduct himself with the utmost caution and delicacy on the occasion to represent to the commander the evil consequences which might result from the inconsiderate conduct of the young french chevaliers and to entreat him to exert the great influence he so deservedly possessed over them to restrain their excesses don luis was aware however of the peril that attended any interview of the kind with this imperious and fractious man and apprehended however it might commence that it would terminate in a duel still it was an affair of honor in which castilian dignity was concerned beside he had a lurking disgust at the overbearing manners of de foulquerre and perhaps had been somewhat offended by certain intrusive attentions which he had presumed to pay to the beautiful honorata  it was now holy week a time too sacred for worldly feuds and passions especially in a community under the dominion of a religious order it was agreed therefore that the dangerous interview in question should not take place until after the easter holidays it is probable from subsequent circumstances that the commander de foulquerre had some information of this arrangement among the spanish chevaliers and was determined to be beforehand and to mortify the pride of their champion who was thus preparing to read him a lecture he chose good friday for his purpose on this sacred day it is customary in catholic countries to make a tour of all the churches offering up prayers in each in every catholic church as is well known there is a vessel of holy water near the door in this every one on entering dips his fingers and makes therewith the sign of the cross on his forehead and breast an office of gallantry among the young spaniards is to stand near the door dip their hands in the holy vessel and extend them courteously and respectfully to any lady of their acquaintance who may enter who thus receives the sacred water at second hand on the tips of her fingers and proceeds to cross herself with all due decorum the spaniards who are the most jealous of lovers are impatient when this piece of devotional gallantry is proffered to the object of their affections by any other hand on good friday therefore when a lady makes a tour of the churches it is the usage among them for the inamorato to follow her from church to church so as to present her the holy water at the door of each thus testifying his own devotion and at the same time preventing the officious services of a rival  on the day in question don luis followed the beautiful honorata to whom as has already been observed he had long been devoted at the very first church she visited the commander de foulquerre was stationed at the portal with several of the young french chevaliers about him before don luis could offer her the holy water he was anticipated by the commander who thrust himself between them and while he performed the gallant office to the lady rudely turned his back upon her admirer and trod upon his feet the insult was enjoyed by the young frenchmen who were present it was too deep and grave to be forgiven by spanish pride and at once put an end to all don luis plans of caution and forbearance he repressed his passion for the moment however and waited until all the parties left the church then accosting the commander with an air of coolness and unconcern he inquired after his health and asked to what church he proposed making his second visit to the magisterial church of saint john don luis offered to conduct him thither by the shortest route his offer was accepted apparently without suspicion and they proceeded together after walking some distance they entered a long narrow lane without door or window opening upon it called the strada stretta or narrow street it was a street in which duels were tacitly permitted or connived at in malta and were suffered to pass as accidental encounters every where else they were prohibited this restriction had been instituted to diminish the number of duels formerly so frequent in malta as a farther precaution to render these encounters less fatal it was an offence punishable with death for any one to enter this street armed with either poniard or pistol it was a lonely dismal street just wide enough for two men to stand upon their guard and cross their swords few persons ever traversed it unless with some sinister design and on any preconcerted duello the seconds posted themselves at each end to stop all passengers and prevent interruption  in the present instance the parties had scarce entered the street when don luis drew his sword and called upon the commander to defend himself  de foulquerre was evidently taken by surprise he drew back and attempted to expostulate but don luis persisted in defying him to the combat  after a second or two he likewise drew his sword but immediately lowered the point  good friday ejaculated he shaking his head one word with you it is full six years since i have been in a confessional i am shocked at the state of my conscience but within three daysthat is to say on monday next  don luis would listen to nothing though naturally of a peaceable disposition he had been stung to fury and people of that character when once incensed are deaf to reason he compelled the commander to put himself on his guard the latter though a man accustomed to brawl in battle was singularly dismayed terror was visible in all his features he placed himself with his back to the wall and the weapons were crossed the contest was brief and fatal at the very first thrust the sword of don luis passed through the body of his antagonist the commander staggered to the wall and leaned against it  on good friday ejaculated he again with a failing voice and despairing accents heaven pardon you added he take my sword to têtefoulques and have a hundred masses performed in the chapel of the castle for the repose of my soul with these words he expired  the fury of don luis was at an end he stood aghast gazing at the bleeding body of the commander he called to mind the prayer of the deceased for three days respite to make his peace with heaven he had refused it had sent him to the grave with all his sins upon his head his conscience smote him to the core he gathered up the sword of the commander which he had been enjoined to take to têtefoulques and hurried from the fatal strada stretta  the duel of course made a great noise in malta but had no injurious effect upon the worldly fortunes of don luis he made a full declaration of the whole matter before the proper authorities the chapter of the order considered it one of those casual encounters of the strada stretta which were mourned over but tolerated the public by whom the late commander had been generally detested declared that he had deserved his fate it was but three days after the event that don luis was advanced to one of the highest dignities of the order being invested by the grand master with the priorship of the kingdom of minorca  from that time forward however the whole character and conduct of don luis underwent a change he became a prey to a dark melancholy which nothing could assuage the most austere piety the severest penances had no effect in allaying the horror which preyed upon his mind he was absent for a long time from malta having gone it was said on remote pilgrimages when he returned he was more haggard than ever there seemed something mysterious and inexplicable in this disorder of his mind the following is the revelation made by himself of the horrible visions or chimeras by which he was haunted  when i had made my declaration before the chapter said he and my provocations were publicly known i had made my peace with man but it was not so with god nor with my confessor nor with my own conscience my act was doubly criminal from the day on which it was committed and from my refusal to a delay of three days for the victim of my resentment to receive the sacraments his despairing ejaculation good friday good friday continually rang in my ears why did i not grant the respite cried i to myself was it not enough to kill the body but must i seek to kill the soul  on the night of the following friday i started suddenly from my sleep an unaccountable horror was upon me i looked wildly around it seemed as if i were not in my apartment nor in my bed but in the fatal strada stretta lying on the pavement i again saw the commander leaning against the wall i again heard his dying words take my sword to têtefoulques and have a hundred masses performed in the chapel of the castle for the repose of my soul  on the following night i caused one of my servants to sleep in the same room with me i saw and heard nothing either on that night or any of the nights following until the next friday when i had again the same vision with this difference that my valet seemed to be lying at some distance from me on the pavement of the strada stretta the vision continued to be repeated on every friday night the commander always appearing in the same manner and uttering the same words take my sword to têtefoulques and have a hundred masses performed in the chapel of the castle for the repose of my soul on questioning my servant on the subject he stated that on these occasions he dreamed that he was lying in a very narrow street but he neither saw nor heard any thing of the commander  i knew nothing of this têtefoulques whither the defunct was so urgent i should carry his sword i made inquiries therefore concerning it among the french chevaliers they informed me that it was an old castle situated about four leagues from poitiers in the midst of a forest it had been built in old times several centuries since by foulques taillefer or fulke hackiron a redoubtable hardfighting count of angouleme who gave it to an illegitimate son afterward created grand seneschal of poitou which son became the pro genitor of the foulquerres of têtefoulques hereditary seneschals of poitou they farther informed me that strange stories were told of this old castle in the surrounding country and that it contained many curious reliques among these were the arms of foulques taillefer together with all those of the warriors he had slain and that it was an immemorial usage with the foulquerres to have the weapons deposited there which they had wielded either in war or in single combat this then was the reason of the dying injunction of the commander respecting his sword i carried this weapon with me wherever i went but still i neglected to comply with his request  the visions still continued to harass me with undiminished horror i repaired to rome where i confessed myself to the grand cardinal penitentiary and informed him of the terrors with which i was haunted he promised me absolution after i should have performed certain acts of penance the principal of which was to execute the dying request of the commander by carrying the sword to têtefoulques and having the hundred masses performed in the chapel of the castle for the repose of his soul  i set out for france as speedily as possible and made no delay in my journey on arriving at poitiers i found that the tidings of the death of the commander had reached there but had caused no more affliction than among the people of malta leaving my equipage in the town i put on the garb of a pilgrim and taking a guide set out on foot for têtefoulques indeed the roads in this part of the country were impracticable for carriages  i found the castle of têtefoulques a grand but gloomy and dilapidated pile all the gates were closed and there reigned over the whole place an air of almost savage loneliness and desertion i had understood that its only inhabitant were the concierge or warder and a kind of hermit who had charge of the chapel after ringing for some time at the gate i at length succeeded in bringing forth the warder who bowed with reverence to my pilgrims garb i begged him to conduct me to the chapel that being the end of my pilgrimage we found the hermit there chanting the funeral service a dismal sound to one who came to perform a penance for the death of a member of the family when he had ceased to chant i informed him that i came to accomplish an obligation of conscience and that i wished him to perform a hundred masses for the repose of the soul of the commander he replied that not being in orders he was not authorized to perform mass but that he would willingly undertake to see that my debt of conscience was discharged i laid my offering on the altar and would have placed the sword of the commander there likewise hold said the hermit with a melancholy shake of the headthis is no place for so deadly a weapon that has so often been bathed in christian blood take it to the armory you will find there trophies enough of like character it is a place into which i never enter  the warder here took up the theme abandoned by the peaceful man of god he assured me that i would see in the armory the swords of all the warrior race of foulquerres together with those of the enemies over whom they had triumphed this he observed had been a usage kept up since the time of mellusine and of her husband geoffrey a la granddent or geoffrey with the greattooth  i followed the gossiping warder to the armory it was a great dusty hall hung round with gothiclooking portraits of a stark line of warriors each with his weapon and the weapons of those he had slain in battle hung beside his picture the most conspicuous portrait was that of foulques taillefer fulke hackiron count of angouleme and founder of the castle he was represented at fulllength armed capapie and grasping a huge buckler on which were emblazoned three lions passant the figure was so striking that it seemed ready to start from the canvas and i observed beneath this picture a trophy composed of many weapons proofs of the numerous triumphs of this hardfighting old cavalier beside the weapons connected with the portraits there were swords of all shapes sizes and centuries hung round the hall with piles of armor placed as it were in effigy  on each side of an immense chimney were suspended the portraits of the first seneschal of poitou the illegitimate son of foulques taillefer and his wife isabella de lusignan the progenitors of the grim race of foulquerres that frowned around they had the look of being perfect likenesses and as i gazed on them i fancied i could trace in their antiquated features some family resemblance to their unfortunate descendant whom i had slain this was a dismal neighborhood yet the armory was the only part of the castle that had a habitable air so i asked the warder whether he could not make a fire and give me something for supper there and prepare me a bed in one corner  a fire and a supper you shall have and that cheerfully most worthy pilgrim said he but as to a bed i advise you to come and sleep in my chamber  why so inquired i why shall i not sleep in this hall  i have my reasons i will make a bed for you close to mine  i made no objections for i recollected that it was friday and i dreaded the return of my vision he brought in billets of wood kindled a fire in the great overhanging chimney and then went forth to prepare my supper i drew a heavy chair before the fire and seating myself in it gazed muzingly round upon the portraits of the foulquerres and the antiquated armor and weapons the mementos of many a bloody deed as the day declined the smoky draperies of the hall gradually became confounded with the dark ground of the paintings and the lurid gleams from the chimney only enabled me to see visages staring at me from the gathering darkness all this was dismal in the extreme and somewhat appalling perhaps it was the state of my conscience that rendered me peculiarly sensitive and prone to fearful imaginings  at length the warder brought in my supper it consisted of a dish of trout and some crawfish taken in the fosse of the castle he procured also a bottle of wine which he informed me was wine of poitou i requested him to invite the hermit to join me in my repast but the holy man sent back word that he allowed himself nothing but roots and herbs cooked with water i took my meal therefore alone but prolonged it as much as possible and sought to cheer my drooping spirits by the wine of poitou which i found very tolerable  when supper was over i prepared for my evening devotions i have always been very punctual in reciting my breviary it is the prescribed and bounden duty of all chevaliers of the religious orders and i can answer for it is faithfully performed by those of spain i accordingly drew forth from my pocket a small missal and a rosary and told the warder he need only designate to me the way to his chamber where i could come and rejoin him when i had finished my prayers  he accordingly pointed out a winding staircase opening from the hall you will descend this staircase said he until you come to the fourth landingplace where you enter a vaulted passage terminated by an arcade with a statue of the blessed jeanne of france you cannot help finding my room the door of which i will leave open it is the sixth door from the landingplace i advise you not to remain in this hall after midnight before that hour you will hear the hermit ring the bell in going the rounds of the corridors do not linger here after that signal  the warder retired and i commenced my devotions i continued at them earnestly pausing from time to time to put wood upon the fire i did not dare to look much around me for i felt myself becoming a prey to fearful fancies the pictures appeared to become animated if i regarded one attentively for any length of time it seemed to move the eyes and lips above all the portraits of the grand seneschal and his lady which hung on each side of the great chimney the progenitors of the foulquerres of têtefoulque regarded me i thought with angry and baleful eyes i even fancied they exchanged significant glances with each other just then a terrible blast of wind shook all the casements and rushing through the hall made a fearful rattling and clashing among the armor to my startled fancy it seemed something supernatural  at length i heard the bell of the hermit and hastened to quit the hall taking a solitary light which stood on the suppertable i descended the winding staircase but before i had reached the vaulted passage leading to the statue of the blessed jeanne of france a blast of wind extinguished my taper i hastily remounted the stairs to light it again at the chimney but judge of my feelings when on arriving at the entrance to the armory i beheld the seneschal and his lady who had descended from their frames and seated themselves on each side of the fireplace madam my love said the seneschal with great formality and in antiquated phrase what think you of the presumption of this castilian who comes to harbor himself and make wassail in this our castle after having slain our descendant the commander and that without granting him time for confession  truly my lord answered the female spectre with no less stateliness of manner and with great asperity of tone truly my lord i opine that this castilian did a grievous wrong in this encounter and he should never be suffered to depart hence without your throwing him the gauntlet i paused to hear no more but rushed again downstairs to seek the chamber of the warder it was impossible to find it in the darkness and in the perturbation of my mind after an hour and a half of fruitless search and mortal horror and anxieties i endeavored to persuade myself that the day was about to break and listened impatiently for the crowing of the cock for i thought if i could hear his cheerful note i should be reassured catching in the disordered state of my nerves at the popular notion that ghosts never appear after the first crowing of the cock  at length i rallied myself and endeavored to shake off the vague terrors which haunted me i tried to persuade myself that the two figures which i had seemed to see and hear had existed only in my troubled imagination i still had the end of the candle in my hand and determined to make another effort to relight it and find my way to bed for i was ready to sink with fatigue i accordingly sprang up the staircase three steps at a time stopped at the door of the armory and peeped cautiously in the two gothic figures were no longer in the chimney corners but i neglected to notice whether they had reascended to their frames i entered and made desperately for the fireplace but scarce had i advanced three strides when messire foolques taillefer stood before me in the centre of the hall armed capàpie and standing in guard with the point of his sword silently presented to me i would have retreated to the staircase but the door of it was occupied by the phantom figure of an esquire who rudely flung a gauntlet in my face driven to fury i snatched down a sword from the wall by chance it was that of the commander which i had placed there i rushed upon my fantastic adversary and seemed to pierce him through and through but at the same time i felt as if something pierced my heart burning like a redhot iron my blood inundated the hall and i fell senseless  when i recovered consciousness it was broad day and i found myself in a small chamber attended by the warder and the hermit the former told me that on the previous night he had awakened long after the midnight hour and perceiving that i had not come to his chamber he had furnished himself with a vase of holy water and set out to seek me he found me stretched senseless on the pavement of the armory and bore me to this room i spoke of my wound and of the quantity of blood that i had lost he shook his head and knew nothing about it and to my surprise on examination i found myself perfectly sound and unharmed the wound and blood therefore had been all delusion neither the warder nor the hermit put any questions to me but advised me to leave the castle as soon as possible i lost no time in complying with their counsel and felt my heart relieved from an oppressive weight as i left the gloomy and fatebound battlements of têtefoulques behind me  i arrived at bayonne on my way to spain on the following friday at midnight i was startled from my sleep as i had formerly been but it was no longer by the vision of the dying commander it was old foulques taillefer who stood before me armed capàpie and presenting the point of his sword i made the sign of the cross and the spectre vanished but i received the same redhot thrust in the heart which i had felt in the armory and i seemed to be bathed in blood i would have called out or have arisen from my bed and gone in quest of succor but i could neither speak nor stir this agony endured until the crowing of the cock when i fell asleep again but the next day i was ill and in a most pitiable state i have continued to be harassed by the same vision every friday night no acts of penitence and devotion have been able to relieve me from it and it is only a lingering hope in divine mercy that sustains me and enables me to support so lamentable a visitation                                       the grand prior of minorca wasted gradually away under this constant remorse of conscience and this horrible incubus he died some time after having revealed the preceding particulars of his case evidently the victim of a diseased imagination  the above relation has been rendered in many parts literally from the french memoir in which it is given as a true story if so it is one of those instances in which truth is more romantic than fiction                                        legend of the engulphed convent  by geoffrey crayon gent  at the dark and melancholy period when don roderick the goth and his chivalry were overthrown on the banks of the guadalete and all spain was overrun by the moors great was the devastation of churches and convents throughout that pious kingdom the miraculous fate of one of those holy piles is thus recorded in one of the authentic legends of those days  on the summit of a hill not very distant from the capital city of toledo stood an ancient convent and chapel dedicated to the invocation of saint benedict and inhabited by a sisterhood of benedictine nuns this holy asylum was confined to females of noble lineage the younger sisters of the highest families were here given in religious marriage to their saviour in order that the portions of their elder sisters might be increased and they enabled to make suitable matches on earth or that the family wealth might go undivided to elder brothers and the dignity of their ancient houses be protected from decay the convent was renowned therefore for enshrining within its walls a sisterhood of the purest blood the most immaculate virtue and most resplendent beauty of all gothic spain  when the moors overran the kingdom there was nothing that more excited their hostility than these virgin asylums the very sight of a conventspire was sufficient to set their moslem blood in a foment and they sacked it with as fierce a zeal as though the sacking of a nunnery were a sure passport to elysium  tidings of such outrages committed in various parts of the kingdom reached this noble sanctuary and filled it with dismay the danger came nearer and nearer the infidel hosts were spreading all over the country toledo itself was captured there was no flying from the convent and no security within its walls  in the midst of this agitation the alarm was given one day that a great band of saracens were spurring across the plain in an instant the whole convent was a scene of confusion some of the nuns wrung their fair hands at the windows others waved their veils and uttered shrieks from the tops of the towers vainly hoping to draw relief from a country overrun by the foe the sight of these innocent doves thus fluttering about their dovecote but increased the zealot fury of the whiskered moors they thundered at the portal and at every blow the ponderous gates trembled on their hinges  the nuns now crowded round the abbess they had been accustomed to look up to her as allpowerful and they now implored her protection the mother abbess looked with a rueful eye upon the treasures of beauty and vestal virtue exposed to such imminent peril alas how was she to protect them from the spoiler she had it is true experienced many signal interpositions of providence in her individual favor her early days had been passed amid the temptations of a court where her virtue had been purified by repeated trials from none of which had she escaped but by a miracle but were miracles never to cease could she hope that the marvelous protection shown to herself would be extended to a whole sisterhood there was no other resource the moors were at the threshold a few moments more and the convent would be at their mercy summoning her nuns to follow her she hurried into the chapel and throwing herself on her knees before the image of the blessed mary oh holy lady exclaimed she oh most pure and immaculate of virgins thou seest our extremity the ravager is at the gate and there is none on earth to help us look down with pity and grant that the earth may gape and swallow us rather than that our cloister vows should suffer violation  the moors redoubled their assault upon the portal the gates gave way with a tremendous crash a savage yell of exultation arose when of a sudden the earth yawned down sank the convent with its cloisters its dormitories and all its nuns the chapel tower was the last that sank the bell ringing forth a peal of triumph in the very teeth of the infidels                                       forty years had passed and gone since the period of this miracle the subjugation of spain was complete the moors lorded it over city and country and such of the christian population as remained and were permitted to exercise their religion did it in humble resignation to the moslem sway  at this time a christian cavalier of cordova hearing that a patriotic band of his countrymen had raised the standard of the cross in the mountains of the asturias resolved to join them and unite in breaking the yoke of bondage secretly arming himself and caparisoning his steed he set forth from cordova and pursued his course by unfrequented mulepaths and along the dry channels made by winter torrents his spirit burned with indignation whenever on commanding a view over a long sweeping plain he beheld the mosque swelling in the distance and the arab horsemen careering about as if the rightful lords of the soil many a deepdrawn sigh and heavy groan also did the good cavalier utter on passing the ruins of churches and convents desolated by the conquerors  it was on a sultry midsummer evening that this wandering cavalier in skirting a hill thickly covered with forest heard the faint tones of a vesper bell sounding melodiously in the air and seeming to come from the summit of the hill the cavalier crossed himself with wonder at this unwonted and christian sound he supposed it to proceed from one of those humble chapels and hermitages permitted to exist through the indulgence of the moslem conquerors turning his steed up a narrow path of the forest he sought this sanctuary in hopes of finding a hospitable shelter for the night as he advanced the trees threw a deep gloom around him and the bat flitted across his path the bell ceased to toll and all was silence  presently a choir of female voices came stealing sweetly through the forest chanting the evening service to the solemn accompaniment of an organ the heart of the good cavalier melted at the sound for it recalled the happier days of his country urging forward his weary steed he at length arrived at a broad grassy area on the summit of the hill surrounded by the forest here the melodious voices rose in full chorus like the swelling of the breeze but whence they came he could not tell sometimes they were before sometimes behind him sometimes in the air sometimes as if from within the bosom of the earth at length they died away and a holy stillness settled on the place  the cavalier gazed around with bewildered eye there was neither chapel nor convent nor humble hermitage to be seen nothing but a mossgrown stone pinnacle rising out of the centre of the area surmounted by a cross the greensward around appeared to have been sacred from the tread of man or beast and the surrounding trees bent toward the cross as if in adoration  the cavalier felt a sensation of holy awe he alighted and tethered his steed on the skirts of the forest where he might crop the tender herbage then approaching the cross he knelt and poured forth his evening prayers before this relique of the christian days of spain his orisons being concluded he laid himself down at the foot of the pinnacle and reclining his head against one of its stones fell into a deep sleep  about midnight he was awakened by the tolling of a bell and found himself lying before the gate of an ancient convent a train of nuns passed by each bearing a taper the cavalier rose and followed them into the chapel in the centre of which was a bier on which lay the corpse of an aged nun the organ performed a solemn requiem the nuns joining in chorus when the funeral service was finished a melodious voice chanted requiescat in pacemay she rest in peace the lights immediately vanished the whole passed away as a dream and the cavalier found himself at the foot of the cross and beheld by the faint rays of the rising moon his steed quietly grazing near him  when the day dawned the cavalier descended the hill and following the course of a small brook came to a cave at the entrance of which was seated an ancient man clad in hermits garb with rosary and cross and a beard that descended to his girdle he was one of those holy anchorites permitted by the moors to live unmolested in dens and caves and humble hermitages and even to practise the rites of their religion the cavalier checked his horse and dismounting knelt and craved a benediction he then related all that had befallen him in the night and besought the hermit to explain the mystery  what thou hast heard and seen my son replied the other is but type and shadow of the woes of spain  he then related the foregoing story of the miraculous deliverance of the convent  forty years added the holy man have elapsed since this event yet the bells of that sacred edifice are still heard from time to time sounding from under ground together with the pealing of the organ and the chanting of the choir the moors avoid this neighborhood as haunted ground and the whole place as thou mayest perceive has become covered with a thick and lonely forest  the cavalier listened with wonder to the story of this engulphed convent as related by the holy man for three days and nights did they keep vigils beside the cross but nothing more was to be seen of nun or convent it is supposed that forty years having elapsed the natural lives of all the nuns were finished and that the cavalier had beheld the obsequies of the last of the sisterhood certain it is that from that time bell and organ and choral chant have never more been heard  the mouldering pinnacle surmounted by the cross still remains an object of pious pilgrimage some say that it anciently stood in front of the convent but others assert that it was the spire of the sacred edifice and that when the main body of the building sank this remained above ground like the topmast of some tall ship that has foundered these pious believers maintain that the convent is miraculously preserved entire in the centre of the mountain where if proper excavations were made it would be found with all its treasures and monuments and shrines and reliques and the tombs of its virgin nuns  should any one doubt the truth of this marvelous interposition of the virgin to protect the vestal purity of her votaries let him read the excellent work entitled españa triumphante written by padre fray antonio de sancta maria a barefoot friar of the carmelite order and he will doubt no longer                                       the count van horn   during the minority of louis xv while the duke of orleans was regent of france a young flemish nobleman the count antoine joseph van horn made his sudden appearance in paris and by his character conduct and the subsequent disasters in which he became involved created a great sensation in the high circles of the proud aristocracy he was about twentytwo years of age tall finely formed with a pale romantic countenance and eyes of remarkable brilliancy and wildness  he was of one of the most ancient and highlyesteemed families of european nobility being of the line of the princes of horn and overique sovereign counts of hautekerke and hereditary grand veneurs of the empire  the family took its name from the little town and seigneurie of horn in brabant and was known as early as the eleventh century among the little dynasties of the netherlands and since that time by a long line of illustrious generations at the peace of utrecht when the netherlands passed under subjection to austria the house of van horn came under the domination of the emperor at the time we treat of two of the branches of this ancient house were extinct the third and only surviving branch was represented by the reigning prince maximilian emanuel van horn twentyfour years of age who resided in honorable and courtly style on his hereditary domains at baussigny in the netherlands and his brother the count antoine joseph who is the subject of this memoir  the ancient house of van horn by the intermarriage of its various branches with the noble families of the continent had become widely connected and interwoven with the high aristocracy of europe the count antoine therefore could claim relationship to many of the proudest names in paris in fact he was grandson by the mothers side of the prince de ligne and even might boast of affinity to the regent the duke of orleans himself there were circumstances however connected with his sudden appearance in paris and his previous story that placed him in what is termed a false position a word of baleful significance in the fashionable vocabulary of france  the young count had been a captain in the service of austria but had been cashiered for irregular conduct and for disrespect to prince louis of baden commanderinchief to check him in his wild career and bring him to sober reflection his brother the prince caused him to be arrested and sent to the old castle of van wert in the domains of horn this was the same castle in which in former times john van horn stadtholder of gueldres had imprisoned his father a circumstance which has furnished rembrandt with the subject of an admirable painting the governor of the castle was one van wert grandson of the famous john van wert the hero of many a popular song and legend it was the intention of the prince that his brother should be held in honorable durance for his object was to sober and improve not to punish and afflict him van wert however was a stern harsh man of violent passions he treated the youth in a manner that prisoners and offenders were treated in the strongholds of the robber counts of germany in old times confined him in a dungeon and inflicted on him such hardships and indignities that the irritable temperament of the young count was roused to continual fury which ended in insanity for six months was the unfortunate youth kept in this horrible state without his brother the prince being informed of his melancholy condition or of the cruel treatment to which he was subjected at length one day in a paroxysm of frenzy the count knocked down two of his gaolers with a beetle escaped from the castle of van wert and eluded all pursuit and after roving about in a state of distraction made his way to baussigny and appeared like a sceptre before his brother  the prince was shocked at his wretched emaciated appearance and his lamentable state of mental alienation he received him with the most compassionate tenderness lodged him in his own room appointed three servants to attend and watch over him day and night and endeavored by the most soothing and affectionate assiduity to atone for the past act of rigor with which he reproached himself when he learned however the manner in which his unfortunate brother had been treated in confinement and the course of brutalities that had led to his mental malady he was roused to indignation his first step was to cashier van wert from his command that violent man set the prince at defiance and attempted to maintain himself in his government and his castle by instigating the peasants for several leagues round to revolt his insurrection might have been formidable against the power of a petty prince but he was put under the ban of the empire and seized as a state prisoner the memory of his grandfather the oftsung john van wert alone saved him from a gibbet but he was imprisoned in the strong tower of hornopzee there he remained until he was eightytwo years of age savage violent and unconquered to the last for we are told that he never ceased fighting and thumping as long as he could close a fist or wield a cudgel  in the mean time a course of kind and gentle treatment and wholesome regimen and above all the tender and affectionate assiduity of his brother the prince produced the most salutary effects upon count antoine he gradually recovered his reason but a degree of violence seemed always lurking at the bottom of his character and he required to be treated with the greatest caution and mildness for the least contradiction exasperated him  in this state of mental convalescence he began to find the supervision and restraints of brotherly affection insupportable so he left the netherlands furtively and repaired to paris whither in fact it is said he was called by motives of interest to make arrangements concerning a valuable estate which he inherited from his relative the princess depinay  on his arrival in paris he called upon the marquis of créqui and other of the high nobility with whom he was connected he was received with great courtesy but as he brought no letters from his elder brother the prince and as various circumstances of his previous history had transpired they did not receive him into their families nor introduce him to their ladies still they fêted him in bachelor style gave him gay and elegant suppers at their separate apartments and took him to their boxes at the theatres he was often noticed too at the doors of the most fashionable churches taking his stand among the young men of fashion and at such times his tall elegant figure his pale but handsome countenance and his flashing eyes distinguished him from among the crowd and the ladies declared that it was almost impossible to support his ardent gaze  the count did not afflict himself much at his limited circulation in the fastidious circles of the high aristocracy he relished society of a wilder and less ceremonious cast and meeting with loose companions to his taste soon ran into all the excesses of the capital in that most licentious period it is said that in the course of his wild career he had an intrigue with a lady of quality a favorite of the regent that he was surprised by that prince in one of his interviews that sharp words passed between them and that the jealousy and vengeance thus awakened ended only with his life  about this time the famous mississippi scheme of law was at its height or rather it began to threaten that disastrous catastrophe which convulsed the whole financial world every effort was making to keep the bubble inflated the vagrant population of france was swept off from the streets at night and conveyed to havre de grace to be shipped to the projected colonies even laboring people and mechanics were thus crimped and spirited away as count antoine was in the habit of sallying forth at night in disguise in pursuit of his pleasures he came near being carried off by a gang of crimps it seemed in fact as if they had been lying in wait for him as he had experienced very rough treatment at their hands complaint was made of his case by his relation the marquis de créqui who took much interest in the youth but the marquis received mysterious intimations not to interfere in the matter but to advise the count to quit paris immediately if he lingers he is lost this has been cited as a proof that vengeance was dogging at the heels of the unfortunate youth and only watching for an opportunity to destroy him  such opportunity occurred but too soon among the loose companions with whom the count had become intimate were two who lodged in the same hotel with him one was a youth only twenty years of age who passed himself off as the chevalier detampes but whose real name was lestang the prodigal son of a flemish banker the other named laurent de mille a piedmontese was a cashiered captain and at the time an esquire in the service of the dissolute princess de carignan who kept gamblingtables in her palace it is probable that gambling propensities had driven these young men together and that their losses had brought them to desperate measures certain it is that all paris was suddenly astounded by a murder which they were said to have committed what made the crime more startling was that it seemed connected with the great mississippi scheme at that time the fruitful source of all kinds of panics and agitations a jew a stockbroker who dealt largely in shares of the bank of law founded on the mississippi scheme was the victim the story of his death is variously related the darkest account states that the jew was decoyed by these young men into an obscure tavern under pretext of negotiating with him for bank shares to the amount of one hundred thousand crowns which he had with him in his pocketbook lestang kept watch upon the stairs the count and de mille entered with the jew into a chamber in a little while there were heard cries and struggles from within a waiter passing by the room looked in and seeing the jew weltering in his blood shut the door again doublelocked it and alarmed the house lestang rushed downstairs made his way to the hotel secured his most portable effects and fled the country the count and de mille endeavored to escape by the window but were both taken and conducted to prison  a circumstance which occurs in this part of the counts story seems to point him out as a fated man his mother and his brother the prince van horn had received intelligence some time before at baussigny of the dissolute life the count was leading at paris and of his losses at play they despatched a gentleman of the princes household to paris to pay the debts of the count and persuade him to return to flanders or if he should refuse to obtain an order from the regent for him to quit the capital unfortunately the gentleman did not arrive at paris until the day after the murder  the news of the counts arrest and imprisonment on a charge of murder caused a violent sensation among the high aristocracy all those connected with him who had treated him hitherto with indifference found their dignity deeply involved in the question of his guilt or innocence a general convocation was held at the hotel of the marquis de créqui of all the relatives and allies of the house of horn it was an assemblage of the most proud and aristocratic personages of paris inquiries were made into the circumstances of the affair it was ascertained beyond a doubt that the jew was dead and that he had been killed by several stabs of a poniard in escaping by the window it was said that the count had fallen and been immediately taken but that de mille had fled through the streets pursued by the populace and had been arrested at some distance from the scene of the murder that the count had declared himself innocent of the death of the jew and that he had risked his own life in endeavoring to protect him but that de mille on being brought back to the tavern confessed to a plot to murder the broker and rob him of his pocketbook and inculpated the count in the crime  another version of the story was that the count van horn had deposited with the broker bank shares to the amount of eightyeight thousand livres that he had sought him in this tavern which was one of his resorts and had demanded the shares that the jew had denied the deposit that a quarrel had ensued in the course of which the jew struck the count in the face that the latter transported with rage had snatched up a knife from a table and wounded the jew in the shoulder and that thereupon de mille who was present and who had likewise been defrauded by the broker fell on him and despatched him with blows of a poniard and seized upon his pocketbook that he had offered to divide the contents of the latter with the count pro rata of what the usurer had defrauded them that the latter had refused the proposition with disdain and that at a noise of persons approaching both had attempted to escape from the premises but had been taken  regard the story in any way they might appearances were terribly against the count and the noble assemblage was in great consternation what was to be done to ward off so foul a disgrace and to save their illustrious escutcheons from this murderous stain of blood their first attempt was to prevent the affair from going to trial and their relative from being dragged before a criminal tribunal on so horrible and degrading a charge they applied therefore to the regent to intervene his power to treat the count as having acted under an access of his mental malady and to shut him up in a madhouse the regent was deaf to their solicitations he replied coldly that if the count was a madman one could not get rid too quickly of madmen who were furious in their insanity the crime was too public and atrocious to be hushed up or slurred over justice must take its course  seeing there was no avoiding the humiliating scene of a public trial the noble relatives of the count endeavored to predispose the minds of the magistrates before whom he was to be arraigned they accordingly made urgent and eloquent representations of the high descent and noble and powerful connexions of the count set forth the circumstances of his early history his mental malady the nervous irritability to which he was subject and his extreme sensitiveness to insult or contradiction by these means they sought to prepare the judges to interpret every thing in favor of the count and even if it should prove that he had inflicted the mortal blow on the usurer to attribute it to access of insanity provoked by insult  to give full effect to these representations the noble conclave determined to bring upon the judges the dazzling rays of the whole assembled aristocracy accordingly on the day that the trial took place the relations of the count to the number of fiftyseven persons of both sexes and of the highest rank repaired in a body to the palace of justice and took their stations in a long corridor which led to the courtroom here as the judges entered they had to pass in review this array of lofty and noble personages who saluted them mournfully and significantly as they passed any one conversant with the stately pride and jealous dignity of the french noblesse of that day may imagine the extreme state of sensitiveness that produced this selfabasement it was confidently presumed however by the noble suppliants that having once brought themselves to this measure their influence over the tribunal would be irresistible there was one lady present however madame de beauffremont who was affected with the scottish gift of second sight and related such dismal and sinister apparitions as passing before her eyes that many of her female companions were filled with doleful presentiments  unfortunately for the count there was another interest at work more powerful even than the high aristocracy the allpotent abbé dubois the grand favorite and bosom counsellor of the regent was deeply interested in the scheme of law and the prosperity of his bank and of course in the security of the stockbrokers indeed the regent himself is said to have dipped deep in the mississippi scheme dubois and law therefore exerted their influence to the utmost to have the tragic affair pushed to the extremity of the law and the murder of the broker punished in the most signal and appalling manner certain it is the trial was neither long nor intricate the count and his fellow prisoner were equally inculpated in the crime and both were condemned to a death the most horrible and ignominiousto be broken alive on the wheel  as soon as the sentence of the court was made public all the nobility in any degree related to the house of van horn went into mourning another grand aristocratical assemblage was held and a petition to the regent on behalf of the count was drawn out and left with the marquis de créqui for signature this petition set forth the previous insanity of the count and showed that it was a hereditary malady of his family it stated various circumstances in mitigation of his offence and implored that his sentence might be commuted to perpetual imprisonment  upward of fifty names of the highest nobility beginning with the prince de ligne and including cardinals archbishops dukes marquises etc together with ladies of equal rank were signed to this petition by one of the caprices of human pride and vanity it became an object of ambition to get enrolled among the illustrious suppliants a kind of testimonial of noble blood to prove relationship to a murderer the marquis de créqui was absolutely besieged by applicants to sign and had to refer their claims to this singular honor to the prince de ligne the grandfather of the count many who were excluded were highly incensed and numerous feuds took place nay the affronts thus given to the morbid pride of some aristocratical families passed from generation to generation for fifty years afterward the duchess of mazarin complained of a slight which her father had received from the marquis de créqui which proved to be something connected with the signature of this petition this important document being completed the illustrious body of petitioners male and female on saturday evening the eve of palm sunday repaired to the palais royal the residence of the regent and were ushered with great ceremony but profound silence into his hall of council they had appointed four of their number as deputies to present the petition viz the cardinal de rohan the duke de havré the prince de ligne and the marquis de créqui after a little while the deputies were summoned to the cabinet of the regent they entered leaving the assembled petitioners in a state of the greatest anxiety as time slowly wore away and the evening advanced the gloom of the company increased several of the ladies prayed devoutly the good princess of armagnac told her beads  the petition was received by the regent with a most unpropitious aspect in asking the pardon of the criminal said he you display more zeal for the house of van horn than for the service of the king the noble deputies enforced the petition by every argument in their power they supplicated the regent to consider that the infamous punishment in question would reach not merely the person of the condemned not merely the house of van horn but also the genealogies of princely and illustrious families in whose armorial bearings might be found quarterings of this dishonored name  gentlemen replied the regent it appears to me the disgrace consists in the crime rather than in the punishment  the prince de ligne spoke with warmth i have in my genealogical standard said he four escutcheons of van horn and of course have four ancestors of that house i must have them erased and effaced and there would be so many blank spaces like holes in my heraldic ensigns there is not a sovereign family which would not suffer through the rigor of your royal highness nay all the world knows that in the thirtytwo quarterings of madame your mother there is an escutcheon of van horn  very well replied the regent i will share the disgrace with you gentlemen  seeing that a pardon could not be obtained the cardinal de rohan and the marquis de créqui left the cabinet but the prince de ligne and the duke de havré remained behind the honor of their houses more than the life of the unhappy count was the great object of their solicitude they now endeavored to obtain a minor grace they represented that in the netherlands and in germany there was an important difference in the public mind as to the mode of inflicting the punishment of death upon persons of quality that decapitation had no influence on the fortunes of the family of the executed but that the punishment of the wheel was such an infamy that the uncles aunts brothers and sisters of the criminal and his whole family for three succeeding generations were excluded from all noble chapters princely abbeys sovereign bishoprics and even teutonic commanderies of the order of malta they showed how this would operate immediately upon the fortunes of a sister of the count who was on the point of being received as a canoness into one of the noble chapters  while this scene was going on in the cabinet of the regent the illustrious assemblage of petitioners remained in the hall of council in the most gloomy state of suspense the reentrance from the cabinet of the cardinal de rohan and the marquis de créqui with pale downcast countenances had struck a chill into every heart still they lingered until near midnight to learn the result of the after application at length the cabinet conference was at an end the regent came forth and saluted the high personages of the assemblage in a courtly manner one old lady of quality madame de guyon whom he had known in his infancy he kissed on the cheek calling her his good aunt he made a most ceremonious salutation to the stately marchioness de créqui telling her he was charmed to see her at the palais royal a compliment very illtimed said the marchioness considering the circumstance which brought me there he then conducted the ladies to the door of the second saloon and there dismissed them with the most ceremonious politeness  the application of the prince de ligne and the duke de havré for a change of the mode of punishment had after much difficulty been successful the regent had promised solemnly to send a letter of commutation to the attorneygeneral on holy monday the 25th of march at five oclock in the morning according to the same promise a scaffold would be arranged in the cloister of the conciergerie or prison where the count would be beheaded on the same morning immediately after having received absolution this mitigation of the form of punishment gave but little consolation to the great body of petitioners who had been anxious for the pardon of the youth it was looked upon as allimportant however by the prince de ligne who as has been before observedwas exquisitely alive to the dignity of his family  the bishop of bayeux and the marquis de créqui visited the unfortunate youth in prison he had just received the communion in the chapel of the conciergerie and was kneeling before the altar listening to a mass for the dead which was performed at his request he protested his innocence of any intention to murder the jew but did not deign to allude to the accusation of robbery he made the bishop and the marquis promise to see his brother the prince and inform him of this his dying asseveration  two other of his relations the prince rebecqmontmorency and the marshal van isenghien visited him secretly and offered him poison as a means of evading the disgrace of a public execution on his refusing to take it they left him with high indignation miserable man said they you are fit only to perish by the hand of the executioner  the marquis de créqui sought the executioner of paris to bespeak an easy and decent deathfor the unfortunate youth do not make him suffer said he uncover no part of him but the neck and have his body placed in a coffin before you deliver it to his family the executioner promised all that was requested but declined a rouleau of a hundred louisdors which the marquis would have put into his hand i am paid by the king for fulfilling my office said he and added that he had already refused a like sum offered by another relation of the marquis  the marquis de créqui returned home in a state of deep affliction there he found a letter from the duke de st simon the familiar friend of the regent repeating the promise of that prince that the punishment of the wheel should be commuted to decapitation  imagine says the marchioness de créqui who in her memoirs gives a detailed account of this affair imagine what we experienced and what was our astonishment our grief and indignation when on tuesday the 26th of march an hour after midday word was brought us that the count van horn had been exposed on the wheel in the place de gréve since halfpast six in the morning on the same scaffold with the piedmontese de mille and that he had been tortured previous to execution  one more scene of aristocratic pride closed this tragic story the marquis de créqui on receiving this astounding news immediately arrayed himself in the uniform of a general officer with his cordon of nobility on the coat he ordered six valets to attend him in grand livery and two of his carriages each with six horses to be brought forth in this sumptuous state he set off for the place de gréve where he had been preceded by the princes de ligne de rohan de croüy and the duke de havré  the count van horn was already dead and it was believed that the executioner had had the charity to give him the coup de grace or deathblow at eight oclock in the morning at five oclock in the evening when the judge commissary left his post at the hotel de ville these noblemen with their own hands aided to detach the mutilated remains of their relation the marquis de crequi placed them in one of his carriages and bore them off to his hotel to receive the last sad obsequies  the conduct of the regent in this affair excited general indignation his needless severity was attributed by some to vindictive jealousy by others to the persevering machinations of law the house of van horn and the high nobility of flanders and germany considered themselves flagrantly outraged many schemes of vengeance were talked of and a hatred engendered against the regent that followed him through life and was wreaked with bitterness upon his memory after his death  the following letter is said to have been written to the regent by the prince van horn to whom the former had adjudged the confiscated effects of the count  i do not complain sir of the death of my brother but i complain that your royal highness has violated in his person the rights of the kingdom the nobility and the nation i thank you for the confiscation of his effects but i should think myself as much disgraced as he should i accept any favor at your hands i hope that god and the king may render to you as strict justice as you have rendered to my unfortunate brother
