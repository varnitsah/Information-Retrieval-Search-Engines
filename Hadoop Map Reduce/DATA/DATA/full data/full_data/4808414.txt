trumpet with his hand  me lord       as lord william appears james overcome by reminiscences      salutes and is mechanically answered  lord william has      charm  his hair and moustache are crisp and just beginning to      grizzle  his bearing is free easy and only faintly armoured      he will go far to meet you any day  he is in full evening      dress  lord w  cheerfully  i say poulder what have you and james been doing to the press  liberty of the pressit isnt what it was but there is a limit  where is he       he turns to jams between whom and himself there is still the      freemasonry of the trenches  james  pointing to poulder  beind the parapet me lord       the press mopes out from where he has involuntarily been      screened by poulder who looks at james severely  lord william      hides a smile  press  very glad to meet you lord william  my presence down here is quite involuntary  lord w  with a charming smile  i know  the press has to put its erto go to the bottom of everything  wheres this bomb poulder ah       he looks into the wine cooler  press  taking out his notebook  could i have a word with you on the crisis before dinner lord william  lord w  its time you and james were up poulder  indicating the cooler  look after this tell lady william ill be there in a minute  poulder  very good me lord       he goes followed by james carrying the cooler       as the press turns to look after them lord william catches      sight of his back  lord w  i must apologise sir  can i brush you  press  dusting himself  thanks its only behind  he opens his notebook  now lord william if youd kindly outline your views on the national situation after such a narrow escape from death i feel they might have a moral effect  my paper as you know is concerned withthe deeper aspect of things  by the way what do you value your house and collection at  lord w  twisting his little mustache  really i cant  really  press  might i say a quarter of a millionlifted in two seconds and a halfhundred thousand to the second  it brings it home you know  lord w  no no dash it  no  press  disappointed  i seenot draw attention to your property in the present excited state of public feeling  well suppose we approach it from the viewpoint of the antisweating dinner  i have the list of guestsvery weighty  lord w  taken some liftingwouldnt they  press  seriously  may i say that you designed the dinner to soften the tension at this crisis  you saw that case i suppose this morning of the woman dying of starvation in bethnal green  lord w  desperately  yesyes  ive been horribly affected  i always knew this slump would come after the war sooner or later  press  writing    had predicted slump  lord w  you see ive been an antisweating man for years and i thought if only we could come together now  press  nodding  i seei see  get society interested in the sweated through the dinner  i have the menu here he produces it  lord w  good god manmore than that  i want to show the people that we stand side by side with them as we did in the trenches  the whole things too jolly awful  i lie awake over it       he walks up and down  press  scribbling  one moment please  ill just get that down too jolly awfullies awake over it  was wearing a white waistcoat with pearl buttons  at a sign of resentment from his victim i want the human touch lord williamits everything in my paper what do you say about this attempt to bomb you  lord w  well in a way i think its dd natural  press  scribbling  lord william thought it dd natural  lord w  overhearing  no no dont put that down  what i mean is i should like to get hold of those fellows that are singing the marseillaise about the streetsfellows that have been in the war real sports they are you knowthorough good chaps at bottomand say to them have a feeling heart boys put yourself in my position  i dont believe a bit theyd want to bomb me then       he walks up and down  press  scribbling and muttering the idea of brotherhood dyou mind my saying that  word brotherhoodalways effectivealways       he writes  lord e  bewildered  brotherhood well its pure accident that im here and theyre there  all the same i cant pretend to be starving  cant go out into hyde park and stand on a tub can i but if i could only show them what i feeltheyre such good chaps poor devils  press  i quite appreciate  he writes  camel and needles eye you were at eton and oxford  your constituency i know  clubs  but i can get all that  is it your view that christianity is on the upgrade lord william  lord w  dubious  what dyou mean by christianitylovingkindness and that  of course i think that dogmas got the knock       he walks  press  writing  lord william thought dogma had got the knock i should like you just to develop your definition of christianity lovingkindness strikes rather a new note  lord w  new  what about the sermon on the mount  press  writing  refers to sermon on mount  i take it you dont belong to any church lord william  lord w  exasperated  well reallyive been baptised and that sort of thing  but look here  press  oh  you can trust mei shant say anything that youll regret  now do you consider that a religious revival would help to quiet the country  lord w  well i think it would be a deuced good thing if everybody were a bit more kind  press  ah  musing  i feel that your views are strikingly original lord william  if you could just open out on them a little more  how far would you apply kindness in practice  lord w  can you apply it in theory  press  i believe it is done  but would you allow yourself to be blown up with impunity  lord w  well thats a bit extreme  but i quite sympathise with this chap  imagine yourself in his shoes  he sees a huge house all these bottles us swilling them down perhaps hes got a starving wife or consumptive kids  press  writing and murmuring  umm  kids  lord w  he thinks but for the grace of god there swill i  why should that blighter have everything and i nothing and all that  press  writing  and all that  eagerly  yes  lord w  and graduallyyou seethis contrastbecomes an obsession with him  theres got to be an example made he thinks ander he makes it dont you know  press  writing  yees  andwhen youre the example  lord w  well you feel a bit blue of course  but my point is that you quite see it  press  from the other world  do you believe in a future life lord william  the public took a lot of interest in the question if you remember at the time of the war  it might revive at any moment if theres to be a revolution  lord w  the wish is always father to the thought isnt it  press  yes  buterdoesnt the question of a future life rather bear on your point about kindness  if there isnt onewhy be kind  lord w  well i should say one oughtnt to be kind for any motive thats selfinterest but just because one feels it dont you know  press  writing vigorously  thats very newvery new  lord w  simply  you chaps are wonderful  press  doubtfully  you mean werewere  lord w  no really  you have such a dd hard time  it must be perfectly beastly to interview fellows like me  press  oh  not at all lord william  not at all  i assure you compared with a literary man itsits almost heavenly  lord w  you must have a wonderful knowledge of things  press  bridling a little  welli shouldnt say that  lord w  i dont see how you can avoid it  you turn your hands to everything  press  modestly  wellyes yes  lord w  i say  is there really going to be a revolution or are you making it up you press  press  we dont know  we never know whether we come before the event or it comes before us  lord w  thatsvery deepvery dip  dyou mind lending me your notebook a moment  id like to stick that down  all right ill use the other end  the press hands it hypnotically  lord w  jotting  thanks awfully  now whats your real opinion of the situation  press  as a man or a press man  lord w  is there any difference  press  is there any connection  lord w  well as a man  press  as a man i think its rotten  lord w  jotting  rotten  and as a pressman  press  smiling  prime  lord w  what  like a stilton cheese  ha ha       he is about to write  press  my stunt lord william  you said that       he jots it on his cuff  lord w  but look here  would you say that a strong press movement would help to quiet the country  press  well as you ask me lord william ill tell you  no newspapers for a month would do the trick  lord w  jotting  by jove  thats brilliant  press  yes but i should starve  he suddenly looks up and his eyes like gimlets bore their way into lord williams pleasant troubled face  lord william you could do me a real kindness authorise me to go and interview the fellow who left the bomb here ive got his address  i promise you to do it most discreetly  fact iswellim in low water  since the war we simply cant get sensation enough for the new taste  now if i could have an article headed bombed and bombersort of double interview you know itd very likely set me on my legs again  very earnestly  look he holds out his frayed wristbands  lord w  grasping his hand  my dear
