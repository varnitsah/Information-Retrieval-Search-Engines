52274858	the phantom rickshaw and other ghost stories  by rudyard kipling                                            the phantom rickshaw      my own true ghost story      the strange ride of morrowbie jukes      the man who would be king      the finest story in the world                                          the phantom rickshaw    may no ill dreams disturb my rest   nor powers of darkness me molest   evening hymn  one of the few advantages that india has over england is a great knowability after five years service a man is directly or indirectly acquainted with the two or three hundred civilians in his province all the messes of ten or twelve regiments and batteries and some fifteen hundred other people of the nonofficial caste in ten years his knowledge should be doubled and at the end of twenty he knows or knows something about every englishman in the empire and may travel anywhere and everywhere without paying hotelbills  globetrotters who expect entertainment as a right have even within my memory blunted this openheartedness but none the less today if you belong to the inner circle and are neither a bear nor a black sheep all houses are open to you and our small world is very very kind and helpful  rickett of kamartha stayed with polder of kumaon some fifteen years ago he meant to stay two nights but was knocked down by rheumatic fever and for six weeks disorganized polders establishment stopped polders work and nearly died in polders bedroom polder behaves as though he had been placed under eternal obligation by rickett and yearly sends the little ricketts a box of presents and toys it is the same everywhere the men who do not take the trouble to conceal from you their opinion that you are an incompetent ass and the women who blacken your character and misunderstand your wifes amusements will work themselves to the bone in your behalf if you fall sick or into serious trouble  heatherlegh the doctor kept in addition to his regular practice a hospital on his private accountan arrangement of loose boxes for incurables his friend called itbut it was really a sort of fittingup shed for craft that had been damaged by stress of weather the weather in india is often sultry and since the tale of bricks is always a fixed quantity and the only liberty allowed is permission to work overtime and get no thanks men occasionally break down and become as mixed as the metaphors in this sentence  heatherlegh is the dearest doctor that ever was and his invariable prescription to all his patients is lie low go slow and keep cool he says that more men are killed by overwork than the importance of this world justifies he maintains that overwork slew pansay who died under his hands about three years ago he has of course the right to speak authoritatively and he laughs at my theory that there was a crack in pansays head and a little bit of the dark world came through and pressed him to death pansay went off the handle says heatherlegh after the stimulus of long leave at home he may or he may not have behaved like a blackguard to mrs keithwessington my notion is that the work of the katabundi settlement ran him off his legs and that he took to brooding and making much of an ordinary p  o flirtation he certainly was engaged to miss mannering and she certainly broke off the engagement then he took a feverish chill and all that nonsense about ghosts developed overwork started his illness kept it alight and killed him poor devil write him off to the systemone man to take the work of two and a half men  i do not believe this i used to sit up with pansay sometimes when heatherlegh was called out to patients and i happened to be within claim the man would make me most unhappy by describing in a low even voice the procession that was always passing at the bottom of his bed he had a sick mans command of language when he recovered i suggested that he should write out the whole affair from beginning to end knowing that ink might assist him to ease his mind when little boys have learned a new bad word they are never happy till they have chalked it up on a door and this also is literature  he was in a high fever while he was writing and the bloodandthunder magazine diction he adopted did not calm him two months afterward he was reported fit for duty but in spite of the fact that he was urgently needed to help an undermanned commission stagger through a deficit he preferred to die vowing at the last that he was hagridden i got his manuscript before he died and this is his version of the affair dated 1885  my doctor tells me that i need rest and change of air it is not improbable that i shall get both ere longrest that neither the redcoated messenger nor the midday gun can break and change of air far beyond that which any homewardbound steamer can give me in the meantime i am resolved to stay where i am and in flat defiance of my doctors orders to take all the world into my confidence you shall learn for yourselves the precise nature of my malady and shall too judge for yourselves whether any man born of woman on this weary earth was ever so tormented as i  speaking now as a condemned criminal might speak ere the dropbolts are drawn my story wild and hideously improbable as it may appear demands at least attention that it will ever receive credence i utterly disbelieve two months ago i should have scouted as mad or drunk the man who had dared tell me the like two months ago i was the happiest man in india today from peshawur to the sea there is no one more wretched my doctor and i are the only two who know this his explanation is that my brain digestion and eyesight are all slightly affected giving rise to my frequent and persistent delusions delusions indeed i call him a fool but he attends me still with the same unwearied smile the same bland professional manner the same neatly trimmed red whiskers till i begin to suspect that i am an ungrateful eviltempered invalid but you shall judge for yourselves  three years ago it was my fortunemy great misfortuneto sail from gravesend to bombay on return from long leave with one agnes keithwessington wife of an officer on the bombay side it does not in the least concern you to know what manner of woman she was be content with the knowledge that ere the voyage had ended both she and i were desperately and unreasoningly in love with one another heaven knows that i can make the admission now without one particle of vanity in matters of this sort there is always one who gives and another who accepts from the first day of our illomened attachment i was conscious that agness passion was a stronger a more dominant andif i may use the expressiona purer sentiment than mine whether she recognized the fact then i do not know afterward it was bitterly plain to both of us  arrived at bombay in the spring of the year we went our respective ways to meet no more for the next three or four months when my leave and her love took us both to simla there we spent the season together and there my fire of straw burned itself out to a pitiful end with the closing year i attempt no excuse i make no apology mrs wessington had given up much for my sake and was prepared to give up all from my own lips in august 1882 she learned that i was sick of her presence tired of her company and weary of the sound of her voice ninetynine women out of a hundred would have wearied of me as i wearied of them seventyfive of that number would have promptly avenged themselves by active and obtrusive flirtation with other men mrs wessington was the hundredth on her neither my openly expressed aversion nor the cutting brutalities with which i garnished our interviews had the least effect  jack darling was her one eternal cuckoo cry im sure its all a mistakea hideous mistake and well be good friends again some day please forgive me jack dear  i was the offender and i knew it that knowledge transformed my pity into passive endurance and eventually into blind hatethe same instinct i suppose which prompts a man to savagely stamp on the spider he has but half killed and with this hate in my bosom the season of 1882 came to an end  next year we met again at simlashe with her monotonous face and timid attempts at reconciliation and i with loathing of her in every fibre of my frame several times i could not avoid meeting her alone and on each occasion her words were identically the same still the unreasoning wail that it was all a mistake and still the hope of eventually making friends i might have seen had i cared to look that that hope only was keeping her alive she grew more wan and thin month by month you will agree with me at least that such conduct would have driven any one to despair it was uncalled for childish unwomanly i maintain that she was much to blame and again sometimes in the black feverstricken nightwatches i have begun to think that i might have been a little kinder to her but that really is a delusion i could not have continued pretending to love her when i didnt could i it would have been unfair to us both  last year we met againon the same terms as before the same weary appeal and the same curt answers from my lips at least i would make her see how wholly wrong and hopeless were her attempts at resuming the old relationship as the season wore on we fell apartthat is to say she found it difficult to meet me for i had other and more absorbing interests to attend to when i think it over quietly in my sickroom the season of 1884 seems a confused nightmare wherein light and shade were fantastically intermingledmy courtship of little kitty mannering my hopes doubts and fears our long rides together my trembling avowal of attachment her reply and now and again a vision of a white face flitting by in the rickshaw with the black and white liveries i once watched for so earnestly the wave of mrs wessingtons gloved hand and when she met me alone which was but seldom the irksome monotony of her appeal i loved kitty mannering honestly heartily loved her and with my love for her grew my hatred for agnes in august kitty and i were engaged the next day i met those accursed magpie jhampanies at the back of jakko and moved by some passing sentiment of pity stopped to tell mrs wessington everything she knew it already  so i hear youre engaged jack dear then without a moments pause im sure its all a mistakea hideous mistake we shall be as good friends some day jack as we ever were  my answer might have made even a man wince it cut the dying woman before me like the blow of a whip please forgive me jack i didnt mean to make you angry but its true its true  and mrs wessington broke down completely i turned away and left her to finish her journey in peace feeling but only for a moment or two that i had been an unutterably mean hound i looked back and saw that she had turned her rickshaw with the idea i suppose of overtaking me  the scene and its surroundings were photographed on my memory the rainswept sky we were at the end of the wet weather the sodden dingy pines the muddy road and the black powderriven cliffs formed a gloomy background against which the black and white liveries of the jhampanies the yellowpaneled rickshaw and mrs wessingtons downbowed golden head stood out clearly she was holding her handkerchief in her left hand and was leaning hack exhausted against the rickshaw cushions i turned my horse up a bypath near the sanjowlie reservoir and literally ran away once i fancied i heard a faint call of jack this may have been imagination i never stopped to verify it ten minutes later i came across kitty on horseback and in the delight of a long ride with her forgot all about the interview  a week later mrs wessington died and the inexpressible burden of her existence was removed from my life i went plainsward perfectly happy before three months were over i had forgotten all about her except that at times the discovery of some of her old letters reminded me unpleasantly of our bygone relationship by january i had disinterred what was left of our correspondence from among my scattered belongings and had burned it at the beginning of april of this year 1885 i was at simlasemideserted simlaonce more and was deep in lovers talks and walks with kitty it was decided that we should be married at the end of june you will understand therefore that loving kitty as i did i am not saying too much when i pronounce myself to have been at that time the happiest man in india  fourteen delightful days passed almost before i noticed their flight then aroused to the sense of what was proper among mortals circumstanced as we were i pointed out to kitty that an engagement ring was the outward and visible sign of her dignity as an engaged girl and that she must forthwith come to hamiltons to be measured for one up to that moment i give you my word we had completely forgotten so trivial a matter to hamiltons we accordingly went on the 15th of april 1885 remember thatwhatever my doctor may say to the contraryi was then in perfect health enjoying a wellbalanced mind and an absolute tranquil spirit kitty and i entered hamiltons shop together and there regardless of the order of affairs i measured kitty for the ring in the presence of the amused assistant the ring was a sapphire with two diamonds we then rode out down the slope that leads to the combermere bridge and pelitis shop  while my waler was cautiously feeling his way over the loose shale and kitty was laughing and chattering at my sidewhile all simla that is to say as much of it as had then come from the plains was grouped round the readingroom and pelitis verandai was aware that some one apparently at a vast distance was calling me by my christian name it struck me that i had heard the voice before but when and where i could not at once determine in the short space it took to cover the road between the path from hamiltons shop and the first plank of the combermere bridge i had thought over half a dozen people who might have committed such a solecism and had eventually decided that it must have been singing in my ears immediately opposite pelitis shop my eye was arrested by the sight of four jhampanies in magpie livery pulling a yellowpaneled cheap bazar rickshaw in a moment my mind flew back to the previous season and mrs wessington with a sense of irritation and disgust was it not enough that the woman was dead and done with without her black and white servitors reappearing to spoil the days happiness whoever employed them now i thought i would call upon and ask as a personal favor to change her jhampanies livery i would hire the men myself and if necessary buy their coats from off their backs it is impossible to say here what a flood of undesirable memories their presence evoked  kitty i cried there are poor mrs wessingtons jhampanies turned up again i wonder who has them now  kitty had known mrs wessington slightly last season and had always been interested in the sickly woman  what where she asked i cant see them anywhere  even as she spoke her horse swerving from a laden mule threw himself directly in front of the advancing rickshaw i had scarcely time to utter a word of warning when to my unutterable horror horse and rider passed through men and carriage as if they had been thin air  whats the matter cried kitty what made you call out so foolishly jack if i am engaged i dont want all creation to know about it there was lots of space between the mule and the veranda and if you think i cant ridethere  whereupon wilful kitty set off her dainty little head in the air at a handgallop in the direction of the bandstand fully expecting as she herself afterward told me that i should follow her what was the matter nothing indeed either that i was mad or drunk or that simla was haunted with devils i reined in my impatient cob and turned round the rickshaw had turned too and now stood immediately facing me near the left railing of the combermere bridge  jack jack darling there was no mistake about the words this time they rang through my brain as if they had been shouted in my ear its some hideous mistake im sure please forgive me jack and lets be friends again  the rickshawhood had fallen back and inside as i hope and pray daily for the death i dread by night sat mrs keithwessington handkerchief in hand and golden head bowed on her breast  how long i stared motionless i do not know finally i was aroused by my syce taking the walers bridle and asking whether i was ill from the horrible to the commonplace is but a step i tumbled off my horse and dashed half fainting into pelitis for a glass of cherrybrandy there two or three couples were gathered round the coffeetables discussing the gossip of the day their trivialities were more comforting to me just then than the consolations of religion could have been i plunged into the midst of the conversation at once chatted laughed and jested with a face when i caught a glimpse of it in a mirror as white and drawn as that of a corpse three or four men noticed my condition and evidently setting it down to the results of overmany pegs charitably endeavoured to draw me apart from the rest of the loungers but i refused to be led away i wanted the company of my kindas a child rushes into the midst of the dinnerparty after a fright in the dark i must have talked for about ten minutes or so though it seemed an eternity to me when i heard kittys clear voice outside inquiring for me in another minute she had entered the shop prepared to roundly upbraid me for failing so signally in my duties something in my face stopped her  why jack she cried what have you been doing what has happened are you ill thus driven into a direct lie i said that the sun had been a little too much for me it was close upon five oclock of a cloudy april afternoon and the sun had been hidden all day i saw my mistake as soon as the words were out of my mouth attempted to recover it blundered hopelessly and followed kitty in a regal rage out of doors amid the smiles of my acquaintances i made some excuse i have forgotten what on the score of my feeling faint and cantered away to my hotel leaving kitty to finish the ride by herself  in my room i sat down and tried calmly to reason out the matter here was i theobald jack pansay a welleducated bengal civilian in the year of grace 1885 presumably sane certainly healthy driven in terror from my sweethearts side by the apparition of a woman who had been dead and buried eight months ago these were facts that i could not blink nothing was further from my thought than any memory of mrs wessington when kitty and i left hamiltons shop nothing was more utterly commonplace than the stretch of wall opposite pelitis it was broad daylight the road was full of people and yet here look you in defiance of every law of probability in direct outrage of natures ordinance there had appeared to me a face from the grave  kittys arab had gone through the rickshaw so that my first hope that some woman marvelously like mrs wessington had hired the carriage and the coolies with their old livery was lost again and again i went round this treadmill of thought and again and again gave up baffled and in despair the voice was as inexplicable as the apparition i had originally some wild notion of confiding it all to kitty of begging her to marry me at once and in her arms defying the ghostly occupant of the rickshaw after all i argued the presence of the rickshaw is in itself enough to prove the existence of a spectral illusion one may see ghosts of men and women but surely never of coolies and carriages the whole thing is absurd fancy the ghost of a hillman  next morning i sent a penitent note to kitty imploring her to overlook my strange conduct of the previous afternoon my divinity was still very wroth and a personal apology was necessary i explained with a fluency born of nightlong pondering over a falsehood that i had been attacked with sudden palpitation of the heartthe result of indigestion this eminently practical solution had its effect and kitty and i rode out that afternoon with the shadow of my first lie dividing us  nothing would please her save a canter round jakko with my nerves still unstrung from the previous night i feebly protested against the notion suggesting observatory hill jutogh the boileaugunge roadanything rather than the jakko round kitty was angry and a little hurt so i yielded from fear of provoking further misunderstanding and we set out together toward chota simla we walked a greater part of the way and according to our custom cantered from a mile or so below the convent to the stretch of level road by the sanjowlie reservoir the wretched horses appeared to fly and my heart beat quicker and quicker as we neared the crest of the ascent my mind had been full of mrs wessington all the afternoon and every inch of the jakko road bore witness to our oldtime walks and talks the bowlders were full of it the pines sang it aloud overhead the rainfed torrents giggled and chuckled unseen over the shameful story and the wind in my ears chanted the iniquity aloud  as a fitting climax in the middle of the level men call the ladies mile the horror was awaiting me no other rickshaw was in sightonly the four black and white jhampanies the yellowpaneled carriage and the golden head of the woman withinall apparently just as i had left them eight months and one fortnight ago for an instant i fancied that kitty must see what i sawwe were so marvelously sympathetic in all things her next words undeceived menot a soul in sight come along jack and ill race you to the reservoir buildings her wiry little arab was off like a bird my waler following close behind and in this order we dashed under the cliffs half a minute brought us within fifty yards of the rickshaw i pulled my waler and fell back a little the rickshaw was directly in the middle of the road and once more the arab passed through it my horse following jack jack dear please forgive me rang with a wail in my ears and after an intervalits a mistake a hideous mistake  i spurred my horse like a man possessed when i turned my head at the reservoir works the black and white liveries were still waitingpatiently waitingunder the grey hillside and the wind brought me a mocking echo of the words i had just heard kitty bantered me a good deal on my silence throughout the remainder of the ride i had been talking up till then wildly and at random to save my life i could not speak afterward naturally and from sanjowlie to the church wisely held my tongue  i was to dine with the mannerings that night and had barely time to canter home to dress on the road to elysium hill i overheard two men talking together in the duskits a curious thing said one how completely all trace of it disappeared you know my wife was insanely fond of the woman never could see anything in her myself and wanted me to pick up her old rickshaw and coolies if they were to be got for love or money morbid sort of fancy i call it but ive got to do what the memsahib tells me would you believe that the man she hired it from tells me that all four of the menthey were brothersdied of cholera on the way to hardwar poor devils and the rickshaw has been broken up by the man himself told me he never used a dead memsahibs rickshaw spoiled his luck queer notion wasnt it fancy poor little mrs wessington spoiling any ones luck except her own i laughed aloud at this point and my laugh jarred on me as i uttered it so there were ghosts of rickshaws after all and ghostly employments in the other world how much did mrs wessington give her men what were their hours where did they go  and for visible answer to my last question i saw the infernal thing blocking my path in the twilight the dead travel fast and by short cuts unknown to ordinary coolies i laughed aloud a second time and checked my laughter suddenly for i was afraid i was going mad mad to a certain extent i must have been for i recollect that i reined in my horse at the head of the rickshaw and politely wished mrs wessington goodevening her answer was one i knew only too well i listened to the end and replied that i had heard it all before but should be delighted if she had anything further to say some malignant devil stronger than i must have entered into me that evening for i have a dim recollection of talking the commonplaces of the day for five minutes to the thing in front of me  mad as a hatter poor devilor drunk max try and get him to come home  surely that was not mrs wessingtons voice the two men had overheard me speaking to the empty air and had returned to look after me they were very kind and considerate and from their words evidently gathered that i was extremely drunk i thanked them confusedly and cantered away to my hotel there changed and arrived at the mannerings ten minutes late i pleaded the darkness of the night as an excuse was rebuked by kitty for my unloverlike tardiness and sat down  the conversation had already become general and under cover of it i was addressing some tender small talk to my sweetheart when i was aware that at the further end of the table a short redwhiskered man was describing with much broidery his encounter with a mad unknown that evening  a few sentences convinced me that he was repeating the incident of half an hour ago in the middle of the story he looked round for applause as professional storytellers do caught my eye and straightway collapsed there was a moments awkward silence and the redwhiskered man muttered something to the effect that he had forgotten the rest thereby sacrificing a reputation as a good storyteller which he had built up for six seasons past i blessed him from the bottom of my heart andwent on with my fish  in the fulness of time that dinner came to an end and with genuine regret i tore myself away from kittyas certain as i was of my own existence that it would be waiting for me outside the door the redwhiskered man who had been introduced to me as doctor heatherlegh of simla volunteered to bear me company as far as our roads lay together i accepted his offer with gratitude  my instinct had not deceived me it lay in readiness in the mall and in what seemed devilish mockery of our ways with a lighted headlamp the redwhiskered man went to the point at once in a manner that showed he had been thinking over it all dinner time  i say pansay what the deuce was the matter with you this evening on the elysium road the suddenness of the question wrenched an answer from me before i was aware  that said i pointing to it  that may be either d t or eyes for aught i know now you dont liquor i saw as much at dinner so it cant be d t theres nothing whatever where youre pointing though youre sweating and trembling with fright like a scared pony therefore i conclude that its eyes and i ought to understand all about them come along home with me im on the blessington lower road  to my intense delight the rickshaw instead of waiting for us kept about twenty yards aheadand this too whether we walked trotted or cantered in the course of that long night ride i had told my companion almost as much as i have told you here  well youve spoiled one of the best tales ive ever laid tongue to said he but ill forgive you for the sake of what youve gone through now come home and do what i tell you and when ive cured you young man let this be a lesson to you to steer clear of women and indigestible food till the day of your death  the rickshaw kept steady in front and my redwhiskered friend seemed to derive great pleasure from my account of its exact whereabouts  eyes pansayall eyes brain and stomach and the greatest of these three is stomach youve too much conceited brain too little stomach and thoroughly unhealthy eyes get your stomach straight and the rest follows and all thats french for a liver pill ill take sole medical charge of you from this hour for youre too interesting a phenomenon to be passed over  by this time we were deep in the shadow of the blessington lower road and the rickshaw came to a dead stop under a pineclad overhanging shale cliff instinctively i halted too giving my reason heatherlegh rapped out an oath  now if you think im going to spend a cold night on the hillside for the sake of a stomachcumbraincumeye illusion lord ha mercy whats that  there was a muffled report a blinding smother of dust just in front of us a crack the noise of rent boughs and about ten yards of the cliffsidepines undergrowth and allslid down into the road below completely blocking it up the uprooted trees swayed and tottered for a moment like drunken giants in the gloom and then fell prone among their fellows with a thunderous crash our two horses stood motionless and sweating with fear as soon as the rattle of falling earth and stone had subsided my companion mutteredman if wed gone forward we should have been ten feet deep in our graves by now there are more things in heaven and earth come home pansay and thank god i want a peg badly  we retraced our way over the church ridge and i arrived at dr heatherleghs house shortly after midnight  his attempts toward my cure commenced almost immediately and for a week i never left his sight many a time in the course of that week did i bless the goodfortune which had thrown me in contact with simlas best and kindest doctor day by day my spirits grew lighter and more equable day by day too i became more and more inclined to fall in with heatherleghs spectral illusion theory implicating eyes brain and stomach i wrote to kitty telling her that a slight sprain caused by a fall from my horse kept me indoors for a few days and that i should be recovered before she had time to regret my absence  heatherleghs treatment was simple to a degree it consisted of liver pills coldwater baths and strong exercise taken in the dusk or at early dawnfor as he sagely observed a man with a sprained ankle doesnt walk a dozen miles a day and your young woman might be wondering if she saw you  at the end of the week after much examination of pupil and pulse and strict injunctions as to diet and pedestrianism heatherlegh dismissed me as brusquely as he had taken charge of me here is his parting benediction man i can certify to your mental cure and thats as much as to say ive cured most of your bodily ailments now get your traps out of this as soon as you can and be off to make love to miss kitty  i was endeavoring to express my thanks for his kindness he cut me short  dont think i did this because i like you i gather that youve behaved like a blackguard all through but all the same youre a phenomenon and as queer a phenomenon as you are a blackguard nochecking me a second timenot a rupee please go out and see if you can find the eyesbrainandstomach business again ill give you a lakh for each time you see it  half an hour later i was in the mannerings drawingroom with kittydrunk with the intoxication of present happiness and the foreknowledge that i should never more be troubled with its hideous presence strong in the sense of my newfound security i proposed a ride at once and by preference a canter round jakko  never had i felt so well so overladen with vitality and mere animal spirits as i did on the afternoon of the 30th of april kitty was delighted at the change in my appearance and complimented me on it in her delightfully frank and outspoken manner we left the mannerings house together laughing and talking and cantered along the chota simla road as of old  i was in haste to reach the sanjowlie reservoir and there make my assurance doubly sure the horses did their best but seemed all too slow to my impatient mind kitty was astonished at my boisterousness why jack she cried at last you are behaving like a child what are you doing  we were just below the convent and from sheer wantonness i was making my waler plunge and curvet across the road as i tickled it with the loop of my ridingwhip  doing i answered nothing dear thats just it if youd been doing nothing for a week except lie up youd be as riotous as i    singing and murmuring in your feastful mirth     joying to feel yourself alive   lord over nature lord of the visible earth     lord of the senses five  my quotation was hardly out of my lips before we had rounded the corner above the convent and a few yards further on could see across to sanjowlie in the centre of the level road stood the black and white liveries the yellowpaneled rickshaw and mrs keithwessington i pulled up looked rubbed my eyes and i believe must have said something the next thing i knew was that i was lying face downward on the road with kitty kneeling above me in tears  has it gone child i gasped kitty only wept more bitterly  has what gone jack dear what does it all mean there must be a mistake somewhere jack a hideous mistake her last words brought me to my feetmadraving for the time being  yes there is a mistake somewhere i repeated a hideous mistake come and look at it  i have an indistinct idea that i dragged kitty by the wrist along the road up to where it stood and implored her for pitys sake to speak to it to tell it that we were betrothed that neither death nor hell could break the tie between us and kitty only knows how much more to the same effect now and again i appealed passionately to the terror in the rickshaw to bear witness to all i had said and to release me from a torture that was killing me as i talked i suppose i must have told kitty of my old relations with mrs wessington for i saw her listen intently with white face and blazing eyes  thank you mr pansay she said thats quite enough syce ghora láo  the syces impassive as orientals always are had come up with the recaptured horses and as kitty sprang into her saddle i caught hold of the bridle entreating her to hear me out and forgive my answer was the cut of her ridingwhip across my face from mouth to eye and a word or two of farewell that even now i cannot write down so i judged and judged rightly that kitty knew all and i staggered back to the side of the rickshaw my face was cut and bleeding and the blow of the ridingwhip had raised a livid blue wheal on it i had no selfrespect just then heatherlegh who must have been following kitty and me at a distance cantered up  doctor i said pointing to my face heres miss mannerings signature to my order of dismissal and ill thank you for that lakh as soon as convenient  heatherleghs face even in my abject misery moved me to laughter  ill stake my professional reputationhe began  dont be a fool i whispered ive lost my lifes happiness and youd better take me home  as i spoke the rickshaw was gone then i lost all knowledge of what was passing the crest of jakko seemed to heave and roll like the crest of a cloud and fall in upon me  seven days later on the 7th of may that is to say i was aware that i was lying in heatherleghs room as weak as a little child heatherlegh was watching me intently from behind the papers on his writingtable his first words were not encouraging but i was too far spent to be much moved by them  heres miss kitty has sent back your letters you corresponded a good deal you young people heres a packet that looks like a ring and a cheerful sort of a note from mannering papa which ive taken the liberty of reading and burning the old gentlemans not pleased with you  and kitty i asked dully  rather more drawn than her father from what she says by the same token you must have been letting out any number of queer reminiscences just before i met you says that a man who would have behaved to a woman as you did to mrs wessington ought to kill himself out of sheer pity for his kind shes a hotheaded little virago your mash will have it too that you were suffering from d t when that row on the jakko road turned up says shell die before she ever speaks to you again  i groaned and turned over to the other side  now youve got your choice my friend this engagement has to be broken off and the mannerings dont want to be too hard on you was it broken through d t or epileptic fits sorry i cant offer you a better exchange unless youd prefer hereditary insanity say the word and ill tell em its fits all simla knows about that scene on the ladies mile come ill give you five minutes to think over it  during those five minutes i believe that i explored thoroughly the lowest circles of the inferno which it is permitted man to tread on earth and at the same time i myself was watching myself faltering through the dark labyrinths of doubt misery and utter despair i wondered as heatherlegh in his chair might have wondered which dreadful alternative i should adopt presently i heard myself answering in a voice that i hardly recognized  theyre confoundedly particular about morality in these parts give em fits heatherlegh and my love now let me sleep a bit longer  then my two selves joined and it was only i half crazed devildriven i that tossed in my bed tracing step by step the history of the past month  but i am in simla i kept repeating to myself i jack pansay am in simla and there are no ghosts here its unreasonable of that woman to pretend there are why couldnt agnes have left me alone i never did her any harm it might just as well have been me as agnes only id never have come hack on purpose to kill her why cant i be left aloneleft alone and happy  it was high noon when i first awoke and the sun was low in the sky before i sleptslept as the tortured criminal sleeps on his rack too worn to feel further pain  next day i could not leave my bed heatherlegh told me in the morning that he had received an answer from mr mannering and that thanks to his heatherleghs friendly offices the story of my affliction had traveled through the length and breadth of simla where i was on all sides much pitied  and thats rather more than you deserve he concluded pleasantly though the lord knows youve been going through a pretty severe mill never mind well cure you yet you perverse phenomenon  i declined firmly to be cured youve been much too good to me already old man said i but i dont think i need trouble you further  in my heart i knew that nothing heatherlegh could do would lighten the burden that had been laid upon me  with that knowledge came also a sense of hopeless impotent rebellion against the unreasonableness of it all there were scores of men no better than i whose punishments had at least been reserved for another world and i felt that it was bitterly cruelly unfair that i alone should have been singled out for so hideous a fate this mood would in time give place to another where it seemed that the rickshaw and i were the only realities in a world of shadows that kitty was a ghost that mannering heatherlegh and all the other men and women i knew were all ghosts and the great grey hills themselves but vain shadows devised to torture me from mood to mood i tossed backward and forward for seven weary days my body growing daily stronger and stronger until the bedroom lookingglass told me that i had returned to everyday life and was as other men once more curiously enough my face showed no signs of the struggle i had gone through it was pale indeed but as expressionless and commonplace as ever i had expected some permanent alterationvisible evidence of the disease that was eating me away i found nothing  on the 15th of may i left heatherleghs house at eleven oclock in the morning and the instinct of the bachelor drove me to the club there i found that every man knew my story as told by heatherlegh and was in clumsy fashion abnormally kind and attentive nevertheless i recognized that for the rest of my natural life i should be among but not of my fellows and i envied very bitterly indeed the laughing coolies on the mall below i lunched at the club and at four oclock wandered aimlessly down the mall in the vague hope of meeting kitty close to the bandstand the black and white liveries joined me and i heard mrs wessingtons old appeal at my side i had been expecting this ever since i came out and was only surprised at her delay the phantom rickshaw and i went side by side along the chota simla road in silence close to the bazar kitty and a man on horseback overtook and passed us for any sign she gave i might have been a dog in the road she did not even pay me the compliment of quickening her pace though the rainy afternoon had served for an excuse  so kitty and her companion and i and my ghostly lightolove crept round jakko in couples the road was streaming with water the pines dripped like roofpipes on the rocks below and the air was full of fine driving rain two or three times i found myself saying to myself almost aloud im jack pansay on leave at simlaat simla everyday ordinary simla i mustnt forget thati mustnt forget that then i would try to recollect some of the gossip i had heard at the club the prices of soandsos horsesanything in fact that related to the workaday angloindian world i knew so well i even repeated the multiplicationtable rapidly to myself to make quite sure that i was not taking leave of my senses it gave me much comfort and must have prevented my hearing mrs wessington for a time  once more i wearily climbed the convent slope and entered the level road here kitty and the man started off at a canter and i was left alone with mrs wessington agnes said i will you put back your hood and tell me what it all means the hood dropped noiselessly and i was face to face with my dead and buried mistress she was wearing the dress in which i had last seen her alive carried the same tiny handkerchief in her right hand and the same cardcase in her left a woman eight months dead with a cardcase i had to pin myself down to the multiplicationtable and to set both hands on the stone parapet of the road to assure myself that that at least was real  agnes i repeated for pitys sake tell me what it all means mrs wessington leaned forward with that odd quick turn of the head i used to know so well and spoke  if my story had not already so madly overleaped the bounds of all human belief i should apologize to you now as i know that no oneno not even kitty for whom it is written as some sort of justification of my conductwill believe me i will go on mrs wessington spoke and i walked with her from the sanjowlie road to the turning below the commanderinchiefs house as i might walk by the side of any living womans rickshaw deep in conversation the second and most tormenting of my moods of sickness had suddenly laid hold upon me and like the prince in tennysons poem i seemed to move amid a world of ghosts there had been a gardenparty at the commanderinchiefs and we two joined the crowd of homewardbound folk as i saw them then it seemed that they were the shadowsimpalpable fantastic shadowsthat divided for mrs wessingtons rickshaw to pass through what we said during the course of that weird interview i cannotindeed i dare nottell heatherleghs comment would have been a short laugh and a remark that i had been mashing a braineyeandstomach chimera it was a ghastly and yet in some indefinable way a marvelously dear experience could it be possible i wondered that i was in this life to woo a second time the woman i had killed by my own neglect and cruelty  i met kitty on the homeward roada shadow among shadows  if i were to describe all the incidents of the next fortnight in their order my story would never come to an end and your patience would be exhausted morning after morning and evening after evening the ghostly rickshaw and i used to wander through simla together wherever i went there the four black and white liveries followed me and bore me company to and from my hotel at the theatre i found them amid the crowd or yelling jhampanies outside the club veranda after a long evening of whist at the birthday ball waiting patiently for my reappearance and in broad daylight when i went calling save that it cast no shadow the rickshaw was in every respect as real to look upon as one of wood and iron more than once indeed i have had to check myself from warning some hardriding friend against cantering over it more than once i have walked down the mall deep in conversation with mrs wessington to the unspeakable amazement of the passersby  before i had been out and about a week i learned that the fit theory had been discarded in favor of insanity however i made no change in my mode of life i called rode and dined out as freely as ever i had a passion for the society of my kind which i had never felt before i hungered to be among the realities of life and at the same time i felt vaguely unhappy when i had been separated too long from my ghostly companion it would be almost impossible to describe my varying moods from the 15th of may up to today  the presence of the rickshaw filled me by turns with horror blind fear a dim sort of pleasure and utter despair i dared not leave simla and i knew that my stay there was killing me i knew moreover that it was my destiny to die slowly and a little every day my only anxiety was to get the penance over as quietly as might be alternately i hungered for a sight of kitty and watched her outrageous flirtations with my successorto speak more accurately my successorswith amused interest she was as much out of my life as i was out of hers by day i wandered with mrs wessington almost content by night i implored heaven to let me return to the world as i used to know it above all these varying moods lay the sensation of dull numbing wonder that the seen and the unseen should mingle so strangely on this earth to hound one poor soul to its grave                                       august 27heatherlegh has been indefatigable in his attendance on me and only yesterday told me that i ought to send in an application for sick leave an application to escape the company of a phantom a request that the government would graciously permit me to get rid of five ghosts and an airy rickshaw by going to england heatherleghs proposition moved me to almost hysterical laughter i told him that i should await the end quietly at simla and i am sure that the end is not far off believe me that i dread its advent more than any word can say and i torture myself nightly with a thousand speculations as to the manner of my death  shall i die in my bed decently and as an english gentleman should die or in one last walk on the mall will my soul be wrenched from me to take its place forever and ever by the side of that ghastly phantasm shall i return to my old lost allegiance in the next world or shall i meet agnes loathing her and bound to her side through all eternity shall we two hover over the scene of our lives till the end of time as the day of my death draws nearer the intense horror that all living flesh feels toward escaped spirits from beyond the grave grows more and more powerful it is an awful thing to go down quick among the dead with scarcely onehalf of your life completed it is a thousand times more awful to wait as i do in your midst for i know not what unimaginable terror pity me at least on the score of my delusion for i know you will never believe what i have written here yet as surely as ever a man was done to death by the powers of darkness i am that man  in justice too pity her for as surely as ever woman was killed by man i killed mrs wessington and the last portion of my punishment is ever now upon me     my own true ghost story    as i came through the desert thus it was   as i came through the desert   the city of dreadful night  somewhere in the other world where there are books and pictures and plays and shop windows to look at and thousands of men who spend their lives in building up all four lives a gentleman who writes real stories about the real insides of people and his name is mr walter besant but he will insist upon treating his ghostshe has published half a workshopful of themwith levity he makes his ghostseers talk familiarly and in some cases flirt outrageously with the phantoms you may treat anything from a viceroy to a vernacular paper with levity but you must behave reverently toward a ghost and particularly an indian one  there are in this land ghosts who take the form of fat cold pobby corpses and hide in trees near the roadside till a traveler passes then they drop upon his neck and remain there are also terrible ghosts of women who have died in childbed these wander along the pathways at dusk or hide in the crops near a village and call seductively but to answer their call is death in this world and the next their feet are turned backward that all sober men may recognize them there are ghosts of little children who have been thrown into wells these haunt well curbs and the fringes of jungles and wail under the stars or catch women by the wrist and beg to be taken up and carried these and the corpse ghosts however are only vernacular articles and do not attack sahibs no native ghost has yet been authentically reported to have frightened an englishman but many english ghosts have scared the life out of both white and black  nearly every other station owns a ghost there are said to be two at simla not counting the woman who blows the bellows at syree dâkbungalow on the old road mussoorie has a house haunted of a very lively thing a white lady is supposed to do nightwatchman round a house in lahore dalhousie says that one of her houses repeats on autumn evenings all the incidents of a horrible horseandprecipice accident murree has a merry ghost and now that she has been swept by cholera will have room for a sorrowful one there are officers quarters in mian mir whose doors open without reason and whose furniture is guaranteed to creak not with the heat of june but with the weight of invisibles who come to lounge in the chairs peshawur possesses houses that none will willingly rent and there is somethingnot feverwrong with a big bungalow in allahabad the older provinces simply bristle with haunted houses and march phantom armies along their main thoroughfares  some of the dâkbungalows on the grand trunk road have handy little cemeteries in their compoundwitnesses to the changes and chances of this mortal life in the days when men drove from calcutta to the northwest these bungalows are objectionable places to put up in they are generally very old always dirty while the khansamah is as ancient as the bungalow he either chatters senilely or falls into the long trances of age in both moods he is useless if you get angry with him he refers to some sahib dead and buried these thirty years and says that when he was in that sahibs service not a khansamah in the province could touch him then he jabbers and mows and trembles and fidgets among the dishes and you repent of your irritation  in these dâkbungalows ghosts are most likely to be found and when found they should be made a note of not long ago it was my business to live in dâkbungalows i never inhabited the same house for three nights running and grew to be learned in the breed i lived in governmentbuilt ones with red brick walls and rail ceilings an inventory of the furniture posted in every room and an excited snake at the threshold to give welcome i lived in converted onesold houses officiating as dâkbungalowswhere nothing was in its proper place and there wasnt even a fowl for dinner i lived in secondhand palaces where the wind blew through openwork marble tracery just as uncomfortably as through a broken pane i lived in dâkbungalows where the last entry in the visitors book was fifteen months old and where they slashed off the currykids head with a sword it was my good luck to meet all sorts of men from sober traveling missionaries and deserters flying from british regiments to drunken loafers who threw whisky bottles at all who passed and my still greater good fortune just to escape a maternity case seeing that a fair proportion of the tragedy of our lives out here acted itself in dâkbungalows i wondered that i had met no ghosts a ghost that would voluntarily hang about a dâkbungalow would be mad of course but so many men have died mad in dâkbungalows that there must be a fair percentage of lunatic ghosts  in due time i found my ghost or ghosts rather for there were two of them up till that hour i had sympathized with mr besants method of handling them as shown in the strange case of mr lucraft and other stories i am now in the opposition  we will call the bungalow katmal dâkbungalow but that was the smallest part of the horror a man with a sensitive hide has no right to sleep in dâkbungalows he should marry katmal dâkbungalow was old and rotten and unrepaired the floor was of worn brick the walls were filthy and the windows were nearly black with grime it stood on a bypath largely used by native subdeputy assistants of all kinds from finance to forests but real sahibs were rare the khansamah who was nearly bent double with old age said so  when i arrived there was a fitful undecided rain on the face of the land accompanied by a restless wind and every gust made a noise like the rattling of dry bones in the stiff toddy palms outside the khansamah completely lost his head on my arrival he had served a sahib once did i know that sahib he gave me the name of a wellknown man who has been buried for more than a quarter of a century and showed me an ancient daguerreotype of that man in his prehistoric youth i had seen a steel engraving of him at the head of a double volume of memoirs a month before and i felt ancient beyond telling  the day shut in and the khansamah went to get me food he did not go through the pretense of calling it khanamans victuals he said ratub and that means among other things grubdogs rations there was no insult in his choice of the term he had forgotten the other word i suppose  while he was cutting up the dead bodies of animals i settled myself down after exploring the dâkbungalow there were three rooms beside my own which was a corner kennel each giving into the other through dingy white doors fastened with long iron bars the bungalow was a very solid one but the partition walls of the rooms were almost jerrybuilt in their flimsiness every step or bang of a trunk echoed from my room down the other three and every footfall came back tremulously from the far walls for this reason i shut the door there were no lampsonly candles in long glass shades an oil wick was set in the bathroom  for bleak unadulterated misery that dâkbungalow was the worst of the many that i had ever set foot in there was no fireplace and the windows would not open so a brazier of charcoal would have been useless the rain and the wind splashed and gurgled and moaned round the house and the toddy palms rattled and roared half a dozen jackals went through the compound singing and a hyena stood afar off and mocked them a hyena would convince a sadducee of the resurrection of the deadthe worst sort of dead then came the ratuba curious meal half native and half english in compositionwith the old khansamah babbling behind my chair about dead and gone english people and the windblown candles playing shadowbopeep with the bed and the mosquitocurtains it was just the sort of dinner and evening to make a man think of every single one of his past sins and of all the others that he intended to commit if he lived  sleep for several hundred reasons was not easy the lamp in the bathroom threw the most absurd shadows into the room and the wind was beginning to talk nonsense  just when the reasons were drowsy with bloodsucking i heard the regularletustakeandheavehimover grunt of dooliebearers in the compound first one doolie came in then a second and then a third i heard the doolies dumped on the ground and the shutter in front of my door shook thats some one trying to come in i said but no one spoke and i persuaded myself that it was the gusty wind the shutter of the room next to mine was attacked flung back and the inner door opened thats some subdeputy assistant i said and he has brought his friends with him now theyll talk and spit and smoke for an hour  but there were no voices and no footsteps no one was putting his luggage into the next room the door shut and i thanked providence that i was to be left in peace but i was curious to know where the doolies had gone i got out of bed and looked into the darkness there was never a sign of a doolie just as i was getting into bed again i heard in the next room the sound that no man in his senses can possibly mistakethe whir of a billiard ball down the length of the slates when the striker is stringing for break no other sound is like it a minute afterwards there was another whir and i got into bed i was not frightenedindeed i was not i was very curious to know what had become of the doolies i jumped into bed for that reason  next minute i heard the double click of a cannon and my hair sat up it is a mistake to say that hair stands up the skin of the head tightens and you can feel a faint prickly bristling all over the scalp that is the hair sitting up  there was a whir and a click and both sounds could only have been made by one thinga billiard ball i argued the matter out at great length with myself and the more i argued the less probable it seemed that one bed one table and two chairsall the furniture of the room next to minecould so exactly duplicate the sounds of a game of billiards after another cannon a threecushion one to judge by the whir i argued no more i had found my ghost and would have given worlds to have escaped from that dâkbungalow i listened and with each listen the game grew clearer there was whir on whir and click on click sometimes there was a double click and a whir and another click beyond any sort of doubt people were playing billiards in the next room and the next room was not big enough to hold a billiard table  between the pauses of the wind i heard the game go forwardstroke after stroke i tried to believe that i could not hear voices but that attempt was a failure  do you know what fear is not ordinary fear of insult injury or death but abject quivering dread of something that you cannot seefear that dries the inside of the mouth and half of the throatfear that makes you sweat on the palms of the hands and gulp in order to keep the uvula at work this is a fine feara great cowardice and must be felt to be appreciated the very improbability of billiards in a dâkbungalow proved the reality of the thing no mandrunk or sobercould imagine a game at billiards or invent the spitting crack of a screwcannon  a severe course of dâkbungalows has this disadvantageit breeds infinite credulity if a man said to a confirmed dâkbungalowhaunterthere is a corpse in the next room and theres a mad girl in the next but one and the woman and man on that camel have just eloped from a place sixty miles away the hearer would not disbelieve because he would know that nothing is too wild grotesque or horrible to happen in a dâkbungalow  this credulity unfortunately extends to ghosts a rational person fresh from his own house would have turned on his side and slept i did not so surely as i was given up as a bad carcass by the scores of things in the bed because the bulk of my blood was in my heart so surely did i hear every stroke of a long game at billiards played in the echoing room behind the ironbarred door my dominant fear was that the players might want a marker it was an absurd fear because creatures who could play in the dark would be above such superfluities i only know that that was my terror and it was real  after a long long while the game stopped and the door banged i slept because i was dead tired otherwise i should have preferred to have kept awake not for everything in asia would i have dropped the doorbar and peered into the dark of the next room  when the morning came i considered that i had done well and wisely and inquired for the means of departure  by the way khansamah i said what were those three doolies doing in my compound in the night  there were no doolies said the khansamah  i went into the next room and the daylight streamed through the open door i was immensely brave i would at that hour have played black pool with the owner of the big black pool down below  has this place always been a dâkbungalow i asked  no said the khansamah ten or twenty years ago i have forgotten how long it was a billiard room  a how much  a billiard room for the sahibs who built the railway i was khansamah then in the big house where all the railwaysahibs lived and i used to come across with brandyshrab these three rooms were all one and they held a big table on which the sahibs played every evening but the sahibs are all dead now and the railway runs you say nearly to kabul  do you remember anything about the sahibs  it is long ago but i remember that one sahib a fat man and always angry was playing here one night and he said to memangal khan brandypani do and i filled the glass and he bent over the table to strike and his head fell lower and lower till it hit the table and his spectacles came off and when wethe sahibs and i myselfran to lift him he was dead i helped to carry him out aha he was a strong sahib but he is dead and i old mangal khan am still living by your favor  that was more than enough i had my ghosta firsthand authenticated article i would write to the society for psychical researchi would paralyze the empire with the news but i would first of all put eighty miles of assessed crop land between myself and that dâkbungalow before nightfall the society might send their regular agent to investigate later on  i went into my own room and prepared to pack after noting down the facts of the case as i smoked i heard the game begin againwith a miss in balk this time for the whir was a short one  the door was open and i could see into the room clickclick that was a cannon i entered the room without fear for there was sunlight within and a fresh breeze without the unseen game was going on at a tremendous rate and well it might when a restless little rat was running to and fro inside the dingy ceilingcloth and a piece of loose windowsash was making fifty breaks off the windowbolt as it shook in the breeze  impossible to mistake the sound of billiard balls impossible to mistake the whir of a ball over the slate but i was to be excused even when i shut my enlightened eyes the sound was marvelously like that of a fast game  entered angrily the faithful partner of my sorrows kadir baksh  this bungalow is very bad and lowcaste no wonder the presence was disturbed and is speckled three sets of dooliebearers came to the bungalow late last night when i was sleeping outside and said that it was their custom to rest in the rooms set apart for the english people what honor has the khansamah they tried to enter but i told them to go no wonder if these oorias have been here that the presence is sorely spotted it is shame and the work of a dirty man  kadir baksh did not say that he had taken from each gang two annas for rent in advance and then beyond my earshot had beaten them with the big green umbrella whose use i could never before divine but kadir baksh has no notions of morality  there was an interview with the khansamah but as he promptly lost his head wrath gave place to pity and pity led to a long conversation in the course of which he put the fat engineersahibs tragic death in three separate stationstwo of them fifty miles away the third shift was to calcutta and there the sahib died while driving a dogcart  if i had encouraged him the khansamah would have wandered all through bengal with his corpse  i did not go away as soon as i intended i stayed for the night while the wind and the rat and the sash and the windowbolt played a dingdong hundred and fifty up then the wind ran out and the billiards stopped and i felt that i had ruined my one genuine hallmarked ghost story  had i only stopped at the proper time i could have made anything out of it  that was the bitterest thought of all     the strange ride of morrowbie jukes    alive or deadthere is no other way   native proverb  there is as the conjurers say no deception about this tale jukes by accident stumbled upon a village that is well known to exist though he is the only englishman who has been there a somewhat similar institution used to flourish on the outskirts of calcutta and there is a story that if you go into the heart of bikanir which is in the heart of the great indian desert you shall come across not a village but a town where the dead who did not die but may not live have established their headquarters and since it is perfectly true that in the same desert is a wonderful city where all the rich money lenders retreat after they have made their fortunes fortunes so vast that the owners cannot trust even the strong hand of the government to protect them but take refuge in the waterless sands and drive sumptuous cspring barouches and buy beautiful girls and decorate their palaces with gold and ivory and minton tiles and mothernpearl i do not see why jukess tale should not be true he is a civil engineer with a head for plans and distances and things of that kind and he certainly would not take the trouble to invent imaginary traps he could earn more by doing his legitimate work he never varies the tale in the telling and grows very hot and indignant when he thinks of the disrespectful treatment he received he wrote this quite straightforwardly at first but he has since touched it up in places and introduced moral reflections thus  in the beginning it all arose from a slight attack of fever my work necessitated my being in camp for some months between pakpattan and muharakpura desolate sandy stretch of country as every one who has had the misfortune to go there may know my coolies were neither more nor less exasperating than other gangs and my work demanded sufficient attention to keep me from moping had i been inclined to so unmanly a weakness  on the 23d december 1884 i felt a little feverish there was a full moon at the time and in consequence every dog near my tent was baying it the brutes assembled in twos and threes and drove me frantic a few days previously i had shot one loudmouthed singer and suspended his carcass in terrorem about fifty yards from my tentdoor but his friends fell upon fought for and ultimately devoured the body and as it seemed to me sang their hymns of thanksgiving afterward with renewed energy  the lightheartedness which accompanies fever acts differently on different men my irritation gave way after a short time to a fixed determination to slaughter one huge black and white beast who had been foremost in song and first in flight throughout the evening thanks to a shaking hand and a giddy head i had already missed him twice with both barrels of my shotgun when it struck me that my best plan would be to ride him down in the open and finish him off with a hogspear this of course was merely the semidelirious notion of a fever patient but i remember that it struck me at the time as being eminently practical and feasible  i therefore ordered my groom to saddle pornic and bring him round quietly to the rear of my tent when the pony was ready i stood at his head prepared to mount and dash out as soon as the dog should again lift up his voice pornic by the way had not been out of his pickets for a couple of days the night air was crisp and chilly and i was armed with a specially long and sharp pair of persuaders with which i had been rousing a sluggish cob that afternoon you will easily believe then that when he was let go he went quickly in one moment for the brute bolted as straight as a die the tent was left far behind and we were flying over the smooth sandy soil at racing speed  in another we had passed the wretched dog and i had almost forgotten why it was that i had taken the horse and hogspear  the delirium of fever and the excitement of rapid motion through the air must have taken away the remnant of my senses i have a faint recollection of standing upright in my stirrups and of brandishing my hogspear at the great white moon that looked down so calmly on my mad gallop and of shoutlog challenges to the camelthorn bushes as they whizzed past once or twice i believe i swayed forward on pornics neck and literally hung on by my spursas the marks next morning showed  the wretched beast went forward like a thing possessed over what seemed to be a limitless expanse of moonlit sand next i remember the ground rose suddenly in front of us and as we topped the ascent i saw the waters of the sutlej shining like a silver bar below then pornic blundered heavily on his nose and we rolled together down some unseen slope  i must have lost consciousness for when i recovered i was lying on my stomach in a heap of soft white sand and the dawn was beginning to break dimly over the edge of the slope down which i had fallen as the light grew stronger i saw that i was at the bottom of a horseshoeshaped crater of sand opening on one side directly on to the shoals of the sutlej my fever had altogether left me and with the exception of a slight dizziness in the head i felt no had effects from the fall over night  pornic who was standing a few yards away was naturally a good deal exhausted but had not hurt himself in the least his saddle a favorite polo one was much knocked about and had been twisted under his belly it took me some time to put him to rights and in the meantime i had ample opportunities of observing the spot into which i had so foolishly dropped  at the risk of being considered tedious i must describe it at length inasmuch as an accurate mental picture of its peculiarities will be of material assistance in enabling the reader to understand what follows  imagine then as i have said before a horseshoeshaped crater of sand with steeply graded sand walls about thirtyfive feet high the slope i fancy must have been about 65 degrees this crater enclosed a level piece of ground about fifty yards long by thirty at its broadest part with a crude well in the centre round the bottom of the crater about three feet from the level of the ground proper ran a series of eightythree semicircular ovoid square and multilateral holes all about three feet at the mouth each hole on inspection showed that it was carefully shored internally with driftwood and bamboos and over the mouth a wooden dripboard projected like the peak of a jockeys cap for two feet no sign of life was visible in these tunnels but a most sickening stench pervaded the entire amphitheatrea stench fouler than any which my wanderings in indian villages have introduced me to  having remounted pornic who was as anxious as i to get back to camp i rode round the base of the horseshoe to find some place whence an exit would be practicable the inhabitants whoever they might be had not thought fit to put in an appearance so i was left to my own devices my first attempt to rush pornic up the steep sandbanks showed me that i had fallen into a trap exactly on the same model as that which the antlion sets for its prey at each step the shifting sand poured down from above in tons and rattled on the dripboards of the holes like small shot a couple of ineffectual charges sent us both rolling down to the bottom half choked with the torrents of sand and i was constrained to turn my attention to the riverbank  here everything seemed easy enough the sand hills ran down to the river edge it is true but there were plenty of shoals and shallows across which i could gallop pornic and find my way back to terra firma by turning sharply to the right or left as i led pornic over the sands i was startled by the faint pop of a rifle across the river and at the same moment a bullet dropped with a sharp whit close to pornics head  there was no mistaking the nature of the missilea regulation martinihenry picket about five hundred yards away a countryboat was anchored in midstream and a jet of smoke drifting away from its bows in the still morning air showed me whence the delicate attention had come was ever a respectable gentleman in such an impasse the treacherous sand slope allowed no escape from a spot which i had visited most involuntarily and a promenade on the river frontage was the signal for a bombardment from some insane native in a boat im afraid that i lost my temper very much indeed  another bullet reminded me that i had better save my breath to cool my porridge and i retreated hastily up the sands and back to the horseshoe where i saw that the noise of the rifle had drawn sixtyfive human beings from the badgerholes which i had up till that point supposed to be untenanted i found myself in the midst of a crowd of spectatorsabout forty men twenty women and one child who could not have been more than five years old they were all scantily clothed in that salmoncolored cloth which one associates with hindu mendicants and at first sight gave me the impression of a band of loathsome fakirs the filth and repulsiveness of the assembly were beyond all description and i shuddered to think what their life in the badgerholes must be  even in these days when local selfgovernment has destroyed the greater part of a natives respect for a sahib i have been accustomed to a certain amount of civility from my inferiors and on approaching the crowd naturally expected that there would be some recognition of my presence as a matter of fact there was but it was by no means what i had looked for  the ragged crew actually laughed at mesuch laughter i hope i may never hear again they cackled yelled whistled and howled as i walked into their midst some of them literally throwing themselves down on the ground in convulsions of unholy mirth in a moment i had let go pornics head and irritated beyond expression at the mornings adventure commenced cuffing those nearest to me with all the force i could the wretches dropped under my blows like ninepins and the laughter gave place to wails for mercy while those yet untouched clasped me round the knees imploring me in all sorts of uncouth tongues to spare them  in the tumult and just when i was feeling very much ashamed of myself for having thus easily given way to my temper a thin high voice murmured in english from behind my shoulder sahib sahib do you not know me sahib it is gunga dass the telegraphmaster  i spun round quickly and faced the speaker  gunga dass i have of course no hesitation in mentioning the mans real name i had known four years before as a deccanee brahmin loaned by the punjab government to one of the khalsia states he was in charge of a branch telegraphoffice there and when i had last met him was a jovial fullstomached portly government servant with a marvelous capacity for making bad puns in englisha peculiarity which made me remember him long after i had forgotten his services to me in his official capacity it is seldom that a hindu makes english puns  now however the man was changed beyond all recognition castemark stomach slatecolored continuations and unctuous speech were all gone i looked at a withered skeleton turbanless and almost naked with long matted hair and deepset codfisheyes but for a crescentshaped scar on the left cheekthe result of an accident for which i was responsible i should never have known him but it was indubitably gunga dass andfor this i was thankfullan englishspeaking native who might at least tell me the meaning of all that i had gone through that day  the crowd retreated to some distance as i turned toward the miserable figure and ordered him to show me some method of escaping from the crater he held a freshly plucked crow in his hand and in reply to my question climbed slowly on a platform of sand which ran in front of the holes and commenced lighting a fire there in silence dried bents sandpoppies and driftwood burn quickly and i derived much consolation from the fact that he lit them with an ordinary sulphurmatch when they were in a bright glow and the crow was nearly spitted in front thereof gunga dass began without a word of preamble  there are only two kinds of men sar the alive and the dead when you are dead you are dead but when you are alive you live here the crow demanded his attention for an instant as it twirled before the fire in danger of being burned to a cinder if you die at home and do not die when you come to the ghât to be burned you come here  the nature of the reeking village was made plain now and all that i had known or read of the grotesque and the horrible paled before the fact just communicated by the exbrahmin sixteen years ago when i first landed in bombay i had been told by a wandering armenian of the existence somewhere in india of a place to which such hindus as had the misfortune to recover from trance or catalepsy were conveyed and kept and i recollect laughing heartily at what i was then pleased to consider a travelers tale  sitting at the bottom of the sandtrap the memory of watsons hotel with its swinging punkahs whiterobed attendants and the sallowfaced armenian rose up in my mind as vividly as a photograph and i burst into a loud fit of laughter the contrast was too absurd  gunga dass as he bent over the unclean bird watched me curiously hindus seldom laugh and his surroundings were not such as to move gunga dass to any undue excess of hilarity he removed the crow solemnly from the wooden spit and as solemnly devoured it then he continued his story which i give in his own words  in epidemics of the cholera you are carried to be burned almost before you are dead when you come to the riverside the cold air perhaps makes you alive and then if you are only little alive mud is put on your nose and mouth and you die conclusively if you are rather more alive more mud is put but if you are too lively they let you go and take you away i was too lively and made protestation with anger against the indignities that they endeavored to press upon me in those days i was brahmin and proud man now i am dead man and eathere he eyed the wellgnawed breast bone with the first sign of emotion that i had seen in him since we metcrows and other things they took me from my sheets when they saw that i was too lively and gave me medicines for one week and i survived successfully then they sent me by rail from my place to okara station with a man to take care of me and at okara station we met two other men and they conducted we three on camels in the night from okara station to this place and they propelled me from the top to the bottom and the other two succeeded and i have been here ever since two and a half years once i was brahmin and proud man and now i eat crows  there is no way of getting out  none of what kind at all when i first came i made experiments frequently and all the others also but we have always succumbed to the sand which is precipitated upon our heads  but surely i broke in at this point the riverfront is open and it is worth while dodging the bullets while at nighti had already matured a rough plan of escape which a natural instinct of selfishness forbade me sharing with gunga dass he however divined my unspoken thought almost as soon as it was formed and to my intense astonishment gave vent to a long low chuckle of derisionthe laughter be it understood of a superior or at least of an equal  you will nothe had dropped the sir completely after his opening sentencemake any escape that way but you can try i have tried once only  the sensation of nameless terror and abject fear which i had in vain attempted to strive against overmastered me completely my long fastit was now close upon ten oclock and i had eaten nothing since tiffin on the previous daycombined with the violent and unnatural agitation of the ride had exhausted me and i verily believe that for a few minutes i acted as one mad i hurled myself against the pitiless sandslope i ran round the base of the crater blaspheming and praying by turns i crawled out among the sedges of the riverfront only to be driven back each time in an agony of nervous dread by the riflebullets which cut up the sand round mefor i dared not face the death of a mad dog among that hideous crowdand finally fell spent and raving at the curb of the well no one had taken the slightest notion of an exhibition which makes me blush hotly even when i think of it now  two or three men trod on my panting body as they drew water but they were evidently used to this sort of thing and had no time to waste upon me the situation was humiliating gunga dass indeed when he had banked the embers of his fire with sand was at some pains to throw half a cupful of fetid water over my head an attention for which i could have fallen on my knees and thanked him but he was laughing all the while in the same mirthless wheezy key that greeted me on my first attempt to force the shoals and so in a semicomatose condition i lay till noon then being only a man after all i felt hungry and intimated as much to gunga dass whom i had begun to regard as my natural protector following the impulse of the outer world when dealing with natives i put my hand into my pocket and drew out four annas the absurdity of the gift struck me at once and i was about to replace the money  gunga dass however was of a different opinion give me the money said he all you have or i will get help and we will kill you all this as if it were the most natural thing in the world  a britons first impulse i believe is to guard the contents of his pockets but a moments reflection convinced me of the futility of differing with the one man who had it in his power to make me comfortable and with whose help it was possible that i might eventually escape from the crater i gave him all the money in my possession rs 985nine rupees eight annas and five piefor i always keep small change as bakshish when i am in camp gunga dass clutched the coins and hid them at once in his ragged loin cloth his expression changing to something diabolical as he looked round to assure himself that no one had observed us  now i will give you something to eat said he  what pleasure the possession of my money could have afforded him i am unable to say but inasmuch as it did give him evident delight i was not sorry that i had parted with it so readily for i had no doubt that he would have had me killed if i had refused one does not protest against the vagaries of a den of wild beasts and my companions were lower than any beasts while i devoured what gunga dass had provided a coarse chapatti and a cupful of the foul wellwater the people showed not the faintest sign of curiositythat curiosity which is so rampant as a rule in an indian village  i could even fancy that they despised me at all events they treated me with the most chilling indifference and gunga dass was nearly as bad i plied him with questions about the terrible village and received extremely unsatisfactory answers so far as i could gather it had been in existence from time immemorialwhence i concluded that it was at least a century oldand during that time no one had ever been known to escape from it i had to control myself here with both hands lest the blind terror should lay hold of me a second time and drive me raving round the crater gunga dass took a malicious pleasure in emphasizing this point and in watching me wince nothing that i could do would induce him to tell me who the mysterious they were  it is so ordered he would reply and i do not yet know any one who has disobeyed the orders  only wait till my servants find that i am missing i retorted and i promise you that this place shall be cleared off the face of the earth and ill give you a lesson in civility too my friend  your servants would be torn in pieces before they came near this place and besides you are dead my dear friend it is not your fault of course but none the less you are dead and buried  at irregular intervals supplies of food i was told were dropped down from the land side into the amphitheatre and the inhabitants fought for them like wild beasts when a man felt his death coming on he retreated to his lair and died there the body was sometimes dragged out of the hole and thrown on to the sand or allowed to rot where it lay  the phrase thrown on to the sand caught my attention and i asked gunga dass whether this sort of thing was not likely to breed a pestilence  that said he with another of his wheezy chuckles you may see for yourself subsequently you will have much time to make observations  whereat to his great delight i winced once more and hastily continued the conversation and how do you live here from day to day what do you do the question elicited exactly the same answer as beforecoupled with the information that this place is like your european heaven there is neither marrying nor giving in marriage  gunga dass had been educated at a mission school and as he himself admitted had he only changed his religion like a wise man might have avoided the living grave which was now his portion but as long as i was with him i fancy he was happy  here was a sahib a representative of the dominant race helpless as a child and completely at the mercy of his native neighbors in a deliberate lazy way he set himself to torture me as a schoolboy would devote a rapturous halfhour to watching the agonies of an impaled beetle or as a ferret in a blind burrow might glue himself comfortably to the neck of a rabbit the burden of his conversation was that there was no escape of no kind whatever and that i should stay here till i died and was thrown on to the sand if it were possible to forejudge the conversation of the damned on the advent of a new soul in their abode i should say that they would speak as gunga dass did to me throughout that long afternoon i was powerless to protest or answer all my energies being devoted to a struggle against the inexplicable terror that threatened to overwhelm me again and again i can compare the feeling to nothing except the struggles of a man against the overpowering nausea of the channel passageonly my agony was of the spirit and infinitely more terrible  as the day wore on the inhabitants began to appear in full strength to catch the rays of the afternoon sun which were now sloping in at the mouth of the crater they assembled in little knots and talked among themselves without even throwing a glance in my direction about four oclock as far as i could judge gunga dass rose and dived into his lair for a moment emerging with a live crow in his hands the wretched bird was in a most draggled and deplorable condition but seemed to be in no way afraid of its master advancing cautiously to the river front gunga dass stepped from tussock to tussock until he had reached a smooth patch of sand directly in the line of the boats fire the occupants of the boat took no notice here he stopped and with a couple of dexterous turns of the wrist pegged the bird on its back with outstretched wings as was only natural the crow began to shriek at once and beat the air with its claws in a few seconds the clamor had attracted the attention of a bevy of wild crows on a shoal a few hundred yards away where they were discussing something that looked like a corpse half a dozen crows flew over at once to see what was going on and also as it proved to attack the pinioned bird gunga dass who had lain down on a tussock motioned to me to be quiet though i fancy this was a needless precaution in a moment and before i could see how it happened a wild crow who had grappled with the shrieking and helpless bird was entangled in the latters claws swiftly disengaged by gunga dass and pegged down beside its companion in adversity curiosity it seemed overpowered the rest of the flock and almost before gunga dass and i had time to withdraw to the tussock two more captives were struggling in the upturned claws of the decoys so the chaseif i can give it so dignified a namecontinued until gunga dass had captured seven crows five of them he throttled at once reserving two for further operations another day i was a good deal impressed by this to me novel method of securing food and complimented gunga dass on his skill  it is nothing to do said he tomorrow you must do it for me you are stronger than i am  this calm assumption of superiority upset me not a little and i answered peremptorily indeed you old ruffian what do you think i have given you money for  very well was the unmoved reply perhaps not tomorrow nor the day after nor subsequently but in the end and for many years you will catch crows and eat crows and you will thank your european god that you have crows to catch and eat  i could have cheerfully strangled him for this but judged it best under the circumstances to smother my resentment an hour later i was eating one of the crows and as gunga dass had said thanking my god that i had a crow to eat never as long as i live shall i forget that evening meal the whole population were squatting on the hard sand platform opposite their dens huddled over tiny fires of refuse and dried rushes death having once laid his hand upon these men and forborne to strike seemed to stand aloof from them now for most of our company were old men bent and worn and twisted with years and women aged to all appearance as the fates themselves they sat together in knots and talkedgod only knows what they found to discussin low equable tones curiously in contrast to the strident babble with which natives are accustomed to make day hideous now and then an access of that sudden fury which had possessed me in the morning would lay hold on a man or woman and with yells and imprecations the sufferer would attack the steep slope until baffled and bleeding he fell back on the platform incapable of moving a limb the others would never even raise their eyes when this happened as men too well aware of the futility of their fellows attempts and wearied with their useless repetition i saw four such outbursts in the course of the evening  gunga dass took an eminently businesslike view of my situation and while we were diningi can afford to laugh at the recollection now but it was painful enough at the timepropounded the terms on which he would consent to do for me my nine rupees eight annas he argued at the rate of three annas a day would provide me with food for fiftyone days or about seven weeks that is to say he would be willing to cater for me for that length of time at the end of it i was to look after myself for a further considerationvidelicet my bootshe would be willing to allow me to occupy the den next to his own and would supply me with as much dried grass for bedding as he could spare  very well gunga dass i replied to the first terms i cheerfully agree but as there is nothing on earth to prevent my killing you as you sit here and taking everything that you have i thought of the two invaluable crows at the time i flatly refuse to give you my boots and shall take whichever den i please  the stroke was a bold one and i was glad when i saw that it had succeeded gunga dass changed his tone immediately and disavowed all intention of asking for my boots at the time it did not strike me as at all strange that i a civil engineer a man of thirteen years standing in the service and i trust an average englishman should thus calmly threaten murder and violence against the man who had for a consideration it is true taken me under his wing i had left the world it seemed for centuries i was as certain then as i am now of my own existence that in the accursed settlement there was no law save that of the strongest that the living dead men had thrown behind them every canon of the world which had cast them out and that i had to depend for my own life on my strength and vigilance alone the crew of the illfated mignonette are the only men who would understand my frame of mind at present i argued to myself i am strong and a match for six of these wretches it is imperatively necessary that i should for my own sake keep both health and strength until the hour of my release comesif it ever does  fortified with these resolutions i ate and drank as much as i could and made gunga dass understand that i intended to be his master and that the least sign of insubordination on his part would be visited with the only punishment i had it in my power to inflictsudden and violent death shortly after this i went to bed that is to say gunga dass gave me a double armful of dried bents which i thrust down the mouth of the lair to the right of his and followed myself feet foremost the hole running about nine feet into the sand with a slight downward inclination and being neatly shored with timbers from my den which faced the riverfront i was able to watch the waters of the sutlej flowing past under the light of a young moon and compose myself to sleep as best i might  the horrors of that night i shall never forget my den was nearly as narrow as a coffin and the sides had been worn smooth and greasy by the contact of innumerable naked bodies added to which it smelled abominably sleep was altogether out of question to one in my excited frame of mind as the night wore on it seemed that the entire amphitheatre was filled with legions of unclean devils that trooping up from the shoals below mocked the unfortunates in their lairs  personally i am not of an imaginative temperamentvery few engineers arebut on that occasion i was as completely prostrated with nervous terror as any woman after half an hour or so however i was able once more to calmly review my chances of escape any exit by the steep sand walls was of course impracticable i had been thoroughly convinced of this some time before it was possible just possible that i might in the uncertain moonlight safely run the gauntlet of the rifle shots the place was so full of terror for me that i was prepared to undergo any risk in leaving it imagine my delight then when after creeping stealthily to the riverfront i found that the infernal boat was not there my freedom lay before me in the next few steps  by walking out to the first shallow pool that lay at the foot of the projecting left horn of the horseshoe i could wade across turn the flank of the crater and make my way inland without a moments hesitation i marched briskly past the tussocks where gunga dass had snared the crows and out in the direction of the smooth white sand beyond my first step from the tufts of dried grass showed me how utterly futile was any hope of escape for as i put my foot down i felt an indescribable drawing sucking motion of the sand below another moment and my leg was swallowed up nearly to the knee in the moonlight the whole surface of the sand seemed to be shaken with devilish delight at my disappointment i struggled clear sweating with terror and exertion back to the tussocks behind me and fell on my face  my only means of escape from the semicircle was protected with a quicksand  how long i lay i have not the faintest idea but i was roused at last by the malevolent chuckle of gunga dass at my ear i would advise you protector of the poor the ruffian was speaking english to return to your house it is unhealthy to lie down here moreover when the boat returns you will most certainly be rifled at he stood over me in the dim light of the dawn chuckling and laughing to himself suppressing my first impulse to catch the man by the neck and throw him on to the quicksand i rose sullenly and followed him to the platform below the burrows  suddenly and futilely as i thought while i spoke i asked gunga dass what is the good of the boat if i cant get out anyhow i recollect that even in my deepest trouble i had been speculating vaguely on the waste of ammunition in guarding an already well protected foreshore  gunga dass laughed again and made answer they have the boat only in daytime it is for the reason that there is a way i hope we shall have the pleasure of your company for much longer time it is a pleasant spot when you have been here some years and eaten roast crow long enough  i staggered numbed and helpless toward the fetid burrow allotted to me and fell asleep an hour or so later i was awakened by a piercing screamthe shrill highpitched scream of a horse in pain those who have once heard that will never forget the sound i found some little difficulty in scrambling out of the burrow when i was in the open i saw pornic my poor old pornic lying dead on the sandy soil how they had killed him i cannot guess gunga dass explained that horse was better than crow and greatest good of greatest number is political maxim we are now republic mister jukes and you are entitled to a fair share of the beast if you like we will pass a vote of thanks shall i propose  yes we were a republic indeed a republic of wild beasts penned at the bottom of a pit to eat and fight and sleep till we died i attempted no protest of any kind but sat down and stared at the hideous sight in front of me in less time almost than it takes me to write this pornics body was divided in some unclear way or other the men and women had dragged the fragments on to the platform and were preparing their normal meal gunga dass cooked mine the almost irresistible impulse to fly at the sand walls until i was wearied laid hold of me afresh and i had to struggle against it with all my might gunga dass was offensively jocular till i told him that if he addressed another remark of any kind whatever to me i should strangle him where he sat this silenced him till silence became insupportable and i bade him say something  you will live here till you die like the other feringhi he said coolly watching me over the fragment of gristle that he was gnawing  what other sahib you swine speak at once and dont stop to tell me a lie  he is over there answered gunga dass pointing to a burrowmouth about four doors to the left of my own you can see for yourself he died in the burrow as you will die and i will die and as all these men and women and the one child will also die  for pitys sake tell me all you know about him who was he when did he come and when did he die  this appeal was a weak step on my part gunga dass only leered and replied i will notunless you give me something first  then i recollected where i was and struck the man between the eyes partially stunning him he stepped down from the platform at once and cringing and fawning and weeping and attempting to embrace my feet led me round to the burrow which he had indicated  i know nothing whatever about the gentleman your god be my witness that i do not he was as anxious to escape as you were and he was shot from the boat though we all did all things to prevent him from attempting he was shot here gunga dass laid his hand on his lean stomach and bowed to the earth  well and what then go on  and thenand then your honor we carried him in to his house and gave him water and put wet cloths on the wound and he laid down in his house and gave up the ghost  in how long in how long  about half an hour after he received his wound i call vishnu to witness yelled the wretched man that i did everything for him everything which was possible that i did  he threw himself down on the ground and clasped my ankles but i had my doubts about gunga dasss benevolence and kicked him off as he lay protesting  i believe you robbed him of everything he had but i can find out in a minute or two how long was the sahib here  nearly a year and a half i think he must have gone mad but hear me swear protector of the poor wont your honor hear me swear that i never touched an article that belonged to him what is your worship going to do  i had taken gunga dass by the waist and had hauled him on to the platform opposite the deserted burrow as i did so i thought of my wretched fellowprisoners unspeakable misery among all these horrors for eighteen months and the final agony of dying like a rat in a hole with a bulletwound in the stomach gunga dass fancied i was going to kill him and howled pitifully the rest of the population in the plethora that follows a full flesh meal watched us without stirring  go inside gunga dass said i and fetch it out  i was feeling sick and faint with horror now gunga dass nearly rolled off the platform and howled aloud  but i am brahmin sahiba highcaste brahmin by your soul by your fathers soul do not make me do this thing  brahmin or no brahmin by my soul and my fathers soul in you go i said and seizing him by the shoulders i crammed his head into the mouth of the burrow kicked the rest of him in and sitting down covered my face with my hands  at the end of a few minutes i heard a rustle and a creak then gunga dass in a sobbing choking whisper speaking to himself then a soft thudand i uncovered my eyes  the dry sand had turned the corpse entrusted to its keeping into a yellowbrown mummy i told gunga dass to stand off while i examined it the bodyclad in an olivegreen huntingsuit much stained and worn with leather pads on the shoulderswas that of a man between thirty and forty above middle height with light sandy hair long mustache and a rough unkempt beard the left canine of the upper jaw was missing and a portion of the lobe of the right ear was gone on the second finger of the left hand was a ringa shieldshaped bloodstone set in gold with a monogram that might have been either bk or bl on the third finger of the right hand was a silver ring in the shape of a coiled cobra much worn and tarnished gunga dass deposited a handful of trifles he had picked out of the burrow at my feet and covering the face of the body with my handkerchief i turned to examine these i give the full list in the hope that it may lead to the identification of the unfortunate man  1 bowl of a briarwood pipe serrated at the edge much worn and blackened bound with string at the crew  2 two patentlever keys wards of both broken  3 tortoiseshellhandled penknife silver or nickel nameplate marked with monogram bk  4 envelope postmark undecipherable bearing a victorian stamp addressed to miss mon rest illegiblehamnt  5 imitation crocodileskin notebook with pencil first fortyfive pages blank four and a half

or jack  6 handle of smallsized huntingknife blade snapped short bucks horn diamond cut with swivel and ring on the butt fragment of cotton cord attached  it must not be supposed that i inventoried all these things on the spot as fully as i have here written them down the notebook first attracted my attention and i put it in my pocket with a view of studying it later on  the rest of the articles i conveyed to my burrow for safetys sake and there being a methodical man i inventoried them i then returned to the corpse and ordered gunga dass to help me to carry it out to the riverfront while we were engaged in this the exploded shell of an old brown cartridge dropped out of one of the pockets and rolled at my feet gunga dass had not seen it and i fell to thinking that a man does not carry exploded cartridgecases especially browns which will not bear loading twice about with him when shooting in other words that cartridgecase had been fired inside the crater consequently there must be a gun somewhere i was on the verge of asking gunga dass but checked myself knowing that he would lie we laid the body down on the edge of the quicksand by the tussocks it was my intention to push it out and let it be swallowed upthe only possible mode of burial that i could think of i ordered gunga dass to go away  then i gingerly put the corpse out on the quicksand in doing so it was lying face downward i tore the frail and rotten khaki shootingcoat open disclosing a hideous cavity in the back i have already told you that the dry sand had as it were mummified the body a moments glance showed that the gaping hole had been caused by a gunshot wound the gun must have been fired with the muzzle almost touching the back the shootingcoat being intact had been drawn over the body after death which must have been instantaneous the secret of the poor wretchs death was plain to me in a flash some one of the crater presumably gunga dass must have shot him with his own gunthe gun that fitted the brown cartridges he had never attempted to escape in the face of the riflefire from the boat  i pushed the corpse out hastily and saw it sink from sight literally in a few seconds i shuddered as i watched in a dazed halfconscious way i turned to peruse the notebook a stained and discolored slip of paper had been inserted between the binding and the back and dropped out as i opened the pages this is what it contained four out from crowclump three left nine out two right three back two left fourteen out two left seven out one left nine back two right six back four right seven back the paper had been burned and charred at the edges what it meant i could not understand i sat down on the dried bents turning it over and over between my fingers until i was aware of gunga dass standing immediately behind me with glowing eyes and outstretched hands  have you got it he panted will you not let me look at it also i swear that i will return it  got what return what asked  that which you have in your hands it will help us both he stretched out his long birdlike talons trembling with eagerness  i could never find it he continued he had secreted it about his person therefore i shot him but nevertheless i was unable to obtain it  gunga dass had quite forgotten his little fiction about the riflebullet i received the information perfectly calmly morality is blunted by consorting with the dead who are alive  what on earth are you raving about what is it you want me to give you  the piece of paper in the notebook it will help us both oh you fool you fool can you not see what it will do for us we shall escape  his voice rose almost to a scream and he danced with excitement before me i own i was moved at the chance of my getting away  dont skip explain yourself do you mean to say that this slip of paper will help us what does it mean  read it aloud read it aloud i beg and i pray you to read it aloud  i did so gunga dass listened delightedly and drew an irregular line in the sand with his fingers  see now it was the length of his gunbarrels without the stock i have those barrels four gunbarrels out from the place where i caught crows straight out do you follow me then three left ah how well i remember when that man worked it out night after night then nine out and so on out is always straight before you across the quicksand he told me so before i killed him  but if you knew all this why didnt you get out before  i did not know it he told me that he was working it out a year and a half ago and how he was working it out night after night when the boat had gone away and he could get out near the quicksand safely then he said that we would get away together but i was afraid that he would leave me behind one night when he had worked it all out and so i shot him besides it is not advisable that the men who once get in here should escape only i and i am a brahmin  the prospect of escape had brought gunga dasss caste back to him he stood up walked about and gesticulated violently eventually i managed to make him talk soberly and he told me how this englishman had spent six months night after night in exploring inch by inch the passage across the quicksand how he had declared it to be simplicity itself up to within about twenty yards of the river bank after turning the flank of the left horn of the horseshoe this much he had evidently not completed when gunga dass shot him with his own gun  in my frenzy of delight at the possibilities of escape i recollect shaking hands effusively with gunga dass after we had decided that we were to make an attempt to get away that very night it was weary work waiting throughout the afternoon  about ten oclock as far as i could judge when the moon had just risen above the lip of the crater gunga dass made a move for his burrow to bring out the gunbarrels whereby to measure our path all the other wretched inhabitants had retired to their lairs long ago the guardian boat drifted downstream some hours before and we were utterly alone by the crowclump gunga dass while carrying the gunbarrels let slip the piece of paper which was to be our guide i stooped down hastily to recover it and as i did so i was aware that the diabolical brahmin was aiming a violent blow at the back of my head with the gunbarrels it was too late to turn round i must have received the blow somewhere on the nape of my neck a hundred thousand fiery stars danced before my eyes and i fell forwards senseless at the edge of the quicksand  when i recovered consciousness the moon was going down and i was sensible of intolerable pain in the back of my head gunga dass had disappeared and my mouth was full of blood i lay down again and prayed that i might die without more ado then the unreasoning fury which i had before mentioned laid hold upon me and i staggered inland toward the walls of the crater it seemed that some one was calling to me in a whispersahib sahib sahib exactly as my bearer used to call me in the morning i fancied that i was delirious until a handful of sand fell at my feet then i looked up and saw a head peering down into the amphitheatrethe head of dunnoo my dogboy who attended to my collies as soon as he had attracted my attention he held up his hand and showed a rope i motioned staggering to and fro for the while that he should throw it down it was a couple of leather punkahropes knotted together with a loop at one end i slipped the loop over my head and under my arms heard dunnoo urge something forward was conscious that i was being dragged face downward up the steep sand slope and the next instant found myself choked and half fainting on the sand hills overlooking the crater dunnoo with his face ashy grey in the moonlight implored me not to stay but to get back to my tent at once  it seems that he had tracked pornics footprints fourteen miles across the sands to the crater had returned and told my servants who flatly refused to meddle with any one white or black once fallen into the hideous village of the dead whereupon dunnoo had taken one of my ponies and a couple of punkahropes returned to the crater and hauled me out as i have described  to cut a long story short dunnoo is now my personal servant on a gold mohur a montha sum which i still think far too little for the services he has rendered nothing on earth will induce me to go near that devilish spot again or to reveal its whereabouts more clearly than i have done of gunga dass i have never found a trace nor do i wish to do my sole motive in giving this to be published is the hope that some one may possibly identify from the details and the inventory which i have given above the corpse of the man in the olivegreen huntingsuit     the man who would be king    brother to a prince and fellow to a beggar if he be found worthy  the law as quoted lays down a fair conduct of life and one not easy to follow i have been fellow to a beggar again and again under circumstances which prevented either of us finding out whether the other was worthy i have still to be brother to a prince though i once came near to kinship with what might have been a veritable king and was promised the reversion of a kingdomarmy lawcourts revenue and policy all complete but today i greatly fear that my king is dead and if i want a crown i must go hunt it for myself  the beginning of everything was in a railwaytrain upon the road to mhow from ajmir there had been a deficit in the budget which necessitated travelling not secondclass which is only half as dear as firstclass but by intermediate which is very awful indeed there are no cushions in the intermediate class and the population are either intermediate which is eurasian or native which for a long night journey is nasty or loafer which is amusing though intoxicated intermediates do not buy from refreshmentrooms they carry their food in bundles and pots and buy sweets from the native sweetmeatsellers and drink the roadside water this is why in hot weather intermediates are taken out of the carriages dead and in all weathers are most properly looked down upon  my particular intermediate happened to be empty till i reached nasirabad when the big blackbrowed gentleman in shirtsleeves entered and following the custom of intermediates passed the time of day he was a wanderer and a vagabond like myself but with an educated taste for whisky he told tales of things he had seen and done of outoftheway corners of the empire into which he had penetrated and of adventures in which he risked his life for a few days food  if india was filled with men like you and me not knowing more than the crows where theyd get their next days rations it isnt seventy millions of revenue the land would be payingits seven hundred millions said he and as i looked at his mouth and chin i was disposed to agree with him  we talked politicsthe politics of loaferdom that sees things from the under side where the lath and plaster is not smoothed offand we talked postal arrangements because my friend wanted to send a telegram back from the next station to ajmir the turningoff place from the bombay to the mhow line as you travel westward my friend had no money beyond eight annas which he wanted for dinner and i had no money at all owing to the hitch in the budget before mentioned further i was going into a wilderness where though i should resume touch with the treasury there were no telegraph offices i was therefore unable to help him in any way  we might threaten a stationmaster and make him send a wire on tick said my friend but thatd mean inquiries for you and for me and ive got my hands full these days did you say you were travelling back along this line within any days  within ten i said  cant you make it eight said he mine is rather urgent business  i can send your telegrams within ten days if that will serve you i said  i couldnt trust the wire to fetch him now i think of it its this way he leaves delhi on the 23rd for bombay that means hell be running through ajmir about the night of the 23rd  but im going into the indian desert i explained  well and good said he youll be changing at marwar junction to get into jodhpore territoryyou must do thatand hell be coming through marwar junction in the early morning of the 24th by the bombay mail can you be at marwar junction on that time t wont be inconveniencing you because i know that theres precious few pickings to be got out of these central india stateseven though you pretend to be correspondent of the backwoodsman  have you ever tried that trick i asked  again and again but the residents find you out and then you get escorted to the border before youve time to get your knife into them but about my friend here i must give him a word o mouth to tell him whats come to me or else he wont know where to go i would take it more than kind of you if you was to come out of central india in time to catch him at marwar junction and say to him he has gone south for the week hell know what that means hes a big man with a red beard and a great swell he is youll find him sleeping like a gentleman with all his luggage round him in a secondclass apartment but dont you be afraid slip down the window and say he has gone south for the week and hell tumble its only cutting your time of stay in those parts by two days i ask you as a strangergoing to the west he said with emphasis  where have you come from said i  from the east said he and i am hoping that you will give him the message on the squarefor the sake of my mother as well as your own  englishmen are not usually softened by appeals to the memory of their mothers but for certain reasons which will be fully apparent i saw fit to agree  its more than a little matter said he and thats why i asked you to do itand now i know that i can depend on you doing it a secondclass carriage at marwar junction and a redhaired man asleep in it youll be sure to remember i get out at the next station and i must hold on there till he comes or sends me what i want  ill give the message if i catch him i said and for the sake of your mother as well as mine ill give you a word of advice dont try to run the central india states just now as the correspondent of the backwoodsman theres a real one knocking about here and it might lead to trouble  thank you said he simply and when will the swine be gone i cant starve because hes ruining my work i wanted to get hold of the degumber rajah down here about his fathers widow and give him a jump  what did he do to his fathers widow then  filled her up with red pepper and slippered her to death as she hung from a beam i found that out myself and im the only man that would dare going into the state to get hushmoney for it theyll try to poison me same as they did in chortumna when i went on the loot there but youll give the man at marwar junction my message  he got out at a little roadside station and i reflected i had heard more than once of men personating correspondents of newspapers and bleeding small native states with threats of exposure but i had never met any of the caste before they lead a hard life and generally die with great suddenness the native states have a wholesome horror of english newspapers which may throw light on their peculiar methods of government and do their best to choke correspondents with champagne or drive them out of their mind with fourinhand barouches they do not understand that nobody cares a straw for the internal administration of native states so long as oppression and crime are kept within decent limits and the ruler is not drugged drunk or diseased from one end of the year to the other they are the dark places of the earth full of unimaginable cruelty touching the railway and the telegraph on one side and on the other the days of harunalraschid when i left the train i did business with divers kings and in eight days passed through many changes of life sometimes i wore dressclothes and consorted with princes and politicals drinking from crystal and eating from silver sometimes i lay out upon the ground and devoured what i could get from a plate made of leaves and drank the running water and slept under the same rug as my servant it was all in the days work  then i headed for the great indian desert upon the proper date as i had promised and the night mail set me down at marwar junction where a funny little happygolucky nativemanaged railway runs to jodhpore the bombay mail from delhi makes a short halt at marwar she arrived just as i got in and i had just time to hurry to her platform and go down the carriages there was only one secondclass on the train i slipped the window and looked down upon a flamingred beard half covered by a railwayrug that was my man fast asleep and i dug him gently in the ribs he woke with a grunt and i saw his face in the light of the lamps it was a great and shining face  tickets again said he  no said i i am to tell you that he is gone south for the week he has gone south for the week  the train had begun to move out the red man rubbed his eyes he has gone south for the week he repeated now thats just like his impidence did he say that i was to give you anything cause i wont  he didnt i said and dropped away and watched the red lights die out in the dark it was horribly cold because the wind was blowing off the sands i climbed into my own trainnot an intermediate carriage this timeand went to sleep  if the man with the beard had given me a rupee i should have kept it as a memento of a rather curious affair but the consciousness of having done my duty was my only reward  later on i reflected that two gentlemen like my friends could not do any good if they foregathered and personated correspondents of newspapers and might if they blackmailed one of the little rattrap states of central india or southern rajputana get themselves into serious difficulties i therefore took some trouble to describe them as accurately as i could remember to people who would be interested in deporting them and succeeded so i was later informed in having them headed back from the degumber borders  then i became respectable and returned to an office where there were no kings and no incidents outside the daily manufacture of a newspaper a newspaper office seems to attract every conceivable sort of person to the prejudice of discipline zenanamission ladies arrive and beg that the editor will instantly abandon all his duties to describe a christian prizegiving in a back slum of a perfectly inaccessible village colonels who have been overpassed for command sit down and sketch the outline of a series of ten twelve or twentyfour leading articles on seniority versus selection missionaries wish to know why they have not been permitted to escape from their regular vehicles of abuse and swear at a brother missionary under special patronage of the editorial we stranded theatrical companies troop up to explain that they cannot pay for their advertisements but on their return from new zealand or tahiti will do so with interest inventors of patent punkapulling machines carriage couplings and unbreakable swords and axletrees call with specifications in their pockets and hours at their disposal tea companies enter and elaborate their prospectuses with the office pens secretaries of ball committees clamour to have the glories of their last dance more fully described strange ladies rustle in and say i want a hundred ladys cards printed at once please which is manifestly part of an editors duty and every dissolute ruffian that ever tramped the grand trunk road makes it his business to ask for employment as a proofreader and all the time the telephonebell is ringing madly and kings are being killed on the continent and empires are saying youre another and mister gladstone is calling down brimstone upon the british dominions and the little black copyboys are whining kaapi chayhayeh copy wanted like tired bees and most of the paper is as blank as modreds shield  but that is the amusing part of the year there are six other months when none ever come to call and the thermometer walks inch by inch up to the top of the glass and the office is darkened to just above readinglight and the pressmachines are redhot to touch and nobody writes anything but accounts of amusements in the hillstations or obituary notices then the telephone becomes a tinkling terror because it tells you of the sudden deaths of men and women that you knew intimately and the prickly heat covers you with a garment and you sit down and write a slight increase of sickness is reported from the khuda janta khan district the outbreak is purely sporadic in its nature and thanks to the energetic efforts of the district authorities is now almost at an end it is however with deep regret we record the death etc  then the sickness really breaks out and the less recording and reporting the better for the peace of the subscribers but the empires and the kings continue to divert themselves as selfishly as before and the foreman thinks that a daily paper really ought to come out once in twentyfour hours and all the people at the hillstations in the middle of their amusements say good gracious why cant the paper be sparkling im sure theres plenty going on up here  that is the dark half of the moon and as the advertisements say must be experienced to be appreciated  it was in that season and a remarkably evil season that the paper began running the last issue of the week on saturday night which is to say sunday morning after the custom of a london paper this was a great convenience for immediately after the paper was put to bed the dawn would lower the thermometer from 96 degrees to almost 84 degrees for half an hour and in that chillyou have no idea how cold is 84 degrees on the grass until you begin to pray for ita very tired man could get off to sleep ere the heat roused him  one saturday night it was my pleasant duty to put the paper to bed alone a king or courtier or a courtesan or a community was going to die or get a new constitution or do something that was important on the other side of the world and the paper was to be held open till the latest possible minute in order to catch the telegram  it was a pitchyblack night as stifling as a june night can be and the loo the redhot wind from the westward was booming among the tinderdry trees and pretending that the rain was on its heels now and again a spot of almost boiling water would fall on the dust with the flop of a frog but all our weary world knew that was only pretence it was a shade cooler in the pressroom than the office so i sat there while the type ticked and clicked and the nightjars hooted at the windows and the all but naked compositors wiped the sweat from their foreheads and called for water the thing that was keeping us back whatever it was would not come off though the loo dropped and the last type was set and the whole round earth stood still in the choking heat with its finger on its lip to wait the event i drowsed and wondered whether the telegraph was a blessing and whether this dying man or struggling people might be aware of the inconvenience the delay was causing there was no special reason beyond the heat and worry to make tension but as the clockhands crept up to three oclock and the machines spun their flywheels two and three times to see that all was in order before i said the word that would set them off i could have shrieked aloud  then the roar and rattle of the wheels shivered the quiet into little bits i rose to go away but two men in white clothes stood in front of me the first one said its him the second said so it is and they both laughed almost as loudly as the machinery roared and mopped their foreheads we seed there was a light burning across the road and we were sleeping in that ditch there for coolness and i said to my friend here the office is open lets come along and speak to him as turned us back from degumber state said the smaller of the two he was the man i had met in the mhow train and his fellow was the redbearded man of marwar junction there was no mistaking the eyebrows of the one or the beard of the other  i was not pleased because i wished to go to sleep not to squabble with loafers what do you want i asked  half an hours talk with you cool and comfortable in the office said the redbearded man wed like some drinkthe contrack doesnt begin yet peachey so you neednt lookbut what we really want is advice we dont want money we ask you as a favour because we found out you did us a bad turn about degumber state  i led from the pressroom to the stifling office with the maps on the walls and the redhaired man rubbed his hands thats something like said he this was the proper shop to come to now sir let me introduce you to brother peachey carnehan thats him and brother daniel dravot that is me and the less said about our professions the better for we have been most things in our timesoldier sailor compositor photographer proofreader streetpreacher and correspondents of the backwoodsman when we thought the paper wanted one carnehan is sober and so am i look at us first and see thats sure it will save you cutting into my talk well take one of your cigars apiece and you shall see us light up  i watched the test the men were absolutely sober so i gave them each a tepid whiskyandsoda  well and good said carnehan of the eyebrows wiping the froth from his moustache let me talk now dan we have been all over india mostly on foot we have been boilerfitters enginedrivers petty contractors and all that and we have decided that india isnt big enough for such as us  they certainly were too big for the office dravots beard seemed to fill half the room and carnehans shoulders the other half as they sat on the big table carnehan continued the country isnt half worked out because they that governs it wont let you touch it they spend all their blessed time in governing it and you cant lift a spade nor chip a rock nor look for oil nor anything like that without all the government saying leave it alone and let us govern therefore such as it is we will let it alone and go away to some other place where a man isnt crowded and can come to his own we are not little men and there is nothing that we are afraid of except drink and we have signed a contrack on that therefore we are going away to be kings  kings in our own right muttered dravot  yes of course i said youve been tramping in the sun and its a very warm night and hadnt you better sleep over the notion come tomorrow  neither drunk nor sunstruck said dravot we have slept over the notion half a year and require to see books and atlases and we have decided that there is only one place now in the world that two strong men can sarawhack they call it kafiristan by my reckoning its the top righthand corner of afghanistan not more than three hundred miles from peshawar they have two and thirty heathen idols there and well be the thirtythird and fourth its a mountaineous country the women of those parts are very beautiful  but that is provided against in the contrack said carnehan neither women nor liquor daniel  and thats all we know except that no one has gone there and they fight and in any place where they fight a man who knows how to drill men can always be a king we shall go to those parts and say to any king we find d you want to vanquish your foes and we will show him how to drill men for that we know better than anything else then we will subvert that king and seize his throne and establish a dynasty  youll be cut to pieces before youre fifty miles across the border i said you have to travel through afghanistan to get to that country its one mass of mountains and peaks and glaciers and no englishman has been through it the people are utter brutes and even if you reached them you couldnt do anything  thats more like said carnehan if you could think us a little more mad we would be more pleased we have come to you to know about this country to read a book about it and to be shown maps we want you to tell us that we are fools and to show us your books he turned to the bookcases  are you at all in earnest i said  a little said dravot sweetly as big a map as you have got even if its all blank where kafiristan is and any books youve got we can read though we arent very educated  i uncased the big thirtytwomilestotheinch map of india and two smaller frontier maps hauled down volume infkan of the encyclopaedia britannica and the men consulted them  see here said dravot his thumb on the map up to jagdallak peachey and me know the road we was there with roberts army well have to turn off to the right at jagdallak through laghmann territory then we get among the hillsfourteen thousand feetfifteen thousandit will be cold work there but it dont look very far on the map  i handed him wood on the sources of the oxus carnehan was deep in the encyclopaedia  theyre a mixed lot said dravot reflectively and it wont help us to know the names of their tribes the more tribes the more theyll fight and the better for us from jagdallak to ashang hmm  but all the information about the country is as sketchy and inaccurate as can be i protested no one knows anything about it really heres the file of the united services institute read what bellew says  blow bellew said carnehan dan theyre a stinkin lot of heathens but this book here says they think theyre related to us english  i smoked while the men poured over raverty wood the maps and the encyclopaedia  there is no use your waiting said dravot politely its about four oclock now well go before six oclock if you want to sleep and we wont steal any of the papers dont you sit up were two harmless lunatics and if you come tomorrow evening down to the serai well say goodbye to you  you are two fools i answered youll be turned back at the frontier or cut up the minute you set foot in afghanistan do you want any money or a recommendation downcountry i can help you to the chance of work next week  next week we shall be hard at work ourselves thank you said dravot it isnt so easy being a king as it looks when weve got our kingdom in going order well let you know and you can come up and help us govern it  would two lunatics make a contrack like that said carnehan with subdued pride showing me a greasy halfsheet of notepaper on which was written the following i copied it then and there as a curiosity    this contract between me and you persuing witnesseth in   the name of godamen and so forth    one     that me and you will settle this matter             together ie to be kings of kafiristan    two     that you and me will not while this             matter is being settled look at any             liquor nor any woman black white             or brown so as to get mixed up with             one or the other harmful    three   that we conduct ourselves with dignity             and discretion and if one of us gets             into trouble the other will stay by him    signed by you and me this day             peachey taliaferro carnehan             daniel dravot             both gentlemen at large  there was no need for the last article said carnehan blushing modestly but it looks regular now you know the sort of men that loafers arewe are loafers dan until we get out of indiaand do you think that we would sign a contrack like that unless we was in earnest we have kept away from the two things that make life worth having  you wont enjoy your lives much longer if you are going to try this idiotic adventure dont set the office on fire i said and go away before nine oclock  i left them still poring over the maps and making notes on the back of the contrack be sure to come down to the serai tomorrow were their parting words  the kumharsen serai is the great foursquare sink of humanity where the strings of camels and horses from the north load and unload all the nationalities of central asia may be found there and most of the folk of india proper balkh and bokhara there meet bengal and bombay and try to draw eyeteeth you can buy ponies turquoises persian pussycats saddlebags fattailed sheep and musk in the kumharsen serai and get many strange things for nothing in the afternoon i went down to see whether my friends intended to keep their word or were lying there drunk  a priest attired in fragments of ribbons and rags stalked up to me gravely twisting a childs paper whirligig behind him was his servant bending under the load of a crate of mud toys the two were loading up two camels and the inhabitants of the serai watched them with shrieks of laughter  the priest is mad said a horsedealer to me he is going up to kabul to sell toys to the amir he will either be raised to honour or have his head cut off he came in here this morning and has been behaving madly ever since  the witless are under the protection of god stammered a flatcheeked usbeg in broken hindi they foretell future events  would they could have foretold that my caravan would have been cut up by the shinwaris almost within shadow of the pass grunted the eusufzai agent of a rajputana tradinghouse whose goods had been diverted into the hands of other robbers just across the border and whose misfortunes were the laughingstock of the bazaar ohé priest whence come you and whither do you go  from roum have i come shouted the priest waving his whirligig from roum blown by the breath of a hundred devils across the sea o thieves robbers liars the blessing of pir khan on pigs dogs and perjurers who will take the protected of god to the north to sell charms that are never still to the amir the camels shall not gall the sons shall not fall sick and the wives shall remain faithful while they are away of the men who give me place in their caravan who will assist me to slipper the king of the roos with a golden slipper with a silver heel the protection of pir khan be upon his labours he spread out the skirts of his gabardine and pirouetted between the lines of tethered horses  there starts a caravan from peshawar to kabul in twenty days huzrut said the eusufzai trader my camels go therewith do thou also go and bring us good luck  i will go even now shouted the priest i will depart upon my winged camels and be at peshawar in a day ho hazar mir khan he yelled to his servant drive out the camels but let me first mount my own  he leaped on the back of his beast as it knelt and turning round to me cried come thou also sahib a little along the road and i will sell thee a charman amulet that shall make thee king of kafiristan  then the light broke upon me and i followed the two camels out of the serai till we reached open road and the priest halted  what d you think o that said he in english carnehan cant talk their patter so ive made him my servant he makes a handsome servant t isnt for nothing that ive been knocking about the country for fourteen years didnt i do that talk neat well hitch on to a caravan at peshawar till we get to jagdallak and then well see if we can get donkeys for our camels and strike into kafiristan whirligigs for the amir o lor put your hand under the camelbags and tell me what you feel  i felt the butt of a martini and another and another  twenty of em said dravot placidly twenty of em and ammunition to correspond under the whirligigs and the mud dolls  heaven help you if you are caught with those things i said a martini is worth her weight in silver among the pathans  fifteen hundred rupees of capitalevery rupee we could beg borrow or stealare invested on these two camels said dravot we wont get caught were going through the khaiber with a regular caravan whod touch a poor mad priest  have you got everything you want i asked overcome with astonishment  not yet but we shall soon give us a memento of your kindness brother you did me a service yesterday and that time in marwar half my kingdom shall you have as the saying is i slipped a small charm compass from my watchchain and handed it up to the priest  goodbye said dravot giving me hand cautiously its the last time well shake hands with an englishman these many days shake hands with him carnehan he cried as the second camel passed me  carnehan leaned down and shook hands then the camels passed away along the dusty road and i was left alone to wonder my eye could detect no failure in the disguises the scene in the serai proved that they were complete to the native mind there was just the chance therefore that carnehan and dravot would be able to wander through afghanistan without detection but beyond they would find deathcertain and awful death  ten days later a native correspondent giving me the news of the day from peshawar wound up his letter with there has been much laughter here on account of a certain mad priest who is going in his estimation to sell petty gauds and insignificant trinkets which he ascribes as great charms to h h the amir of bokhara he passed through peshawar and associated himself to the second summer caravan that goes to kabul the merchants are pleased because through superstition they imagine that such mad fellows bring good fortune  the two then were beyond the border i would have prayed for them but that night a real king died in europe and demanded an obituary notice  the wheel of the world swings through the same phases again and again summer passed and winter thereafter and came and passed again the daily paper continued and i with it and upon the third summer there fell a hot night a night issue and a strained waiting for something to be telegraphed from the other side of the world exactly as had happened before a few great men had died in the past two years the machines worked with more clatter and some of the trees in the office garden were a few feet taller but that was all the difference  i passed over to the pressroom and went through just such a scene as i have already described the nervous tension was stronger than it had been two years before and i felt the heat more acutely at three oclock i cried print off and turned to go when there crept to my chair what was left of a man he was bent into a circle his head was sunk between his shoulders and he moved his feet one over the other like a bear i could hardly see whether he walked or crawledthis ragwrapped whining cripple who addressed me by name crying that he was come back can you give me a drink he whimpered for the lords sake give me a drink  i went back to the office the man following with groans of pain and i turned up the lamp  dont you know me he gasped dropping into a chair and he turned his drawn face surmounted by a shock of gray hair to the light  i looked at him intently once before had i seen eyebrows that met over the nose in an inchbroad black band but for the life of me i could not tell where  i dont know you i said handing him the whisky what can i do for you  he took a gulp of the spirit raw and shivered in spite of the suffocating heat  ive come back he repeated and i was the king of kafiristanme and dravotcrowned kings we was in this office we settled ityou setting there and giving us the books i am peacheypeachey taliaferro carnehanand youve been setting here ever sinceo lord  i was more than a little astonished and expressed my feelings accordingly  its true said carnehan with a dry cackle nursing his feet which were wrapped in ragstrue as gospel kings we were with crowns upon our headsme and dravotpoor danoh poor poor dan that would never take advice not though i begged of him  take the whisky i said and take your own time tell me all you can recollect of everything from beginning to end you got across the border on your camels dravot dressed as a mad priest and you his servant do you remember that  i aint madyet but i shall be that way soon of course i remember keep looking at me or maybe my words will go all to pieces keep looking at me in my eyes and dont say anything  i leaned forward and looked into his face as steadily as i could he dropped one hand upon the table and i grasped it by the wrist it was twisted like a birds claw and upon the back was a ragged red diamondshaped scar  no dont look there look at me said carnehan that comes afterward but for the lords sake dont distrack me we left with that caravan me and dravot playing all sorts of antics to amuse the people we were with dravot used to make us laugh in the evenings when all the people was cooking their dinnerscooking their dinners and what did they do then they lit little fires with sparks that went into dravots beard and we all laughedfit to die little red fires they was going into dravots big red beardso funny his eyes left mine and he smiled foolishly  you went as far as jagdallak with that caravan i said at a venture after you had lit those fires to jagdallak where you turned off to try to get into kafiristan  no we didnt neither what are you talking about we turned off before jagdallak because we heard the roads was good but they wasnt good enough for our two camelsmine and dravots when we left the caravan dravot took off all his clothes and mine too and said we would be heathen because the kafirs didnt allow mohammedans to talk to them so we dressed betwixt and between and such a sight as daniel dravot i never saw yet nor expect to see again he burned half his beard and slung a sheepskin over his shoulder and shaved his head into patterns he shaved mine too and made me wear outrageous things to look like a heathen that was in a most mountaineous country and our camels couldnt go along any more because of the mountains they were tall and black and coming home i saw them fight like wild goatsthere are lots of goats in kafiristan and these mountains they never keep still no more than the goats always fighting they are and dont let you sleep at night  take some more whisky i said very slowly what did you and daniel dravot do when the camels could go no farther because of the rough roads that led into kafiristan  what did which do there was a party called peachey taliaferro carnehan that was with dravot shall i tell you about him he died out there in the cold slap from the bridge fell old peachey turning and twisting in the air like a penny whirligig that you can sell to the amir no they was two for three hapence those whirligigs or i am much mistaken and woeful sore and then these camels were no use and peachey said to dravot for the lords sake lets get out of this before our heads are chopped off and with that they killed the camels all among the mountains not having anything in particular to eat but first they took off the boxes with the guns and the ammunition till two men came along driving four mules dravot up and dances in front of them singing sell me four mules says the first man if you are rich enough to buy you are rich enough to rob but before ever he could put his hand to his knife dravot breaks his neck over his knee and the other party runs away so carnehan loaded the mules with the rifles that was taken off the camels and together we starts forward into those bittercold mountaineous parts and never a road broader than the back of your hand  he paused for a moment while i asked him if he could remember the nature of the country through which he had journeyed  i am telling you as straight as i can but my head isnt as good as it might be they drove nails through it to make me hear better how dravot died the country was mountaineous and the mules were most contrary and the inhabitants was dispersed and solitary they went up and up and down and down and that other party carnehan was imploring of dravot not to sing and whistle so loud for fear of bringing down the tremenjus avalanches but dravot says that if a king couldnt sing it wasnt worth being king and whacked the mules over the rump and never took no heed for ten cold days we came to a big level valley all among the mountains and the mules were near dead so we killed them not having anything in special for them or us to eat we sat upon the boxes and played odd and even with the cartridges that was jolted out  then ten men with bows and arrows ran down that valley chasing twenty men with bows and arrows and the row was tremenjus they was fair menfairer than you or mewith yellow hair and remarkable well built says dravot unpacking the guns this is the beginning of the business well fight for the ten men and with that he fires two rifles at the twenty men and drops one of them at two hundred yards from the rock where he was sitting the other men began to run but carnehan and dravot sits on the boxes picking them off at all ranges up and down the valley then we goes up to the ten men that had run across the snow too and they fires a footy little arrow at us dravot he shoots above their heads and they all falls down flat then he walks over them and kicks them and then he lifts them up and shakes hands all round to make them friendly like he calls them and gives them the boxes to carry and waves his hand for all the world as though he was king already they takes the boxes and him across the valley and up the hill into a pine wood on the top where there was half a dozen big stone idols dravot he goes to the biggesta fellow they call imbraand lays a rifle and a cartridge at his feet rubbing his nose respectfully with his own nose patting him on the head and nods his head and says thats all right im in the know too and these old jimjams are my friends then he opens his mouth and points down it and when the first man brings him food he says no and when the second man brings him food he says no but when one of the old priests and the boss of the village brings him food he says yes very haughty and eats it slow that was how we came to our first village without any trouble just as though we had tumbled from the skies but we tumbled from one of those damned ropebridges you see andyou couldnt expect a man to laugh much after that  take some more whisky and go on i said that was the first village you came into how did you get to be king  i wasnt king said carnehan dravot he was the king and a handsome man he looked with the gold crown on his head and all him and the other party stayed in that village and every morning dravot sat by the side of old imbra and the people came and worshipped that was dravots order then a lot of men came into the valley and carnehan dravot picks them off with the rifles before they knew where they was and runs down into the valley and up again the other side and finds another village same as the first one and the people all falls down flat on their faces and dravot says now what is the trouble between you two villages and the people points to a woman as fair as you or me that was carried off and dravot takes her back to the first village and counts up the deadeight there was for each dead man dravot pours a little milk on the ground and waves his arms like a whirligig and thats all right says he then he and carnehan takes the big boss of each village by the arm and walks them down the valley and shows them how to scratch a line with a spear right down the valley and gives each a sod of turf from both sides of the line then all the people comes down and shouts like the devil and all and dravot says go and dig the land and be fruitful and multiply which they did though they didnt understand then we asks the names of things in their lingobread and water and fire and idols and such and dravot leads the priest of each village up to the idol and says he must sit there and judge the people and if anything goes wrong he is to be shot  next week they was all turning up the land in the valley as quiet as bees and much prettier and the priests heard all the complaints and told dravot in dumbshow what it was about thats just the beginning says dravot they think were gods he and carnehan picks out twenty good men and shows them how to click off a rifle and form fours and advance in line and they was very pleased to do so and clever to see the hang of it then he takes out his pipe and his baccypouch and leaves one at one village and one at the other and off we two goes to see what was to be done in the next valley that was all rock and there was a little village there and carnehan says send em to the old valley to plant and takes em there and gives em some land that wasnt took before they were a poor lot and we blooded em with a kid before letting em into the new kingdom that was to impress the people and then they settled down quiet and carnehan went back to dravot who had got into another valley all snow and ice and most mountaineous there was no people there and the army got afraid so dravot shoots one of them and goes on till he finds some people in a village and the army explains that unless the people wants to be killed they had better not shoot their little matchlocks for they had matchlocks we makes friends with the priest and i stays there alone with two of the army teaching the men how to drill and a thundering big chief comes across the snow with kettledrums and horns twanging because he heard there was a new god kicking about carnehan sights for the brown of the men half a mile across the snow and wings one of them then he sends a message to the chief that unless he wished to be killed he must come and shake hands with me and leave his arms behind the chief comes alone first and carnehan shakes hands with him and whirls his arms about same as dravot used and very much surprised that chief was and strokes my eyebrows then carnehan goes alone to the chief and asks him in dumbshow if he had an enemy he hated i have says the chief so carnehan weeds out the pick of his men and sets the two of the army to show them drill and at the end of two weeks the men can manoeuvre about as well as volunteers so he marches with the chief to a great big plain on the top of a mountain and the chiefs men rushes into a village and takes it we three martinis firing into the brown of the enemy so we took that village too and i gives the chief a rag from my coat and says occupy till i come which was scriptural by way of a reminder when me and the army was eighteen hundred yards away i drops a bullet near him standing on the snow and all the people falls flat on their faces then i sends a letter to dravot wherever he be by land or by sea  at the risk of throwing the creature out of train i interrupted how could you write a letter up yonder  the letterohthe letter keep looking at me between the eyes please it was a stringtalk letter that wed learned the way of it from a blind beggar in the punjab  i remember that there had once come to the office a blind man with a knotted twig and a piece of string which he wound round the twig according to some cipher of his own he could after the lapse of days or hours repeat the sentence which he had reeled up he had reduced the alphabet to eleven primitive sounds and tried to teach me his method but i could not understand  i sent that letter to dravot said carnehan and told him to come back because this kingdom was growing too big for me to handle and then i struck for the first valley to see how the priests were working they called the village we took along with the chief bashkai and the first village we took erheb the priests at erheb was doing all right but they had a lot of pending cases about land to show me and some men from another village had been firing arrows at night i went out and looked for that village and fired four rounds at it from a thousand yards that used all the cartridges i cared to spend and i waited for dravot who had been away two or three months and i kept my people quiet  one morning i heard the devils own noise of drums and horns and dan dravot marches down the hill with his army and a tail of hundreds of men and which was the most amazing a great gold crown on his head my gord carnehan says daniel this is a tremenjus business and weve got the whole country as far as its worth having i am the son of alexander by queen semiramis and youre my younger brother and a god too its the biggest thing weve ever seen ive been marching and fighting for six weeks with the army and every footy little village for fifty miles has come in rejoiceful and more than that ive got the key of the whole show as youll see and ive got a crown for you i told em to make two of em at a place called shu where the gold lies in the rock like suet in mutton gold ive seen and turquoise ive kicked out of the cliffs and theres garnets in the sands of the river and heres a chunk of amber that a man brought me call up all the priests and here take your crown  one of the men opens a black hair bag and i slips the crown on it was too small and too heavy but i wore it for the glory hammered gold it wasfive pounds weight like a hoop of a barrel  peachey says dravot we dont want to fight no more the crafts the trick so help me and he brings forward that same chief that i left at bashkaibilly fish we called him afterward because he was so like billy fish that drove the big tankengine at mach on the bolan in the old days shake hands with him says dravot and i shook hands and nearly dropped for billy fish gave me the grip i said nothing but tried him with the fellowcraft grip he answers all right and i tried the masters grip but that was a slip a fellowcraft he is i says to dan does he know the word he does says dan and all the priests know its a miracle the chiefs and the priests can work a fellowcraft lodge in a way thats very like ours and theyve cut the marks on the rocks but they dont know the third degree and theyve come to find out its gords truth ive known these long years that the afghans knew up to the fellowcraft degree but this is a miracle a god and a grand master of the craft am i and a lodge in the third degree i will open and well raise the head priests and the chiefs of the villages  its against all the law i says holding a lodge without warrant from any one and you know we never held office in any lodge  its a master stroke o policy says dravot it means running the country as easy as a fourwheeled bogie on a down grade we cant stop to inquire now or theyll turn against us ive forty chiefs at my heel and passed and raised according to their merit they shall be billet these men on the villages and see that we run up a lodge of some kind the temple of imbra will do for a lodgeroom the women must make aprons as you show them ill hold a levee of chiefs tonight and lodge tomorrow  i was fair run off my legs but i wasnt such a fool as not to see what a pull this craft business gave us i showed the priests families how to make aprons of the degrees but for dravots apron the blue border and marks was made of turquoise lumps on white hide not cloth we took a great square stone in the temple for the masters chair and little stones for the officers chairs and painted the black pavement with white squares and did what we could to make things regular  at the levee which was held that night on the hillside with big bonfires dravot gives out that him and me were gods and sons of alexander and passed grand masters in the craft and was come to make kafiristan a country where every man should eat in peace and drink in quiet and specially obey us then the chiefs come round to shake hands and they were so hairy and white and fair it was just shaking hands with old friends we gave them names according as they was like men we had known in indiabilly fish holly dilworth pikky kergan that was bazaarmaster when i was at mhow and so on and so on  the most amazing miracles was at lodge next night one of the old priests was watching us continuous and i felt uneasy for i knew wed have to fudge the ritual and i didnt know what the men knew the old priest was a stranger come in from beyond the village of bashkai the minute dravot puts on the masters apron that the girls had made for him the priest fetches a whoop and a howl and tries to overturn the stone that dravot was sitting on its all up now i says that comes of meddling with the craft without warrant dravot never winked an eye not when ten priests took and tilted over the grand masters chairwhich was to say the stone of imbra the priest begins rubbing the bottom end of it to clear away the black dirt and presently he shows all the other priests the masters mark same as was on dravots apron cut into the stone not even the priests of the temple of imbra knew it was there the old chap falls flat on his face at dravots feet and kisses em luck again says dravot across the lodge to me they say its the missing mark that no one could understand the why of were more than safe now then he bangs the butt of his gun for a gavel and says by virtue of the authority vested in me by my own right hand and the help of peachey i declare myself grand master of all freemasonry in kafiristan in this the mother lodge o the country and king of kafiristan equally with peachey at that he puts on his crown and i puts on minei was doing senior wardenand we opens the lodge in most ample form it was an amazing miracle the priests moved in lodge through the first two degrees almost without telling as if the memory was coming back to them after that peachey and dravot raised such as was worthyhigh priests and chiefs of faroff villages billy fish was the first and i can tell you we scared the soul out of him it was not in any way according to ritual but it served our turn we didnt raise more than ten of the biggest men because we didnt want to make the degree common and they was clamouring to be raised  in another six months says dravot well hold another communication and see how you are working then he asks them about their villages and learns that they was fighting one against the other and were sick and tired of it and when they wasnt doing that they was fighting with the mohammedans you can fight those when they come into our country says dravot tell off every tenth man of your tribes for a frontier guard and send two hundred at a time to this valley to be drilled nobody is going to be shot or speared any more so long as he does well and i know that you wont cheat me because youre white peoplesons of alexanderand not like common black mohammedans you are my people and by god says he running off into english at the end ill make a damned fine nation of you or ill die in the making  i cant tell all we did for the next six months because dravot did a lot i couldnt see the hang of and he learned their lingo in a way i never could my work was to help the people plough and now and again go out with some of the army and see what the other villages were doing and make em throw rope bridges across the ravines which cut up the country horrid dravot was very kind to me but when he walked up and down in the pine wood pulling that bloody red beard of his with both fists i knew he was thinking plans i could not advise about and i just waited for orders  but dravot never showed me disrespect before the people they were afraid of me and the army but they loved dan he was the best of friends with the priests and the chiefs but any one could come across the hills with a complaint and dravot would hear him out fair and call four priests together and say what was to be done he used to call in billy fish from bashkai and pikky kergan from shu and an old chief we called kafuzelumit was like enough to his real nameand hold councils with em when there was any fighting to be done in small villages that was his council of war and the four priests of bashkai shu khawak and madora was his privy council between the lot of em they sent me with forty men and twenty rifles and sixty men carrying turquoises into the ghorband country to buy those handmade martini rifles that come out of the amirs workshops at kabul from one of the amirs herati regiments that would have sold the very teeth out of their mouths for turquoises  i stayed in ghorband a month and gave the governor there the pick of my baskets for hushmoney and bribed the colonel of the regiment some more and between the two and the tribespeople we got more than a hundred handmade martinis a hundred good kohat jezails thatll throw to six hundred yards and forty manloads of very bad ammunition for the rifles i came back with what i had and distributed em among the men that the chiefs sent in to me to drill dravot was too busy to attend to those things but the old army that we first made helped me and we turned out five hundred men that could drill and two hundred that knew how to hold arms pretty straight even those corkscrewed handmade guns was a miracle to them dravot talked big about powdershops and factories walking up and down in the pine wood when the winter was coming on  i wont make a nation says he ill make an empire these men arent niggers theyre english look at their eyeslook at their mouths look at the way they stand up they sit on chairs in their own houses theyre the lost tribes or something like it and theyve grown to be english ill take a census in the spring if the priests dont get frightened there must be a fair two million of em in these hills the villages are full o little children two million peopletwo hundred and fifty thousand fighting

wearing nowto queen victoria on my knees and shed say rise up sir daniel dravot oh its big its big i tell you but theres so much to be done in every placebashkai khawak shu and everywhere else  what is it i says there are no more men coming in to be drilled this autumn look at those fat black clouds theyre bringing the snow  it isnt that says daniel putting his hand very hard on my shoulder and i dont wish to say anything thats against you for no other living man would have followed me and made me what i am as you have done youre a firstclass commanderinchief and the people know you butits a big country and somehow you cant help me peachey in the way i want to be helped  go to your blasted priests then i said and i was sorry when i made that remark but it did hurt me sore to find daniel talking so superior when id drilled all the men and done all he told me  dont lets quarrel peachey says daniel without cursing youre a king too and the half of this kingdom is yours but cant you see peachey we want cleverer men than us nowthree or four of em that we can scatter about for our deputies its a hugeous great state and i cant always tell the right thing to do and i havent time for all i want to do and heres the winter coming on and all he put half his beard into his mouth all red like the gold of his crown  im sorry daniel says i ive done all i could ive drilled the men and shown the people how to stack their oats better and ive brought in those tinware rifles from ghorbandbut i know what youre driving at i take it kings always feel oppressed that way  theres another thing too says dravot walking up and down the winters coming and these people wont be giving much trouble and if they do we cant move about i want a wife  for gords sake leave the women alone i says weve both got all the work we can though i am a fool remember the contrack and keep clear o women  the contrack only lasted till such time as we was kings and kings we have been these months past says dravot weighing his crown in his hand you go get a wife too peacheya nice strappin plump girl thatll keep you warm in the winter theyre prettier than english girls and we can take the pick of em boil em once or twice in hot water and theyll come out like chicken and ham  dont tempt me i says i will not have any dealings with a woman not till we are a dam side more settled than we are now ive been doing the work o two men and youve been doing the work of three lets lie off a bit and see if we can get some better tobacco from afghan country and run in some good liquor and no women  whos talking o women says dravot i said wifea queen to breed a kings son for the king a queen out of the strongest tribe thatll make them your bloodbrothers and thatll lie by your side and tell you all the people thinks about you and their own affairs thats what i want  do you remember that bengali woman i kept at mogul serai when i was a platelayer says i a fat lot o good she was to me she taught me the lingo and one or two other things but what happened she ran away with the stationmasters servant and half my months pay then she turned up at dadur junction in tow of a halfcaste and had the impidence to say i was her husbandall among the drivers in the runningshed too  weve done with that says dravot these women are whiter than you or me and a queen i will have for the winter months  for the last time o asking dan do not i says itll only bring us harm the bible says that kings aint to waste their strength on women specially when theyve got a new raw kingdom to work over  for the last time of answering i will said dravot and he went away through the pinetrees looking like a big red devil the sun being on his crown and beard and all  but getting a wife was not as easy as dan thought he put it before the council and there was no answer till billy fish said that hed better ask the girls dravot damned them all round whats wrong with me he shouts standing by the idol imbra am i a dog or am i not enough of a man for your wenches havent i put the shadow of my hand over this country who stopped the last afghan raid it was me really but dravot was too angry to remember who bought your guns who repaired the bridges whos the grand master of the sign cut in the stone says he and he thumped his hand on the block that he used to sit on in lodge and at council which opened like lodge always billy fish said nothing and no more did the others keep your hair on dan said i and ask the girls thats how its done at home and these people are quite english  the marriage of the king is a matter of state says dan in a whitehot rage for he could feel i hope that he was going against his better mind he walked out of the councilroom and the others sat still looking at the ground  billy fish says i to the chief of bashkai whats the difficulty here a straight answer to a true friend  you know says billy fish how should a man tell you who knows everything how can daughters of men marry gods or devils its not proper  i remembered something like that in the bible but if after seeing us as long as they had they still believed we were gods it wasnt for me to undeceive them  a god can do anything says i if the king is fond of a girl hell not let her die shell have to said billy fish there are all sorts of gods and devils in these mountains and now and again a girl marries one of them and isnt seen any more besides you two know the mark cut in the stone only the gods know that we thought you were men till you showed the sign of the master  i wished then that we had explained about the loss of the genuine secrets of a master mason at the first gooff but i said nothing all that night there was a blowing of horns in a little dark temple halfway down the hill and i heard the girl crying fit to die one of the priests told us that she was being prepared to marry the king  ill have no nonsense of that kind says dan i dont want to interfere with your customs but ill take my own wife the girls a little bit afraid says the priest she thinks shes going to die and they are aheartening of her up down in the temple  hearten her very tender then says dravot or ill hearten you with the butt of a gun so youll never want to be heartened again he licked his lips did dan and stayed up walking about more than half the night thinking of the wife that he was going to get in the morning i wasnt any means comfortable for i knew that dealings with a woman in foreign parts though you was a crowned king twenty times over could not but be risky i got up very early in the morning while dravot was asleep and i saw the priests talking together in whispers and the chiefs talking together too and they looked at me out of the corners of their eyes  what is up fish i say to the bashkai man who was wrapped up in his furs and looking splendid to behold  i cant rightly say says he but if you can make the king drop all this nonsense about marriage youll be doing him and me and yourself a great service  that i do believe says i but sure you know billy as well as me having fought against and for us that the king and me are nothing more than two of the finest men that god almighty ever made nothing more i do assure you  that may be says billy fish and yet i should be sorry if it was he sinks his head upon his great fur cloak for a minute and thinks king says he be you man or god or devil ill stick by you today i have twenty of my men with me and they will follow me well go to bashkai until the storm blows over  a little snow had fallen in the night and everything was white except the greasy fat clouds that blew down and down from the north dravot came out with his crown on his head swinging his arms and stamping his feet and looking more pleased than punch  for the last time drop it dan says i in a whisper billy fish here says that there will be a row  a row among my people says dravot not much peachey youre a fool not to get a wife too wheres the girl says he with a voice as loud as the braying of a jackass call up all the chiefs and priests and let the emperor see if his wife suits him  there was no need to call any one they were all there leaning on their guns and spears round the clearing in the centre of the pine wood a lot of priests went down to the little temple to bring up the girl and the horns blew fit to wake the dead billy fish saunters round and gets as close to daniel as he could and behind him stood his twenty men with matchlocksnot a man of them under six feet i was next to dravot and behind me was twenty men of the regular army up comes the girl and a strapping wench she was covered with silver and turquoises but white as death and looking back every minute at the priests  shell do said dan looking her over whats to be afraid of lass come and kiss me he puts his arm round her she shuts her eyes gives a bit of a squeak and down goes her face in the side of dans flamingred beard  the sluts bitten me says he clapping his hand to his neck and sure enough his hand was red with blood billy fish and two of his matchlock men catches hold of dan by the shoulders and drags him into the bashkai lot while the priests howls in their lingo neither god nor devil but a man i was all taken aback for a priest cut at me in front and the army behind began firing into the bashkai men  god amighty says dan what is the meaning o this  come back come away says billy fish ruin and mutiny is the matter well break for bashkai if we can  i tried to give some sort of orders to my menthe men o the regular armybut it was no use so i fired into the brown of em with an english martini and drilled three beggars in a line the valley was full of shouting howling creatures and every soul was shrieking not a god nor a devil but only a man the bashkai troops stuck to billy fish all they were worth but their matchlocks wasnt half as good as the kabul breechloaders and four of them dropped dan was bellowing like a bull for he was very wrathy and billy fish had a hard job to prevent him running out at the crowd  we cant stand says billy fish make a run for it down the valley the whole place is against us the matchlockmen ran and we went down the valley in spite of dravot he was swearing horrible and crying out that he was a king the priests rolled great stones on us and the regular army fired hard and there wasnt more than six men not counting dan billy fish and me that came down to the bottom of the valley alive  then they stopped firing and the horns in the temple blew again come awayfor gords sake come away says billy fish theyll send runners out to all the villages before ever we get to bashkai i can protect you there but i cant do anything now  my own notion is that dan began to go mad in his head from that hour he stared up and down like a stuck pig then he was all for walking back alone and killing the priests with his bare hands which he could have done an emperor am i says daniel and next year i shall be a knight of the queen  all right dan says i but come along now while theres time  its your fault says he for not looking after your army better there was mutiny in the midst and you didnt knowyou damned enginedriving platelaying missionaryspasshunting hound he sat upon a rock and called me every foul name he could lay tongue to i was too heartsick to care though it was all his foolishness that brought the smash  im sorry dan says i but theres no accounting for natives this business is our fiftyseven maybe well make something out of it yet when weve got to bashkai  lets get to bashkai then says dan and by god when i come back here again ill sweep the valley so there isnt a bug in a blanket left  we walked all that day and all that night dan was stumping up and down on the snow chewing his beard and muttering to himself  theres no hope o getting clear said billy fish the priests have sent runners to the villages to say that you are only men why didnt you stick on as gods till things was more settled im a dead man says billy fish and he throws himself down on the snow and begins to pray to his gods  next morning we was in a cruel bad countryall up and down no level ground at all and no food either the six bashkai men looked at billy fish hungryway as if they wanted to ask something but they never said a word at noon we came to the top of a flat mountain all covered with snow and when we climbed up into it behold there was an army in position waiting in the middle  the runners have been very quick says billy fish with a little bit of a laugh they are waiting for us  three or four men began to fire from the enemys side and a chance shot took daniel in the calf of the leg that brought him to his senses he looks across the snow at the army and sees the rifles that we had brought into the country  were done for says he they are englishmen these peopleand its my blasted nonsense that has brought you to this get back billy fish and take your men away youve done what you could and now cut for it carnehan says he shake hands with me and go along with billy maybe they wont kill you ill go and meet em alone its me that did it me the king  go says i go to hell dan im with you here billy fish you clear out and we two will meet those folk  im a chief says billy fish quite quiet i stay with you my men can go  the bashkai fellows didnt wait for a second word but ran off and dan and me and billy fish walked across to where the drums were drumming and the horns were horning it was coldawful cold ive got that cold in the back of my head now theres a lump of it there  the punkacoolies had gone to sleep two kerosene lamps were blazing in the office and the perspiration poured down my face and splashed on the blotter as i leaned forward carnehan was shivering and i feared that his mind might go i wiped my face took a fresh grip of the piteously mangled hands and said what happened after that  the momentary shift of my eyes had broken the clear current  what was you pleased to say whined carnehan they took them without any sound not a little whisper all along the snow not though the king knocked down the first man that set hand on himnot though old peachey fired his last cartridge into the brown of em not a single solitary sound did those swines make they just closed up tight and i tell you their furs stunk there was a man called billy fish a good friend of us all and they cut his throat sir then and there like a pig and the king kicks up the bloody snow and says weve had a dashed fine run for our money whats coming next but peachey peachey taliaferro i tell you sir in confidence as betwixt two friends he lost his head sir no he didnt neither the king lost his head so he did all along o one of those cunning rope bridges kindly let me have the papercutter sir it tilted this way they marched him a mile across that snow to a rope bridge over a ravine with a river at the bottom you may have seen such they prodded him behind like an ox damn your eyes says the king d you suppose i cant die like a gentleman he turns to peacheypeachey that was crying like a child ive brought you to this peachey says he brought you out of your happy life to be killed in kafiristan where you was late commanderinchief of the emperors forces say you forgive me peachey i do says peachey fully and freely do i forgive you dan shake hands peachey says he im going now out he goes looking neither right nor left and when he was plumb in the middle of those dizzy dancing ropes cut you beggars he shouts and they cut and old dan fell turning round and round and round twenty thousand miles for he took half an hour to fall till he struck the water and i could see his body caught on a rock with the gold crown close beside  but do you know what they did to peachey between two pinetrees they crucified him sir as peacheys hand will show they used wooden pegs for his hands and feet but he didnt die he hung there and screamed and they took him down next day and said it was a miracle that he wasnt dead they took him downpoor old peachey that hadnt done them any harmthat hadnt done them any  he rocked to and fro and wept bitterly wiping his eyes with the back of his scarred hands and moaning like a child for some ten minutes  they was cruel enough to feed him up in the temple because they said he was more of a god than old daniel that was a man then they turned him out on the snow and told him to go home and peachey came home in about a year begging along the roads quite safe for daniel dravot he walked before and said come along peachey its a big thing were doing the mountains they danced at night and the mountains they tried to fall on peacheys head but dan he held up his hand and peachey came along bent double he never let go of dans hand and he never let go of dans head they gave it to him as a present in the temple to remind him not to come again and though the crown was pure gold and peachey was starving never would peachey sell the same you know dravot sir you knew right worshipful brother dravot look at him now  he fumbled in the mass of rags round his bent waist brought out a black horsehair bag embroidered with silver thread and shook therefrom on to my tablethe dried withered head of daniel dravot the morning sun that had long been paling the lamps struck the red beard and blind sunken eyes struck too a heavy circlet of gold studded with raw turquoises that carnehan placed tenderly on the battered temples  you beold now said carnehan the emperor in his abit as he livedthe king of kafiristan with his crown upon his head poor old daniel that was a monarch once  i shuddered for in spite of defacements manifold i recognised the head of the man of marwar junction carnehan rose to go i attempted to stop him he was not fit to walk abroad let me take away the whisky and give me a little money he gasped i was a king once ill go to the deputy commissioner and ask to set in the poorhouse till i get my health no thank you i cant wait till you get a carriage for me ive urgent private affairsin the southat marwar  he shambled out of the office and departed in the direction of the deputy commissioners house that day at noon i had occasion to go down the blindinghot mall and i saw a crooked man crawling along the white dust of the roadside his hat in his hand quavering dolorously after the fashion of streetsingers at home there was not a soul in sight and he was out of all possible earshot of the houses and he sang through his nose turning his head from right to left    the son of man goes forth to war         a golden crown to gain    his bloodred banner streams afar         who follows in his train  i waited to hear no more but put the poor wretch into my carriage and drove him off to the nearest missionary for eventual transfer to the asylum he repeated the hymn twice while he was with me whom he did not in the least recognise and i left him singing it to the missionary  two days later i inquired after his welfare of the superintendent of the asylum  he was admitted suffering from sunstroke he died early yesterday morning said the superintendent is it true that he was half an hour bareheaded in the sun at midday  yes said i but do you happen to know if he had anything upon him by any chance when he died  not to my knowledge said the superintendent  and there the matter rests     the finest story in the world    o ever the knightly years were gone     with the old world to the grave   i was a king in babylon     and you were a christian slave   w e henley  his name was charlie mears he was the only son of his mother who was a widow and he lived in the north of london coming into the city every day to work in a bank he was twenty years old and suffered from aspirations i met him in a public billiardsaloon where the marker called him by his given name and he called the marker bullseyes charley explained a little nervously that he had only come to the place to look on and since looking on at games of skill is not a cheap amusement for the young i suggested that charlie should go back to his mother  that was our first step toward better acquaintance he would call on me sometimes in the evenings instead of running about london with his fellowclerks and before long speaking of himself as a young man must he told me of his aspirations which were all literary he desired to make himself an undying name chiefly through verse though he was not above sending stories of love and death to the dropapennyintheslot journals it was my fate to sit still while charlie read me poems of many hundred lines and bulky fragments of plays that would surely shake the world my reward was his unreserved confidence and the selfrevelations and troubles of a young man are almost as holy as those of a maiden charlie had never fallen in love but was anxious to do so on the first opportunity he believed in all things good and all things honorable but at the same time was curiously careful to let me see that he knew his way about the world as befitted a bank clerk on twentyfive shillings a week he rhymed dove with love and moon with june and devoutly believed that they had never so been rhymed before the long lame gaps in his plays he filled up with hasty words of apology and description and swept on seeing all that he intended to do so clearly that he esteemed it already done and turned to me for applause  i fancy that his mother did not encourage his aspirations and i know that his writingtable at home was the edge of his washstand this he told me almost at the outset of our acquaintance when he was ravaging my bookshelves and a little before i was implored to speak the truth as to his chances of writing something really great you know maybe i encouraged him too much for one night he called on me his eyes flaming with excitement and said breathlessly  do you mindcan you let me stay here and write all this evening i wont interrupt you i wont really theres no place for me to write in at my mothers  whats the trouble i said knowing well what that trouble was  ive a notion in my head that would make the most splendid story that was ever written do let me write it out here its such a notion  there was no resisting the appeal i set him a table he hardly thanked me but plunged into the work at once for half an hour the pen scratched without stopping then charlie sighed and tugged his hair the scratching grew slower there were more erasures and at last ceased the finest story in the world would not come forth  it looks such awful rot now he said mournfully and yet it seemed so good when i was thinking about it whats wrong  i could not dishearten him by saying the truth so i answered perhaps you dont feel in the mood for writing  yes i doexcept when i look at this stuff ugh  read me what youve done i said he read and it was wondrous bad and he paused at all the specially turgid sentences expecting a little approval for he was proud of those sentences as i knew he would be  it needs compression i suggested cautiously  i hate cutting my things down i dont think you could alter a word here without spoiling the sense it reads better aloud than when i was writing it  charlie youre suffering from an alarming disease afflicting a numerous class put the thing by and tackle it again in a week  i want to do it at once what do you think of it  how can i judge from a halfwritten tale tell me the story as it lies in your head  charlie told and in the telling there was everything that his ignorance had so carefully prevented from escaping into the written word i looked at him and wondering whether it were possible that he did not know the originality the power of the notion that had come in his way it was distinctly a notion among notions men had been puffed up with pride by notions not a tithe as excellent and practicable but charlie babbled on serenely interrupting the current of pure fancy with samples of horrible sentences that he purposed to use i heard him out to the end it would be folly to allow his idea to remain in his own inept hands when i could do so much with it not all that could be done indeed but oh so much  what do you think he said at last i fancy i shall call it the story of a ship  i think the ideas pretty good but you wont be able to handle it for ever so long now i  would it be of any use to you would you care to take it i should be proud said charlie promptly  there are few things sweeter in this world than the guileless hotheaded intemperate open admiration of a junior even a woman in her blindest devotion does not fall into the gait of the man she adores tilt her bonnet to the angle at which he wears his hat or interlard her speech with his pet oaths and charlie did all these things still it was necessary to salve my conscience before i possessed myself of charlies thoughts  lets make a bargain ill give you a fiver for the notion i said charlie became a bankclerk at once  oh thats impossible between two pals you know if i may call you so and speaking as a man of the world i couldnt take the notion if its any use to you ive heaps more  he hadnone knew this better than ibut they were the notions of other men  look at it as a matter of businessbetween men of the world i returned five pounds will buy you any number of poetrybooks business is business and you may be sure i shouldnt give that price unless  oh if you put it that way said charlie visibly moved by the thought of the books the bargain was clinched with an agreement that he should at unstated intervals come to me with all the notions that he possessed should have a table of his own to write at and unquestioned right to inflict upon me all his poems and fragments of poems then i said now tell me how you came by this idea  it came by itself charlies eyes opened a little  yes but you told me a great deal about the hero that you must have read before somewhere  i havent any time for reading except when you let me sit here and on sundays im on my bicycle or down the river all day theres nothing wrong about the hero is there  tell me again and i shall understand clearly you say that your hero went pirating how did he live  he was on the lower deck of this shipthing that i was telling you about  what sort of ship  it was the kind rowed with oars and the sea spurts through the oarholes and the men row sitting up to their knees in water then theres a bench running down between the two lines of oars and an overseer with a whip walks up and down the bench to make the men work  how do you know that  its in the tale theres a rope running overhead looped to the upper deck for the overseer to catch hold of when the ship rolls when the overseer misses the rope once and falls among the rowers remember the hero laughs at him and gets licked for it hes chained to his oar of coursethe hero  how is he chained  with an iron band round his waist fixed to the bench he sits on and a sort of handcuff on his left wrist chaining him to the oar hes on the lower deck where the worst men are sent and the only light comes from the hatchways and through the oarholes cant you imagine the sunlight just squeezing through between the handle and the hole and wobbling about as the ship moves  i can but i cant imagine your imagining it  how could it be any other way now you listen to me the long oars on the upper deck are managed by four men to each bench the lower ones by three and the lowest of all by two remember its quite dark on the lowest deck and all the men there go mad when a man dies at his oar on that deck he isnt thrown overboard but cut up in his chains and stuffed through the oarhole in little pieces  why i demanded amazed not so much at the information as the tone of command in which it was flung out  to save trouble and to frighten the others it needs two overseers to drag a mans body up to the top deck and if the men at the lower deck oars were left alone of course theyd stop rowing and try to pull up the benches by all standing up together in their chains  youve a most provident imagination where have you been reading about galleys and galleyslaves  nowhere that i remember i row a little when i get the chance but perhaps if you say so i may have read something  he went away shortly afterward to deal with booksellers and i wondered how a bank clerk aged twenty could put into my hands with a profligate abundance of detail all given with absolute assurance the story of extravagant and bloodthirsty adventure riot piracy and death in unnamed seas he had led his hero a desperate dance through revolt against the overseas to command of a ship of his own and ultimate establishment of a kingdom on an island somewhere in the sea you know and delighted with my paltry five pounds had gone out to buy the notions of other men that these might teach him how to write i had the consolation of knowing that this notion was mine by right of purchase and i thought that i could make something of it  when next he came to me he was drunkroyally drunk on many poets for the first time revealed to him his pupils were dilated his words tumbled over each other and he wrapped himself in quotations most of all was he drunk with longfellow  isnt it splendid isnt it superb he cried after hasty greetings listen to this    wouldst thou so the helmsman answered     know the secret of the sea   only those who brave its dangers     comprehend its mystery  by gum    only those who brave its dangers     comprehend its mystery  he repeated twenty times walking up and down the room and forgetting me but i can understand it too he said to himself i dont know how to thank you for that fiver and this listen    i remember the black wharves and the ships     and the seatides tossing free   and the spanish sailors with bearded lips   and the beauty and mystery of the ships     and the magic of the sea  i havent braved any dangers but i feel as if i knew all about it  you certainly seem to have a grip of the sea have you ever seen it  when i was a little chap i went to brighton once we used to live in coventry though before we came to london i never saw it    when descends on the atlantic     the gigantic   stormwind of the equinox  he shook me by the shoulder to make me understand the passion that was shaking himself  when that storm comes he continued i think that all the oars in the ship that i was talking about get broken and the rowers have their chests smashed in by the bucking oarheads by the way have you done anything with that notion of mine yet  no i was waiting to hear more of it from you tell me how in the world you re so certain about the fittings of the ship you know nothing of ships  i dont know its as real as anything to me until i try to write it down i was thinking about it only last night in bed after you had loaned me treasure island and i made up a a whole lot of new things to go into the story  what sort of things  about the food the men ate rotten figs and black beans and wine in a skin bag passed from bench to bench  was the ship built so long ago as that  as what i dont know whether it was long ago or not its only a notion but sometimes it seems just as real as if it was true do i bother you with talking about it  not in the least did you make up anything else  yes but its nonsense charlie flushed a little  never mind lets hear about it  well i was thinking over the story and after awhile i got out of bed and wrote down on a piece of paper the sort of stuff the men might be supposed to scratch on their oars with the edges of their handcuffs it seemed to make the thing more lifelike it is so real to me yknow  have you the paper on you  yees but whats the use of showing it its only a lot of scratches all the same we might have em reproduced in the book on the front page  ill attend to those details show me what your men wrote  he pulled out of his pocket a sheet of notepaper with a single line of scratches upon it and i put this carefully away  what is it supposed to mean in english i said  oh i dont know perhaps it means im beastly tired its great nonsence he repeated but all those men in the ship seem as real people to me do do something to the notion soon i should like to see it written and printed  but all youve told me would make a long book  make it then youve only to sit down and write it out  give me a little time have you any more notions  not just now im reading all the books ive bought theyre splendid  when he had left i looked at the sheet of notepaper with the inscription upon it then i took my head tenderly between both hands to make certain that it was not coming off or turning round then but there seemed to be no interval between quitting my rooms and finding myself arguing with a policeman outside a door marked private in a corridor of the british museum all i demanded as politely as possible was the greek antiquity man the policeman knew nothing except the rules of the museum and it became necessary to forage through all the houses and offices inside the gates an elderly gentleman called away from his lunch put an end to my search by holding the notepaper between finger and thumb and sniffing at it scornfully  what does this mean hmm said he so far as i can ascertain it is an attempt to write extremely corrupt greek on the parthere he glared at me with intentionof an extremely illiterateahperson he read slowly from the paper pollock erckman tauchnitz hennikerfour names familiar to me  can you tell me what the corruption is supposed to meanthe gist of the thing i asked  i have beenmany timesovercome with weariness in this particular employment that is the meaning he returned me the paper and i fled without a word of thanks explanation or apology  i might have been excused for forgetting much to me of all men had been given the chance to write the most marvelous tale in the world nothing less than the story of a greek galleyslave as told by himself small wonder that his dreaming had seemed real to charlie the fates that are so careful to shut the doors of each successive life behind us had in this case been neglectful and charlie was looking though that he did not know where never man had been permitted to look with full knowledge since time began above all he was absolutely ignorant of the knowledge sold to me for five pounds and he would retain that ignorance for bankclerks do not understand metempsychosis and a sound commercial education does not include greek he would supply mehere i capered among the dumb gods of egypt and laughed in their battered faceswith material to make my tale sureso sure that the world would hail it as an impudent and vamped fiction and ii alone would know that it was absolutely and literally true ii alone held this jewel to my hand for the cutting and polishing therefore i danced again among the gods till a policeman saw me and took steps in my direction  it remained now only to encourage charlie to talk and here there was no difficulty but i had forgotten those accursed books of poetry he came to me time after time as useless as a surcharged phonographdrunk on byron shelley or keats knowing now what the boy had been in his past lives and desperately anxious not to lose one word of his babble i could not hide from him my respect and interest he misconstrued both into respect for the present soul of charlie mears to whom life was as new as it was to adam and interest in his readings and stretched my patience to breaking point by reciting poetrynot his own now but that of others i wished every english poet blotted out of the memory of mankind i blasphemed the mightiest names of song because they had drawn charlie from the path of direct narrative and would later spur him to imitate them but i choked down my impatience until the first flood of enthusiasm should have spent itself and the boy returned to his dreams  whats the use of my telling you what i think when these chaps wrote things for the angels to read he growled one evening why dont you write something like theirs  i dont think youre treating me quite fairly i said speaking under strong restraint  ive given you the story he said shortly replunging into lara  but i want the details  the things i make up about that damned ship that you call a galley theyre quite easy you can just make em up yourself turn up the gas a little i want to go on reading  i could have broken the gas globe over his head for his amazing stupidity i could indeed make up things for myself did i only know what charlie did not know that he knew but since the doors were shut behind me i could only wait his youthful pleasure and strive to keep him in good temper one minutes want of guard might spoil a priceless revelation now and again he would toss his books asidehe kept them in my rooms for his mother would have been shocked at the waste of good money had she seen themand launched into his sea dreams again i cursed all the poets of england the plastic mind of the bankclerk had been overlaid colored and distorted by that which he had read and the result as delivered was a confused tangle of other voices most like the muttered song through a city telephone in the busiest part of the day  he talked of the galleyhis own galley had he but known itwith illustrations borrowed from the bride of abydos he pointed the experiences of his hero with quotations from the corsair and threw in deep and desperate moral reflections from cain and manfred expecting me to use them all only when the talk turned on longfellow were the jarring crosscurrents dumb and i knew that charlie was speaking the truth as he remembered it  what do you think of this i said one evening as soon as i understood the medium in which his memory worked best and before he could expostulate read him the whole of the saga of king olaf  he listened openmouthed flushed his hands drumming on the back of the sofa where he lay till i came to the songs of emar tamberskelver and the verse    emar then the arrow taking     from the loosened string   answered that was norway breaking     neath thy hand o king  he gasped with pure delight of sound  thats better than byron a little i ventured  better why its true how could he have known  i went back and repeated    what was that said olaf standing     on the quarterdeck   something heard i like the stranding     of a shattered wreck  how could he have known how the ships crash and the oars rip out and go zzzp all along the line why only the other night but go back please and read the skerry of shrieks again  no im tired lets talk what happened the other night  i had an awful nightmare about that galley of ours i dreamed i was drowned in a fight you see we ran alongside another ship in harbor the water was dead still except where our oars whipped it up you know where i always sit in the galley he spoke haltingly at first under a fine english fear of being laughed at  no thats news to me i answered meekly my heart beginning to beat  on the fourth oar from the bow on the right side on the upper deck there were four of us at the oar all chained i remember watching the water and trying to get my handcuffs off before the row began then we closed up on the other ship and all their fighting men jumped over our bulwarks and my bench broke and i was pinned down with the three other fellows on top of me and the big oar jammed across our backs  well charlies eyes were alive and alight he was looking at the wall behind my chair  i dont know how we fought the men were trampling all over my back and i lay low then our rowers on the left sidetied to their oars you knowbegan to yell and back water i could hear the water sizzle and we spun round like a cockchafer and i knew lying where i was that there was a galley coming up bowon to ram us on the left side i could just lift up my head and see her sail over the bulwarks we wanted to meet her bow to bow but it was too late we could only turn a little bit because the galley on our right had hooked herself on to us and stopped our moving then by gum there was a crash our left oars began to break as the other galley the moving one yknow stuck her nose into them then the lowerdeck oars shot up through the deckplanking but first and one of them jumped clean up into the air and came down again close to my head  how was that managed  the moving galleys bow was plunking them back through their own oarholes and i could hear the devil of a shindy in the decks below then her nose caught us nearly in the middle and we tilted sideways and the fellows in the righthand galley unhitched their hooks and ropes and threw things on to our upper deckarrows and hot pitch or something that stung and we went up and up and up on the left side and the right side dipped and i twisted my head round and saw the water stand still as it topped the right bulwarks and then it curled over and crashed down on the whole lot of us on the right side and i felt it hit my back and i woke  one minute charlie when the sea topped the bulwarks what did it look like i had my reasons for asking a man of my acquaintance had once gone down with a leaking ship in a still sea and had seen the waterlevel pause for an instant ere it fell on the deck  it looked just like a banjostring drawn tight and it seemed to stay there for years said charlie  exactly the other man had said  it looked like a silver wire laid down along the bulwarks and i thought it was never going to break he had paid everything except the bare life for this little valueless piece of knowledge and i had traveled ten thousand weary miles to meet him and take his knowledge at second hand but charlie the bankclerk on twentyfive shillings a week he who had never been out of sight of a london omnibus knew it all it was no consolation to me that once in his lives he had been forced to die for his gains i also must have died scores of times but behind me because i could have used my knowledge the doors were shut  and then i said trying to put away the devil of envy  the funny thing was though in all the mess i didnt feel a bit astonished or frightened it seemed as if id been in a good many fights because i told my next man so when the row began but that cad of an overseer on my deck wouldnt unloose our chains and give us a chance he always said that wed all be set free after a battle but we never were we never were charlie shook his head mournfully  what a scoundrel  i should say he was he never gave us enough to eat and sometimes we were so thirsty that we used to drink saltwater i can taste that saltwater still  now tell me something about the harbor where the fight was fought  i didnt dream about that i know it was a harbor though because we were tied up to a ring on a white wall and all the face of the stone under water was covered with wood to prevent our ram getting chipped when the tide made us rock  thats curious our hero commanded the galley didnt he  didnt he just he stood by the bows and shouted like a good un he was the man who killed the overseer  but you were all drowned together charlie werent you  i cant make that fit quite he said with a puzzled look the galley must have gone down with all hands and yet i fancy that the hero went on living afterward perhaps he climbed into the attacking ship i wouldnt see that of course i was dead you know  he shivered slightly and protested that he could remember no more  i did not press him further but to satisfy myself that he lay in ignorance of the workings of his own mind deliberately introduced him to mortimer collinss transmigration and gave him a sketch of the plot before he opened the pages  what rot it all is he said frankly at the end of an hour i dont understand his nonsense about the red planet mars and the king and the rest of it chuck me the longfellow again  i handed him the book and wrote out as much as i could remember of his description of the seafight appealing to him from time to time for confirmation of fact or detail he would answer without raising his eyes from the book as assuredly as though all his knowledge lay before flint on the printed page i spoke under the normal key of my voice that the current might not be broken and i know that he was not aware of what he was saying for his thoughts were out on the sea with longfellow  charlie i asked when the rowers on the galleys mutinied how did they kill their overseers  tore up the benches and brained em that happened when a heavy sea was running an overseer on the lower deck slipped from the centre plank and fell among the rowers they choked him to death against the side of the ship with their chained hands quite quietly and it was too dark for the other overseer to see what had happened when he asked he was pulled down too and choked and the lower deck fought their way up deck by deck with the pieces of the broken benches banging behind em how they howled  and what happened after that  i dont know the hero went awayred hair and red beard and all that was after he had captured our galley i think  the sound of my voice irritated him and he motioned slightly with his left hand as a man does when interruption jars  you never told me he was redheaded before or that he captured your galley i said after a discreet interval  charlie did not raise his eyes  he was as red as a red bear said he abstractedly he came from the north they said so in the galley when he looked for rowersnot slaves but free men afterwardyears and years afterwardnews came from another ship or else he came back his lips moved in silence he was rapturously retasting some poem before him  where had he been then i was almost whispering that the sentence might come gentle to whichever section of charlies brain was working on my behalf  to the beachesthe long and wonderful beaches was the reply after a minute of silence  to furdurstrandi i asked tingling from head to foot  yes to furdurstrandi he pronounced the word in a new fashion and i too saw the voice failed  do you know what you have said i shouted incautiously  he lifted his eyes fully roused now no he snapped i wish youd let a chap go on reading hark to this    but othere the old sea captain   he neither paused nor stirred     till the king listened and then     once more took up his pen   and wrote down every word    and to the king of the saxons   in witness of the truth     raising his noble head     he stretched his brown hand and said   behold this walrus tooth  by jove what chaps those must have been to go sailing all over the shop never knowing where theyd fetch the land hah  charlie i pleaded if youll only be sensible for a minute or two ill make our hero in our tale every inch as good as othere  umph longfellow wrote that poem i dont care about writing things any more i want to read he was thoroughly out of tune now and raging over my own illluck i left him  conceive yourself at the door of the worlds treasurehouse guarded by a childan idle irresponsible child playing knuckleboneson whose favor depends the gift of the key and you will imagine onehalf my torment till that evening charlie had spoken nothing that might not lie within the experiences of a greek galleyslave but now or there was no virtue in books he had talked of some desperate adventure of the vikings of thorfin karlsefnes sailing to wineland which is america in the ninth or tenth century the battle in the harbor he had seen and his own death he had described but this was a much more startling plunge into the past was it possible that he had skipped half a dozen lives and was then dimly remembering some episode of a thousand years later it was a maddening jumble and the worst of it was that charlie mears in his normal condition was the last person in the world to clear it up i could only wait and watch but i went to bed that night full of the wildest imaginings there was nothing that was not possible if charlies detestable memory only held good  i might rewrite the saga of thorfin karlsefne as it had never been written before might tell the story of the first discovery of america myself the discoverer but i was entirely at charlies mercy and so long as there was a threeandsixpenny bohn volume within his reach charlie would not tell i dared not curse him openly i hardly dared jog his memory for i was dealing with the experiences of a thousand years ago told through the mouth of a boy of today and a boy of today is affected by every change of tone and gust of opinion so that he lies even when he desires to speak the truth  i saw no more of him for nearly a week when next i met him it was in gracechurch street with a billbook chained to his waist business took him over london bridge and i accompanied him he was very full of the importance of that book and magnified it as we passed over the thames we paused to look at a steamer unloading great slabs of white and brown marble a barge drifted under the steamers stern and a lonely cow in that barge bellowed charlies face changed from the face of the bankclerk to that of an unknown andthough he would not have believed thisa much shrewder man he flung out his arm across the parapet of the bridge and laughing very loudly said  when they heard our bulls bellow the skroelings ran away  i waited only for an instant but the barge and the cow had disappeared under the bows of the steamer before i answered  charlie what do you suppose are skroelings  never heard of em before they sound like a new kind of seagull what a chap you are for asking questions he replied i have to go to the cashier of the omnibus company yonder will you wait for me and we can lunch somewhere together ive a notion for a poem  no thanks im off youre sure you know nothing about skroelings  not unless hes been entered for the liverpool handicap he nodded and disappeared in the crowd  now it is written in the saga of eric the red or that of thorfin karlsefne that nine hundred years ago when karlsefnes galleys came to leifs booths which leif had erected in the unknown land called markland which may or may not have been rhode island the skroelingsand the lord he knows who these may or may not have beencame to trade with the vikings and ran away because they were frightened at the bellowing of the cattle which thorfin had brought with him in the ships but what in the world could a greek slave know of that affair i wandered up and down among the streets trying to unravel the mystery and the more i considered it the more baffling it grew one thing only seemed certain and that certainty took away my breath for the moment if i came to full knowledge of anything at all it would not be one life of the soul in charlie mearss body but half a dozenhalf a dozen several and separate existences spent on blue water in the morning of the world  then i walked round the situation  obviously if i used my knowledge i should stand alone and unapproachable until all men were as wise as myself that would be something but manlike i was ungrateful it seemed bitterly unfair that charlies memory should fail me when i needed it most great powers abovei looked up at them through the fog smokedid the lords of life and death know what this meant to me nothing less than eternal fame of the best kind that comes from one and is shared by one alone i would be contentremembering clive i stood astounded at my own moderationwith the mere right to tell one story to work out one little contribution to the light literature of the day if charlie were permitted full recollection for one hourfor sixty short minutesof existences that had extended over a thousand yearsi would forego all profit and honor from all that i should make of his speech i would take no share in the commotion that would follow throughout the particular corner of the earth that calls itself the world the thing should be put forth anonymously nay i would make other men believe that they had written it they would hire bullhided selfadvertising englishmen to bellow it abroad preachers would found a fresh conduct of life upon it swearing that it was new and that they had lifted the fear of death from all mankind every orientalist in europe would patronize it discursively with sanskrit and pali texts terrible women would invent unclean variants of the mens belief for the elevation of their sisters churches and religions would war over it between the hailing and restarting of an omnibus i foresaw the scuffles that would arise among half a dozen denominations all professing the doctrine of the true metempsychosis as applied to the world and the new era and saw too the respectable english newspapers shying like frightened kine over the beautiful simplicity of the tale the mind leaped forward a hundredtwo hundreda thousand years i saw with sorrow that men would mutilate and garble the story that rival creeds would turn it upside down till at last the western world which clings to the dread of death more closely than the hope of life would set it aside as an interesting superstition and stampede after some faith so long forgotten that it seemed altogether new upon this i changed the terms of the bargain that i would make with the lords of life and death only let me know let me write the story with sure knowledge that i wrote the truth and i would burn the manuscript as a solemn sacrifice five minutes after the last line was written i would destroy it all but i must be allowed to write it with absolute certainty  there was no answer the flaming colors of an aquarium poster caught my eye and i wondered whether it would be wise or prudent to lure charlie into the hands of the professional mesmerist and whether if he were under his power he would speak of his past lives if he did and if people believed him but charlie would be frightened and flustered or made conceited by the interviews in either case he would begin to lie through fear or vanity he was safest in my own hands  they are very funny fools your english said a voice at my elbow and turning round i recognized a casual acquaintance a young bengali law student called grish chunder whose father had sent him to england to become civilized the old man was a retired native official and on an income of five pounds a month contrived to allow his son two hundred pounds a year and the run of his teeth in a city where he could pretend to be the cadet of a royal house and tell stories of the brutal indian bureaucrats who ground the faces of the poor  grish chunder was a young fat fullbodied bengali dressed with scrupulous care in frock coat tall hat light trousers and tan gloves but i had known him in the days when the brutal indian government paid for his university education and he contributed cheap sedition to sachi durpan and intrigued with the wives of his schoolmates  that is very funny and very foolish he said nodding at the poster i am going down to the northbrook club will you come too  i walked with him for some time you are not well he said what is there in your mind you do not talk  grish chunder youve been too well educated to believe in a god havent you  oah yes here but when i go home i must conciliate popular superstition and make ceremonies of purification and my women will anoint idols  and bang up tulsi and feast the purohit and take you back into caste again and make a good khuttrj of you again you advanced social freethinker and youll eat desi food and like it all from the smell in the courtyard to the mustard oil over you  i shall very much like it said grish chunder unguardedly once a hindualways a hindu but i like to know what the english think they know  ill tell you something that one englishman knows its an old tale to you  i began to tell the story of charlie in english but grish chunder put a question in the vernacular and the history went forward naturally in the tongue best suited for its telling after all it could never have been told in english grish chunder heard me nodding from time to time and then came up to my rooms where i finished the tale  beshak he said philosophically lekin darwaza band hai without doubt but the door is shut i have heard of this remembering of previous existences among my people it is of course an old tale with us but to happen to an englishmana cowfed malechkan outcast by jove that is most peculiar  outcast yourself grish chunder you eat cowbeef every day lets think the thing over the boy remembers his incarnations  does he know that said grish chunder quietly swinging his legs as he sat on my table he was speaking in english now  he does not know anything would i speak to you if he did go on  there is no going on at all if you tell that to your friends they will say you are mad and put it in the papers suppose now you prosecute for libel  lets leave that out of the question entirely is there any chance of his being made to speak  there is a chance oah yes but if he spoke it would mean that all this world would end nowinstantofall down on your head these things are not allowed you know as i said the door is shut  not a ghost of a chance  how can there be you are a christián and it is forbidden to eat in your books of the tree of life or else you would never die how shall you all fear death if you all know what your friend does not know that he knows i am afraid to be kicked but i am not afraid to die because i know what i know you are not afraid to be kicked but you are afraid to die if you were not by god you english would be all over the shop in an hour upsetting the balances of power and making commotions it would not be good but no fear he will remember a little and a little less and he will call it dreams then he will forget altogether when i passed my first arts examination in calcutta that was all in the crambook on wordsworth trailing clouds of glory you know  this seems to be an exception to the rule  there are no exceptions to rules some are not so hardlooking as others but they are all the same when you touch if this friend of yours said soandso and soandso indicating that he remembered all his lost lives or one piece of a lost life he would not be in the bank another hour he would be what you called sack because he was mad and they would send him to an asylum for lunatics you can see that my friend  of course i can but i wasnt thinking of him his name need never appear in the story  ah i see that story will never be written you can try  i am going to  for your own credit and for the sake of money of course  no for the sake of writing the story on my honor that will be all  even then there is no chance you cannot play with the gods it is a very pretty story now as they say let it go on thati mean at that be quick he will not last long  how do you mean  what i say he has never so far thought about a woman  hasnt he though i remembered some of charlies confidences  i mean no woman has thought about him when that comes bushogyaall up i know there are millions of women here housemaids for instance  i winced at the thought of my story being ruined by a housemaid and yet nothing was more probable  grish chunder grinned  yesalso pretty girlscousins of his house and perhaps not of his house one kiss that he gives back again and remembers will cure all this nonsense or else  or else what remember he does not know that he knows  i know that or else if nothing happens he will become immersed in the trade and the financial speculations like the rest it must be so you can see that it must be so but the woman will come first i think  there was a rap at the door and charlie charged in impetuously he had been released from office and by the look in his eyes i could see that he had come over for a long talk most probably with poems in his pockets charlies poems were very wearying but sometimes they led him to talk about the galley  grish chunder looked at him keenly for a minute  i beg your pardon charlie said uneasily i didnt know you had any one with you  i am going said grish chunder  he drew me into the lobby as he departed  that is your man he said quickly i tell you he will never speak all you wish that is rotbosh but he would be most good to make to see things suppose now we pretend that it was only playi had never seen grish chunder so excitedand pour the inkpool into his hand eh what do you think i tell you that he could see anything that a man could see let me get the ink and the camphor he is a seer and he will tell us very many things  he may be all you say but im not going to trust him to your gods and devils  it will not hurt him he will only feel a little stupid and dull when he wakes up you have seen boys look into the inkpool before  that is the reason why i am not going to see it any more youd better go grish chunder  he went declaring far down the staircase that it was throwing away my only chance of looking into the future  this left me unmoved for i was concerned for the past and no peering of hypnotized boys into mirrors and inkpools would help me do that but i recognized grish chunders point of view and sympathized with it  what a big black brute that was said charlie when i returned to him well look here ive just done a poem did it instead of playing dominoes after lunch may i read it  let me read it to myself  then you miss the proper expression besides you always make my things sound as if the rhymes were all wrong  read it aloud then youre like the rest of em  charlie mouthed me his poem and it was not much worse than the average of his verses he had been reading his book faithfully but he was not pleased when i told him that i preferred my longfellow undiluted with charlie  then we began to go through the ms line by line charlie parrying every objection and correction with  yes that may be better but you dont catch what im driving at  charlie was in one way at least very like one kind of poet  there was a pencil scrawl at the back of the paper and whats that i said  oh thats not poetry t all its some rot i wrote last night before i went to bed and it was too much bother to hunt for rhymes so i made it a sort of a blank verse instead  here is charlies blank verse    we pulled for you when the wind was against us and the sails   were low    will you never let us go    we ate bread and onions when you took towns or ran aboard   quickly when you were beaten back by the foe    the captains walked up and down the deck in fair weather singing   songs but we were below    we fainted with our chins on the oars and you did not see that we   were idle for we still swung to and fro    will you never let us go    the salt made the oar handles like sharkskin our knees were cut to   the bone with salt cracks our hair was stuck to our foreheads and   our lips were cut to our gums and you whipped us because we   could not row    will you never let us go    but in a little time we shall run out of the portholes as the water   runs along the oarblade and though you tell the others to row after   us you will never catch us till you catch the oarthresh and tie up   the winds in the belly of the sail aho    will you never let us go  hm whats oarthresh charlie  the water washed up by the oars thats the sort of song they might sing in the galley yknow arent you ever going to finish that story and give me some of the profits  it depends on yourself if you had only told me more about your hero in the first instance it might have been finished by now youre so hazy in your notions  i only want to give you the general notion of itthe knocking about from place to place and the fighting and all that cant you fill in the rest yourself make the hero save a girl on a pirategalley and marry her or do something  youre a really helpful collaborator i suppose the hero went through some few adventures before he married  well then make him a very artful carda low sort of mana sort of political man who went about making treaties and breaking thema blackhaired chap who hid behind the mast when the fighting began  but you said the other day that he was redhaired  i couldnt have make him blackhaired of course youve no imagination  seeing that i had just discovered the entire principles upon which the halfmemory falsely called imagination is based i felt entitled to laugh but forbore for the sake of the tale  youre right youre the man with imagination a blackhaired chap in a decked ship i said  no an open shiplike a big boat  this was maddening  your ship has been built and designed closed and decked in you said so yourself i protested  no no not that ship that was open or half decked because by jove youre right you made me think of the hero as a redhaired chap of course if he were red the ship would be an open one with painted sails  surely i thought he would remember now that he had served in two galleys at leastin a threedecked greek one under the blackhaired political man and again in a vikings open seaserpent under the man red as a red bear who went to markland the devil prompted me to speak  why of course charlie said i  i dont know are you making fun of me  the current was broken for the time being i took up a notebook and pretended to make many entries in it  its a pleasure to work with an imaginative chap like yourself i said after a pause the way that youve brought out the character of the hero is simply wonderful  do you think so he answered with a pleased flush i often tell myself that theres more in me than my mothan people think  theres an enormous amount in you  then wont you let me send an essay on the ways of bank clerks to titbits and get the guinea prize  that wasnt exactly what i meant old fellow perhaps it would be better to wait a little and go ahead with the galleystory  ah but i shant get the credit of that titbits would publish my name and address if i win what are you grinning at they would  i know it suppose you go for a walk i want to look through my notes about our story  now this reprehensible youth who left me a little hurt and put back might for aught he or i knew have been one of the crew of the argohad been certainly slave or comrade to thorfin karlsefne therefore he was deeply interested in guinea competitions remembering what grish chunder had said i laughed aloud the lords of life and death would never allow charlie mears to speak with full knowledge of his pasts and i must even piece out what he had told me with my own poor inventions while charlie wrote of the ways of bankclerks  i got together and placed on one file all my notes and the net result was not cheering i read them a second time there was nothing that might not have been compiled at secondhand from other peoples booksexcept perhaps the story of the fight in the harbor the adventures of a viking had been written many times before the history of a greek galleyslave was no new thing and though i wrote both who could challenge or confirm the accuracy of my details i might as well tell a tale of two thousand years hence the lords of life and death were as cunning as grish chunder had hinted they would allow nothing to escape that might trouble or make easy the minds of men though i was convinced of this yet i could not leave the tale alone exaltation followed reaction not once but twenty times in the next few weeks my moods varied with the march sunlight and flying clouds by night or in the beauty of a spring morning i perceived that i could write that tale and shift continents thereby in the wet windy afternoons i saw that the tale might indeed be written but would be nothing more than a faked falsevarnished shamrusted piece of wardour street work at the end then i blessed charlie in many waysthough it was no fault of his he seemed to be busy with prize competitions and i saw less and less of him as the weeks went by and the earth cracked and grew ripe to spring and the buds swelled in their sheaths he did not care to read or talk of what he had read and there was a new ring of selfassertion in his voice i hardly cared to remind him of the galley when we met but charlie alluded to it on every occasion always as a story from which money was to be made  i think i deserve twentyfive per cent dont i at least he said with beautiful frankness i supplied all the ideas didnt i  this greediness for silver was a new side in his nature i assumed that it had been developed in the city where charlie was picking up the curious nasal drawl of the underbred city man  when the things done well talk about it i cant make anything of it at present redhaired or blackhaired hero are equally difficult  he was sitting by the fire staring at the red coals i cant understand what you find so difficult its all as clean as mud to me he replied a jet of gas puffed out between the bars took light and whistled softly suppose we take the redhaired heros adventures first from the time that he came south to my galley and captured it and sailed to the beaches  i knew better now than to interrupt charlie i was out of reach of pen and paper and dared not move to get them lest i should break the current the gasjet puffed and whinnied charlies voice dropped almost to a whisper and he told a tale of the sailing of an open galley to furdurstrandi of sunsets on the open sea seen under the curve of the one sail evening after evening when the galleys beak was notched into the centre of the sinking disc and we sailed by that for we had no other guide quoth charlie he spoke of a landing on an island and explorations in its woods where the crew killed three men whom they found asleep under the pines their ghosts charlie said followed the galley swimming and choking in the water and the crew cast lots and threw one of their number overboard as a sacrifice to the strange gods whom they had offended then they ate seaweed when their provisions failed and their legs swelled and their leader the redhaired man killed two rowers who mutinied and after a year spent among the woods they set sail for their own country and a wind that never failed carried them back so safely that they all slept at night this and much more charlie told sometimes the voice fell so low that i could not catch the words though every nerve was on the strain he spoke of their leader the redhaired man as a pagan speaks of his god for it was he who cheered them and slew them impartially as he thought best for their needs and it was he who steered them for three days among floating ice each floe crowded with strange beasts that tried to sail with us said charlie and we beat them back with the handles of the oars  the gasjet went out a burned coal gave way and the fire settled down with a tiny crash to the bottom of the grate charlie ceased speaking and i said no word  by jove he said at last shaking his head ive been staring at the fire till im dizzy what was i going to say  something about the galley  i remember now its 25 per cent of the profits isnt it  its anything you like when ive done the tale  i wanted to be sure of that i must go now ive ive an appointment and he left me  had my eyes not been held i might have know that that broken muttering over the fire was the swansong of charlie mears but i thought it the prelude to fuller revelation at last and at last i should cheat the lords of life and death  when next charlie came to me i received him with rapture he was nervous and embarrassed but his eyes were very full of light and his lips a little parted  ive done a poem he said and then quickly its the best ive ever done read it he thrust it into my hand and retreated to the window  i groaned inwardly it would be the work of half an hour to criticisethat is to say praisethe poem sufficiently to please charlie then i had good reason to groan for charlie discarding his favorite centipede metres had launched into shorter and choppier verse and verse with a motive at the back of it this is what i read    the day is most fair the cheery wind     halloos behind the hill   where he bends the wood as seemeth good     and the sapling to his will   riot o wind there is that in my blood     that would not have thee still    she gave me herself o earth o sky     grey sea she is mine alone   let the sullen boulders hear my cry     and rejoice tho they be but stone    mine i have won her o good brown earth     make merry tis hard on spring   make merry my love is doubly worth     all worship your fields can bring   let the bind that tills you feel my mirth     at the early harrowing  yes its the early harrowing past a doubt i said with a dread at my heart charlie smiled but did not answer    red cloud of the sunset tell it abroad     i am victor greet me o sun   dominant master and absolute lord     over the soul of one  well said charlie looking over my shoulder  i thought it far from well and very evil indeed when he silently laid a photograph on the paperthe photograph of a girl with a curly head and a foolish slack mouth  isnt itisnt it wonderful he whispered pink to the tips of his ears wrapped in the rosy mystery of first love i didnt know i didnt thinkit came like a thunderclap  yes it comes like a thunderclap are you very happy charlie  my godsheshe loves me he sat down repeating the last words to himself i looked at the hairless face the narrow shoulders already bowed by deskwork and wondered when where and how he had loved in his past lives  what will your mother say i asked cheerfully  i dont care a damn what she says  at twenty the things for which one does not care a damn should properly be many but one must not include mothers in the list i told him this gently and he described her even as adam must have described to the newly named beasts the glory and tenderness and beauty of eve incidentally i learned that she was a tobacconists assistant with a weakness for pretty dress and had told him four or five times already that she had never been kissed by a man before  charlie spoke on and on and on while i separated from him by thousands of years was considering the beginnings of things now i understood why the lords of life and death shut the doors so carefully behind us it is that we may not remember our first wooings were it not so our world would be without inhabitants in a hundred years  now about that galleystory i said still more cheerfully in a pause in the rush of the speech  charlie looked up as though he had been hit the galleywhat galley good heavens dont joke man this is serious you dont know how serious it is  grish chunder was right charlie had tasted the love of woman that kills remembrance and the finest story in the world would never be written
