1928      illustration   made in u s a     by way of introduction  robert lewis balfour stevenson or robert louis stevenson as the world knows him was still a boy when he published this rare volume of a childs garden of verses although by the calendar he was thirtyfive years old you and i have sighed no doubt to be a boy again but here was one who while he outgrew his knickerbockers never outgrew the quick sympathy the brave heart the fresh outlook the confident faith and buoyant spirit of the little scotch boy who roamed the hills round edinburgh better than any man of any time he was able to enter into the heart of a boy to view things with a boys eyes and to write of them in simple verse touched with the warmth and color of his rich imagination in these verses he writes as a child rather than about children and in this lies much of the charm which they possess for little readers there is in them the surprise of reality the beauty of a simple rhythm and the mysterious flavor of magic that grips a boys heart and will not let him go until the book has become a part of him surely this is a rare quality in schoolbooks  the stevensons had been famous engineers for more than a hundred years building lighthouses along the scottish coast and it was natural that his father should have expected robert louis to follow in the family footsteps but the slim boy with brown eyes who at eight had written a history of moses and illustrated it with his own pen who was slow to learn from books but quick to understand things that he saw and felt the boy who carried a volume of history in one pocket and a notebook in another had other plans for himself and even his father came to see the wisdom of his sons choice of a literary life as early as 1873 when only twentythree years old stevenson was ordered south for the winter by his physician to ward off impending consumption for more than twenty years or until his death in samoa late in 1894 he was never far from this pursuing enemy it followed him over tossing seas and through many lands as he journeyed in search of health yet through all these years he carried a brave and happy heart and wrote at the end this requiem the last three lines of which are upon his tomb on the mountaintop in samoa      under the wide and starry sky     dig the grave and let me lie     glad did i live and gladly die       and i laid me down with a will     this be the verse you grave for me     here he lies where he longed to be     home is the sailor home from sea       and the hunter home from the hill  robert louis stevensons first book an inland voyage was published in 1878 when he was twentyeight years old and is a fresh and charming account of a canoe trip up the rivers of holland it was during this journey that he wrote if we were charged so much a head for sunsets or if god sent around a drum before the hawthorn came into flower what a work we should make about their beauty but these things like good companions stupid people early cease to observe  the next year came his travels with a donkey which told in the same na√Øve style the story of his journey through the cevennes mountains with no other companion than a donkey whose gait he describes as being as much slower than a walk as a walk is slower than a run  he first visited america in 1879 in search of health returning in 1880 to scotland with mrs stevenson whom he had married in california in 1887 he came again with the hope that a dry winter in the adirondack mountains would stand off the hand of death but he was little benefited and took up his search for health by chartering a yacht for a voyage through the south seas it was on this trip that he fell in love with the beauty of the scenery and the healthful climate of samoa and in 1890 he took up his home there never again to leave the island except for occasional visits to honolulu and sydney and when the time came for him to die the natives with their knives and axes cut a path up the steep mountainside and carried him on their broad shoulders to his grave on the mountaintop  a childs garden of verses was first published in london in 1885 and long ago became a childrens classic yet it is now for the first time made available as a supplementary reader for the primary grades in a suitable form and at a possible price there have been many and beautiful editions but they have all appealed to grownups rather than to boys and girls to whom the book really belongs to put such a book with its simple style its wise observations its kindly sympathy and fanciful humor into the hands of a boy or girl is not only to make him happy it is to start him on the straight path to culture  this volume contains all the poems originally appearing under the title a childs garden of verses the poems grouped under the child alone garden days and envoys have been omitted as many of them are too philosophical to be understood by children in the primary grades  the illustrations in this book are used by special arrangement with harper  brothers of new york city who publish the complete verses in a beautiful edition suitable for the home or the library  so with stevensons own words the book is
