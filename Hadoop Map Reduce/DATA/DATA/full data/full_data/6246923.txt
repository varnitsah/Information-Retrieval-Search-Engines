6246923	the bostonians                                 a novel                              by henry james                              in two volumes                                 vol i    macmillan and co limited st martins street london 1921  first published in 1886     book first     i   olive will come down in about ten minutes she told me to tell you that about ten that is exactly like olive neither five nor fifteen and yet not ten exactly but either nine or eleven she didnt tell me to say she was glad to see you because she doesnt know whether she is or not and she wouldnt for the world expose herself to telling a fib she is very honest is olive chancellor she is full of rectitude nobody tells fibs in boston i dont know what to make of them all well i am very glad to see you at any rate  these words were spoken with much volubility by a fair plump smiling woman who entered a narrow drawingroom in which a visitor kept waiting for a few moments was already absorbed in a book the gentleman had not even needed to sit down to become interested apparently he had taken up the volume from a table as soon as he came in and standing there after a single glance round the apartment had lost himself in its pages he threw it down at the approach of mrs luna laughed shook hands with her and said in answer to her last remark you imply that you do tell fibs perhaps that is one  oh no there is nothing wonderful in my being glad to see you mrs luna rejoined when i tell you that i have been three long weeks in this unprevaricating city  that has an unflattering sound for me said the young man i pretend not to prevaricate  dear me whats the good of being a southerner the lady asked olive told me to tell you she hoped you will stay to dinner and if she said it she does really hope it she is willing to risk that  just as i am the visitor inquired presenting himself with rather a workaday aspect  mrs luna glanced at him from head to foot and gave a little smiling sigh as if he had been a long sum in addition and indeed he was very long basil ransom and he even looked a little hard and discouraging like a column of figures in spite of the friendly face which he bent upon his hostesss deputy and which in its thinness had a deep dry line a sort of premature wrinkle on either side of the mouth he was tall and lean and dressed throughout in black his shirtcollar was low and wide and the triangle of linen a little crumpled exhibited by the opening of his waistcoat was adorned by a pin containing a small red stone in spite of this decoration the young man looked pooras poor as a young man could look who had such a fine head and such magnificent eyes those of basil ransom were dark deep and glowing his head had a character of elevation which fairly added to his stature it was a head to be seen above the level of a crowd on some judicial bench or political platform or even on a bronze medal his forehead was high and broad and his thick black hair perfectly straight and glossy and without any division rolled back from it in a leonine manner these things the eyes especially with their smouldering fire might have indicated that he was to be a great american statesman or on the other hand they might simply have proved that he came from carolina or alabama he came in fact from mississippi and he spoke very perceptibly with the accent of that country it is not in my power to reproduce by any combination of characters this charming dialect but the initiated reader will have no difficulty in evoking the sound which is to be associated in the present instance with nothing vulgar or vain this lean pale sallow shabby striking young man with his superior head his sedentary shoulders his expression of bright grimness and hard enthusiasm his provincial distinguished appearance is as a representative of his sex the most important personage in my narrative he played a very active part in the events i have undertaken in some degree to set forth and yet the reader who likes a complete image who desires to read with the senses as well as with the reason is entreated not to forget that he prolonged his consonants and swallowed his vowels that he was guilty of elisions and interpolations which were equally unexpected and that his discourse was pervaded by something sultry and vast something almost african in its rich basking tone something that suggested the teeming expanse of the cottonfield mrs luna looked up at all this but saw only a part of it otherwise she would not have replied in a bantering manner in answer to his inquiry are you ever different from this mrs luna was familiarintolerably familiar  basil ransom coloured a little then he said oh yes when i dine out i usually carry a sixshooter and a bowieknife and he took up his hat vaguelya soft black hat with a low crown and an immense straight brim mrs luna wanted to know what he was doing she made him sit down she assured him that her sister quite expected him would feel as sorry as she could ever feel for anythingfor she was a kind of fatalist anyhowif he didnt stay to dinner it was an immense pityshe herself was going out in boston you must jump at invitations olive too was going somewhere after dinner but he mustnt mind that perhaps he would like to go with her it wasnt a partyolive didnt go to parties it was one of those weird meetings she was so fond of  what kind of meetings do you refer to you speak as if it were a rendezvous of witches on the brocken  well so it is they are all witches and wizards mediums and spiritrappers and roaring radicals  basil ransom stared the yellow light in his brown eyes deepened do you mean to say your sisters a roaring radical  a radical shes a female jacobinshes a nihilist whatever is is wrong and all that sort of thing if you are going to dine with her you had better know it  oh murder murmured the young man vaguely sinking back in his chair with his arms folded he looked at mrs luna with intelligent incredulity she was sufficiently pretty her hair was in clusters of curls like bunches of grapes her tight bodice seemed to crack with her vivacity and from beneath the stiff little plaits of her petticoat a small fat foot protruded resting upon a stilted heel she was attractive and impertinent especially the latter he seemed to think it was a great pity what she had told him but he lost himself in this consideration or at any rate said nothing for some time while his eyes wandered over mrs luna and he probably wondered what body of doctrine she represented little as she might partake of the nature of her sister many things were strange to basil ransom boston especially was strewn with surprises and he was a man who liked to understand mrs luna was drawing on her gloves ransom had never seen any that were so long they reminded him of stockings and he wondered how she managed without garters above the elbow well i suppose i might have known that he continued at last  you might have known what  well that miss chancellor would be all that you say she was brought up in the city of reform  oh it isnt the city its just olive chancellor she would reform the solar system if she could get hold of it shell reform you if you dont look out thats the way i found her when i returned from europe  have you been in europe ransom asked  mercy yes havent you  no i havent been anywhere has your sister  yes but she stayed only an hour or two she hates it she would like to abolish it didnt you know i had been to europe mrs luna went on in the slightly aggrieved tone of a woman who discovers the limits of her reputation  ransom reflected he might answer her that until five minutes ago he didnt know she existed but he remembered that this was not the way in which a southern gentleman spoke to ladies and he contented himself with saying that he must condone his boeotian ignorance he was fond of an elegant phrase that he lived in a part of the country where they didnt think much about europe and that he had always supposed she was domiciled in new york this last remark he made at a venture for he had naturally not devoted any supposition whatever to mrs luna his dishonesty however only exposed him the more  if you thought i lived in new york why in the world didnt you come and see me the lady inquired  well you see i dont go out much except to the courts  do you mean the lawcourts every one has got some profession over here are you very ambitious you look as if you were  yes very basil ransom replied with a smile and the curious feminine softness with which southern gentlemen enunciate that adverb  mrs luna explained that she had been living in europe for several yearsever since her husband diedbut had come home a month before come home with her little boy the only thing she had in the world and was paying a visit to her sister who of course was the nearest thing after the child but it isnt the same she said olive and i disagree so much  while you and your little boy dont the young man remarked  oh no i never differ from newton and mrs luna added that now she was back she didnt know what she should do that was the worst of coming back it was like being born again at ones ageone had to begin life afresh one didnt even know what one had come back for there were people who wanted one to spend the winter in boston but she couldnt stand thatshe knew at least what she had not come back for perhaps she should take a house in washington did he ever hear of that little place they had invented it while she was away besides olive didnt want her in boston and didnt go through the form of saying so that was one comfort with olive she never went through any forms  basil ransom had got up just as mrs luna made this last declaration for a young lady had glided into the room who stopped short as it fell upon her ears she stood there looking consciously and rather seriously at mr ransom a smile of exceeding faintness played about her lipsit was just perceptible enough to light up the native gravity of her face it might have been likened to a thin ray of moonlight resting upon the wall of a prison  if that were true she said i shouldnt tell you that i am very sorry to have kept you waiting  her voice was low and agreeablea cultivated voiceand she extended a slender white hand to her visitor who remarked with some solemnity he felt a certain guilt of participation in mrs lunas indiscretion that he was intensely happy to make her acquaintance he observed that miss chancellors hand was at once cold and limp she merely placed it in his without exerting the smallest pressure mrs luna explained to her sister that her freedom of speech was caused by his being a relationthough indeed he didnt seem to know much about them she didnt believe he had ever heard of her mrs luna though he pretended with his southern chivalry that he had she must be off to her dinner now she saw the carriage was there and in her absence olive might give any version of her she chose  i have told him you are a radical and you may tell him if you like that i am a painted jezebel try to reform him a person from mississippi is sure to be all wrong i shall be back very late we are going to a theatreparty thats why we dine so early goodbye mr ransom mrs luna continued gathering up the feathery white shawl which added to the volume of her fairness i hope you are going to stay a little so that you may judge us for yourself i should like you to see newton too he is a noble little nature and i want some advice about him you only stay tomorrow why whats the use of that well mind you come and see me in new york i shall be sure to be part of the winter there i shall send you a card i wont let you off dont come out my sister has the first claim olive why dont you take him to your female convention mrs lunas familiarity extended even to her sister she remarked to miss chancellor that she looked as if she were got up for a seavoyage i am glad i havent opinions that prevent my dressing in the evening she declared from the doorway the amount of thought they give to their clothing the people who are afraid of looking frivolous     ii   whether much or little consideration had been directed to the result miss chancellor certainly would not have incurred this reproach she was habited in a plain dark dress without any ornaments and her smooth colourless hair was confined as carefully as that of her sister was encouraged to stray she had instantly seated herself and while mrs luna talked she kept her eyes on the ground glancing even less toward basil ransom than toward that woman of many words the young man was therefore free to look at her a contemplation which showed him that she was agitated and trying to conceal it he wondered why she was agitated not foreseeing that he was destined to discover later that her nature was like a skiff in a stormy sea even after her sister had passed out of the room she sat there with her eyes turned away as if there had been a spell upon her which forbade her to raise them miss olive chancellor it may be confided to the reader to whom in the course of our history i shall be under the necessity of imparting much occult information was subject to fits of tragic shyness during which she was unable to meet even her own eyes in the mirror one of these fits had suddenly seized her now without any obvious cause though indeed mrs luna had made it worse by becoming instantly so personal there was nothing in the world so personal as mrs luna her sister could have hated her for it if she had not forbidden herself this emotion as directed to individuals basil ransom was a young man of firstrate intelligence but conscious of the narrow range as yet of his experience he was on his guard against generalisations which might be hasty but he had arrived at two or three that were of value to a gentleman lately admitted to the new york bar and looking out for clients one of them was to the effect that the simplest division it is possible to make of the human race is into the people who take things hard and the people who take them easy he perceived very quickly that miss chancellor belonged to the former class this was written so intensely in her delicate face that he felt an unformulated pity for her before they had exchanged twenty words he himself by nature took things easy if he had put on the screw of late it was after reflexion and because circumstances pressed him close but this pale girl with her lightgreen eyes her pointed features and nervous manner was visibly morbid it was as plain as day that she was morbid poor ransom announced this fact to himself as if he had made a great discovery but in reality he had never been so boeotian as at that moment it proved nothing of any importance with regard to miss chancellor to say that she was morbid any sufficient account of her would lie very much to the rear of that why was she morbid and why was her morbidness typical ransom might have exulted if he had gone back far enough to explain that mystery the women he had hitherto known had been mainly of his own soft clime and it was not often they exhibited the tendency he detected and cursorily deplored in mrs lunas sister that was the way he liked themnot to think too much not to feel any responsibility for the government of the world such as he was sure miss chancellor felt if they would only be private and passive and have no feeling but for that and leave publicity to the sex of tougher hide ransom was pleased with the vision of that remedy it must be repeated that he was very provincial  these considerations were not present to him as definitely as i have written them here they were summed up in the vague compassion which his cousins figure excited in his mind and which was yet accompanied with a sensible reluctance to know her better obvious as it was that with such a face as that she must be remarkable he was sorry for her but he saw in a flash that no one could help her that was what made her tragic he had not seeking his fortune come away from the blighted south which weighed upon his heart to look out for tragedies at least he didnt want them outside of his office in pine street he broke the silence ensuing upon mrs lunas departure by one of the courteous speeches to which blighted regions may still encourage a tendency and presently found himself talking comfortably enough with his hostess though he had said to himself that no one could help her the effect of his tone was to dispel her shyness it was her great advantage for the career she had proposed to herself that in certain conditions she was liable suddenly to become bold she was reassured at finding that her visitor was peculiar the way he spoke told her that it was no wonder he had fought on the southern side she had never yet encountered a personage so exotic and she always felt more at her ease in the presence of anything strange it was the usual things of life that filled her with silent rage which was natural enough inasmuch as to her vision almost everything that was usual was iniquitous she had no difficulty in asking him now whether he would not stay to dinnershe hoped adeline had given him her message it had been when she was upstairs with adeline as his card was brought up a sudden and very abnormal inspiration to offer him this for her really ultimate favour nothing could be further from her common habit than to entertain alone at any repast a gentleman she had never seen  it was the same sort of impulse that had moved her to write to basil ransom in the spring after hearing accidentally that he had come to the north and intended in new york to practise his profession it was her nature to look out for duties to appeal to her conscience for tasks this attentive organ earnestly consulted had represented to her that he was an offshoot of the old slaveholding oligarchy which within her own vivid remembrance had plunged the country into blood and tears and that as associated with such abominations he was not a worthy object of patronage for a person whose two brothersher only oneshad given up life for the northern cause it reminded her however on the other hand that he too had been much bereaved and moreover that he had fought and offered his own life even if it had not been taken she could not defend herself against a rich admirationa kind of tenderness of envyof any one who had been so happy as to have that opportunity the most secret the most sacred hope of her nature was that she might some day have such a chance that she might be a martyr and die for something basil ransom had lived but she knew he had lived to see bitter hours his family was ruined they had lost their slaves their property their friends and relations their home had tasted of all the cruelty of defeat he had tried for a while to carry on the plantation himself but he had a millstone of debt round his neck and he longed for some work which would transport him to the haunts of men the state of mississippi seemed to him the state of despair so he surrendered the remnants of his patrimony to his mother and sisters and at nearly thirty years of age alighted for the first time in new york in the costume of his province with fifty dollars in his pocket and a gnawing hunger in his heart  that this incident had revealed to the young man his ignorance of many thingsonly however to make him say to himself after the first angry blush that here he would enter the game and here he would win itso much olive chancellor could not know what was sufficient for her was that he had rallied as the french say had accepted the accomplished fact had admitted that north and south were a single indivisible political organism their cousinshipthat of chancellors and ransomswas not very close it was the kind of thing that one might take up or leave alone as one pleased it was in the female line as basil ransom had written in answering her letter with a good deal of form and flourish he spoke as if they had been royal houses her mother had wished to take it up it was only the fear of seeming patronising to people in misfortune that had prevented her from writing to mississippi if it had been possible to send mrs ransom money or even clothes she would have liked that but she had no means of ascertaining how such an offering would be taken by the time basil came to the northmaking advances as it weremrs chancellor had passed away so it was for olive left alone in the little house in charles street adeline being in europe to decide  she knew what her mother would have done and that helped her decision for her mother always chose the positive course olive had a fear of everything but her greatest fear was of being afraid she wished immensely to be generous and how could one be generous unless one ran a risk she had erected it into a sort of rule of conduct that whenever she saw a risk she was to take it and she had frequent humiliations at finding herself safe after all she was perfectly safe after writing to basil ransom and indeed it was difficult to see what he could have done to her except thank her he was only exceptionally superlative for her letter and assure her that he would come and see her the first time his business he was beginning to get a little should take him to boston he had now come in redemption of his grateful vow and even this did not make miss chancellor feel that she had courted danger she saw when once she had looked at him that he would not put those worldly interpretations on things which with her it was both an impulse and a principle to defy he was too simpletoo mississippianfor that she was almost disappointed she certainly had not hoped that she might have struck him as making unwomanly overtures miss chancellor hated this epithet almost as much as she hated its opposite but she had a presentiment that he would be too goodnatured primitive to that degree of all things in the world contention was most sweet to her though why it is hard to imagine for it always cost her tears headaches a day or two in bed acute emotion and it was very possible basil ransom would not care to contend nothing could be more displeasing than this indifference when people didnt agree with you that he should agree she did not in the least expect of him how could a mississippian agree if she had supposed he would agree she would not have written to him     iii   when he had told her that if she would take him as he was he should be very happy to dine with her she excused herself a moment and went to give an order in the diningroom the young man left alone looked about the parlourthe two parlours which in their prolonged adjacent narrowness formed evidently one apartmentand wandered to the windows at the back where there was a view of the water miss chancellor having the good fortune to dwell on that side of charles street toward which in the rear the afternoon sun slants redly from an horizon indented at empty intervals with wooden spires the masts of lonely boats the chimneys of dirty works over a brackish expanse of anomalous character which is too big for a river and too small for a bay the view seemed to him very picturesque though in the gathered dusk little was left of it save a cold yellow streak in the west a gleam of brown water and the reflexion of the lights that had begun to show themselves in a row of houses impressive to ransom in their extreme modernness which overlooked the same lagoon from a long embankment on the left constructed of stones roughly piled he thought this prospect from a cityhouse almost romantic and he turned from it back to the interior illuminated now by a lamp which the parlourmaid had placed on a table while he stood at the window as to something still more genial and interesting the artistic sense in basil ransom had not been highly cultivated neither though he had passed his early years as the son of a rich man was his conception of material comfort very definite it consisted mainly of the vision of plenty of cigars and brandy and water and newspapers and a canebottomed armchair of the right inclination from which he could stretch his legs nevertheless it seemed to him he had never seen an interior that was so much an interior as this queer corridorshaped drawingroom of his newfound kinswoman he had never felt himself in the presence of so much organised privacy or of so many objects that spoke of habits and tastes most of the people he had hitherto known had no tastes they had a few habits but these were not of a sort that required much upholstery he had not as yet been in many houses in new york and he had never before seen so many accessories the general character of the place struck him as bostonian this was in fact very much what he had supposed boston to be he had always heard boston was a city of culture and now there was culture in miss chancellors tables and sofas in the books that were everywhere on little shelves like brackets as if a book were a statuette in the photographs and watercolours that covered the walls in the curtains that were festooned rather stiffly in the doorways he looked at some of the books and saw that his cousin read german and his impression of the importance of this as a symptom of superiority was not diminished by the fact that he himself had mastered the tongue knowing it contained a large literature of jurisprudence during a long empty deadly summer on the plantation it is a curious proof of a certain crude modesty inherent in basil ransom that the main effect of his observing his cousins german books was to give him an idea of the natural energy of northerners he had noticed it often before he had already told himself that he must count with it it was only after much experience he made the discovery that few northerners were in their secret soul so energetic as he many other persons had made it before that he knew very little about miss chancellor he had come to see her only because she wrote to him he would never have thought of looking her up and since then there had been no one in new york he might ask about her therefore he could only guess that she was a rich young woman such a house inhabited in such a way by a quiet spinster implied a considerable income how much he asked himself five thousand ten thousand fifteen thousand a year there was richness to our panting young man in the smallest of these figures he was not of a mercenary spirit but he had an immense desire for success and he had more than once reflected that a moderate capital was an aid to achievement he had seen in his younger years one of the biggest failures that history commemorates an immense national fiasco and it had implanted in his mind a deep aversion to the ineffectual it came over him while he waited for his hostess to reappear that she was unmarried as well as rich that she was sociable her letter answered for that as well as single and he had for a moment a whimsical vision of becoming a partner in so flourishing a firm he ground his teeth a little as he thought of the contrasts of the human lot this cushioned feminine nest made him feel unhoused and underfed such a mood however could only be momentary for he was conscious at bottom of a bigger stomach than all the culture of charles street could fill  afterwards when his cousin had come back and they had gone down to dinner together where he sat facing her at a little table decorated in the middle with flowers a position from which he had another view through a window where the curtain remained undrawn by her direction she called his attention to thisit was for his benefit of the dusky empty river spotted with points of lightat this period i say it was very easy for him to remark to himself that nothing would induce him to make love to such a type as that several months later in new york in conversation with mrs luna of whom he was destined to see a good deal he alluded by chance to this repast to the way her sister had placed him at table and to the remark with which she had pointed out the advantage of his seat  thats what they call in boston being very thoughtful mrs luna said giving you the back bay dont you hate the name to look at and then taking credit for it  this however was in the future what basil ransom actually perceived was that miss chancellor was a signal old maid that was her quality her destiny nothing could be more distinctly written there are women who are unmarried by accident and others who are unmarried by option but olive chancellor was unmarried by every implication of her being she was a spinster as shelley was a lyric poet or as the month of august is sultry she was so essentially a celibate that ransom found himself thinking of her as old though when he came to look at her as he said to himself it was apparent that her years were fewer than his own he did not dislike her she had been so friendly but little by little she gave him an uneasy feelingthe sense that you could never be safe with a person who took things so hard it came over him that it was because she took things hard she had sought his acquaintance it had been because she was strenuous not because she was genial she had had in her eyeand what an extraordinary eye it wasnot a pleasure but a duty she would expect him to be strenuous in return but he couldntin private life he couldnt privacy for basil ransom consisted entirely in what he called laying off she was not so plain on further acquaintance as she had seemed to him at first even the young mississippian had culture enough to see that she was refined her white skin had a singular look of being drawn tightly across her face but her features though sharp and irregular were delicate in a fashion that suggested good breeding their line was perverse but it was not poor the curious tint of her eyes was a living colour when she turned it upon you you thought vaguely of the glitter of green ice she had absolutely no figure and presented a certain appearance of feeling cold with all this there was something very modern and highly developed in her aspect she had the advantages as well as the drawbacks of a nervous organisation she smiled constantly at her guest but from the beginning to the end of dinner though he made several remarks that he thought might prove amusing she never once laughed later he saw that she was a woman without laughter exhilaration if it ever visited her was dumb once only in the course of his subsequent acquaintance with her did it find a voice and then the sound remained in ransoms ear as one of the strangest he had heard  she asked him a great many questions and made no comment on his answers which only served to suggest to her fresh inquiries her shyness had quite left her it did not come back she had confidence enough to wish him to see that she took a great interest in him why should she he wondered he couldnt believe he was one of her kind he was conscious of much bohemianismhe drank beer in new york in cellars knew no ladies and was familiar with a variety actress certainly as she knew him better she would disapprove of him though of course he would never mention the actress nor even if necessary the beer ransoms conception of vice was purely as a series of special cases of explicable accidents not that he cared if it were a part of the boston character to be inquiring he would be to the last a courteous mississippian he would tell her about mississippi as much as she liked he didnt care how much he told her that the old ideas in the south were played out she would not understand him any the better for that she would not know how little his own views could be gathered from such a limited admission what her sister imparted to him about her mania for reform had left in his mouth a kind of unpleasant aftertaste he felt at any rate that if she had the religion of humanitybasil ransom had read comte he had read everythingshe would never understand him he too had a private vision of reform but the first principle of it was to reform the reformers as they drew to the close of a meal which in spite of all latent incompatibilities had gone off brilliantly she said to him that she should have to leave him after dinner unless perhaps he should be inclined to accompany her she was going to a small gathering at the house of a friend who had asked a few people interested in new ideas to meet mrs farrinder  oh thank you said basil ransom is it a party i havent been to a party since mississippi seceded  no miss birdseye doesnt give parties shes an ascetic  oh well we have had our dinner ransom rejoined laughing  his hostess sat silent a moment with her eyes on the ground she looked at such times as if she were hesitating greatly between several things she might say all so important that it was difficult to choose  i think it might interest you she remarked presently you will hear some discussion if you are fond of that perhaps you wouldnt agree she added resting her strange eyes on him  perhaps i shouldnti dont agree with everything he said smiling and stroking his leg  dont you care for human progress miss chancellor went on  i dont knowi never saw any are you going to show me some  i can show you an earnest effort towards it thats the most one can be sure of but i am not sure you are worthy  is it something very bostonian i should like to see that said basil ransom  there are movements in other cities mrs farrinder goes everywhere she may speak tonight  mrs farrinder the celebrated  yes the celebrated the great apostle of the emancipation of women she is a great friend of miss birdseye  and who is miss birdseye  she is one of our celebrities she is the woman in the world i suppose who has laboured most for every wise reform i think i ought to tell you miss chancellor went on in a moment she was one of the earliest one of the most passionate of the old abolitionists  she had thought indeed she ought to tell him that and it threw her into a little tremor of excitement to do so yet if she had been afraid he would show some irritation at this news she was disappointed at the geniality with which he exclaimed  why poor old ladyshe must be quite mature  it was therefore with some severity that she rejoined  she will never be old she is the youngest spirit i know but if you are not in sympathy perhaps you had better not come she went on  in sympathy with what dear madam basil ransom asked failing still to her perception to catch the tone of real seriousness if as you say there is to be a discussion there will be different sides and of course one cant sympathise with both  yes but every one will in his wayor in her wayplead the cause of the new truths if you dont care for them you wont go with us  i tell you i havent the least idea what they are i have never yet encountered in the world any but old truthsas old as the sun and moon how can i know but do take me its such a chance to see boston  it isnt bostonits humanity miss chancellor as she made this remark rose from her chair and her movement seemed to say that she consented but before she quitted her kinsman to get ready she observed to him that she was sure he knew what she meant he was only pretending he didnt  well perhaps after all i have a general idea he confessed but dont you see how this little reunion will give me a chance to fix it  she lingered an instant with her anxious face mrs farrinder will fix it she said and she went to prepare herself  it was in this poor young ladys nature to be anxious to have scruple within scruple and to forecast the consequences of things she returned in ten minutes in her bonnet which she had apparently assumed in recognition of miss birdseyes asceticism as she stood there drawing on her glovesher visitor had fortified himself against mrs farrinder by another glass of wineshe declared to him that she quite repented of having proposed to him to go something told her that he would be an unfavourable element  why is it going to be a spiritual séance basil ransom asked  well i have heard at miss birdseyes some inspirational speaking olive chancellor was determined to look him straight in the face as she said this her sense of the way it might strike him operated as a cogent not as a deterrent reason  why miss olive its just got up on purpose for me cried the young mississippian radiant and clasping his hands she thought him very handsome as he said this but reflected that unfortunately men didnt care for the truth especially the new kinds in proportion as they were goodlooking she had however a moral resource that she could always fall back upon it had already been a comfort to her on occasions of acute feeling that she hated men as a class anyway and i want so much to see an old abolitionist i have never laid eyes on one basil ransom added  of course you couldnt see one in the south you were too afraid of them to let them come there she was now trying to think of something she might say that would be sufficiently disagreeable to make him cease to insist on accompanying her for strange to recordif anything in a person of that intense sensibility be stranger than any otherher second thought with regard to having asked him had deepened with the elapsing moments into an unreasoned terror of the effect of his presence perhaps miss birdseye wont like you she went on as they waited for the carriage  i dont know i reckon she will said basil ransom goodhumouredly he evidently had no intention of giving up his opportunity  from the window of the diningroom at that moment they heard the carriage drive up miss birdseye lived at the south end the distance was considerable and miss chancellor had ordered a hackneycoach it being one of the advantages of living in charles street that stables were near the logic of her conduct was none of the clearest for if she had been alone she would have proceeded to her destination by the aid of the streetcar not from economy for she had the good fortune not to be obliged to consult it to that degree and not from any love of wandering about boston at night a kind of exposure she greatly disliked but by reason of a theory she devotedly nursed a theory which bade her put off invidious differences and mingle in the common life she would have gone on foot to boylston street and there she would have taken the public conveyance in her heart she loathed it to the south end boston was full of poor girls who had to walk about at night and to squeeze into horsecars in which every sense was displeased and why should she hold herself superior to these olive chancellor regulated her conduct on lofty principles and this is why having tonight the advantage of a gentlemans protection she sent for a carriage to obliterate that patronage if they had gone together in the common way she would have seemed to owe it to him that she should be so daring and he belonged to a sex to which she wished to be under no obligations months before when she wrote to him it had been with the sense rather of putting him in debt as they rolled toward the south end side by side in a good deal of silence bouncing and bumping over the railwaytracks very little less after all than if their wheels had been fitted to them and looking out on either side at rows of red houses dusky in the lamplight with protuberant fronts approached by ladders of stone as they proceeded with these contemplative undulations miss chancellor said to her companion with a concentrated desire to defy him as a punishment for having thrown her she couldnt tell why into such a tremor  dont you believe then in the coming of a better dayin its being possible to do something for the human race  poor ransom perceived the defiance and he felt rather bewildered he wondered what type after all he had got hold of and what game was being played with him why had she made advances if she wanted to pinch him this way however he was good for any gamethat one as well as anotherand he saw that he was in for something of which he had long desired to have a nearer view well miss olive he answered putting on again his big hat which he had been holding in his lap what strikes me most is that the human race has got to bear its troubles  thats what men say to women to make them patient in the position they have made for them  oh the position of women basil ransom exclaimed the position of women is to make fools of men i would change my position for yours any day he went on thats what i said to myself as i sat there in your elegant home  he could not see in the dimness of the carriage that she had flushed quickly and he did not know that she disliked to be reminded of certain things which for her were mitigations of the hard feminine lot but the passionate quaver with which a moment later she answered him sufficiently assured him that he had touched her at a tender point  do you make it a reproach to me that i happen to have a little money the dearest wish of my heart is to do something with it for othersfor the miserable  basil ransom might have greeted this last declaration with the sympathy it deserved might have commended the noble aspirations of his kinswoman but what struck him rather was the oddity of so sudden a sharpness of pitch in an intercourse which an hour or two before had begun in perfect amity and he burst once more into an irrepressible laugh this made his companion feel with intensity how little she was joking i dont know why i should care what you think she said  dont caredont care what does it matter it is not of the slightest importance  he might say that but it was not true she felt that there were reasons why she should care she had brought him into her life and she should have to pay for it but she wished to know the worst at once are you against our emancipation she asked turning a white face on him in the momentary radiance of a streetlamp  do you mean your voting and preaching and all that sort of thing he made this inquiry but seeing how seriously she would take his answer he was almost frightened and hung fire i will tell you when i have heard mrs farrinder  they had arrived at the address given by miss chancellor to the coachman and their vehicle stopped with a lurch basil ransom got out he stood at the door with an extended hand to assist the young lady but she seemed to hesitate she sat there with her spectral face you hate it she exclaimed in a low tone  miss birdseye will convert me said ransom with intention for he had grown very curious and he was afraid that now at the last miss chancellor would prevent his entering the house she alighted without his help and behind her he ascended the high steps of miss birdseyes residence he had grown very curious and among the things he wanted to know was why in the world this ticklish spinster had written to him     iv   she had told him before they started that they should be early she wished to see miss birdseye alone before the arrival of any one else this was just for the pleasure of seeing herit was an opportunity she was always so taken up with others she received miss chancellor in the hall of the mansion which had a salient front an enormous and very high number756painted in gilt on the glass light above the door a tin sign bearing the name of a doctress mary j prance suspended from one of the windows of the basement and a peculiar look of being both new and fadeda kind of modern fatiguelike certain articles of commerce which are sold at a reduction as shopworn the hall was very narrow a considerable part of it was occupied by a large hattree from which several coats and shawls already depended the rest offered space for certain lateral demonstrations on miss birdseyes part she sidled about her visitors and at last went round to open for them a door of further admission which happened to be locked inside she was a little old lady with an enormous head that was the first thing ransom noticedthe vast fair protuberant candid ungarnished brow surmounting a pair of weak kind tiredlooking eyes and ineffectually balanced in the rear by a cap which had the air of falling backward and which miss birdseye suddenly felt for while she talked with unsuccessful irrelevant movements she had a sad soft pale face which and it was the effect of her whole head looked as if it had been soaked blurred and made vague by exposure to some slow dissolvent the long practice of philanthropy had not given accent to her features it had rubbed out their transitions their meanings the waves of sympathy of enthusiasm had wrought upon them in the same way in which the waves of time finally modify the surface of old marble busts gradually washing away their sharpness their details in her large countenance her dim little smile scarcely showed it was a mere sketch of a smile a kind of instalment or payment on account it seemed to say that she would smile more if she had time but that you could see without this that she was gentle and easy to beguile  she always dressed in the same way she wore a loose black jacket with deep pockets which were stuffed with papers memoranda of a voluminous correspondence and from beneath her jacket depended a short stuff dress the brevity of this simple garment was the one device by which miss birdseye managed to suggest that she was a woman of business that she wished to be free for action she belonged to the shortskirts league as a matter of course for she belonged to any and every league that had been founded for almost any purpose whatever this did not prevent her being a confused entangled inconsequent discursive old woman whose charity began at home and ended nowhere whose credulity kept pace with it and who knew less about her fellowcreatures if possible after fifty years of humanitary zeal than on the day she had gone into the field to testify against the iniquity of most arrangements basil ransom knew very little about such a life as hers but she seemed to him a revelation of a class and a multitude of socialistic figures of names and episodes that he had heard of grouped themselves behind her she looked as if she had spent her life on platforms in audiences in conventions in phalansteries in séances in her faded face there was a kind of reflexion of ugly lecturelamps with its habit of an upward angle it seemed turned toward a public speaker with an effort of respiration in the thick air in which social reforms are usually discussed she talked continually in a voice of which the spring seemed broken like that of an overworked bellwire and when miss chancellor explained that she had brought mr ransom because he was so anxious to meet mrs farrinder she gave the young man a delicate dirty democratic little hand looking at him kindly as she could not help doing but without the smallest discrimination as against others who might not have the good fortune which involved possibly an injustice to be present on such an interesting occasion she struck him as very poor but it was only afterward that he learned she had never had a penny in her life no one had an idea how she lived whenever money was given her she gave it away to a negro or a refugee no woman could be less invidious but on the whole she preferred these two classes of the human race since the civil war much of her occupation was gone for before that her best hours had been spent in fancying that she was helping some southern slave to escape it would have been a nice question whether in her heart of hearts for the sake of this excitement she did not sometimes wish the blacks back in bondage she had suffered in the same way by the relaxation of many european despotisms for in former years much of the romance of her life had been in smoothing the pillow of exile for banished conspirators her refugees had been very precious to her she was always trying to raise money for some cadaverous pole to obtain lessons for some shirtless italian there was a legend that an hungarian had once possessed himself of her affections and had disappeared after robbing her of everything she possessed this however was very apocryphal for she had never possessed anything and it was open to grave doubt that she could have entertained a sentiment so personal she was in love even in those days only with causes and she languished only for emancipations but they had been the happiest days for when causes were embodied in foreigners what else were the africans they were certainly more appealing  she had just come down to see doctor pranceto see whether she wouldnt like to come up but she wasnt in her room and miss birdseye guessed she had gone out to her supper she got her supper at a boardingtable about two blocks off miss birdseye expressed the hope that miss chancellor had had hers she would have had plenty of time to take it for no one had come in yet she didnt know what made them all so late ransom perceived that the garments suspended to the hatrack were not a sign that miss birdseyes friends had assembled if he had gone a little further still he would have recognised the house as one of those in which mysterious articles of clothing are always hooked to something in the hall miss birdseyes visitors those of doctor prance and of other tenantsfor number 756 was the common residence of several persons among whom there prevailed much vagueness of boundaryused to leave things to be called for many of them went about with satchels and reticules for which they were always looking for places of deposit what completed the character of this interior was miss birdseyes own apartment into which her guests presently made their way and where they were joined by various other members of the good ladys circle indeed it completed miss birdseye herself if anything could be said to render that office to this essentially formless old woman who had no more outline than a bundle of hay but the bareness of her long loose empty parlour it was shaped exactly like miss chancellors told that she had never had any needs but moral needs and that all her history had been that of her sympathies the place was lighted by a small hot glare of gas which made it look white and featureless it struck even basil ransom with its flatness and he said to himself that his cousin must have a very big bee in her bonnet to make her like such a house he did not know then and he never knew that she mortally disliked it and that in a career in which she was constantly exposing herself to offence and laceration her most poignant suffering came from the injury of her taste she had tried to kill that nerve to persuade herself that taste was only frivolity in the disguise of knowledge but her susceptibility was constantly blooming afresh and making her wonder whether an absence of nice arrangements were a necessary part of the enthusiasm of humanity miss birdseye was always trying to obtain employment lessons in drawing orders for portraits for poor foreign artists as to the greatness of whose talent she pledged herself without reserve but in point of fact she had not the faintest sense of the scenic or plastic side of life  toward nine oclock the light of her hissing burners smote the majestic person of mrs farrinder who might have contributed to answer that question of miss chancellors in the negative she was a copious handsome woman in whom angularity had been corrected by the air of success she had a rustling dress it was evident what she thought about taste abundant hair of a glossy blackness a pair of folded arms the expression of which seemed to say that rest in such a career as hers was as sweet as it was brief and a terrible regularity of feature i apply that adjective to her fine placid mask because she seemed to face you with a question of which the answer was preordained to ask you how a countenance could fail to be noble of which the measurements were so correct you could contest neither the measurements nor the nobleness and had to feel that mrs farrinder imposed herself there was a lithographic smoothness about her and a mixture of the american matron and the public character there was something public in her eye which was large cold and quiet it had acquired a sort of exposed reticence from the habit of looking down from a lecturedesk over a sea of heads while its distinguished owner was eulogised by a leading citizen mrs farrinder at almost any time had the air of being introduced by a few remarks she talked with great slowness and distinctness and evidently a high sense of responsibility she pronounced every syllable of every word and insisted on being explicit if in conversation with her you attempted to take anything for granted or to jump two or three steps at a time she paused looking at you with a cold patience as if she knew that trick and then went on at her own measured pace she lectured on temperance and the rights of women the ends she laboured for were to give the ballot to every woman in the country and to take the flowing bowl from every man she was held to have a very fine manner and to embody the domestic virtues and the graces of the drawingroom to be a shining proof in short that the forum for ladies is not necessarily hostile to the fireside she had a husband and his name was amariah  doctor prance had come back from supper and made her appearance in response to an invitation that miss birdseyes relaxed voice had tinkled down to her from the hall over the banisters with much repetition to secure attention she was a plain spare young woman with short hair and an eyeglass she looked about her with a kind of nearsighted deprecation and seemed to hope that she should not be expected to generalise in any way or supposed to have come up for any purpose more social than to see what miss birdseye wanted this time by nine oclock twenty other persons had arrived and had placed themselves in the chairs that were ranged along the sides of the long bald room in which they ended by producing the similitude of an enormous streetcar the apartment contained little else but these chairs many of which had a borrowed aspect an implication of bare bedrooms in the upper regions a table or two with a discoloured marble top a few books and a collection of newspapers piled up in corners ransom could see for himself that the occasion was not crudely festive there was a want of convivial movement and among most of the visitors even of mutual recognition they sat there as if they were waiting for something they looked obliquely and silently at mrs farrinder and were plainly under the impression that fortunately they were not there to amuse themselves the ladies who were much the more numerous wore their bonnets like miss chancellor the men were in the garb of toil many of them in wearylooking overcoats two or three had retained their overshoes and as you approached them the odour of the indiarubber was perceptible it was not however that miss birdseye ever noticed anything of that sort she neither knew what she smelled nor tasted what she ate most of her friends had an anxious haggard look though there were sundry exceptionshalfadozen placid florid faces basil ransom wondered who they all were he had a general idea they were mediums communists vegetarians it was not either that miss birdseye failed to wander about among them with repetitions of inquiry and friendly absences of attention she sat down near most of them in turn saying yes yes vaguely and kindly to remarks they made to her feeling for the papers in the pockets of her loosened bodice recovering her cap and sacrificing her spectacles wondering most of all what had been her idea in convoking these people then she remembered that it had been connected in some way with mrs farrinder that this eloquent woman had promised to favour the company with a few reminiscences of her last campaign to sketch even perhaps the lines on which she intended to operate during the coming winter this was what olive chancellor had come to hear this would be the attraction for the darkeyed young man he looked like a genius she had brought with her miss birdseye made her way back to the great lecturess who was bending an indulgent attention on miss chancellor the latter compressed into a small space to be near her and sitting with clasped hands and a concentration of inquiry which by contrast made mrs farrinders manner seem large and free in her transit however the hostess was checked by the arrival of fresh pilgrims she had no idea she had mentioned the occasion to so many peopleshe only remembered as it were those she had forgottenand it was certainly a proof of the interest felt in mrs farrinders work the people who had just come in were doctor and mrs tarrant and their daughter verena he was a mesmeric healer and she was of old abolitionist stock miss birdseye rested her dim dry smile upon the daughter who was new to her and it floated before her that she would probably be remarkable as a genius her parentage was an implication of that there was a genius for miss birdseye in every bush selah tarrant had effected wonderful cures she knew so many peopleif they would only try him his wife was a daughter of abraham greenstreet she had kept a runaway slave in her house for thirty days that was years before when this girl must have been a child but hadnt it thrown a kind of rainbow over her cradle and wouldnt she naturally have some gift the girl was very pretty though she had red hair     v   mrs farrinder meanwhile was not eager to address the assembly she confessed as much to olive chancellor with a smile which asked that a temporary lapse of promptness might not be too harshly judged she had addressed so many assemblies and she wanted to hear what other people had to say miss chancellor herself had thought so much on the vital subject would not she make a few remarks and give them some of her experiences how did the ladies on beacon street feel about the ballot perhaps she could speak for them more than for some others that was a branch of the question on which it might be the leaders had not information enough but they wanted to take in everything and why shouldnt miss chancellor just make that field her own mrs farrinder spoke in the tone of one who took views so wide that they might easily at first before you could see how she worked round look almost meretricious she was conscious of a scope that exceeded the first flight of your imagination she urged upon her companion the idea of labouring in the world of fashion appeared to attribute to her familiar relations with that mysterious realm and wanted to know why she shouldnt stir up some of her friends down there on the milldam  olive chancellor received this appeal with peculiar feelings with her immense sympathy for reform she found herself so often wishing that reformers were a little different there was something grand about mrs farrinder it lifted one up to be with her but there was a false note when she spoke to her young friend about the ladies in beacon street olive hated to hear that fine avenue talked about as if it were such a remarkable place and to live there were a proof of worldly glory all sorts of inferior people lived there and so brilliant a woman as mrs farrinder who lived at roxbury ought not to mix things up it was of course very wretched to be irritated by such mistakes but this was not the first time miss chancellor had observed that the possession of nerves was not by itself a reason for embracing the new truths she knew her place in the boston hierarchy and it was not what mrs farrinder supposed so that there was a want of perspective in talking to her as if she had been a representative of the aristocracy nothing could be weaker she knew very well than in the united states to apply that term too literally nevertheless it would represent a reality if one were to say that by distinction the chancellors belonged to the bourgeoisiethe oldest and best they might care for such a position or not as it happened they were very proud of it but there they were and it made mrs farrinder seem provincial there was something provincial after all in the way she did her hair too not to understand when miss birdseye spoke as if one were a leader of society olive could forgive her even that odious expression because of course one never pretended that she poor dear had the smallest sense of the real she was heroic she was sublime the whole moral history of boston was reflected in her displaced spectacles but it was a part of her originality as it were that she was deliciously provincial olive chancellor seemed to herself to have privileges enough without being affiliated to the exclusive set and having invitations to the smaller parties which were the real test it was a mercy for her that she had not that added immorality on her conscience the ladies mrs farrinder meant it was to be supposed she meant some particular ones might speak for themselves she wished to work in another field she had long been preoccupied with the romance of the people she had an immense desire to know intimately some very poor girl this might seem one of the most accessible of pleasures but in point of fact she had not found it so there were two or three pale shopmaidens whose acquaintance she had sought but they had seemed afraid of her and the attempt had come to nothing she took them more tragically then they took themselves they couldnt make out what she wanted them to do and they always ended by being odiously mixed up with charlie charlie was a young man in a white overcoat and a paper collar it was for him in the last analysis that they cared much the most they cared far more about charlie than about the ballot olive chancellor wondered how mrs farrinder would treat that branch of the question in her researches among her young townswomen she had always found this obtrusive swain planted in her path and she grew at last to dislike him extremely it filled her with exasperation to think that he should be necessary to the happiness of his victims she had learned that whatever they might talk about with her it was of him and him only that they discoursed among themselves and one of the main recommendations of the evening club for her fatigued underpaid sisters which it had long been her dream to establish was that it would in some degree undermine his positiondistinct as her prevision might be that he would be in waiting at the door she hardly knew what to say to mrs farrinder when this momentarily misdirected woman still preoccupied with the milldam returned to the charge  we want labourers in that field though i know two or three lovely womensweet homewomenmoving in circles that are for the most part closed to every new voice who are doing their best to help on the fight i have several names that might surprise you names well known on state street but we cant have too many recruits especially among those whose refinement is generally acknowledged if it be necessary we are prepared to take certain steps to conciliate the shrinking our movement is for allit appeals to the most delicate ladies raise the standard among them and bring me a thousand names i know several that i should like to have i look after the details as well as the big currents mrs farrinder added in a tone as explanatory as could be expected of such a woman and with a smile of which the sweetness was thrilling to her listener  i cant talk to those people i cant said olive chancellor with a face which seemed to plead for a remission of responsibility i want to give myself up to others i want to know everything that lies beneath and out of sight dont you know i want to enter into the lives of women who are lonely who are piteous i want to be near to themto help them i want to do somethingoh i should like so to speak  we should be glad to have you make a few remarks at present mrs farrinder declared with a punctuality which revealed the faculty of presiding  oh dear no i cant speak i have none of that sort of talent i have no selfpossession no eloquence i cant put three words together but i do want to contribute  what have you got mrs farrinder inquired looking at her interlocutress up and down with the eye of business in which there was a certain chill have you got money  olive was so agitated for the moment with the hope that this great woman would approve of her on the financial side that she took no time to reflect that some other quality might in courtesy have been suggested but she confessed to possessing a certain capital and the tone seemed rich and deep in which mrs farrinder said to her then contribute that she was so good as to develop this idea and her picture of the part miss chancellor might play by making liberal donations to a fund for the diffusion among the women of america of a more adequate conception of their public and private rightsa fund her adviser had herself lately inauguratedthis bold rapid sketch had the vividness which characterised the speakers most successful public efforts it placed olive under the spell it made her feel almost inspired if her life struck others in that wayespecially a woman like mrs farrinder whose horizon was so fullthen there must be something for her to do it was one thing to choose for herself but now the great representative of the enfranchisement of their sex from every form of bondage had chosen for her  the barren gaslighted room grew richer and richer to her earnest eyes it seemed to expand to open itself to the great life of humanity the serious tired people in their bonnets and overcoats began to glow like a company of heroes yes she would do something olive chancellor said to herself she would do something to brighten the darkness of that dreadful image that was always before her and against which it seemed to her at times that she had been born to lead a crusadethe image of the unhappiness of women the unhappiness of women the voice of their silent suffering was always in her ears the ocean of tears that they had shed from the beginning of time seemed to pour through her own eyes ages of oppression had rolled over them uncounted millions had lived only to be tortured to be crucified they were her sisters they were her own and the day of their delivery had dawned this was the only sacred cause this was the great the just revolution it must triumph it must sweep everything before it it must exact from the other the brutal bloodstained ravening race the last particle of expiation it would be the greatest change the world had seen it would be a new era for the human family and the names of those who had helped to show the way and lead the squadrons would be the brightest in the tables of fame they would be names of women weak insulted persecuted but devoted in every pulse of their being to the cause and asking no better fate than to die for it it was not clear to this interesting girl in what manner such a sacrifice as this last would be required of her but she saw the matter through a kind of sunrisemist of emotion which made danger as rosy as success when miss birdseye approached it transfigured her familiar her comical shape and made the poor little humanitary hack seem already a martyr olive chancellor looked at her with love remembered that she had never in her long unrewarded weary life had a thought or an impulse for herself she had been consumed by the passion of sympathy it had crumpled her into as many creases as an old glazed distended glove she had been laughed at but she never knew it she was treated as a bore but she never cared she had nothing in the world but the clothes on her back and when she should go down into the grave she would leave nothing behind her but her grotesque undistinguished pathetic little name and yet people said that women were vain that they were personal that they were interested while miss birdseye stood there asking mrs farrinder if she wouldnt say something olive chancellor tenderly fastened a small battered brooch which confined her collar and which had half detached itself     vi   oh thank you said miss birdseye i shouldnt like to lose it it was given me by mirandola he had been one of her refugees in the old time when two or three of her friends acquainted with the limits of his resources wondered how he had come into possession of the trinket she had been diverted again after her greeting with doctor and mrs tarrant by stopping to introduce the tall dark young man whom miss chancellor had brought with her to doctor prance she had become conscious of his somewhat sombre figure uplifted against the wall near the door he was leaning there in solitude unacquainted with opportunities which miss birdseye felt to be collectively of value and which were really of course what strangers came to boston for it did not occur to her to ask herself why miss chancellor didnt talk to him since she had brought him miss birdseye was incapable of a speculation of this kind olive in fact had remained vividly conscious of her kinsmans isolation until the moment when mrs farrinder lifted her with a word to a higher plane she watched him across the room she saw that he might be bored but she proposed to herself not to mind that she had asked him after all not to come then he was no worse off than others he was only waiting like the rest and before they left she would introduce him to mrs farrinder she might tell that lady who he was first it was not every one that would care to know a person who had borne such a part in the southern disloyalty it came over our young lady that when she sought the acquaintance of her distant kinsman she had indeed done a more complicated thing than she suspected the sudden uneasiness that he flung over her in the carriage had not left her though she felt it less now she was with others and especially that she was close to mrs farrinder who was such a fountain of strength at any rate if he was bored he could speak to some one there were excellent people near him even if they were ardent reformers he could speak to that pretty girl who had just come inthe one with red hairif he liked southerners were supposed to be so chivalrous  miss birdseye reasoned much less and did not offer to introduce him to verena tarrant who was apparently being presented by her parents to a group of friends at the other end of the room it came back to miss birdseye in this connexion that sure enough verena had been away for a long timefor nearly a year had been on a visit to friends in the west and would therefore naturally be a stranger to most of the boston circle doctor prance was looking at herat miss birdseyewith little sharp fixed pupils and the good lady wondered whether she were angry at having been induced to come up she had a general impression that when genius was original its temper was high and all this would be the case with doctor prance she wanted to say to her that she could go down again if she liked but even to miss birdseyes unsophisticated mind this scarcely appeared as regards a guest an adequate formula of dismissal she tried to bring the young southerner out she said to him that she presumed they would have some entertainment soonmrs farrinder could be interesting when she tried and then she bethought herself to introduce him to doctor prance it might serve as a reason for having brought her up moreover it would do her good to break up her work now and then she pursued her medical studies far into the night and miss birdseye who was nothing of a sleeper mary prance precisely had wanted to treat her for it had heard her in the stillness of the small hours with her open windows she had fresh air on the brain sharpening instruments it was miss birdseyes mild belief that she dissected in a little physiological laboratory which she had set up in her back room the room which if she hadnt been a doctor might have been her chamber and perhaps was even with the dissecting miss birdseye didnt know she explained her young friends to each other a trifle incoherently perhaps and then went to stir up mrs farrinder  basil ransom had already noticed doctor prance he had not been at all bored and had observed every one in the room arriving at all sorts of ingenious inductions the little medical lady struck him as a perfect example of the yankee femalethe figure which in the unregenerate imagination of the children of the cottonstates was produced by the new england schoolsystem the puritan code the ungenial climate the absence of chivalry spare dry hard without a curve an inflexion or a grace she seemed to ask no odds in the battle of life and to be prepared to give none but ransom could see that she was not an enthusiast and after his contact with his cousins enthusiasm this was rather a relief to him she looked like a boy and not even like a good boy it was evident that if she had been a boy she would have cut school to try private experiments in mechanics or to make researches in natural history it was true that if she had been a boy she would have borne some relation to a girl whereas doctor prance appeared to bear none whatever except her intelligent eye she had no features to speak of ransom asked her if she were acquainted with the lioness and on her staring at him without response explained that he meant the renowned mrs farrinder  well i dont know as i ought to say that im acquainted with her but ive heard her on the platform i have paid my halfdollar the doctor added with a certain grimness  well did she convince you ransom inquired  convince me of what sir  that women are so superior to men  oh deary me said doctor prance with a little impatient sigh i guess i know more about women than she does  and that isnt your opinion i hope said ransom laughing  men and women are all the same to me doctor prance remarked i dont see any difference there is room for improvement in both sexes neither of them is up to the standard and on ransoms asking her what the standard appeared to her to be she said well they ought to live better thats what they ought to do and she went on to declare further that she thought they all talked too much this had so long been ransoms conviction that his heart quite warmed to doctor prance and he paid homage to her wisdom in the manner of mississippiwith a richness of compliment that made her turn her acute suspicious eye upon him this checked him she was capable of thinking that he talked too muchshe herself having apparently no general conversation it was german to the matter at any rate for him to observe that he believed they were to have a lecture from mrs farrinderhe didnt know why she didnt begin yes said doctor prance rather dryly i suppose thats what miss birdseye called me up for she seemed to think i wouldnt want to miss that  whereas i infer you could console yourself for the loss of the oration ransom suggested  well ive got some work i dont want any one to teach me what a woman can do doctor prance declared she can find out some things if she tries besides i am familiar with mrs farrinders system i know all she has got to say  well what is it then since she continues to remain silent  well what it amounts to is just that women want to have a better time thats what it comes to in the end i am aware of that without her telling me  and dont you sympathise with such an aspiration  well i dont know as i cultivate the sentimental side said doctor prance theres plenty of sympathy without mine if they want to have a better time i suppose its natural so do men too i suppose but i dont know as it appeals to meto make sacrifices for it it aint such a wonderful timethe best you can have  this little lady was tough and technical she evidently didnt care for great movements she became more and more interesting to basil ransom who it is to be feared had a fund of cynicism he asked her if she knew his cousin miss chancellor whom he indicated beside mrs farrinder she believed on the contrary in wonderful times she thought they were coming she had plenty of sympathy and he was sure she was willing to make sacrifices  doctor prance looked at her across the room for a moment then she said she didnt know her but she guessed she knew others like hershe went to see them when they were sick shes having a private lecture to herself ransom remarked whereupon doctor prance rejoined well i guess shell have to pay for it she appeared to regret her own halfdollar and to be vaguely impatient of the behaviour of her sex ransom became so sensible of this that he felt it was indelicate to allude further to the cause of woman and for a change endeavoured to elicit from his companion some information about the gentlemen present he had given her a chance vainly to start some topic herself but he could see that she had no interests beyond the researches from which this evening she had been torn and was incapable of asking him a personal question she knew two or three of the gentlemen she had seen them before at miss birdseyes of course she knew principally ladies the time hadnt come when a ladydoctor was sent for by a gentleman and she hoped it never would though some people seemed to think that this was what ladydoctors were working for she knew mr pardon that was the young man with the sidewhiskers and the white hair he was a kind of editor and he wrote too over his signatureperhaps basil had read some of his works he was under thirty in spite of his white hair he was a great deal thought of in magazine circles she believed he was very brightbut she hadnt read anything she didnt read muchnot for amusement only the transcript she believed mr pardon sometimes wrote in the transcript well she supposed he was very bright the other that she knewonly she didnt know him she supposed basil would think that queerwas the tall pale gentleman with the black moustache and the eyeglass she knew him because she had met him in society but she didnt know himwell because she didnt want to if he should come and speak to herand he looked as if he were going to work round that wayshe should just say to him yes sir or no sir very coldly she couldnt help it if he did think her dry if he were a little more dry it might be better for him what was the matter with him oh she thought she had mentioned that he was a mesmeric healer he made miraculous cures she didnt believe in his system or disbelieve in it one way or the other she only knew that she had been called to see ladies he had worked on and she found that he had made them lose a lot of valuable time he talked to themwell as if he didnt know what he was saying she guessed he was quite ignorant of physiology and she didnt think he ought to go round taking responsibilities she didnt want to be narrow but she thought a person ought to know something she supposed basil would think her very uplifted but he had put the question to her as she might say all she could say was she didnt want him to be laying his hands on any of her folks it was all done with the handswhat wasnt done with the tongue basil could see that doctor prance was irritated that this extreme candour of allusion to her neighbour was probably not habitual to her as a member of a society in which the casual expression of strong opinion generally produced waves of silence but he blessed her irritation for him it was so illuminating and to draw further profit from it he asked her who the young lady was with the red hairthe pretty one whom he had only noticed during the last ten minutes she was miss tarrant the daughter of the healer hadnt she mentioned his name selah tarrant if he wanted to send for him doctor prance wasnt acquainted with her beyond knowing that she was the mesmerists only child and having heard something about her having some giftshe couldnt remember which it was oh if she was his child she would be sure to have some giftif it was only the gift of the gwell she didnt mean to say that but a talent for conversation perhaps she could die and come to life again perhaps she would show them her gift as no one seemed inclined to do anything yes she was prettyappearing but there was a certain indication of anæmia and doctor prance would be surprised if she didnt eat too much candy basil thought she had an engaging exterior it was his private reflexion coloured doubtless by sectional prejudice that she was the first pretty girl he had seen in boston she was talking with some ladies at the other end of the room and she had a large red fan which she kept constantly in movement she was not a quiet girl she fidgeted was restless while she talked and had the air of a person who whatever she might be doing would wish to be doing something else if people watched her a good deal she also returned their contemplation and her charming eyes had several times encountered those of basil ransom but they wandered mainly in the direction of mrs farrinderthey lingered upon the serene solidity of the great oratress it was easy to see that the girl admired this beneficent woman and felt it a privilege to be near her it was apparent indeed that she was excited by the company in which she found herself a fact to be explained by a reference to that recent period of exile in the west of which we have had a hint and in consequence of which the present occasion may have seemed to her a return to intellectual life ransom secretly wished that his cousinsince fate was to reserve for him a cousin in bostonhad been more like that  by this time a certain agitation was perceptible several ladies impatient of vain delay had left their places to appeal personally to mrs farrinder who was presently surrounded with sympathetic remonstrants miss birdseye had given her up it had been enough for miss birdseye that she should have said when pressed so far as her hostess muffled in laxity could press on the subject of the general expectation that she could only deliver her message to an audience which she felt to be partially hostile there was no hostility there they were all only too much in sympathy i dont require sympathy she said with a tranquil smile to olive chancellor i am only myself i only rise to the occasion when i see prejudice when i see bigotry when i see injustice when i see conservatism massed before me like an army then i feeli feel as i imagine napoleon bonaparte to have felt on the eve of one of his great victories i must have unfriendly elementsi like to win them over  olive thought of basil ransom and wondered whether he would do for an unfriendly element she mentioned him to mrs farrinder who expressed an earnest hope that if he were opposed to the principles which were so dear to the rest of them he might be induced to take the floor and testify on his own account i should be so happy to answer him said mrs farrinder with supreme softness i should be so glad at any rate to exchange ideas with him olive felt a deep alarm at the idea of a public dispute between these two vigorous people she had a perception that ransom would be vigorous not because she doubted of the happy issue but because she herself would be in a false position as having brought the offensive young man and she had a horror of false positions miss birdseye was incapable of resentment she had invited forty people to hear mrs farrinder speak and now mrs farrinder wouldnt speak but she had such a beautiful reason for it there was something martial and heroic in her pretext and besides it was so characteristic so free that miss birdseye was quite consoled and wandered away looking at her other guests vaguely as if she didnt know them from each other while she mentioned to them at a venture the excuse for their disappointment confident evidently that they would agree with her it was very fine but we cant pretend to be on the other side just to start her up can we she asked of mr tarrant who sat there beside his wife with a rather conscious but by no means complacent air of isolation from the rest of the company  well i dont knowi guess we are all solid here this gentleman replied looking round him with a slow deliberate smile which made his mouth enormous developed two wrinkles as long as the wings of a bat on either side of it and showed a set of big even carnivorous teeth  selah said his wife laying her hand on the sleeve of his waterproof i wonder whether miss birdseye would be interested to hear verena  well if you mean she sings its a shame i havent got a piano miss birdseye took upon herself to respond it came back to her that the girl had a gift  she doesnt want a pianoshe doesnt want anything selah remarked giving no apparent attention to his wife it was a part of his attitude in life never to appear to be indebted to another person for a suggestion never to be surprised or unprepared  well i dont know that the interest in singing is so general said miss birdseye quite unconscious of any slackness in preparing a substitute for the entertainment that had failed her  it isnt singing youll see mrs tarrant declared  what is it then  mr tarrant unfurled his wrinkles showed his back teeth its inspirational  miss birdseye gave a small vague unsceptical laugh well if you can guarantee that  i think it would be acceptable said mrs tarrant and putting up a halfgloved familiar hand she drew miss birdseye down to her and the pair explained in alternation what it was their child could do  meanwhile basil ransom confessed to doctor prance that he was after all rather disappointed he had expected more of a programme he wanted to hear some of the new truths mrs farrinder as he said remained within her tent and he had hoped not only to see these distinguished people but also to listen to them  well i aint disappointed the sturdy little doctress replied if any question had been opened i suppose i should have had to stay  but i presume you dont propose to retire  well ive got to pursue my studies some time i dont want the gentlemendoctors to get ahead of me  oh no one will ever get ahead of you im very sure and there is that pretty young lady going over to speak to mrs farrinder shes going to beg her for a speechmrs farrinder cant resist that  well then ill just trickle out before she begins goodnight sir said doctor prance who by this time had begun to appear to ransom more susceptible of domestication as if she had been a small forestcreature a catamount or a ruffled doe that had learned to stand still while you stroked it or even to extend a paw she ministered to health and she was healthy herself if his cousin could have been even of this type basil would have felt himself more fortunate  goodnight doctor he replied you havent told me after all your opinion of the capacity of the ladies  capacity for what said doctor prance theyve got a capacity for making people waste time all i know is that i dont want any one to tell me what a lady can do and she edged away from him softly as if she had been traversing a hospitalward and presently he saw her reach the door which with the arrival of the later comers had remained open she stood there an instant turning over the whole assembly a glance like the flash of a watchmans bullseye and then quickly passed out ransom could see that she was impatient of the general question and bored with being reminded even for the sake of her rights that she was a womana detail that she was in the habit of forgetting having as many rights as she had time for it was certain that whatever might become of the movement at large doctor prances own little revolution was a success     vii   she had no sooner left him than olive chancellor came towards him with eyes that seemed to say i dont care whether you are here now or notim all right but what her lips said was much more gracious she asked him if she mightnt have the pleasure of introducing him to mrs farrinder ransom consented with a little of his southern flourish and in a moment the lady got up to receive him from the midst of the circle that now surrounded her it was an occasion for her to justify her reputation of an elegant manner and it must be impartially related that she struck ransom as having a dignity in conversation and a command of the noble style which could not have been surpassed by a daughterone of the most accomplished most fardescended daughtersof his own latitude it was as if she had known that he was not eager for the changes she advocated and wished to show him that especially to a southerner who had bitten the dust her sex could be magnanimous this knowledge of his secret heresy seemed to him to be also in the faces of the other ladies whose circumspect glances however for he had not been introduced treated it as a pity rather than as a shame he was conscious of all these middleaged feminine eyes conscious of curls rather limp that depended from dusky bonnets of heads poked forward as if with a waiting listening familiar habit of no one being very bright or gayno one at least but that girl he had noticed before who had a brilliant head and who now hovered on the edge of the conclave he met her eye again she was watching him too it had been in his thought that mrs farrinder to whom his cousin might have betrayed or misrepresented him would perhaps defy him to combat and he wondered whether he could pull himself together he was extremely embarrassed sufficiently to do honour to such a challenge if she would fling down the glove on the temperance question it seemed to him that it would be in him to pick it up for the idea of a meddling legislation on this subject filled him with rage the taste of liquor being good to him and his conviction strong that civilisation itself would be in danger if it should fall into the power of a herd of vociferating women i am but the reporter of his angry formulae to prevent a gentleman from taking his glass mrs farrinder proved to him that she had not the eagerness of insecurity she asked him if he wouldnt like to give the company some account of the social and political condition of the south he begged to be excused expressing at the same time a high sense of the honour done him by such a request while he smiled to himself at the idea of his extemporising a lecture he smiled even while he suspected the meaning of the look miss chancellor gave him well you are not of much account after all to talk to those people about the southif they could have guessed how little he cared to do it he had a passionate tenderness for his own country and a sense of intimate connexion with it which would have made it as impossible for him to take a roomful of northern fanatics into his confidence as to read aloud his mothers or his mistresss letters to be quiet about the southern land not to touch her with vulgar hands to leave her alone with her wounds and her memories not prating in the marketplace either of her troubles or her hopes but waiting as a man should wait for the slow process the sensible beneficence of timethis was the desire of ransoms heart and he was aware of how little it could minister to the entertainment of miss birdseyes guests  we know so little about the women of the south they are very voiceless mrs farrinder remarked how much can we count upon them in what numbers would they flock to our standard i have been recommended not to lecture in the southern cities  ah madam that was very cruel advicefor us basil ransom exclaimed with gallantry  i had a magnificent audience last spring in st louis a fresh young voice announced over the heads of the gathered groupa voice which on basils turning like every one else for an explanation appeared to have proceeded from the pretty girl with red hair she had coloured a little with the effort of making this declaration and she stood there smiling at her listeners  mrs farrinder bent a benignant brow upon her in spite of her being evidently rather a surprise oh indeed and your subject my dear young lady  the past history the present condition and the future prospects of our sex  oh well st louisthats scarcely the south said one of the ladies  im sure the young lady would have had equal success at charleston or new orleans basil ransom interposed  well i wanted to go farther the girl continued but i had no friends i have friends in st louis  you oughtnt to want for them anywhere said mrs farrinder in a manner which by this time had quite explained her reputation i am acquainted with the loyalty of st louis  well after that you must let me introduce miss tarrant shes perfectly dying to know you mrs farrinder these words emanated from one of the gentlemen the young man with white hair who had been mentioned to ransom by doctor prance as a celebrated magazinist he too up to this moment had hovered in the background but he now gently clove the assembly several of the ladies made way for him leading in the daughter of the mesmerist  she laughed and continued to blushher blush was the faintest pink she looked very young and slim and fair as mrs farrinder made way for her on the sofa which olive chancellor had quitted i have wanted to know you i admire you so much i hoped so you would speak tonight its too lovely to see you mrs farrinder so she expressed herself while the company watched the encounter with a look of refreshed inanition you dont know who i am of course im just a girl who wants to thank you for all you have done for us for you have spoken for us girls just as much asjust as much as she hesitated now looking about with enthusiastic eyes at the rest of the group and meeting once more the gaze of basil ransom  just as much as for the old women said mrs farrinder genially you seem very well able to speak for yourself  she speaks so beautifullyif she would only make a little address the young man who had introduced her remarked its a new style quite original he added he stood there with folded arms looking down at his work the conjunction of the two ladies with a smile and basil ransom remembering what miss prance had told him and enlightened by his observation in new york of some of the sources from which newspapers are fed was immediately touched by the conviction that he perceived in it the material of a paragraph  my dear child if youll take the floor ill call the meeting to order said mrs farrinder  the girl looked at her with extraordinary candour and confidence if i could only hear you firstjust to give me an atmosphere  ive got no atmosphere theres very little of the indian summer about me i deal with factshard facts mrs farrinder replied have you ever heard me if so you know how crisp i am  heard you ive lived on you its so much to me to see you ask mother if it aint she had expressed herself from the first word she uttered with a promptness and assurance which gave almost the impression of a lesson rehearsed in advance and yet there was a strange spontaneity in her manner and an air of artless enthusiasm of personal purity if she was theatrical she was naturally theatrical she looked up at mrs farrinder with all her emotion in her smiling eyes this lady had been the object of many ovations it was familiar to her that the collective heart of her sex had gone forth to her but visibly she was puzzled by this unforeseen embodiment of gratitude and fluency and her eyes wandered over the girl with a certain reserve while within the depth of her eminently public manner she asked herself whether miss tarrant were a remarkable young woman or only a forward minx she found a response which committed her to neither view she only said we want the youngof course we want the young  who is that charming creature basil ransom heard his cousin ask in a grave lowered tone of matthias pardon the young man who had brought miss tarrant forward he didnt know whether miss chancellor knew him or whether her curiosity had pushed her to boldness ransom was near the pair and had the benefit of mr pardons answer  the daughter of doctor tarrant the mesmeric healermiss verena shes a highclass speaker  what do you mean olive asked does she give public addresses  oh yes she has had quite a career in the west i heard her last spring at topeka they call it inspirational i dont know what it isonly its exquisite so fresh and poetical she has to have her father to start her up it seems to pass into her and mr pardon indulged in a gesture intended to signify the passage  olive chancellor made no rejoinder save a low impatient sigh she transferred her attention to the girl who now held mrs farrinders hand in both her own and was pleading with her just to prelude a little i want a startingpointi want to know where i am she said just two or three of your grand old thoughts  basil stepped nearer to his cousin he remarked to her that miss verena was very pretty she turned an instant glanced at him and then said do you think so an instant later she added how you must hate this place  oh not now we are going to have some fun ransom replied goodhumouredly if a trifle coarsely and the declaration had a point for miss birdseye at this moment reappeared followed by the mesmeric healer and his wife  ah well i see you are drawing her out said miss birdseye to mrs farrinder and at the idea that this process had been necessary basil ransom broke into a smothered hilarity a spasm which indicated that for him the fun had already begun and procured him another grave glance from miss chancellor miss verena seemed to him as far out as a young woman could be heres her father doctor tarranthe has a wonderful giftand her mothershe was a daughter of abraham greenstreet miss birdseye presented her companion she was sure mrs farrinder would be interested she wouldnt want to lose an opportunity even if for herself the conditions were not favourable and then miss birdseye addressed herself to the company more at large widening the circle so as to take in the most scattered guests and evidently feeling that after all it was a relief that one happened to have an obscurely inspired maiden on the premises when greater celebrities had betrayed the whimsicality of genius it was a part of this whimsicality that mrs farrinderthe reader may find it difficult to keep pace with her variationsappeared now to have decided to utter a few of her thoughts so that her hostess could elicit a general response to the remark that it would be delightful to have both the old school and the new  well perhaps youll be disappointed in verena said mrs tarrant with an air of dolorous resignation to any event and seating herself with her gathered mantle on the edge of a chair as if she at least were ready whoever else might keep on talking  it isnt me mother verena rejoined with soft gravity rather detached now from mrs farrinder and sitting with her eyes fixed thoughtfully on the ground with deference to mrs tarrant a little more talk was necessary for the young lady had as yet been insufficiently explained miss birdseye felt this but she was rather helpless about it and delivered herself with her universal familiarity which embraced every one and everything of a wandering amiable tale in which abraham greenstreet kept reappearing in which doctor tarrants miraculous cures were specified with all the facts wanting and in which verenas successes in the west were related not with emphasis or hyperbole in which miss birdseye never indulged but as accepted and recognised wonders natural in an age of new revelations she had heard of these things in detail only ten minutes before from the girls parents but her hospitable soul had needed but a moment to swallow and assimilate them if her account of them was not very lucid it should be said in excuse for her that it was impossible to have any idea of verena tarrant unless one had heard her and therefore still more impossible to give an idea to others mrs farrinder was perceptibly irritated she appeared to have made up her mind after her first hesitation that the tarrant family were fantastical and compromising she had bent an eye of coldness on selah and his wifeshe might have regarded them all as a company of mountebanks  stand up and tell us what you have to say she remarked with some sternness to verena who only raised her eyes to her silently now with the same sweetness and then rested them on her father this gentleman seemed to respond to an irresistible appeal he looked round at the company with all his teeth and said that these flattering allusions were not so embarrassing as they might otherwise be inasmuch as any success that he and his daughter might have had was so thoroughly impersonal he insisted on that word they had just heard her say it is not me mother and he and mrs tarrant and the girl herself were all equally aware it was not she it was some power outsideit seemed to flow through her he couldnt pretend to say why his daughter should be called more than any one else but it seemed as if she was called when he just calmed her down by laying his hand on her a few moments it seemed to come it so happened that in the west it had taken the form of a considerable eloquence she had certainly spoken with great facility to cultivated and highminded audiences she had long followed with sympathy the movement for the liberation of her sex from every sort of bondage it had been her principal interest even as a child he might mention that at the age of nine she had christened her favourite doll eliza p moseley in memory of a great precursor whom they all reverenced and now the inspiration if he might call it so seemed just to flow in that channel the voice that spoke from her lips seemed to want to take that form it didnt seem as if it could take any other she let it come out just as it wouldshe didnt pretend to have any control they could judge for themselves whether the whole thing was not quite unique that was why he was willing to talk about his own child that way before a gathering of ladies and gentlemen it was because they took no creditthey felt it was a power outside if verena felt she was going to be stimulated that evening he was pretty sure they would be interested only he should have to request a few moments silence while she listened for the voice  several of the ladies declared that they should be delightedthey hoped that miss tarrant was in good trim whereupon they were corrected by others who reminded them that it wasnt hershe had nothing to do with itso her trim didnt matter and a gentleman added that he guessed there were many present who had conversed with eliza p moseley meanwhile verena more and more withdrawn into herself but perfectly undisturbed by the public discussion of her mystic faculty turned yet again very prettily to mrs farrinder and asked her if she wouldnt strike outjust to give her courage by this time mrs farrinder was in a condition of overhanging gloom she greeted the charming suppliant with the frown of juno she disapproved completely of doctor tarrants little speech and she had less and less disposition to be associated with a miraclemonger abraham greenstreet was very well but abraham greenstreet was in his grave and eliza p moseley after all had been very tepid basil ransom wondered whether it were effrontery or innocence that enabled miss tarrant to meet with such complacency the aloofness of the elder lady at this moment he heard olive chancellor at his elbow with the tremor of excitement in her tone suddenly exclaim please begin please begin a voice a human voice is what we want  ill speak after you and if youre a humbug ill expose you mrs farrinder said she was more majestic than facetious  im sure we are all solid as doctor tarrant says i suppose we want to be quiet miss birdseye remarked     viii   verena tarrant got up and went to her father in the middle of the room olive chancellor crossed and resumed her place beside mrs farrinder on the sofa the girl had quitted and miss birdseyes visitors for the rest settled themselves attentively in chairs or leaned against the bare sides of the parlour verena took her fathers hands held them for a moment while she stood before him not looking at him with her eyes towards the company then after an instant her mother rising pushed forward with an interesting sigh the chair on which she had been sitting mrs tarrant was provided with another seat and verena relinquishing her fathers grasp placed herself in the chair which tarrant put in position for her she sat there with closed eyes and her father now rested his long lean hands upon her head basil ransom watched these proceedings with much interest for the girl amused and pleased him she had far more colour than any one there for whatever brightness was to be found in miss birdseyes rather faded and dingy human collection had gathered itself into this attractive but ambiguous young person there was nothing ambiguous by the way about her confederate ransom simply loathed him from the moment he opened his mouth he was intensely familiarthat is his type was he was simply the detested carpetbagger he was false cunning vulgar ignoble the cheapest kind of human product that he should be the father of a delicate pretty girl who was apparently clever too whether she had a gift or no this was an annoying disconcerting fact the white puffy mother with the high forehead in the corner there looked more like a lady but if she were one it was all the more shame to her to have mated with such a varlet ransom said to himself making use as he did generally of terms of opprobrium extracted from the older english literature he had seen tarrant or his equivalent often before he had whipped him as he believed controversially again and again at political meetings in blighted southern towns during the horrible period of reconstruction if mrs farrinder had looked at verena tarrant as if she were a mountebank there was some excuse for it inasmuch as the girl made much the same impression on basil ransom he had never seen such an odd mixture of elements she had the sweetest most unworldly face and yet with it an air of being on exhibition of belonging to a troupe of living in the gaslight which pervaded even the details of her dress fashioned evidently with an attempt at the histrionic if she had produced a pair of castanets or a tambourine he felt that such accessories would have been quite in keeping  little doctor prance with her hard good sense had noted that she was anæmic and had intimated that she was a deceiver the value of her performance was yet to be proved but she was certainly very pale white as women are who have that shade of red hair they look as if their blood had gone into it there was however something rich in the fairness of this young lady she was strong and supple there was colour in her lips and eyes and her tresses gathered into a complicated coil seemed to glow with the brightness of her nature she had curious radiant liquid eyes their smile was a sort of reflexion like the glisten of a gem and though she was not tall she appeared to spring up and carried her head as if it reached rather high ransom would have thought she looked like an oriental if it were not that orientals are dark and if she had only had a goat she would have resembled esmeralda though he had but a vague recollection of who esmeralda had been she wore a lightbrown dress of a shape that struck him as fantastic a yellow petticoat and a large crimson sash fastened at the side while round her neck and falling low upon her flat young chest she had a double chain of amber beads it must be added that in spite of her melodramatic appearance there was no symptom that her performance whatever it was would be of a melodramatic character she was very quiet now at least she had folded her big fan and her father continued the mysterious process of calming her down ransom wondered whether he wouldnt put her to sleep for some minutes her eyes had remained closed he heard a lady near him apparently familiar with phenomena of this class remark that she was going off as yet the exhibition was not exciting though it was certainly pleasant to have such a pretty girl placed there before one like a moving statue doctor tarrant looked at no one as he stroked and soothed his daughter his eyes wandered round the cornice of the room and he grinned upward as if at an imaginary gallery quietlyquietly he murmured from time to time it will come my good child it will come just let it workjust let it gather the spirit you know youve got to let the spirit come out when it will he threw up his arms at moments to rid himself of the wings of his long waterproof which fell forward over his hands basil ransom noticed all these things and noticed also opposite the waiting face of his cousin fixed from her sofa upon the closed eyes of the young prophetess he grew more impatient at last not of the delay of the edifying voice though some time had elapsed but of tarrants grotesque manipulations which he resented as much as if he himself had felt their touch and which seemed a dishonour to the passive maiden they made him nervous they made him angry and it was only afterwards that he asked himself wherein they concerned him and whether even a carpetbagger hadnt a right to do what he pleased with his daughter it was a relief to him when verena got up from her chair with a movement which made tarrant drop into the background as if his part were now over she stood there with a quiet face serious and sightless then after a short further delay she began to speak  she began incoherently almost inaudibly as if she were talking in a dream ransom could not understand her he thought it very queer and wondered what doctor prance would have said shes just arranging her ideas and trying to get in report shell come out all right this remark he heard dropped in a low tone by the mesmeric healer in report was apparently tarrants version of en rapport his prophecy was verified and verena did come out after a little she came out with a great deal of sweetnesswith a very quaint and peculiar effect she proceeded slowly cautiously as if she were listening for the prompter catching one by one certain phrases that were whispered to her a great distance off behind the scenes of the world then memory or inspiration returned to her and presently she was in possession of her part she played it with extraordinary simplicity and grace at the end of ten minutes ransom became aware that the whole audiencemrs farrinder miss chancellor and the tough subject from mississippiwere under the charm i speak of ten minutes but to tell the truth the young man lost all sense of time he wondered afterwards how long she had spoken then he counted that her strange sweet crude absurd enchanting improvisation must have lasted half an hour it was not what she said he didnt care for that he scarcely understood it he could only see that it was all about the gentleness and goodness of women and how during the long ages of history they had been trampled under the iron heel of man it was about their equalityperhaps even he was not definitely conscious about their superiority it was about their day having come at last about the universal sisterhood about their duty to themselves and to each other it was about such matters as these and basil ransom was delighted to observe that such matters as these didnt spoil it the effect was not in what she said though she said some such pretty things but in the picture and figure of the halfbedizened damsel playing now again with her red fan the visible freshness and purity of the little effort when she had gained confidence she opened her eyes and their shining softness was half the effect of her discourse it was full of schoolgirl phrases of patches of remembered eloquence of childish lapses of logic of flights of fancy which might indeed have had success at topeka but ransom thought that if it had been much worse it would have been quite as good for the argument the doctrine had absolutely nothing to do with it it was simply an intensely personal exhibition and the person making it happened to be fascinating she might have offended the taste of certain peopleransom could imagine that there were other boston circles in which she would be thought pert but for himself all he could feel was that to his starved senses she irresistibly appealed he was the stiffest of conservatives and his mind was steeled against the inanities she utteredthe rights and wrongs of women the equality of the sexes the hysterics of conventions the further stultification of the suffrage the prospect of conscript mothers in the national senate it made no difference she didnt mean it she didnt know what she meant she had been stuffed with this trash by her father and she was neither more nor less willing to say it than to say anything else for the necessity of her nature was not to make converts to a ridiculous cause but to emit those charming notes of her voice to stand in those free young attitudes to shake her braided locks like a naiad rising from the waves to please every one who came near her and to be happy that she pleased i know not whether ransom was aware of the bearings of this interpretation which attributed to miss tarrant a singular hollowness of character he contented himself with believing that she was as innocent as she was lovely and with regarding her as a vocalist of exquisite faculty condemned to sing bad music how prettily indeed she made some of it sound  of course i only speak to womento my own dear sisters i dont speak to men for i dont expect them to like what i say they pretend to admire us very much but i should like them to admire us a little less and to trust us a little more i dont know what we have ever done to them that they should keep us out of everything we have trusted them too much and i think the time has come now for us to judge them and say that by keeping us out we dont think they have done so well when i look around me at the world and at the state that men have brought it to i confess i say to myself well if women had fixed it this way i should like to know what they would think of it when i see the dreadful misery of mankind and think of the suffering of which at any hour at any moment the world is full i say that if this is the best they can do by themselves they had better let us come in a little and see what we can do we couldnt possibly make it worse could we if we had done only this we shouldnt boast of it poverty and ignorance and crime disease and wickedness and wars wars always more wars and always more and more blood bloodthe world is drenched with blood to kill each other with all sorts of expensive and perfected instruments that is the most brilliant thing they have been able to invent it seems to me that we might stop it we might invent something better the crueltythe cruelty there is so much so much why shouldnt tenderness come in why should our womans hearts be so full of it and all so wasted and withered while armies and prisons and helpless miseries grow greater all the while i am only a girl a simple american girl and of course i havent seen much and there is a great deal of life that i dont know anything about but there are some things i feelit seems to me as if i had been born to feel them they are in my ears in the stillness of the night and before my face in the visions of the darkness it is what the great sisterhood of women might do if they should all join hands and lift up their voices above the brutal uproar of the world in which it is so hard for the plea of mercy or of justice the moan of weakness and suffering to be heard we should quench it we should make it still and the sound of our lips would become the voice of universal peace for this we must trust one another we must be true and gentle and kind we must remember that the world is ours too ourslittle as we have ever had to say about anythingand that the question is not yet definitely settled whether it shall be a place of injustice or a place of love  it was with this that the young lady finished her harangue which was not followed by her sinking exhausted into her chair or by any of the traces of a laboured climax she only turned away slowly towards her mother smiling over her shoulder at the whole room as if it had been a single person without a flush in her whiteness or the need of drawing a longer breath the performance had evidently been very easy to her and there might have been a kind of impertinence in her air of not having suffered from an exertion which had wrought so powerfully on every one else ransom broke into a genial laugh which he instantly swallowed again at the sweet grotesqueness of this virginal creatures standing up before a company of middleaged people to talk to them about love the note on which she had closed her harangue it was the most charming touch in the whole thing and the most vivid proof of her innocence she had had immense success and mrs tarrant as she took her into her arms and kissed her was certainly able to feel that the audience was not disappointed they were exceedingly affected they broke into exclamations and murmurs selah tarrant went on conversing ostentatiously with his neighbours slowly twirling his long thumbs and looking up at the cornice again as if there could be nothing in the brilliant manner in which his daughter had acquitted herself to surprise him who had heard her when she was still more remarkable and who moreover remembered that the affair was so impersonal miss birdseye looked round at the company with dim exultation her large mild cheeks were shining with unwiped tears young mr pardon remarked in ransoms hearing that he knew parties who if they had been present would want to engage miss verena at a high figure for the winter campaign and ransom heard him add in a lower tone theres money for some one in that girl you see if she dont have quite a run as for our mississippian he kept his agreeable sensation for himself only wondering whether he might not ask miss birdseye to present him to the heroine of the evening not immediately of course for the young man mingled with his southern pride a shyness which often served all the purpose of humility he was aware how much he was an outsider in such a house as that and he was ready to wait for his coveted satisfaction till the others who all hung together should have given her the assurance of an approval which she would value naturally more than anything he could say to her this episode had imparted animation to the assembly a certain gaiety even expressed in a higher pitch of conversation seemed to float in the heated air people circulated more freely and verena tarrant was presently hidden from ransoms sight by the closepressed ranks of the new friends she had made well i never heard it put that way ransom heard one of the ladies exclaim to which another replied that she wondered one of their bright women hadnt thought of it before well it is a gift and no mistake and well they may call it what they please its a pleasure to listen to itthese genial tributes fell from the lips of a pair of ruminating gentlemen it was affirmed within ransoms hearing that if they had a few more like that the matter would soon be fixed and it was rejoined that they couldnt expect to have a great manythe style was so peculiar it was generally admitted that the style was peculiar but miss tarrants peculiarity was the explanation of her success     ix   ransom approached mrs farrinder again who had remained on her sofa with olive chancellor and as she turned her face to him he saw that she had felt the universal contagion her keen eye sparkled there was a flush on her matronly cheek and she had evidently made up her mind what line to take olive chancellor sat motionless her eyes were fixed on the floor with the rigid alarmed expression of her moments of nervous diffidence she gave no sign of observing her kinsmans approach he said something to mrs farrinder something that imperfectly represented his admiration of verena and this lady replied with dignity that it was no wonder the girl spoke so wellshe spoke in such a good cause she is very graceful has a fine command of language her father says its a natural gift ransom saw that he should not in the least discover mrs farrinders real opinion and her dissimulation added to his impression that she was a woman with a policy it was none of his business whether in her heart she thought verena a parrot or a genius it was perceptible to him that she saw she would be effective would help the cause he stood almost appalled for a moment as he said to himself that she would take her up and the girl would be ruined would force her note and become a screamer but he quickly dodged this vision taking refuge in a mechanical appeal to his cousin of whom he inquired how she liked miss verena olive made no answer her head remained averted she bored the carpet with her conscious eyes mrs farrinder glanced at her askance and then said to ransom serenely  you praise the grace of your southern ladies but you have had to come north to see a human gazelle miss tarrant is of the best new england stockwhat i call the best  im sure from what i have seen of the boston ladies no manifestation of grace can excite my surprise ransom rejoined looking with his smile at his cousin  she has been powerfully affected mrs farrinder explained very slightly dropping her voice as olive apparently still remained deaf  miss birdseye drew near at this moment she wanted to know if mrs farrinder didnt want to express some acknowledgment on the part of the company at large for the real stimulus miss tarrant had given them mrs farrinder said oh yes she would speak now with pleasure only she must have a glass of water first miss birdseye replied that there was some coming in a moment one of the ladies had asked for it and mr pardon had just stepped down to draw some basil took advantage of this intermission to ask miss birdseye if she would give him the great privilege of an introduction to miss verena mrs farrinder will thank her for the company he said laughing but she wont thank her for me  miss birdseye manifested the greatest disposition to oblige him she was so glad he had been impressed she was proceeding to lead him toward miss tarrant when olive chancellor rose abruptly from her chair and laid her hand with an arresting movement on the arm of her hostess she explained to her that she must go that she was not very well that her carriage was there also that she hoped miss birdseye if it was not asking too much would accompany her to the door  well you are impressed too said miss birdseye looking at her philosophically it seems as if no one had escaped  ransom was disappointed he saw he was going to be taken away and before he could suppress it an exclamation burst from his lipsthe first exclamation he could think of that would perhaps check his cousins retreat ah miss olive are you going to give up mrs farrinder  at this miss olive looked at him showed him an extraordinary face a face he scarcely understood or even recognised it was portentously grave the eyes were enlarged there was a red spot in each of the cheeks and as directed to him a quick piercing question a kind of leaping challenge in the whole expression he could only answer this sudden gleam with a stare and wonder afresh what trick his northern kinswoman was destined to play him impressed too he should think he had been mrs farrinder who was decidedly a woman of the world came to his assistance or to miss chancellors and said she hoped very much olive wouldnt stayshe felt these things too much if you stay i wont speak she added i should upset you altogether and then she continued tenderly for so preponderantly intellectual a nature when women feel as you do how can i doubt that we shall come out all right  oh we shall come out all right i guess murmured miss birdseye  but you must remember beacon street mrs farrinder subjoined you must take advantage of your positionyou must wake up the back bay  im sick of the back bay said olive fiercely and she passed to the door with miss birdseye bidding goodbye to no one she was so agitated that evidently she could not trust herself and there was nothing for ransom but to follow at the door of the room however he was checked by a sudden pause on the part of the two ladies olive stopped and stood there hesitating she looked round the room and spied out verena where she sat with her mother the centre of a gratified group then throwing back her head with an air of decision she crossed over to her ransom said to himself that now perhaps was his chance and he quickly accompanied miss chancellor the little knot of reformers watched her as she arrived their faces expressed a suspicion of her social importance mingled with conscientious scruples as to whether it were right to recognise it verena tarrant saw that she was the object of this manifestation and she got up to meet the lady whose approach was so full of point ransom perceived however or thought he perceived that she recognised nothing she had no suspicions of social importance yet she smiled with all her radiance as she looked from miss chancellor to him smiled because she liked to smile to please to feel her successor was it because she was a perfect little actress and this was part of her training she took the hand that olive put out to her the others rather solemnly sat looking up from their chairs  you dont know me but i want to know you olive said i can thank you now will you come and see me  oh yes where do you live verena answered in the tone of a girl for whom an invitation she hadnt so many was always an invitation  miss chancellor syllabled her address and mrs tarrant came forward smiling i know about you miss chancellor i guess your father knew my fathermr greenstreet verena will be very glad to visit you we shall be very happy to see you in our home  basil ransom while the mother spoke wanted to say something to the daughter who stood there so near him but he could think of nothing that would do certain words that came to him his mississippi phrases seemed patronising and ponderous besides he didnt wish to assent to what she had said he wished simply to tell her she was delightful and it was difficult to mark that difference so he only smiled at her in silence and she smiled back at hima smile that seemed to him quite for himself  where do you live olive asked and mrs tarrant replied that they lived at cambridge and that the horsecars passed just near their door whereupon olive insisted will you come very soon and verena said oh yes she would come very soon and repeated the number in charles street to show that she had taken heed of it this was done with childlike good faith ransom saw that she would come and see any one who would ask her like that and he regretted for a minute that he was not a boston lady so that he might extend to her such an invitation olive chancellor held her hand a moment longer looked at her in farewell and then saying come mr ransom drew him out of the room in the hall they met mr pardon coming up from the lower regions with a jug of water and a tumbler miss chancellors hackneycoach was there and when basil had put her into it she said to him that she wouldnt trouble him to drive with herhis hotel was not near charles street he had so little desire to sit by her sidehe wanted to smokethat it was only after the vehicle had rolled off that he reflected upon her coolness and asked himself why the deuce she had brought him away she was a very odd cousin was this boston cousin of his he stood there a moment looking at the light in miss birdseyes windows and greatly minded to reenter the house now he might speak to the girl but he contented himself with the memory of her smile and turned away with a sense of relief after all at having got out of such wild company as well as with in a different order a vulgar consciousness of being very thirsty     x   verena tarrant came in the very next day from cambridge to charles street that quarter of boston is in direct communication with the academic suburb it hardly seemed direct to poor verena perhaps who in the crowded streetcar which deposited her finally at miss chancellors door had to stand up all the way half suspended by a leathern strap from the glazed roof of the stifling vehicle like some blooming cluster dangling in a hothouse she was used however to these perpendicular journeys and though as we have seen she was not inclined to accept without question the social arrangements of her time it never would have occurred to her to criticise the railways of her native land the promptness of her visit to olive chancellor had been an idea of her mothers and verena listened openeyed while this lady in the seclusion of the little house in cambridge while selah tarrant was off as they said with his patients sketched out a line of conduct for her the girl was both submissive and unworldly and she listened to her mothers enumeration of the possible advantages of an intimacy with miss chancellor as she would have listened to any other fairytale it was still a part of the fairytale when this zealous parent put on with her own hands verenas smart hat and feather buttoned her little jacket the buttons were immense and gilt and presented her with twenty cents to pay her carfare  there was never any knowing in advance how mrs tarrant would take a thing and even verena who filially was much less argumentative than in her civic and as it were public capacity had a perception that her mother was queer she was queer indeeda flaccid relaxed unhealthy whimsical woman who still had a capacity to cling what she clung to was society and a position in the world which a secret whisper told her she had never had and a voice more audible reminded her she was in danger of losing to keep it to recover it to reconsecrate it was the ambition of her heart this was one of the many reasons why providence had judged her worthy of having so wonderful a child verena was born not only to lead their common sex out of bondage but to remodel a visitinglist which bulged and contracted in the wrong places like a countrymade garment as the daughter of abraham greenstreet mrs tarrant had passed her youth in the first abolitionist circles and she was aware how much such a prospect was clouded by her union with a young man who had begun life as an itinerant vendor of leadpencils he had called at mr greenstreets door in the exercise of this function had afterwards been for a while a member of the celebrated cayuga community where there were no wives or no husbands or something of that sort mrs tarrant could never remember and had still later though before the development of the healing faculty achieved distinction in the spiritualistic world he was an extraordinarily favoured medium only he had had to stop for reasons of which mrs tarrant possessed her version even in a society much occupied with the effacement of prejudice there had been certain dim presumptions against this versatile being who naturally had not wanted arts to ingratiate himself with miss greenstreet her eyes like his own being fixed exclusively on the future the young couple he was considerably her elder had gazed on the future together until they found that the past had completely forsaken them and that the present offered but a slender foothold mrs tarrant in other words incurred the displeasure of her family who gave her husband to understand that much as they desired to remove the shackles from the slave there were kinds of behaviour which struck them as too unfettered these had prevailed to their thinking at cayuga and they naturally felt it was no use for him to say that his residence there had been for himthe community still existed but a momentary episode inasmuch as there was little more to be urged for the spiritual picnics and vegetarian campmeetings in which the discountenanced pair now sought consolation  such were the narrow views of people hitherto supposed capable of opening their hearts to all salutary novelties but now put to a genuine test as mrs tarrant felt her husbands tastes rubbed off on her soft moist moral surface and the couple lived in an atmosphere of novelty in which occasionally the accommodating wife encountered the fresh sensation of being in want of her dinner her father died leaving after all very little money he had spent his modest fortune upon the blacks selah tarrant and his companion had strange adventures she found herself completely enrolled in the great irregular army of nostrummongers domiciled in humanitary bohemia it absorbed her like a social swamp she sank into it a little more every day without measuring the inches of her descent now she stood there up to her chin it may probably be said of her that she had touched bottom when she went to miss birdseyes it seemed to her that she reentered society the door that admitted her was not the door that admitted some of the others she should never forget the tippedup nose of mrs farrinder and the superior portal remained ajar disclosing possible vistas she had lived with longhaired men and shorthaired women she had contributed a flexible faith and an irremediable want of funds to a dozen social experiments she had partaken of the comfort of a hundred religions had followed innumerable dietary reforms chiefly of the negative order and had gone of an evening to a séance or a lecture as regularly as she had eaten her supper her husband always had tickets for lectures in moments of irritation at the want of a certain sequence in their career she had remarked to him that it was the only thing he did have the memory of all the winter nights they had tramped through the slush the tickets alas were not cartickets to hear mrs ada t p foat discourse on the summerland came back to her with bitterness selah was quite enthusiastic at one time about mrs foat and it was his wifes belief that he had been associated with her that was selahs expression in referring to such episodes at cayuga the poor woman matrimonially had a great deal to put up with it took at moments all her belief in his genius to sustain her she knew that he was very magnetic that in fact was his genius and she felt that it was his magnetism that held her to him he had carried her through things where she really didnt know what to think there were moments when she suspected that she had lost the strong moral sense for which the greenstreets were always so celebrated  of course a woman who had had the bad taste to marry selah tarrant would not have been likely under any circumstances to possess a very straight judgement but there is no doubt that this poor lady had grown dreadfully limp she had blinked and compromised and shuffled she asked herself whether after all it was any more than natural that she should have wanted to help her husband in those exciting days of his mediumship when the table sometimes wouldnt rise from the ground the sofa wouldnt float through the air and the soft hand of a lost loved one was not so alert as it might have been to visit the circle mrs tarrants hand was soft enough for the most supernatural effect and she consoled her conscience on such occasions by reflecting that she ministered to a belief in immortality she was glad somehow for verenas sake that they had emerged from the phase of spiritintercourse her ambition for her daughter took another form than desiring that she too should minister to a belief in immortality yet among mrs tarrants multifarious memories these reminiscences of the darkened room the waiting circle the little taps on table and wall the little touches on cheek and foot the music in the air the rain of flowers the sense of something mysteriously flitting were most tenderly cherished she hated her husband for having magnetised her so that she consented to certain things and even did them the thought of which today would suddenly make her face burn hated him for the manner in which somehow as she felt he had lowered her social tone yet at the same time she admired him for an impudence so consummate that it had ended in the face of mortifications exposures failures all the misery of a handtomouth existence by imposing itself on her as a kind of infallibility she knew he was an awful humbug and yet her knowledge had this imperfection that he had never confessed ita fact that was really grand when one thought of his opportunities for doing so he had never allowed that he wasnt straight the pair had so often been in the position of the two augurs behind the altar and yet he had never given her a glance that the whole circle mightnt have observed even in the privacy of domestic intercourse he had phrases excuses explanations ways of putting things which as she felt were too sublime for just herself they were pitched as selahs nature was pitched altogether in the key of public life  so it had come to pass in her distended and demoralised conscience that with all the things she despised in her life and all the things she rather liked between being worn out with her husbands inability to earn a living and a kind of terror of his consistency he had a theory that they lived delightfully it happened i say that the only very definite criticism she made of him today was that he didnt know how to speak that was where the shoe pinchedthat was where selah was slim he couldnt hold the attention of an audience he was not acceptable as a lecturer he had plenty of thoughts but it seemed as if he couldnt fit them into each other public speaking had been a greenstreet tradition and if mrs tarrant had been asked whether in her younger years she had ever supposed she should marry a mesmeric healer she would have replied well i never thought i should marry a gentleman who would be silent on the platform this was her most general humiliation it included and exceeded every other and it was a poor consolation that selah possessed as a substitutehis career as a healer to speak of none other was there to prove itthe eloquence of the hand the greenstreets had never set much store on manual activity they believed in the influence of the lips it may be imagined therefore with what exultation as time went on mrs tarrant found herself the mother of an inspired maiden a young lady from whose lips eloquence flowed in streams the greenstreet tradition would not perish and the dry places of her life would perhaps be plentifully watered it must be added that of late this sandy surface had been irrigated in moderation from another source since selah had addicted himself to the mesmeric mystery their home had been a little more what the home of a greenstreet should be he had considerable many patients he got about two dollars a sitting and he had effected some most gratifying cures a lady in cambridge had been so much indebted to him that she had recently persuaded them to take a house near her in order that doctor tarrant might drop in at any time he availed himself of this conveniencethey had taken so many houses that another more or less didnt matterand mrs tarrant began to feel as if they really had struck something  even to verena as we know she was confused and confusing the girl had not yet had an opportunity to ascertain the principles on which her mothers limpness was liable suddenly to become rigid this phenomenon occurred when the vapours of social ambition mounted to her brain when she extended an arm from which a crumpled dressinggown fluttered back to seize the passing occasion then she surprised her daughter by a volubility of exhortation as to the duty of making acquaintances and by the apparent wealth of her knowledge of the mysteries of good society she had in particular a way of explaining confidentiallyand in her desire to be graphic she often made up the oddest facesthe interpretation that you must sometimes give to the manners of the best people and the delicate dignity with which you should meet them which made verena wonder what secret sources of information she possessed verena took life as yet very simply she was not conscious of so many differences of social complexion she knew that some people were rich and others poor and that her fathers house had never been visited by such abundance as might make one ask ones self whether it were right in a world so full of the disinherited to roll in luxury but except when her mother made her slightly dizzy by a resentment of some slight that she herself had never perceived or a flutter over some opportunity that appeared already to have passed while mrs tarrant was looking for something to put on verena had no vivid sense that she was not as good as any one else for no authority appealing really to her imagination had fixed the place of mesmeric healers in the scale of fashion it was impossible to know in advance how mrs tarrant would take things sometimes she was abjectly indifferent at others she thought that every one who looked at her wished to insult her at moments she was full of suspicion of the ladies they were mainly ladies whom selah mesmerised then again she appeared to have given up everything but her slippers and the eveningpaper from this publication she derived inscrutable solace so that if mrs foat in person had returned from the summerland to which she had some time since taken her flight she would not have disturbed mrs tarrants almost cynical equanimity  it was however in her social subtleties that she was most beyond her daughter it was when she discovered extraordinary though latent longings on the part of people they met to make their acquaintance that the girl became conscious of how much she herself had still to learn all her desire was to learn and it must be added that she regarded her mother in perfect good faith as a wonderful teacher she was perplexed sometimes by her worldliness that somehow was not a part of the higher life which every one in such a house as theirs must wish above all things to lead and it was not involved in the reign of justice which they were all trying to bring about that such a strict account should be kept of every little snub her father seemed to verena to move more consecutively on the high plane though his indifference to oldfashioned standards his perpetual invocation of the brighter day had not yet led her to ask herself whether after all men are more disinterested than women was it interest that prompted her mother to respond so warmly to miss chancellor to say to verena with an air of knowingness that the thing to do was to go in and see her immediately no italics can represent the earnestness of mrs tarrants emphasis why hadnt she said as she had done in former cases that if people wanted to see them they could come out to their home that she was not so low down in the world as not to know there was such a ceremony as leaving cards when mrs tarrant began on the question of ceremonies she was apt to go far but she had waived it in this case it suited her more to hold that miss chancellor had been very gracious that she was a most desirable friend that she had been more affected than any one by verenas beautiful outpouring that she would open to her the best saloons in boston that when she said come soon she meant the very next day that this was the way to take it anyhow one must know when to go forward gracefully and that in short she mrs tarrant knew what she was talking about  verena accepted all this for she was young enough to enjoy any journey in a horsecar and she was evercurious about the world she only wondered a little how her mother knew so much about miss chancellor just from looking at her once what verena had mainly observed in the young lady who came up to her that way the night before was that she was rather dolefully dressed that she looked as if she had been crying verena recognised that look quickly she had seen it so much and that she was in a hurry to get away however if she was as remarkable as her mother said one would very soon see it and meanwhile there was nothing in the girls feeling about herself in her sense of her importance to make it a painful effort for her to run the risk of a mistake she had no particular feeling about herself she only cared as yet for outside things even the development of her gift had not made her think herself too precious for mere experiments she had neither a particle of diffidence nor a particle of vanity though it would have seemed to you eminently natural that a daughter of selah tarrant and his wife should be an inspirational speaker yet as you knew verena better you would have wondered immensely how she came to issue from such a pair her ideas of enjoyment were very simple she enjoyed putting on her new hat with its redundancy of feather and twenty cents appeared to her a very large sum     xi   i was certain you would comei have felt it all daysomething told me it was with these words that olive chancellor greeted her young visitor coming to her quickly from the window where she might have been waiting for her arrival some weeks later she explained to verena how definite this prevision had been how it had filled her all day with a nervous agitation so violent as to be painful she told her that such forebodings were a peculiarity of her organisation that she didnt know what to make of them that she had to accept them and she mentioned as another example the sudden dread that had come to her the evening before in the carriage after proposing to mr ransom to go with her to miss birdseyes this had been as strange as it had been instinctive and the strangeness of course was what must have struck mr ransom for the idea that he might come had been hers and yet she suddenly veered round she couldnt help it her heart had begun to throb with the conviction that if he crossed that threshold some harm would come of of it for her she hadnt prevented him and now she didnt care for now as she intimated she had the interest of verena and that made her indifferent to every danger to every ordinary pleasure by this time verena had learned how peculiarly her friend was constituted how nervous and serious she was how personal how exclusive what a force of will she had what a concentration of purpose olive had taken her up in the literal sense of the phrase like a bird of the air had spread an extraordinary pair of wings and carried her through the dizzying void of space verena liked it for the most part liked to shoot upward without an effort of her own and look down upon all creation upon all history from such a height from this first interview she felt that she was seized and she gave herself up only shutting her eyes a little as we do whenever a person in whom we have perfect confidence proposes with our assent to subject us to some sensation  i want to know you olive said on this occasion i felt that i must last night as soon as i heard you speak you seem to me very wonderful i dont know what to make of you i think we ought to be friends so i just asked you to come to me straight off without preliminaries and i believed you would come it is so right that you have come and it proves how right i was these remarks fell from miss chancellors lips one by one as she caught her breath with the tremor that was always in her voice even when she was the least excited while she made verena sit down near her on the sofa and looked at her all over in a manner that caused the girl to rejoice at having put on the jacket with the gilt buttons it was this glance that was the beginning it was with this quick survey omitting nothing that olive took possession of her you are very remarkable i wonder if you know how remarkable she went on murmuring the words as if she were losing herself becoming inadvertent in admiration  verena sat there smiling without a blush but with a pure bright look which for her would always make protests unnecessary oh it isnt me you know its something outside she tossed this off lightly as if she were in the habit of saying it and olive wondered whether it were a sincere disclaimer or only a phrase of the lips the question was not a criticism for she might have been satisfied that the girl was a mass of fluent catchwords and yet scarcely have liked her the less it was just as she was that she liked her she was so strange so different from the girls one usually met seemed to belong to some queer gipsyland or transcendental bohemia with her bright vulgar clothes her salient appearance she might have been a ropedancer or a fortuneteller and this had the immense merit for olive that it appeared to make her belong to the people threw her into the social dusk of that mysterious democracy which miss chancellor held that the fortunate classes know so little about and with which in a future possibly very near they will have to count moreover the girl had moved her as she had never been moved and the power to do that from whatever source it came was a force that one must admire her emotion was still acute however much she might speak to her visitor as if everything that had happened seemed to her natural and what kept it above all from subsiding was her sense that she found here what she had been looking for so longa friend of her own sex with whom she might have a union of soul it took a double consent to make a friendship but it was not possible that this intensely sympathetic girl would refuse olive had the penetration to discover in a moment that she was a creature of unlimited generosity i know not what may have been the reality of miss chancellors other premonitions but there is no doubt that in this respect she took verenas measure on the spot this was what she wanted after that the rest didnt matter miss tarrant might wear gilt buttons from head to foot her soul could not be vulgar  mother told me i had better come right in said verena looking now about the room very glad to find herself in so pleasant a place and noticing a great many things that she should like to see in detail  your mother saw that i meant what i said it isnt everybody that does me the honour to perceive that she saw that i was shaken from head to foot i could only say three wordsi couldnt have spoken more what a powerwhat a power miss tarrant  yes i suppose it is a power if it wasnt a power it couldnt do much with me  you are so simpleso much like a child olive chancellor said that was the truth and she wanted to say it because quickly without forms or circumlocutions it made them familiar she wished to arrive at this her impatience was such that before the girl had been five minutes in the room she jumped to her pointinquired of her interrupting herself interrupting everything will you be my friend my friend of friends beyond every one everything for ever and for ever her face was full of eagerness and tenderness  verena gave a laugh of clear amusement without a shade of embarrassment or confusion perhaps you like me too much  of course i like you too much when i like i like too much but of course its another thing your liking me olive chancellor added we must waitwe must wait when i care for anything i can be patient she put out her hand to verena and the movement was at once so appealing and so confident that the girl instinctively placed her own in it so hand in hand for some moments these two young women sat looking at each other there is so much i want to ask you said olive  well i cant say much except when father has worked on me verena answered with an ingenuousness beside which humility would have seemed pretentious  i dont care anything about your father olive chancellor rejoined very gravely with a great air of security  he is very good verena said simply and hes wonderfully magnetic  it isnt your father and it isnt your mother i dont think of them and its not them i want its only youjust as you are  verena dropped her eyes over the front of her dress just as she was seemed to her indeed very well  do you want me to give up she demanded smiling  olive chancellor drew in her breath for an instant like a creature in pain then with her quavering voice touched with a vibration of anguish she said oh how can i ask you to give up i will give upi will give up everything  filled with the impression of her hostesss agreeable interior and of what her mother had told her about miss chancellors wealth her position in boston society verena in her fresh diverted scrutiny of the surrounding objects wondered what could be the need of this scheme of renunciation oh no indeed she hoped she wouldnt give upat least not before she verena had had a chance to see she felt however that for the present there would be no answer for her save in the mere pressure of miss chancellors eager nature that intensity of emotion which made her suddenly exclaim as if in a nervous ecstasy of anticipation but we must wait why do we talk of this we must wait all will be right she added more calmly with great sweetness  verena wondered afterward why she had not been more afraid of herwhy indeed she had not turned and saved herself by darting out of the room but it was not in this young womans nature to be either timid or cautious she had as yet to make acquaintance with the sentiment of fear she knew too little of the world to have learned to mistrust sudden enthusiasms and if she had had a suspicion it would have been in accordance with common worldly knowledge the wrong onethe suspicion that such a whimsical liking would burn itself out she could not have that one for there was a light in miss chancellors magnified face which seemed to say that a sentiment with her might consume its object might consume miss chancellor but would never consume itself verena as yet had no sense of being scorched she was only agreeably warmed she also had dreamed of a friendship though it was not what she had dreamed of most and it came over her that this was the one which fortune might have been keeping she never held back  do you live here all alone she asked of olive  i shouldnt if you would come and live with me  even this really passionate rejoinder failed to make verena shrink she thought it so possible that in the wealthy class people made each other such easy proposals it was a part of the romance the luxury of wealth it belonged to the world of invitations in which she had had so little share but it seemed almost a mockery when she thought of the little house in cambridge where the boards were loose in the steps of the porch  i must stay with my father and mother she said and then i have my work you know thats the way i must live now  your work olive repeated not quite understanding  my gift said verena smiling  oh yes you must use it thats what i mean you must move the world with it its divine  it was so much what she meant that she had lain awake all night thinking of it and the substance of her thought was that if she could only rescue the girl from the danger of vulgar exploitation could only constitute herself her protectress and devotee the two between them might achieve the great result verenas genius was a mystery and it might remain a mystery it was impossible to see how this charming blooming simple creature all youth and grace and innocence got her extraordinary powers of reflexion when her gift was not in exercise she appeared anything but reflective and as she sat there now for instance you would never have dreamed that she had had a vivid revelation olive had to content herself provisionally with saying that her precious faculty had come to her just as her beauty and distinction to olive she was full of that quality had come it had dropped straight from heaven without filtering through her parents whom miss chancellor decidedly did not fancy even among reformers she discriminated she thought all wise people wanted great changes but the votaries of change were not necessarily wise she remained silent a little after her last remark and then she repeated again as if it were the solution of everything as if it represented with absolute certainty some immense happiness in the futurewe must wait we must wait verena was perfectly willing to wait though she did not exactly know what they were to wait for and the aspiring frankness of her assent shone out of her face and seemed to pacify their mutual gaze olive asked her innumerable questions she wanted to enter into her life it was one of those talks which people remember afterwards in which every word has been given and taken and in which they see the signs of a beginning that was to be justified the more olive learnt of her visitors life the more she wanted to enter into it the more it took her out of herself such strange lives are led in america she always knew that but this was queerer than anything she had dreamed of and the queerest part was that the girl herself didnt appear to think it queer she had been nursed in darkened rooms and suckled in the midst of manifestations she had begun to attend lectures as she said when she was quite an infant because her mother had no one to leave her with at home she had sat on the knees of somnambulists and had been passed from hand to hand by trancespeakers she was familiar with every kind of cure and had grown up among ladyeditors of newspapers advocating new religions and people who disapproved of the marriagetie verena talked of the marriagetie as she would have talked of the last novelas if she had heard it as frequently discussed and at certain times listening to the answers she made to her questions olive chancellor closed her eyes in the manner of a person waiting till giddiness passed her young friends revelations actually gave her a vertigo they made her perceive everything from which she should have rescued her verena was perfectly uncontaminated and she would never be touched by evil but though olive had no views about the marriagetie except that she should hate it for herselfthat particular reform she did not propose to considershe didnt like the atmosphere of circles in which such institutions were called into question she had no wish now to enter into an examination of that particular one nevertheless to make sure she would just ask verena whether she disapproved of it  well i must say said miss tarrant i prefer free unions  olive held her breath an instant such an idea was so disagreeable to her then for all answer she murmured irresolutely i wish you would let me help you yet it seemed at the same time that verena needed little help for it was more and more clear that her eloquence when she stood up that way before a roomful of people was literally inspiration she answered all her friends questions with a goodnature which evidently took no pains to make things plausible an effort to oblige not to please but after all she could give very little account of herself this was very visible when olive asked her where she had got her intense realisation of the suffering of women for her address at miss birdseyes showed that she too like olive herself had had that vision in the watches of the night verena thought a moment as if to understand what her companion referred to and then she inquired always smiling where joan of arc had got her idea of the suffering of france this was so prettily said that olive could scarcely keep from kissing her she looked at the moment as if like joan she might have had visits from the saints olive of course remembered afterwards that it had not literally answered the question and she also reflected on something that made an answer seem more difficultthe fact that the girl had grown up among ladydoctors ladymediums ladyeditors ladypreachers ladyhealers women who having rescued themselves from a passive existence could illustrate only partially the misery of the sex at large it was true that they might have illustrated it by their talk by all they had been through and all they could tell a younger sister but olive was sure that verenas prophetic impulse had not been stirred by the chatter of women miss chancellor knew that sound as well as any one it had proceeded rather out of their silence she said to her visitor that whether or no the angels came down to her in glittering armour she struck her as the only person she had yet encountered who had exactly the same tenderness the same pity for women that she herself had miss birdseye had something of it but miss birdseye wanted passion wanted keenness was capable of the weakest concessions mrs farrinder was not weak of course and she brought a great intellect to the matter but she was not personal enoughshe was too abstract verena was not abstract she seemed to have lived in imagination through all the ages verena said she did think she had a certain amount of imagination she supposed she couldnt be so effective on the platform if she hadnt a rich fancy then olive said to her taking her hand again that she wanted her to assure her of thisthat it was the only thing in all the world she cared for the redemption of women the thing she hoped under providence to give her life to verena flushed a little at this appeal and the deeper glow of her eyes was the first sign of exaltation she had offered oh yesi want to give my life she exclaimed with a vibrating voice and then she added gravely i want to do something great  you will you will we both will olive chancellor cried in rapture but after a little she went on i wonder if you know what it means young and lovely as you aregiving your life  verena looked down for a moment in meditation  well she replied i guess i have thought more than i appear  do you understand german do you know faust said olive entsagen sollst du sollst entsagen  i dont know german i should like so to study it i want to know everything  we will work at it togetherwe will study everything olive almost panted and while she spoke the peaceful picture hung before her of still winter evenings under the lamp with falling snow outside and tea on a little table and successful renderings with a chosen companion of goethe almost the only foreign author she cared about for she hated the writing of the french in spite of the importance they have given to women such a vision as this was the highest indulgence she could offer herself she had it only at considerable intervals it seemed as if verena caught a glimpse of it too for her face kindled still more and she said she should like that ever so much at the same time she asked the meaning of the german words  thou shalt renounce refrain abstain thats the way bayard taylor has translated them olive answered  oh well i guess i can abstain verena exclaimed with a laugh and she got up rather quickly as if by taking leave she might give a proof of what she meant olive put out her hands to hold her and at this moment one of the portières of the room was pushed aside while a gentleman was ushered in by miss chancellors little parlourmaid     xii   verena recognised him she had seen him the night before at miss birdseyes and she said to her hostess now i must goyou have got another caller it was verenas belief that in the fashionable world like mrs farrinder she thought miss chancellor belonged to itthought that in standing there she herself was in itin the highest social walks it was the custom of a prior guest to depart when another friend arrived she had been told at peoples doors that she could not be received because the lady of the house had a visitor and she had retired on these occasions with a feeling of awe much more than a sense of injury they had not been the portals of fashion but in this respect she deemed they had emulated such bulwarks olive chancellor offered basil ransom a greeting which she believed to be consummately ladylike and which the young man narrating the scene several months later to mrs luna whose susceptibilities he did not feel himself obliged to consider she considered his so little described by saying that she glared at him olive had thought it very possible he would come that day if he was to leave boston though she was perfectly mindful that she had given him no encouragement at the moment they separated if he should not come she should be annoyed and if he should come she should be furious she was also sufficiently mindful of that but she had a foreboding that of the two grievances fortune would confer upon her only the less the only one she had as yet was that he had responded to her lettera complaint rather wanting in richness if he came at any rate he would be likely to come shortly before dinner at the same hour as yesterday he had now anticipated this period considerably and it seemed to miss chancellor that he had taken a base advantage of her stolen a march upon her privacy she was startled disconcerted but as i have said she was rigorously ladylike she was determined not again to be fantastic as she had been about his coming to miss birdseyes the strange dread associating itself with that was something which she devoutly trusted she had felt once for all she didnt know what he could do to her he hadnt prevented on the spot though he was one of the happiest things that had befallen her for so longthis quick confident visit of verena tarrant it was only just at the last that he had come in and verena must go now olives detaining hand immediately relaxed itself  it is to be feared there was no disguise of ransoms satisfaction at finding himself once more face to face with the charming creature with whom he had exchanged that final speechless smile the evening before he was more glad to see her than if she had been an old friend for it seemed to him that she had suddenly become a new one the delightful girl he said to himself she smiles at me as if she liked me he could not know that this was fatuous that she smiled so at every one the first time she saw people she treated them as if she recognised them moreover she did not seat herself again in his honour she let it be seen that she was still going the three stood there together in the middle of the long characteristic room and for the first time in her life olive chancellor chose not to introduce two persons who met under her roof she hated europe but she could be european if it were necessary neither of her companions had an idea that in leaving them simply planted face to face the terror of the american heart she had so high a warrant and presently basil ransom felt that he didnt care whether he were introduced or not for the greatness of an evil didnt matter if the remedy were equally great  miss tarrant wont be surprised if i recognise herif i take the liberty to speak to her she is a public character she must pay the penalty of her distinction these words he boldly addressed to the girl with his most gallant southern manner saying to himself meanwhile that she was prettier still by daylight  oh a great many gentlemen have spoken to me verena said there were quite a number at topeka and her phrase lost itself in her look at olive as if she were wondering what was the matter with her  now i am afraid you are going the very moment i appear ransom went on do you know thats very cruel to me i know what your ideas areyou expressed them last night in such beautiful language of course you convinced me i am ashamed of being a man but i am and i cant help it and ill do penance any way you may prescribe must she go miss olive he asked of his cousin do you flee before the individual male and he turned to verena  this young lady gave a laugh that resembled speech in liquid fusion oh no i like the individual  as an incarnation of a movement ransom thought her more and more singular and he wondered how she came to be closeted so soon with his kinswoman to whom only a few hours before she had been a complete stranger these however were doubtless the normal proceedings of women he begged her to sit down again he was sure miss chancellor would be sorry to part with her verena looking at her friend not for permission but for sympathy dropped again into a chair and ransom waited to see miss chancellor do the same she gratified him after a moment because she could not refuse without appearing to put a hurt upon verena but it went hard with her and she was altogether discomposed she had never seen any one so free in her own drawingroom as this loud southerner to whom she had so rashly offered a footing he extended invitations to her guests under her nose that verena should do as he asked her was a signal sign of the absence of that homeculture it was so that miss chancellor expressed the missing quality which she never supposed the girl possessed fortunately as it would be supplied to her in abundance in charles street olive of course held that homeculture was perfectly compatible with the widest emancipation it was with a perfectly good conscience that verena complied with basil ransoms request but it took her quick sensibility only a moment to discover that her friend was not pleased she scarcely knew what had ruffled her but at the same instant there passed before her the vision of the anxieties of this sudden unexplained sort for instance and much worse which intimate relations with miss chancellor might entail  now i want you to tell me this basil ransom said leaning forward towards verena with his hands on his knees and completely oblivious to his hostess do you really believe all that pretty moonshine you talked last night i could have listened to you for another hour but i never heard such monstrous sentiments i must protesti must as a calumniated misrepresented man confess you meant it as a kind of reductio ad absurduma satire on mrs farrinder he spoke in a tone of the freest pleasantry with his familiar friendly southern cadence  verena looked at him with eyes that grew large why you dont mean to say you dont believe in our cause  oh it wont doit wont do ransom went on laughing you are on the wrong tack altogether do you really take the ground that your sex has been without influence influence why you have led us all by the nose to where we are now wherever we are its all you you are at the bottom of everything  oh yes and we want to be at the top said verena  ah the bottom is a better place depend on it when from there you move the whole mass besides you are on the top as well you are everywhere you are everything i am of the opinion of that historical characterwasnt he some kingwho thought there was a lady behind everything whatever it was he held you have only to look for her she is the explanation well i always look for her and i always find her of course i am always delighted to do so but it proves she is the universal cause now you dont mean to deny that power the power of setting men in motion you are at the bottom of all the wars  well i am like mrs farrinder i like opposition verena exclaimed with a happy smile  that proves as i say how in spite of your expressions of horror you delight in the shock of battle what do you say to helen of troy and the fearful carnage she excited it is well known that the empress of france was at the bottom of the last war in that country and as for our four fearful years of slaughter of course you wont deny that there the ladies were the great motive power the abolitionists brought it on and were not the abolitionists principally females who was that celebrity that was mentioned last nighteliza p moseley i regard eliza as the cause of the biggest war of which history preserves the record  basil ransom enjoyed his humour the more because verena appeared to enjoy it and the look with which she replied to him at the end of this little tirade why sir you ought to take the platform too we might go round together as poison and antidotethis made him feel that he had convinced her for the moment quite as much as it was important he should in verenas face however it lasted but an instantan instant after she had glanced at olive chancellor who with her eyes fixed intently on the ground a look she was to learn to know so well had a strange expression the girl slowly got up she felt that she must go she guessed miss chancellor didnt like this handsome joker it was so that basil ransom struck her and it was impressed upon her in time as she thought that her new friend would be more serious even than she about the womanquestion serious as she had hitherto believed herself to be  i should like so much to have the pleasure of seeing you again ransom continued i think i should be able to interpret history for you by a new light  well i should be very happy to see you in my home these words had barely fallen from verenas lips her mother told her they were in general the proper thing to say when people expressed such a desire as that she must not let it be assumed that she would come first to themshe had hardly uttered this hospitable speech when she felt the hand of her hostess upon her arm and became aware that a passionate appeal sat in olives eyes  you will just catch the charles street car that young woman murmured with muffled sweetness  verena did not understand further than to see that she ought already to have departed and the simplest response was to kiss miss chancellor an act which she briefly performed basil ransom understood still less and it was a melancholy commentary on his contention that men are not inferior that this meeting could not come however rapidly to a close without his plunging into a blunder which necessarily aggravated those he had already made he had been invited by the little prophetess and yet he had not been invited but he did not take that up because he must absolutely leave boston on the morrow and besides miss chancellor appeared to have something to say to it but he put out his hand to verena and said goodbye miss tarrant are we not to have the pleasure of hearing you in new york i am afraid we are sadly sunk  certainly i should like to raise my voice in the biggest city the girl replied  well try to come on i wont refute you it would be a very stupid world after all if we always knew what women were going to say  verena was conscious of the approach of the charles street car as well as of the fact that miss chancellor was in pain but she lingered long enough to remark that she could see he had the oldfashioned ideashe regarded woman as the toy of man  dont say the toysay the joy ransom exclaimed there is one statement i will venture to advance i am quite as fond of you as you are of each other  much he knows about that said verena with a sidelong smile at olive chancellor  for olive it made her more beautiful than ever still there was no trace of this mere personal elation in the splendid sententiousness with which turning to mr ransom she remarked what women may be or may not be to each other i wont attempt just now to say but what the truth may be to a human soul i think perhaps even a woman may faintly suspect  the truth my dear cousin your truth is a most vain thing  gracious me cried verena tarrant and the gay vibration of her voice as she uttered this simple ejaculation was the last that ransom heard of her miss chancellor swept her out of the room leaving the young man to extract a relish from the ineffable irony with which she uttered the words even a woman it was to be supposed on general grounds that she would reappear but there was nothing in the glance she gave him as she turned her back that was an earnest of this he stood there a moment wondering then his wonder spent itself on the page of a book which according to his habit at such times he had mechanically taken up and in which he speedily became interested he read it for five minutes in an uncomfortablelooking attitude and quite forgot that he had been forsaken he was recalled to this fact by the entrance of mrs luna arrayed as if for the street and putting on her gloves againshe seemed always to be putting on her gloves she wanted to know what in the world he was doing there alonewhether her sister had not been notified  oh yes said ransom she has just been with me but she has gone downstairs with miss tarrant  and who in the world is miss tarrant  ransom was surprised that mrs luna should not know of the intimacy of the two young ladies in spite of the brevity of their acquaintance being already so great but apparently miss olive had not mentioned her new friend well she is an inspirational speakerthe most charming creature in the world  mrs luna paused in her manipulations gave an amazed amused stare then caused the room to ring with her laughter you dont mean to say you are convertedalready  converted to miss tarrant decidedly  you are not to belong to any miss tarrant you are to belong to me mrs luna said having thought over her southern kinsman during the twentyfour hours and made up her mind that he would be a good man for a lone woman to know then she added did you come here to meet herthe inspirational speaker  no i came to bid your sister goodbye  are you really going i havent made you promise half the things i want yet but we will settle that in new york how do you get on with olive chancellor mrs luna continued making her points as she always did with eagerness though her roundness and her dimples had hitherto prevented her from being accused of that vice it was her practice to speak of her sister by her whole name and you would have supposed from her usual manner of alluding to her that olive was much the older instead of having been born ten years later than adeline she had as many ways as possible of marking the gulf that divided them but she bridged it over lightly now by saying to basil ransom isnt she a dear old thing  this bridge he saw would not bear his weight and her question seemed to him to have more audacity than sense why should she be so insincere she might know that a man couldnt recognise miss chancellor in such a description as that she was not oldshe was sharply young and it was inconceivable to him though he had just seen the little prophetess kiss her that she should ever become any ones dear least of all was she a thing she was intensely fearfully a person he hesitated a moment and then he replied shes a very remarkable woman  take caredont be reckless cried mrs luna do you think she is very dreadful  dont say anything against my cousin basil answered and at that moment miss chancellor reentered the room she murmured some request that he would excuse her absence but her sister interrupted her with an inquiry about miss tarrant  mr ransom thinks her wonderfully charming why didnt you show her to me do you want to keep her all to yourself  olive rested her eyes for some moments upon mrs luna without speaking then she said your veil is not put on straight adeline  i look like a monsterthat evidently is what you mean adeline exclaimed going to the mirror to rearrange the peccant tissue  miss chancellor did not again ask ransom to be seated she appeared to take it for granted that he would leave her now but instead of this he returned to the subject of verena he asked her whether she supposed the girl would come out in publicwould go about like mrs farrinder  come out in public olive repeated in public why you dont imagine that pure voice is to be hushed  oh hushed no its too sweet for that but not raised to a scream not forced and cracked and ruined she oughtnt to become like the others she ought to remain apart  apartapart said miss chancellor when we shall all be looking to her gathering about her praying for her there was an exceeding scorn in her voice if i can help her she shall be an immense power for good  an immense power for quackery my dear miss olive this broke from basils lips in spite of a vow he had just taken not to say anything that should aggravate his hostess who was in a state of tension it was not difficult to detect but he had lowered his tone to friendly pleading and the offensive word was mitigated by his smile  she moved away from him backwards as if he had given her a push ah well now you are reckless mrs luna remarked drawing out her ribbons before the mirror  i dont think you would interfere if you knew how little you understand us miss chancellor said to ransom  whom do you mean by usyour whole delightful sex i dont understand you miss olive  come away with me and ill explain her as we go mrs luna went on having finished her toilet  ransom offered his hand in farewell to his hostess but olive found it impossible to do anything but ignore the gesture she could not have let him touch her well then if you must exhibit her to the multitude bring her on to new york he said with the same attempt at a light treatment  youll have me in new yorkyou dont want any one else mrs luna ejaculated coquettishly i have made up my mind to winter there now  olive chancellor looked from one to the other of her two relatives one near and the other distant but each so little in sympathy with her and it came over her that there might be a kind of protection for her in binding them together entangling them with each other she had never had an idea of that kind in her life before and that this sudden subtlety should have gleamed upon her as a momentary talisman gives the measure of her present nervousness  if i could take her to new york i would take her farther she remarked hoping she was enigmatical  you talk about taking her as if you were a lectureagent are you going into that business mrs luna asked  ransom could not help noticing that miss chancellor would not shake hands with him and he felt on the whole rather injured he paused a moment before leaving the roomstanding there with his hand on the knob of the door look here miss olive what did you write to me to come and see you for he made this inquiry with a countenance not destitute of gaiety but his eyes showed something of that yellow lightjust momentarily luridof which mention has been made mrs luna was on her way downstairs and her companions remained face to face  ask my sisteri think she will tell you said olive turning away from him and going to the window she remained there looking out she heard the door of the house close and saw the two cross the street together as they passed out of sight her fingers played softly a little air upon the pane it seemed to her that she had had an inspiration  basil ransom meanwhile put the question to mrs luna if she was not going to like me why in the world did she write to me  because she wanted you to know meshe thought i would like you and apparently she had not been wrong for mrs luna when they reached beacon street would not hear of his leaving her to go her way alone would not in the least admit his plea that he had only an hour or two more in boston he was to travel economically by the boat and must devote the time to his business she appealed to his southern chivalry and not in vain practically at least he admitted the rights of women     xiii   mrs tarrant was delighted as may be imagined with her daughters account of miss chancellors interior and the reception the girl had found there and verena for the next month took her way very often to charles street just you be as nice to her as you know how mrs tarrant had said to her and she reflected with some complacency that her daughter did knowshe knew how to do everything of that sort it was not that verena had been taught that branch of the education of young ladies which is known as manners and deportment had not figured as a definite head in miss tarrants curriculum she had been told indeed that she must not lie nor steal but she had been told very little else about behaviour her only great advantage in short had been the parental example but her mother liked to think that she was quick and graceful and she questioned her exhaustively as to the progress of this interesting episode she didnt see why as she said it shouldnt be a permanent standby for verena in mrs tarrants meditations upon the girls future she had never thought of a fine marriage as a reward of effort she would have deemed herself very immoral if she had endeavoured to capture for her child a rich husband she had not in fact a very vivid sense of the existence of such agents of fate all the rich men she had seen already had wives and the unmarried men who were generally very young were distinguished from each other not so much by the figure of their income which came little into question as by the degree of their interest in regenerating ideas she supposed verena would marry some one some day and she hoped the personage would be connected with public lifewhich meant for mrs tarrant that his name would be visible in the lamplight on a coloured poster in the doorway of tremont temple but she was not eager about this vision for the implications of matrimony were for the most part wanting in brightnessconsisted of a tired woman holding a baby over a furnaceregister that emitted lukewarm air a real lovely friendship with a young woman who had as mrs tarrant expressed it propty would occupy agreeably such an interval as might occur before verena should meet her sterner fate it would be a great thing for her to have a place to run into when she wanted a change and there was no knowing but what it might end in her having two homes for the idea of the home like most american women of her quality mrs tarrant had an extreme reverence and it was her candid faith that in all the vicissitudes of the past twenty years she had preserved the spirit of this institution if it should exist in duplicate for verena the girl would be favoured indeed  all this was as nothing however compared with the fact that miss chancellor seemed to think her young friends gift was inspirational or at any rate as selah had so often said quite unique she couldnt make out very exactly by verena what she thought but if the way miss chancellor had taken hold of her didnt show that she believed she could rouse the people mrs tarrant didnt know what it showed it was a satisfaction to her that verena evidently responded freely she didnt think anything of what she spent in cartickets and indeed she had told her that miss chancellor wanted to stuff her pockets with them at first she went in because her mother liked to have her but now evidently she went because she was so much drawn she expressed the highest admiration of her new friend she said it took her a little while to see into her but now that she did well she was perfectly splendid when verena wanted to admire she went ahead of every one and it was delightful to see how she was stimulated by the young lady in charles street they thought everything of each otherthat was very plain you could scarcely tell which thought most each thought the other so noble and mrs tarrant had a faith that between them they would rouse the people what verena wanted was some one who would know how to handle her her father hadnt handled anything except the healing up to this time with real success and perhaps miss chancellor would take hold better than some that made more of a profession  its beautiful the way she draws you out verena had said to her mother theres something so searching that the first time i visited her it quite realised my idea of the day of judgement but she seems to show all thats in herself at the same time and then you see how lovely it is shes just as pure as she can live you see if she is not when you know her shes so noble herself that she makes you feel as if you wouldnt want to be less so she doesnt care for anything but the elevation of our sex if she can work a little toward that its all she asks i can tell you she kindles me she does mother really she doesnt care a speck what she wearsonly to have an elegant parlour well she has got that its a regular dreamlike place to sit shes going to have a tree in next week she says she wants to see me sitting under a tree i believe its some oriental idea it has lately been introduced in paris she doesnt like french ideas as a general thing but she says this has more nature than most she has got so many of her own that i shouldnt think she would require to borrow any id sit in a forest to hear her bring some of them out verena went on with characteristic raciness she just quivers when she describes what our sex has been through its so interesting to me to hear what i have always felt if she wasnt afraid of facing the public she would go far ahead of me but she doesnt want to speak herself she only wants to call me out mother if she doesnt attract attention to me there isnt any attention to be attracted she says i have got the gift of expressionit doesnt matter where it comes from she says its a great advantage to a movement to be personified in a bright young figure well of course im young and i feel bright enough when once i get started she says my serenity while exposed to the gaze of hundreds is in itself a qualification in fact she seems to think my serenity is quite godgiven she hasnt got much of it herself shes the most emotional woman i have met up to now she wants to know how i can speak the way i do unless i feel and of course i tell her i do feel so far as i realise she seems to be realising all the time i never saw any one that took so little rest she says i ought to do something great and she makes me feel as if i should she says i ought to have a wide influence if i can obtain the ear of the public and i say to her that if i do it will be all her influence  selah tarrant looked at all this from a higher standpoint than his wife at least such an attitude on his part was to be inferred from his increased solemnity he committed himself to no precipitate elation at the idea of his daughters being taken up by a patroness of movements who happened to have money he looked at his child only from the point of view of the service she might render to humanity to keep her ideal pointing in the right direction to guide and animate her moral lifethis was a duty more imperative for a parent so closely identified with revelations and panaceas than seeing that she formed profitable worldly connexions he was off moreover so much of the time that he could keep little account of her comings and goings and he had an air of being but vaguely aware of whom miss chancellor the object now of his wifes perpetual reference might be verenas initial appearance in boston as he called her performance at miss birdseyes had been a great success and this reflexion added as i say to his habitually sacerdotal expression he looked like the priest of a religion that was passing through the stage of miracles he carried his responsibility in the general elongation of his person of his gestures his hands were now always in the air as if he were being photographed in postures of his words and sentences as well as in his smile as noiseless as a patent hinge and in the folds of his eternal waterproof he was incapable of giving an offhand answer or opinion on the simplest occasion and his tone of high deliberation increased in proportion as the subject was trivial or domestic if his wife asked him at dinner if the potatoes were good he replied that they were strikingly fine he used to speak of the newspaper as finehe applied this term to objects the most dissimilar and embarked on a parallel worthy of plutarch in which he compared them with other specimens of the same vegetable he produced or would have liked to produce the impression of looking above and beyond everything of not caring for the immediate of reckoning only with the long run in reality he had one allabsorbing solicitudethe desire to get paragraphs put into the newspapers paragraphs of which he had hitherto been the subject but of which he was now to divide the glory with his daughter the newspapers were his world the richest expression in his eyes of human life and for him if a diviner day was to come upon earth it would be brought about by copious advertisement in the daily prints he looked with longing for the moment when verena should be advertised among the personals and to his mind the supremely happy people were those and there were a good many of them of whom there was some journalistic mention every day in the year nothing less than this would really have satisfied selah tarrant his ideal of bliss was to be as regularly and indispensably a component part of the newspaper as the title and date or the list of fires or the column of western jokes the vision of that publicity haunted his dreams and he would gladly have sacrificed to it the innermost sanctities of home human existence to him indeed was a huge publicity in which the only fault was that it was sometimes not sufficiently effective there had been a spiritualist paper of old which he used to pervade but he could not persuade himself that through this medium his personality had attracted general attention and moreover the sheet as he said was played out anyway success was not success so long as his daughters physique the rumour of her engagement were not included in the jottings with the certainty of being extensively copied  the account of her exploits in the west had not made their way to the seaboard with the promptitude that he had looked for the reason of this being he supposed that the few addresses she had made had not been lectures announced in advance to which tickets had been sold but incidents of abrupt occurrence of certain multitudinous meetings where there had been other performers better known to fame they had brought in no money they had been delivered only for the good of the cause if it could only be known that she spoke for nothing that might deepen the reverberation the only trouble was that her speaking for nothing was not the way to remind him that he had a remunerative daughter it was not the way to stand out so very much either selah tarrant felt for there were plenty of others that knew how to make as little money as she would to speakthat was the one thing that most people were willing to do for nothing it was not a line in which it was easy to appear conspicuously disinterested disinterestedness too was incompatible with receipts and receipts were what selah tarrant was in his own parlance after he wished to bring about the day when they would flow in freely the reader perhaps sees the gesture with which in his colloquies with himself he accompanied this mental image  it seemed to him at present that the fruitful time was not far off it had been brought appreciably nearer by that fortunate evening at miss birdseyes if mrs farrinder could be induced to write an open letter about verena that would do more than anything else selah was not remarkable for delicacy of perception but he knew the world he lived in well enough to be aware that mrs farrinder was liable to rear up as they used to say down in pennsylvania where he lived before he began to peddle leadpencils she wouldnt always take things as you might expect and if it didnt meet her views to pay a public tribute to verena there wasnt any way known to tarrants ingenious mind of getting round her if it was a question of a favour from mrs farrinder you just had to wait for it as you would for a rise in the thermometer he had told miss birdseye what he would like and she seemed to think from the way their celebrated friend had been affected that the idea might take her some day of just letting the public know all she had felt she was off somewhere now since that evening but miss birdseye had an idea that when she was back in roxbury she would send for verena and give her a few points meanwhile at any rate selah was sure he had a card he felt there was money in the air it might already be said there were receipts from charles street that rich peculiar young woman seemed to want to lavish herself he pretended as i have intimated not to notice this but he never saw so much as when he had his eyes fixed on the cornice he had no doubt that if he should make up his mind to take a hall some night she would tell him where the bill might be sent that was what he was thinking of now whether he had better take a hall right away so that verena might leap at a bound into renown or wait till she had made a few more appearances in private so that curiosity might be worked up  these meditations accompanied him in his multifarious wanderings through the streets and the suburbs of the new england capital as i have also mentioned he was absent for hourslong periods during which mrs tarrant sustaining nature with a hardboiled egg and a doughnut wondered how in the world he stayed his stomach he never wanted anything but a piece of pie when he came in the only thing about which he was particular was that it should be served up hot she had a private conviction that he partook at the houses of his lady patients of little lunches she applied this term to any episodical repast at any hour of the twentyfour it is but fair to add that once when she betrayed her suspicion selah remarked that the only refreshment he ever wanted was the sense that he was doing some good this effort with him had many forms it involved among other things a perpetual perambulation of the streets a haunting of horsecars railwaystations shops that were selling off but the places that knew him best were the offices of the newspapers and the vestibules of the hotelsthe big marblepaved chambers of informal reunion which offer to the streets through high glass plates the sight of the american citizen suspended by his heels here amid the piledup luggage the convenient spittoons the elbowing loungers the disconsolate guests the truculent irish porters the rows of shaggybacked men in strange hats writing letters at a table inlaid with advertisements selah tarrant made innumerable contemplative stations he could not have told you at any particular moment what he was doing he only had a general sense that such places were national nervecentres and that the more one looked in the more one was on the spot the penetralia of the daily press were however still more fascinating and the fact that they were less accessible that here he found barriers in his path only added to the zest of forcing an entrance he abounded in pretexts he even sometimes brought contributions he was persistent and penetrating he was known as the irrepressible tarrant he hung about sat too long took up the time of busy people edged into the printingrooms when he had been eliminated from the office talked with the compositors till they set up his remarks by mistake and to the newsboys when the compositors had turned their backs he was always trying to find out what was going in he would have liked to go in himself bodily and failing in this he hoped to get advertisements inserted gratis the wish of his soul was that he might be interviewed that made him hover at the editorial elbow once he thought he had been and the headings five or six deep danced for days before his eyes but the report never appeared he expected his revenge for this the day after verena should have burst forth he saw the attitude in which he should receive the emissaries who would come after his daughter     xiv   we ought to have some one to meet her mrs tarrant said i presume she wouldnt care to come out just to see us she between the mother and the daughter at this period could refer only to olive chancellor who was discussed in the little house at cambridge at all hours and from every possible point of view it was never verena now who began for she had grown rather weary of the topic she had her own ways of thinking of it which were not her mothers and if she lent herself to this ladys extensive considerations it was because that was the best way of keeping her thoughts to herself  mrs tarrant had an idea that she mrs tarrant liked to study people and that she was now engaged in an analysis of miss chancellor it carried her far and she came out at unexpected times with her results it was still her purpose to interpret the world to the ingenious mind of her daughter and she translated miss chancellor with a confidence which made little account of the fact that she had seen her but once while verena had this advantage nearly every day verena felt that by this time she knew olive very well and her mothers most complicated versions of motive and temperament mrs tarrant with the most imperfect idea of the meaning of the term was always talking about peoples temperament rendered small justice to the phenomena it was now her privilege to observe in charles street olive was much more remarkable than mrs tarrant suspected remarkable as mrs tarrant believed her to be she had opened verenas eyes to extraordinary pictures made the girl believe that she had a heavenly mission given her as we have seen quite a new measure of the interest of life these were larger consequences than the possibility of meeting the leaders of society at olives house she had met no one as yet but mrs luna her new friend seemed to wish to keep her quite for herself this was the only reproach that mrs tarrant directed to the new friend as yet she was disappointed that verena had not obtained more insight into the world of fashion it was one of the prime articles of her faith that the world of fashion was wicked and hollow and moreover verena told her that miss chancellor loathed and despised it she could not have informed you wherein it would profit her daughter for the way those ladies shrank from any new gospel was notorious nevertheless she was vexed that verena shouldnt come back to her with a little more of the fragrance of beacon street the girl herself would have been the most interested person in the world if she had not been the most resigned she took all that was given her and was grateful and missed nothing that was withheld she was the most extraordinary mixture of eagerness and docility mrs tarrant theorised about temperaments and she loved her daughter but she was only vaguely aware of the fact that she had at her side the sweetest flower of character as one might say that had ever bloomed on earth she was proud of verenas brightness and of her special talent but the commonness of her own surface was a nonconductor of the girls quality therefore she thought that it would add to her success in life to know a few highflyers if only to put them to shame as if anything could add to verenas success as if it were not supreme success simply to have been made as she was made  mrs tarrant had gone into town to call upon miss chancellor she carried out this resolve on which she had bestowed infinite consideration independently of verena she had decided that she had a pretext her dignity required one for she felt that at present the antique pride of the greenstreets was terribly at the mercy of her curiosity she wished to see miss chancellor again and to see her among her charming appurtenances which verena had described to her with great minuteness the pretext that she would have valued most was wantingthat of olives having come out to cambridge to pay the visit that had been solicited from the first so she had to take the next bestshe had to say to herself that it was her duty to see what she should think of a place where her daughter spent so much time to miss chancellor she would appear to have come to thank her for her hospitality she knew in advance just the air she should take or she fancied she knew itmrs tarrants were not always what she supposed just the nuance she had also an impression she knew a little french of her tone olive after the lapse of weeks still showed no symptoms of presenting herself and mrs tarrant rebuked verena with some sternness for not having made her feel that this attention was due to the mother of her friend verena could scarcely say to her she guessed miss chancellor didnt think much of that personage true as it was that the girl had discerned this angular fact which she attributed to olives extraordinary comprehensiveness of view verena herself did not suppose that her mother occupied a very important place in the universe and miss chancellor never looked at anything smaller than that nor was she free to report she was certainly now less frank at home and moreover the suspicion was only just becoming distinct to her that olive would like to detach her from her parents altogether and was therefore not interested in appearing to cultivate relations with them mrs tarrant i may mention had a further motive she was consumed with the desire to behold mrs luna this circumstance may operate as a proof that the aridity of her life was great and if it should have that effect i shall not be able to gainsay it she had seen all the people who went to lectures but there were hours when she desired for a change to see some who didnt go and mrs luna from verenas description of her summed up the characteristics of this eccentric class  verena had given great attention to olives brilliant sister she had told her friend everything noweverything but one little secret namely that if she could have chosen at the beginning she would have liked to resemble mrs luna this lady fascinated her carried off her imagination to strange lands she should enjoy so much a long evening with her alone when she might ask her ten thousand questions but she never saw her alone never saw her at all but in glimpses adeline flitted in and out dressed for dinners and concerts always saying something worldly to the young woman from cambridge and something to olive that had a freedom which she herself would probably never arrive at a failure of foresight on verenas part but miss chancellor never detained her never gave verena a chance to see her never appeared to imagine that she could have the least interest in such a person only took up the subject again after adeline had left themthe subject of course which was always the same the subject of what they should do together for their suffering sex it was not that verena was not interested in thatgracious no it opened up before her in those wonderful colloquies with olive in the most inspiring way but her fancy would make a dart to right or left when other game crossed their path and her companion led her intellectually a dance in which her feetthat is her headfailed her at times for weariness mrs tarrant found miss chancellor at home but she was not gratified by even the most transient glimpse of mrs luna a fact which in her heart verena regarded as fortunate inasmuch as she said to herself if her mother returning from charles street began to explain miss chancellor to her with fresh energy and as if she verena had never seen her and up to this time they had had nothing to say about her to what developments of the same sort would not an encounter with adeline have given rise  when verena at last said to her friend that she thought she ought to come out to cambridgeshe didnt understand why she didntolive expressed her reasons very frankly admitted that she was jealous that she didnt wish to think of the girls belonging to any one but herself mr and mrs tarrant would have authority opposed claims and she didnt wish to see them to remember that they existed this was true so far as it went but olive could not tell verena everythingcould not tell her that she hated that dreadful pair at cambridge as we know she had forbidden herself this emotion as regards individuals and she flattered herself that she considered the tarrants as a type a deplorable one a class that with the public at large discredited the cause of the new truths she had talked them over with miss birdseye olive was always looking after her now and giving her thingsthe good lady appeared at this period in wonderful caps and shawlsfor she felt she couldnt thank her enough and even doctor prances fellowlodger whose animosity to flourishing evils lived in the happiest though the most illicit union with the mania for finding excuses even miss birdseye was obliged to confess that if you came to examine his record poor selah didnt amount to so very much how little he amounted to olive perceived after she had made verena talk as the girl did immensely about her father and motherquite unconscious meanwhile of the conclusions she suggested to miss chancellor tarrant was a moralist without moral sensethat was very clear to olive as she listened to the history of his daughters childhood and youth which verena related with an extraordinary artless vividness this narrative tremendously fascinating to miss chancellor made her feel in all sorts of waysprompted her to ask herself whether the girl was also destitute of the perception of right and wrong no she was only supremely innocent she didnt understand she didnt interpret nor see the portée of what she described she had no idea whatever of judging her parents olive had wished to realise the conditions in which her wonderful young friend she thought her more wonderful every day had developed and to this end as i have related she prompted her to infinite discourse but now she was satisfied the realisation was complete and what she would have liked to impose on the girl was an effectual rupture with her past that past she by no means absolutely deplored for it had the merit of having initiated verena and her patroness through her agency into the miseries and mysteries of the people it was her theory that verena in spite of the blood of the greenstreets and after all who were they was a flower of the great democracy and that it was impossible to have had an origin less distinguished than tarrant himself his birth in some unheardof place in pennsylvania was quite inexpressibly low and olive would have been much disappointed if it had been wanting in this defect she liked to think that verena in her childhood had known almost the extremity of poverty and there was a kind of ferocity in the joy with which she reflected that there had been moments when this delicate creature came near if the pinch had only lasted a little longer to literally going without food these things added to her value for olive they made that young lady feel that their common undertaking would in consequence be so much more serious it is always supposed that revolutionists have been goaded and the goading would have been rather deficient here were it not for such happy accidents in verenas past when she conveyed from her mother a summons to cambridge for a particular occasion olive perceived that the great effort must now be made great efforts were nothing new to herit was a great effort to live at allbut this one appeared to her exceptionally cruel she determined however to make it promising herself that her first visit to mrs tarrant should also be her last her only consolation was that she expected to suffer intensely for the prospect of suffering was always spiritually speaking so much cash in her pocket it was arranged that olive should come to tea the repast that selah designated as his supper when mrs tarrant as we have seen desired to do her honour by inviting another guest this guest after much deliberation between that lady and verena was selected and the first person olive saw on entering the little parlour in cambridge was a young man with hair prematurely or as one felt that one should say precociously white whom she had a vague impression she had encountered before and who was introduced to her as mr matthias pardon  she suffered less than she had hopedshe was so taken up with the consideration of verenas interior it was as bad as she could have desired desired in order to feel that to take her out of such a milieu as that she should have a right to draw her altogether to herself olive wished more and more to extract some definite pledge from her she could hardly say what it had best be as yet she only felt that it must be something that would have an absolute sanctity for verena and would bind them together for life on this occasion it seemed to shape itself in her mind she began to see what it ought to be though she also saw that she would perhaps have to wait awhile mrs tarrant too in her own house became now a complete figure there was no manner of doubt left as to her being vulgar olive chancellor despised vulgarity had a scent for it which she followed up in her own family so that often with a rising flush she detected the taint even in adeline there were times indeed when every one seemed to have it every one but miss birdseye who had nothing to do with itshe was an antique and the poorest humblest people the toilers and spinners the very obscure these were the only persons who were safe from it miss chancellor would have been much happier if the movements she was interested in could have been carried on only by the people she liked and if revolutions somehow didnt always have to begin with ones selfwith internal convulsions sacrifices executions a common end unfortunately however fine as regards a special result does not make community impersonal  mrs tarrant with her soft corpulence looked to her guest very bleached and tumid her complexion had a kind of withered glaze her hair very scanty was drawn off her forehead à la chinoise she had no eyebrows and her eyes seemed to stare like those of a figure of wax when she talked and wished to insist and she was always insisting she puckered and distorted her face with an effort to express the inexpressible which turned out after all to be nothing she had a kind of doleful elegance tried to be confidential lowered her voice and looked as if she wished to establish a secret understanding in order to ask her visitor if she would venture on an applefritter she wore a flowing mantle which resembled her husbands waterproofa garment which when she turned to her daughter or talked about her might have passed for the robe of a sort of priestess of maternity she endeavoured to keep the conversation in a channel which would enable her to ask sudden incoherent questions of olive mainly as to whether she knew the principal ladies the expression was mrs tarrants not only in boston but in the other cities which in her nomadic course she herself had visited olive knew some of them and of some of them had never heard but she was irritated and pretended a universal ignorance she was conscious that she had never told so many fibs by which her hostess was much disconcerted although her questions had apparently been questions pure and simple leading nowhither and without bearings on any new truth     xv   tarrant however kept an eye in that direction he was solemnly civil to miss chancellor handed her the dishes at table over and over again and ventured to intimate that the applefritters were very fine but save for this alluded to nothing more trivial than the regeneration of humanity and the strong hope he felt that miss birdseye would again have one of her delightful gatherings with regard to this latter point he explained that it was not in order that he might again present his daughter to the company but simply because on such occasions there was a valuable interchange of hopeful thought a contact of mind with mind if verena had anything suggestive to contribute to the social problem the opportunity would comethat was part of their faith they couldnt reach out for it and try and push their way if they were wanted their hour would strike if they were not they would just keep still and let others press forward who seemed to be called if they were called they would know it and if they werent they could just hold on to each other as they had always done tarrant was very fond of alternatives and he mentioned several others it was never his fault if his listeners failed to think him impartial they hadnt much as miss chancellor could see she could tell by their manner of life that they hadnt raked in the dollars but they had faith that whether one raised ones voice or simply worked on in silence the principal difficulties would straighten themselves out and they had also a considerable experience of great questions tarrant spoke as if as a family they were prepared to take charge of them on moderate terms he always said maam in speaking to olive to whom moreover the air had never been so filled with the sound of her own name it was always in her ear save when mrs tarrant and verena conversed in prolonged and ingenuous asides this was still for her benefit but the pronoun sufficed them she had wished to judge doctor tarrant not that she believed he had come honestly by his title to make up her mind she had done these things now and she expressed to herself the kind of man she believed him to be in reflecting that if she should offer him ten thousand dollars to renounce all claim to verena keepinghe and his wifeclear of her for the rest of time he would probably say with his fearful smile make it twenty money down and ill do it some image of this transaction as one of the possibilities of the future outlined itself for olive among the moral incisions of that evening it seemed implied in the very place the bald bareness of tarrants temporary lair a wooden cottage with a rough front yard a little naked piazza which seemed rather to expose than to protect facing upon an unpaved road in which the footway was overlaid with a strip of planks these planks were embedded in ice or in liquid thaw according to the momentary mood of the weather and the advancing pedestrian traversed them in the attitude and with a good deal of the suspense of a ropedancer there was nothing in the house to speak of nothing to olives sense but a smell of kerosene though she had a consciousness of sitting down somewherethe object creaked and rocked beneath herand of the table at tea being covered with a cloth stamped in bright colours  as regards the pecuniary transaction with selah it was strange how she should have seen it through the conviction that verena would never give up her parents olive was sure that she would never turn her back upon them would always share with them she would have despised her had she thought her capable of another course yet it baffled her to understand why when parents were so trashy this natural law should not be suspended such a question brought her back however to her perpetual enigma the mystery she had already turned over in her mind for hours togetherthe wonder of such people being verenas progenitors at all she had explained it as we explain all exceptional things by making the part as the french say of the miraculous she had come to consider the girl as a wonder of wonders to hold that no human origin however congruous it might superficially appear would sufficiently account for her that her springing up between selah and his wife was an exquisite whim of the creative force and that in such a case a few shades more or less of the inexplicable didnt matter it was notorious that great beauties great geniuses great characters take their own times and places for coming into the world leaving the gaping spectators to make them fit in and holding from faroff ancestors or even perhaps straight from the divine generosity much more than from their ugly or stupid progenitors they were incalculable phenomena anyway as selah would have said verena for olive was the very type and model of the gifted being her qualities had not been bought and paid for they were like some brilliant birthdaypresent left at the door by an unknown messenger to be delightful for ever as an inexhaustible legacy and amusing for ever from the obscurity of its source they were superabundantly crude as yethappily for olive who promised herself as we know to train and polish thembut they were as genuine as fruit and flowers as the glow of the fire or the plash of water for her scrutinising friend verena had the disposition of the artist the spirit to which all charming forms come easily and naturally it required an effort at first to imagine an artist so untaught so mistaught so poor in experience but then it required an effort also to imagine people like the old tarrants or a life so full as her life had been of ugly things only an exquisite creature could have resisted such associations only a girl who had some natural light some divine spark of taste there were people like that fresh from the hand of omnipotence they were far from common but their existence was as incontestable as it was beneficent  tarrants talk about his daughter her prospects her enthusiasm was terribly painful to olive it brought back to her what she had suffered already from the idea that he laid his hands upon her to make her speak that he should be mixed up in any way with this exercise of her genius was a great injury to the cause and olive had already determined that in future verena should dispense with his cooperation the girl had virtually confessed that she lent herself to it only because it gave him pleasure and that anything else would do as well anything that would make her quiet a little before she began to give out olive took upon herself to believe that she could make her quiet though certainly she had never had that effect upon any one she would mount the platform with verena if necessary and lay her hands upon her head why in the world had a perverse fate decreed that tarrant should take an interest in the affairs of womanas if she wanted his aid to arrive at her goal a charlatan of the poor lean shabby sort without the humour brilliancy prestige which sometimes throw a drapery over shallowness mr pardon evidently took an interest as well and there was something in his appearance that seemed to say that his sympathy would not be dangerous he was much at his ease plainly beneath the roof of the tarrants and olive reflected that though verena had told her much about him she had not given her the idea that he was as intimate as that what she had mainly said was that he sometimes took her to the theatre olive could enter to a certain extent into that she herself had had a phase some time after her fathers deathher mothers had preceded hiswhen she bought the little house in charles street and began to live alone during which she accompanied gentlemen to respectable places of amusement she was accordingly not shocked at the idea of such adventures on verenas part than which indeed judging from her own experience nothing could well have been less adventurous her recollections of these expeditions were as of something solemn and edifyingof the earnest interest in her welfare exhibited by her companion there were few occasions on which the young bostonian appeared to more advantage of the comfort of other friends sitting near who were sure to know whom she was with of serious discussion between the acts in regard to the behaviour of the characters in the piece and of the speech at the end with which as the young man quitted her at her door she rewarded his civilityi must thank you for a very pleasant evening she always felt that she made that too prim her lips stiffened themselves as she spoke but the whole affair had always a primness this was discernible even to olives very limited sense of humour it was not so religious as going to eveningservice at kings chapel but it was the next thing to it of course all girls didnt do it there were families that viewed such a custom with disfavour but this was where the girls were of the romping sort there had to be some things they were known not to do as a general thing moreover the practice was confined to the decorous it was a sign of culture and quiet tastes all this made it innocent for verena whose life had exposed her to much worse dangers but the thing referred itself in olives mind to a danger which cast a perpetual shadow therethe possibility of the girls embarking with some ingenuous youth on an expedition that would last much longer than an evening she was haunted in a word with the fear that verena would marry a fate to which she was altogether unprepared to surrender her and this made her look with suspicion upon all male acquaintance  mr pardon was not the only one she knew she had an example of the rest in the persons of two young harvard lawstudents who presented themselves after tea on this same occasion as they sat there olive wondered whether verena had kept something from her whether she were after all like so many other girls in cambridge a collegebelle an object of frequentation to undergraduates it was natural that at the seat of a big university there should be girls like that with students dangling after them but she didnt want verena to be one of them there were some that received the seniors and juniors others that were accessible to sophomores and freshmen certain young ladies distinguished the professional students there was a group even that was on the best terms with the young men who were studying for the unitarian ministry in that queer little barrack at the end of divinity avenue the advent of the new visitors made mrs tarrant bustle immensely but after she had caused every one to change places two or three times with every one else the company subsided into a circle which was occasionally broken by wandering movements on the part of her husband who in the absence of anything to say on any subject whatever placed himself at different points in listening attitudes shaking his head slowly up and down and gazing at the carpet with an air of supernatural attention mrs tarrant asked the young men from the law school about their studies and whether they meant to follow them up seriously said she thought some of the laws were very unjust and she hoped they meant to try and improve them she had suffered by the laws herself at the time her father died she hadnt got half the propty she should have got if they had been different she thought they should be for public matters not for peoples private affairs the idea always seemed to her to keep you down if you were down and to hedge you in with difficulties sometimes she thought it was a wonder how she had developed in the face of so many but it was a proof that freedom was everywhere if you only knew how to look for it  the two young men were in the best humour they greeted these sallies with a merriment of which though it was courteous in form olive was by no means unable to define the spirit they talked naturally more with verena than with her mother and while they were so engaged mrs tarrant explained to her who they were and how one of them the smaller who was not quite so spruce had brought the other his particular friend to introduce him this friend mr burrage was from new york he was very fashionable he went out a great deal in boston i have no doubt you know some of the places said mrs tarrant his famly was very rich  well he knows plenty of that sort mrs tarrant went on but he felt unsatisfied he didnt know any one like us he told mr gracie thats the little one that he felt as if he must it seemed as if he couldnt hold out so we told mr gracie of course to bring him right round well i hope hell get something from us im sure he has been reported to be engaged to miss winkworth i have no doubt you know who i mean but mr gracie says he hasnt looked at her more than twice thats the way rumours fly round in that set i presume well i am glad we are not in it wherever we are mr gracie is very different he is intensely plain but i believe he is very learned you dont think him plain oh you dont know well i suppose you dont care you must see so many but i must say when a young man looks like that i call him painfully plain i heard doctor tarrant make the remark the last time he was here i dont say but what the plainest are the best well i had no idea we were going to have a party when i asked you i wonder whether verena hadnt better hand the cake we generally find the students enjoy it so much  this office was ultimately delegated to selah who after a considerable absence reappeared with a dish of dainties which he presented successively to each member of the company olive saw verena lavish her smiles on mr gracie and mr burrage the liveliest relation had established itself and the latter gentleman in especial abounded in appreciative laughter it might have been fancied just from looking at the group that verenas vocation was to smile and talk with young men who bent towards her might have been fancied that is by a person less sure of the contrary than olive who had reason to know that a gifted being is sent into the world for a very different purpose and that making the time pass pleasantly for conceited young men is the last duty you are bound to think of if you happen to have a talent for embodying a cause olive tried to be glad that her friend had the richness of nature that makes a woman gracious without latent purposes she reflected that verena was not in the smallest degree a flirt that she was only enchantingly and universally genial that nature had given her a beautiful smile which fell impartially on every one man and woman alike olive may have been right but it shall be confided to the reader that in reality she never knew by any sense of her own whether verena were a flirt or not this young lady could not possibly have told her even if she herself knew which she didnt and olive destitute of the quality had no means of taking the measure in another of the subtle feminine desire to please she could see the difference between mr gracie and mr burrage her being bored by mrs tarrants attempting to point it out is perhaps a proof of that it was a curious incident of her zeal for the regeneration of her sex that manly things were perhaps on the whole what she understood best mr burrage was rather a handsome youth with a laughing clever face a certain sumptuosity of apparel an air of belonging to the fast seta precocious goodnatured man of the world curious of new sensations and containing perhaps the making of a dilettante being doubtless a little ambitious and liking to flatter himself that he appreciated worth in lowly forms he had associated himself with the ruder but at the same time acuter personality of a genuine son of new england who had a harder head than his own and a humour in reality more cynical and who having earlier knowledge of the tarrants had undertaken to show him something indigenous and curious possibly even fascinating mr gracie was short with a big head he wore eyeglasses looked unkempt almost rustic and said good things with his ugly lips verena had replies for a good many of them and a pretty colour came into her face as she talked olive could see that she produced herself quite as well as one of these gentlemen had foretold the other that she would miss chancellor knew what had passed between them as well as if she had heard it mr gracie had promised that he would lead her on that she should justify his description and prove the raciest of her class they would laugh about her as they went away lighting their cigars and for many days afterwards their discourse would be enlivened with quotations from the womens rights girl  it was amazing how many ways men had of being antipathetic these two were very different from basil ransom and different from each other and yet the manner of each conveyed an insult to ones womanhood the worst of the case was that verena would be sure not to perceive this outragenot to dislike them in consequence there were so many things that she hadnt yet learned to dislike in spite of her friends earnest efforts to teach her she had the idea vividly that was the marvel of the cruelty of man of his immemorial injustice but it remained abstract platonic she didnt detest him in consequence what was the use of her having that sharp inspired vision of the history of the sex it was as she had said herself exactly like joan of arcs absolutely supernatural apprehension of the state of france if she wasnt going to carry it out if she was going to behave as the ordinary pusillanimous conventional young lady it was all very well for her to have said that first day that she would renounce did she look at such a moment as this like a young woman who had renounced suppose this glittering laughing burrage youth with his chains and rings and shining shoes should fall in love with her and try to bribe her with his great possessions to practise renunciations of another kindto give up her holy work and to go with him to new york there to live as his wife partly bullied partly pampered in the accustomed burrage manner there was as little comfort for olive as there had been on the whole alarm in the recollection of that offhand speech of verenas about her preference for free unions this had been mere maiden flippancy she had not known the meaning of what she said though she had grown up among people who took for granted all sorts of queer laxities she had kept the consummate innocence of the american girl that innocence which was the greatest of all for it had survived the abolition of walls and locks and of the various remarks that had dropped from verena expressing this quality that startling observation certainly expressed it most it implied at any rate that unions of some kind or other had her approval and did not exclude the dangers that might arise from encounters with young men in search of sensations     xvi   mr pardon as olive observed was a little out of this combination but he was not a person to allow himself to droop he came and seated himself by miss chancellor and broached a literary subject he asked her if she were following any of the current serials in the magazines on her telling him that she never followed anything of that sort he undertook a defence of the serial system which she presently reminded him that she had not attacked he was not discouraged by this retort but glided gracefully off to the question of mount desert conversation on some subject or other being evidently a necessity of his nature he talked very quickly and softly with words and even sentences imperfectly formed there was a certain amiable flatness in his tone and he abounded in exclamationsgoodness gracious and mercy on usnot much in use among the sex whose profanity is apt to be coarse he had small fair features remarkably neat and pretty eyes and a moustache that he caressed and an air of juvenility much at variance with his grizzled locks and the free familiar reference in which he was apt to indulge to his career as a journalist his friends knew that in spite of his delicacy and his prattle he was what they called a live man his appearance was perfectly reconcilable with a large degree of literary enterprise it should be explained that for the most part they attached to this idea the same meaning as selah tarranta state of intimacy with the newspapers the cultivation of the great arts of publicity for this ingenuous son of his age all distinction between the person and the artist had ceased to exist the writer was personal the person food for newsboys and everything and every one were every ones business all things with him referred themselves to print and print meant simply infinite reporting a promptitude of announcement abusive when necessary or even when not about his fellowcitizens he poured contumely on their private life on their personal appearance with the best conscience in the world his faith again was the faith of selah tarrantthat being in the newspapers is a condition of bliss and that it would be fastidious to question the terms of the privilege he was an enfant de la balle as the french say he had begun his career at the age of fourteen by going the rounds of the hotels to cull flowers from the big greasy registers which lie on the marble counters and he might flatter himself that he had contributed in his measure and on behalf of a vigilant public opinion the pride of a democratic state to the great end of preventing the american citizen from attempting clandestine journeys since then he had ascended other steps of the same ladder he was the most brilliant young interviewer on the boston press he was particularly successful in drawing out the ladies he had condensed into shorthand many of the most celebrated women of his timesome of these daughters of fame were very voluminousand he was supposed to have a remarkably insinuating way of waiting upon prime donne and actresses the morning after their arrival or sometimes the very evening while their luggage was being brought up he was only twentyeight years old and with his hoary head was a thoroughly modern young man he had no idea of not taking advantage of all the modern conveniences he regarded the mission of mankind upon earth as a perpetual evolution of telegrams everything to him was very much the same he had no sense of proportion or quality but the newest thing was what came nearest exciting in his mind the sentiment of respect he was an object of extreme admiration to selah tarrant who believed that he had mastered all the secrets of success and who when mrs tarrant remarked as she had done more than once that it looked as if mr pardon was really coming after verena declared that if he was he was one of the few young men he should want to see in that connexion one of the few he should be willing to allow to handle her it was tarrants conviction that if matthias pardon should seek verena in marriage it would be with a view to producing her in public and the advantage for the girl of having a husband who was at the same time reporter interviewer manager agent who had the command of the principal dailies would write her up and work her as it were scientificallythe attraction of all this was too obvious to be insisted on matthias had a mean opinion of tarrant thought him quite secondrate a votary of playedout causes it was his impression that he himself was in love with verena but his passion was not a jealous one and included a remarkable disposition to share the object of his affection with the american people  he talked some time to olive about mount desert told her that in his letters he had described the company at the different hotels he remarked however that a correspondent suffered a good deal today from the competition of the ladywriters the sort of article they produced was sometimes more acceptable to the papers he supposed she would be glad to hear thathe knew she was so interested in womans having a free field they certainly made lovely correspondents they picked up something bright before you could turn round there wasnt much you could keep away from them you had to be lively if you wanted to get there first of course they were naturally more chatty and that was the style of literature that seemed to take most today only they didnt write much but what ladies would want to read of course he knew there were millions of ladyreaders but he intimated that he didnt address himself exclusively to the gynecæum he tried to put in something that would interest all parties if you read a ladys letter you knew pretty well in advance what you would find now what he tried for was that you shouldnt have the least idea he always tried to have something that would make you jump mr pardon was not conceited more at least than is proper when youth and success go hand in hand and it was natural he should not know in what spirit miss chancellor listened to him being aware that she was a woman of culture his desire was simply to supply her with the pabulum that she would expect she thought him very inferior she had heard he was intensely bright but there was probably some mistake there couldnt be any danger for verena from a mind that took merely a gossips view of great tendencies besides he wasnt half educated and it was her belief or at least her hope that an educative process was now going on for verena under her own direction which would enable her to make such a discovery for herself olive had a standing quarrel with the levity the goodnature of the judgements of the day many of them seemed to her weak to imbecility losing sight of all measures and standards lavishing superlatives delighted to be fooled the age seemed to her relaxed and demoralised and i believe she looked to the influx of the great feminine element to make it feel and speak more sharply  well its a privilege to hear you two talk together mrs tarrant said to her its what i call real conversation it isnt often we have anything so fresh it makes me feel as if i wanted to join in i scarcely know whom to listen to most verena seems to be having such a time with those gentlemen first i catch one thing and then another it seems as if i couldnt take it all in perhaps i ought to pay more attention to mr burrage i dont want him to think we are not so cordial as they are in new york  she decided to draw nearer to the trio on the other side of the room for she had perceived as she devoutly hoped miss chancellor had not that verena was endeavouring to persuade either of her companions to go and talk to her dear friend and that these unscrupulous young men after a glance over their shoulder appeared to plead for remission to intimate that this was not what they had come round for selah wandered out of the room again with his collection of cakes and mr pardon began to talk to olive about verena to say that he felt as if he couldnt say all he did feel with regard to the interest she had shown in her olive could not imagine why he was called upon to say or to feel anything and she gave him short answers while the poor young man unconscious of his doom remarked that he hoped she wasnt going to exercise any influence that would prevent miss tarrant from taking the rank that belonged to her he thought there was too much hanging back he wanted to see her in a front seat he wanted to see her name in the biggest kind of bills and her portrait in the windows of the stores she had genius there was no doubt of that and she would take a new line altogether she had charm and there was a great demand for that nowadays in connexion with new ideas there were so many that seemed to have fallen dead for want of it she ought to be carried straight ahead she ought to walk right up to the top there was a want of bold action he didnt see what they were waiting for he didnt suppose they were waiting till she was fifty years old there were old ones enough in the field he knew that miss chancellor appreciated the advantage of her girlhood because miss verena had told him so her father was dreadfully slack and the winter was ebbing away mr pardon went so far as to say that if dr tarrant didnt see his way to do something he should feel as if he should want to take hold himself he expressed a hope at the same time that olive had not any views that would lead her to bring her influence to bear to make miss verena hold back also that she wouldnt consider that he pressed in too much he knew that was a charge that people brought against newspapermenthat they were rather apt to cross the line he only worried because he thought those who were no doubt nearer to miss verena than he could hope to be were not sufficiently alive he knew that she had appeared in two or three parlours since that evening at miss birdseyes and he had heard of the delightful occasion at miss chancellors own house where so many of the first families had been invited to meet her this was an allusion to a small luncheonparty that olive had given when verena discoursed to a dozen matrons and spinsters selected by her hostess with infinite consideration and many spiritual scruples a report of the affair presumably from the hand of the young matthias who naturally had not been present appeared with extraordinary promptness in an eveningpaper that was very well so far as it went but he wanted something on another scale something so big that people would have to go round if they wanted to get past then lowering his voice a little he mentioned what it was a lecture in the music hall at fifty cents a ticket without her father right there on her own basis he lowered his voice still more and revealed to miss chancellor his innermost thought having first assured himself that selah was still absent and that mrs tarrant was inquiring of mr burrage whether he visited much on the new land the truth was miss verena wanted to shed her father altogether she didnt want him pawing round her that way before she began it didnt add in the least to the attraction mr pardon expressed the conviction that miss chancellor agreed with him in this and it required a great effort of mind on olives part so small was her desire to act in concert with mr pardon to admit to herself that she did she asked him with a certain lofty coldnesshe didnt make her shy now a bitwhether he took a great interest in the improvement of the position of women the question appeared to strike the young man as abrupt and irrelevant to come down on him from a height with which he was not accustomed to hold intercourse he was used to quick operations however and he had only a moment of bright blankness before replying  oh there is nothing i wouldnt do for the ladies just give me a chance and youll see  olive was silent a moment what i mean isis your sympathy a sympathy with our sex or a particular interest in miss tarrant  well sympathy is just sympathythats all i can say it takes in miss verena and it takes in all othersexcept the ladycorrespondents the young man added with a jocosity which as he perceived even at the moment was lost on verenas friend he was not more successful when he went on it takes in even you miss chancellor  olive rose to her feet hesitating she wanted to go away and yet she couldnt bear to leave verena to be exploited as she felt that she would be after her departure that indeed she had already been by those offensive young men she had a strange sense too that her friend had neglected her for the last halfhour had not been occupied with her had placed a barrier between thema barrier of broad male backs of laughter that verged upon coarseness of glancing smiles directed across the room directed to olive which seemed rather to disconnect her with what was going forward on that side than to invite her to take part in it if verena recognised that miss chancellor was not in report as her father said when jocose young men ruled the scene the discovery implied no great penetration but the poor girl might have reflected further that to see it taken for granted that she was unadapted for such company could scarcely be more agreeable to olive than to be dragged into it this young ladys worst apprehensions were now justified by mrs tarrants crying to her that she must not go as mr burrage and mr gracie were trying to persuade verena to give them a little specimen of inspirational speaking and she was sure her daughter would comply in a moment if miss chancellor would just tell her to compose herself they had got to own up to it miss chancellor could do more with her than any one else but mr gracie and mr burrage had excited her so that she was afraid it would be rather an unsuccessful effort the whole group had got up and verena came to olive with her hands outstretched and no signs of a bad conscience in her bright face  i know you like me to speak so muchill try to say something if you want me to but im afraid there are not enough people i cant do much with a small audience  i wish we had brought some of our friendsthey would have been delighted to come if we had given them a chance said mr burrage there is an immense desire throughout the university to hear you and there is no such sympathetic audience as an audience of harvard men gracie and i are only two but gracie is a host in himself and i am sure he will say as much of me the young man spoke these words freely and lightly smiling at verena and even a little at olive with the air of one to whom a mastery of clever chaff was commonly attributed  mr burrage listens even better than he talks his companion declared we have the habit of attention at lectures you know to be lectured by you would be an advantage indeed we are sunk in ignorance and prejudice  ah my prejudices burrage went on if you could see themi assure you they are something monstrous  give them a regular ducking and make them gasp matthias pardon cried if you want an opportunity to act on harvard college nows your chance these gentlemen will carry the news it will be the narrow end of the wedge  i cant tell what you like verena said still looking into olives eyes  im sure miss chancellor likes everything here mrs tarrant remarked with a noble confidence  selah had reappeared by this time his lofty contemplative person was framed by the doorway want to try a little inspiration he inquired looking round on the circle with an encouraging inflexion  ill do it alone if you prefer verena said soothingly to her friend it might be a good chance to try without father  you dont mean to say you aint going to be supported mrs tarrant exclaimed with dismay  ah i beseech you give us the whole programmedont omit any leading feature mr burrage was heard to plead  my only interest is to draw her out said selah defending his integrity i will drop right out if i dont seem to vitalise i have no desire to draw attention to my own poor gifts this declaration appeared to be addressed to miss chancellor  well there will be more inspiration if you dont touch her matthias pardon said to him it will seem to come right down fromwell wherever it does come from  yes we dont pretend to say that mrs tarrant murmured  this little discussion had brought the blood to olives face she felt that every one present was looking at herverena most of alland that here was a chance to take a more complete possession of the girl such chances were agitating moreover she didnt like on any occasion to be so prominent but everything that had been said was benighted and vulgar the place seemed thick with the very atmosphere out of which she wished to lift verena they were treating her as a show as a social resource and the two young men from the college were laughing at her shamelessly she was not meant for that and olive would save her verena was so simple she couldnt see herself she was the only pure spirit in the odious group  i want you to address audiences that are worth addressingto convince people who are serious and sincere olive herself as she spoke heard the great shake in her voice your mission is not to exhibit yourself as a pastime for individuals but to touch the heart of communities of nations  dear madam im sure miss tarrant will touch my heart mr burrage objected gallantly  well i dont know but she judges you young men fairly said mrs tarrant with a sigh  verena diverted a moment from her communion with her friend considered mr burrage with a smile i dont believe you have got any heart and i shouldnt care much if you had  you have no idea how much the way you say that increases my desire to hear you speak  do as you please my dear said olive almost inaudibly my carriage must be therei must leave you in any case  i can see you dont want it said verena wondering you would stay if you liked it wouldnt you  i dont know what i should do come out with me olive spoke almost with fierceness  well youll send them away no better than they came said matthias pardon  i guess you had better come round some other night selah suggested pacifically but with a significance which fell upon olives ear  mr gracie seemed inclined to make the sturdiest protest look here miss tarrant do you want to save harvard college or do you not he demanded with a humorous frown  i didnt know you were harvard college verena returned as humorously  i am afraid you are rather disappointed in your evening if you expected to obtain some insight into our ideas said mrs tarrant with an air of impotent sympathy to mr gracie  well goodnight miss chancellor she went on i hope youve got a warm wrap i suppose youll think we go a good deal by what you say in this house well most people dont object to that theres a little hole right there in the porch it seems as if doctor tarrant couldnt remember to go for the man to fix it i am afraid youll think were too much taken up with all these new hopes well we have enjoyed seeing you in our home it quite raises my appetite for social intercourse did you come out on wheels i cant stand a sleigh myself it makes me sick  this was her hostesss response to miss chancellors very summary farewell uttered as the three ladies proceeded together to the door of the house olive had got herself out of the little parlour with a sort of blind defiant dash she had taken no perceptible leave of the rest of the company when she was calm she had very good manners but when she was agitated she was guilty of lapses every one of which came back to her magnified in the watches of the night sometimes they excited remorse and sometimes triumph in the latter case she felt that she could not have been so justly vindictive in cold blood tarrant wished to guide her down the steps out of the little yard to her carriage he reminded her that they had had ashes sprinkled on the planks on purpose but she begged him to let her alone she almost pushed him back she drew verena out into the dark freshness closing the door of the house behind her there was a splendid sky all blueblack and silvera sparkling wintry vault where the stars were like a myriad points of ice the air was silent and sharp and the vague snow looked cruel olive knew now very definitely what the promise was that she wanted verena to make but it was too cold she could keep her there bareheaded but an instant mrs tarrant meanwhile in the parlour remarked that it seemed as if she couldnt trust verena with her own parents and selah intimated that with a proper invitation his daughter would be very happy to address harvard college at large mr burrage and mr gracie said they would invite her on the spot in the name of the university and matthias pardon reflected and asserted with glee that this would be the newest thing yet but he added that they would have a high time with miss chancellor first and this was evidently the conviction of the company  i can see you are angry at something verena said to olive as the two stood there in the starlight i hope it isnt me what have i done  i am not angryi am anxious i am so afraid i shall lose you verena dont fail medont fail me olive spoke low with a kind of passion  fail you how can i fail  you cant of course you cant your star is above you but dont listen to them  to whom do you mean olive to my parents  oh no not your parents miss chancellor replied with some sharpness she paused a moment and then she said i dont care for your parents i have told you that before but now that i have seen themas they wished as you wished and i didnti dont care for them i must repeat it verena i should be dishonest if i let you think i did  why olive chancellor verena murmured as if she were trying in spite of the sadness produced by this declaration to do justice to her friends impartiality  yes i am hard perhaps i am cruel but we must be hard if we wish to triumph dont listen to young men when they try to mock and muddle you they dont care for you they dont care for us they care only for their pleasure for what they believe to be the right of the stronger the stronger i am not so sure  some of them care so muchare supposed to care too muchfor us verena said with a smile that looked dim in the darkness  yes if we will give up everything i have asked you beforeare you prepared to give up  do you mean to give you up  no all our wretched sistersall our hopes and purposesall that we think sacred and worth living for  oh they dont want that olive verenas smile became more distinct and she added they dont want so much as that  well then go in and speak for themand sing for themand dance for them  olive you are cruel  yes i am but promise me one thing and i shall beoh so tender  what a strange place for promises said verena with a shiver looking about her into the night  yes i am dreadful i know it but promise and olive drew the girl nearer to her flinging over her with one hand the fold of a cloak that hung ample upon her own meagre person and holding her there with the other while she looked at her suppliant but half hesitating promise she repeated  is it something terrible  never to listen to one of them never to be bribed  at this moment the housedoor was opened again and the light of the hall projected itself across the little piazza matthias pardon stood in the aperture and tarrant and his wife with the two other visitors appeared to have come forward as well to see what detained verena  you seem to have started a kind of lecture out here mr pardon said you ladies had better look out or youll freeze together  verena was reminded by her mother that she would catch her death but she had already heard sharply low as they were spoken five last words from olive who now abruptly released her and passed swiftly over the path from the porch to her waiting carriage tarrant creaked along in pursuit to assist miss chancellor the others drew verena into the house promise me not to marrythat was what echoed in her startled mind and repeated itself there when mr burrage returned to the charge asking her if she wouldnt at least appoint some evening when they might listen to her she knew that olives injunction ought not to have surprised her she had already felt it in the air she would have said at any time if she had been asked that she didnt suppose miss chancellor would want her to marry but the idea uttered as her friend had uttered it had a new solemnity and the effect of that quick violent colloquy was to make her nervous and impatient as if she had had a sudden glimpse of futurity that was rather awful even if it represented the fate one would like  when the two young men from the college pressed their petition she asked with a laugh that surprised them whether they wished to mock and muddle her they went away assenting to mrs tarrants last remark i am afraid youll feel that you dont quite understand us yet matthias pardon remained her father and mother expressing their perfect confidence that he would excuse them went to bed and left him sitting there he stayed a good while longer nearly an hour and said things that made verena think that he perhaps would like to marry her but while she listened to him more abstractedly than her custom was she remarked to herself that there could be no difficulty in promising olive so far as he was concerned he was very pleasant and he knew an immense deal about everything or rather about every one and he would take her right into the midst of life but she didnt wish to marry him all the same and after he had gone she reflected that once she came to think of it she didnt want to marry any one so it would be easy after all to make olive that promise and it would give her so much pleasure     xvii   the next time verena saw olive she said to her that she was ready to make the promise she had asked the other night but to her great surprise this young woman answered her by a question intended to check such rashness miss chancellor raised a warning finger she had an air of dissuasion almost as solemn as her former pressure her passionate impatience appeared to have given way to other considerations to be replaced by the resignation that comes with deeper reflexion it was tinged in this case indeed by such bitterness as might be permitted to a young lady who cultivated the brightness of a great faith  dont you want any promise at present verena asked why olive how you change  my dear child you are so youngso strangely young i am a thousand years old i have lived through generationsthrough centuries i know what i know by experience you know it by imagination that is consistent with your being the fresh bright creature that you are i am constantly forgetting the difference between usthat you are a mere child as yet though a child destined for great things i forgot it the other night but i have remembered it since you must pass through a certain phase and it would be very wrong in me to pretend to suppress it that is all clear to me now i see it was my jealousy that spokemy restless hungry jealousy i have far too much of that i oughtnt to give any one the right to say that its a womans quality i dont want your signature i only want your confidenceonly what springs from that i hope with all my soul that you wont marry but if you dont it must not be because you have promised me you know what i thinkthat there is something noble done when one makes a sacrifice for a great good priestswhen they were real priestsnever married and what you and i dream of doing demands of us a kind of priesthood it seems to me very poor when friendship and faith and charity and the most interesting occupation in the worldwhen such a combination as this doesnt seem by itself enough to live for no man that i have ever seen cares a straw in his heart for what we are trying to accomplish they hate it they scorn it they will try to stamp it out whenever they can oh yes i know there are men who pretend to care for it but they are not really men and i wouldnt be sure even of them any man that one would look atwith him as a matter of course it is war upon us to the knife i dont mean to say there are not some male beings who are willing to patronise us a little to pat us on the back and recommend a few moderate concessions to say that there are two or three little points in which society has not been quite just to us but any man who pretends to accept our programme in toto as you and i understand it of his own free will before he is forced tosuch a person simply schemes to betray us there are gentlemen in plenty who would be glad to stop your mouth by kissing you if you become dangerous some day to their selfishness to their vested interests to their immoralityas i pray heaven every day my dear friend that you mayit will be a grand thing for one of them if he can persuade you that he loves you then you will see what he will do with you and how far his love will take him it would be a sad day for you and for me and for all of us if you were to believe something of that kind you see i am very calm now i have thought it all out  verena had listened with earnest eyes why olive you are quite a speaker yourself she exclaimed you would far surpass me if you would let yourself go  miss chancellor shook her head with a melancholy that was not devoid of sweetness i can speak to you but that is no proof the very stones of the streetall the dumb things of naturemight find a voice to talk to you i have no facility i am awkward and embarrassed and dry when this young lady after a struggle with the winds and waves of emotion emerged into the quiet stream of a certain high reasonableness she presented her most graceful aspect she had a tone of softness and sympathy a gentle dignity a serenity of wisdom which sealed the appreciation of those who knew her well enough to like her and which always impressed verena as something almost august such moods however were not often revealed to the public at large they belonged to miss chancellors very private life one of them had possession of her at present and she went on to explain the inconsequence which had puzzled her friend with the same quiet clearness the detachment from error of a woman whose selfscrutiny has been as sharp as her deflexion  dont think me capricious if i say i would rather trust you without a pledge i owe you i owe every one an apology for my rudeness and fierceness at your mothers it came over mejust seeing those young menhow exposed you are and the idea made me for the moment frantic i see your danger still but i see other things too and i have recovered my balance you must be safe verenayou must be saved but your safety must not come from your having tied your hands it must come from the growth of your perception from your seeing things of yourself sincerely and with conviction in the light in which i see them from your feeling that for your work your freedom is essential and that there is no freedom for you and me save in religiously not doing what you will often be asked to doand i never miss chancellor brought out these last words with a proud jerk which was not without its pathos dont promise dont promise she went on i would far rather you didnt but dont fail medont fail me or i shall die  her manner of repairing her inconsistency was altogether feminine she wished to extract a certainty at the same time that she wished to deprecate a pledge and she would have been delighted to put verena into the enjoyment of that freedom which was so important for her by preventing her exercising it in a particular direction the girl was now completely under her influence she had latent curiosities and distractionsleft to herself she was not always thinking of the unhappiness of women but the touch of olives tone worked a spell and she found something to which at least a portion of her nature turned with eagerness in her companions wider knowledge her elevation of view miss chancellor was historic and philosophic or at any rate she appeared so to verena who felt that through such an association one might at last intellectually command all life and there was a simpler impulse verena wished to please her if only because she had such a dread of displeasing her olives displeasures disappointments disapprovals were tragic truly memorable she grew white under them not shedding many tears as a general thing like inferior women she cried when she was angry not when she was hurt but limping and panting morally as if she had received a wound that she would carry for life on the other hand her commendations her satisfactions were as soft as a west wind and she had this sign the rarest of all of generosity that she liked obligations of gratitude when they were not laid upon her by men then indeed she scarcely recognised them she considered men in general as so much in the debt of the opposite sex that any individual woman had an unlimited credit with them she could not possibly overdraw the general feminine account the unexpected temperance of her speech on this subject of verenas accessibility to matrimonial error seemed to the girl to have an antique beauty a wisdom purged of worldly elements it reminded her of qualities that she believed to have been proper to electra or antigone this made her wish the more to do something that would gratify olive and in spite of her friends dissuasion she declared that she should like to promise i will promise at any rate not to marry any of those gentlemen that were at the house she said those seemed to be the ones you were principally afraid of  you will promise not to marry any one you dont like said olive that would be a great comfort  but i do like mr burrage and mr gracie  and mr matthias pardon what a name  well he knows how to make himself agreeable he can tell you everything you want to know  you mean everything you dont well if you like every one i havent the least objection it would only be preferences that i should find alarming i am not the least afraid of your marrying a repulsive man your danger would come from an attractive one  im glad to hear you admit that some are attractive verena exclaimed with the light laugh which her reverence for miss chancellor had not yet quenched it sometimes seems as if there werent any you could like  i can imagine a man i should like very much olive replied after a moment but i dont like those i see they seem to me poor creatures and indeed her uppermost feeling in regard to them was a kind of cold scorn she thought most of them palterers and bullies the end of the colloquy was that verena having assented with her usual docility to her companions optimistic contention that it was a phase this taste for eveningcalls from collegians and newspapermen and would consequently pass away with the growth of her mind remarked that the injustice of men might be an accident or might be a part of their nature but at any rate she should have to change a good deal before she should want to marry  about the middle of december miss chancellor received a visit from matthias pardon who had come to ask her what she meant to do about verena she had never invited him to call upon her and the appearance of a gentleman whose desire to see her was so irrepressible as to dispense with such a preliminary was not in her career an accident frequent enough to have taught her equanimity she thought mr pardons visit a liberty but if she expected to convey this idea to him by withholding any suggestion that he should sit down she was greatly mistaken inasmuch as he cut the ground from under her feet by himself offering her a chair his manner represented hospitality enough for both of them and she was obliged to listen on the edge of her sofa she could at least seat herself where she liked to his extraordinary inquiry of course she was not obliged to answer it and indeed she scarcely understood it he explained that it was prompted by the intense interest he felt in miss verena but that scarcely made it more comprehensible such a sentiment on his part being such a curious mixture he had a sort of enamel of good humour which showed that his indelicacy was his profession and he asked for revelations of the vie intime of his victims with the bland confidence of a fashionable physician inquiring about symptoms he wanted to know what miss chancellor meant to do because if she didnt mean to do anything he had an ideawhich he wouldnt conceal from herof going into the enterprise himself you see what i should like to know is this do you consider that she belongs to you or that she belongs to the people if she belongs to you why dont you bring her out  he had no purpose and no consciousness of being impertinent he only wished to talk over the matter sociably with miss chancellor he knew of course that there was a presumption she would not be sociable but no presumption had yet deterred him from presenting a surface which he believed to be polished till it shone there was always a larger one in favour of his power to penetrate and of the majesty of the great dailies indeed he took so many things for granted that olive remained dumb while she regarded them and he availed himself of what he considered as a fortunate opening to be really very frank he reminded her that he had known miss verena a good deal longer than she he had travelled out to cambridge the other winter when he could get an offnight with the thermometer at ten below zero he had always thought her attractive but it wasnt till this season that his eyes had been fully opened her talent had matured and now he had no hesitation in calling her brilliant miss chancellor could imagine whether as an old friend he could watch such a beautiful unfolding with indifference she would fascinate the people just as she had fascinated her miss chancellor and he might be permitted to add himself the fact was she was a great card and some one ought to play it there never had been a more attractive female speaker before the american public she would walk right past mrs farrinder and mrs farrinder knew it there was room for both no doubt they had such a different style anyhow what he wanted to show was that there was room for miss verena she didnt want any more tuningup she wanted to break right out moreover he felt that any gentleman who should lead her to success would win her esteem he might even attract her more powerfullywho could tell if miss chancellor wanted to attach her permanently she ought to push her right forward he gathered from what miss verena had told him that she wanted to make her study up the subject a while longerfollow some kind of course well now he could assure her that there was no preparation so good as just seeing a couple of thousand people down there before you who have paid their money to have you tell them something miss verena was a natural genius and he hoped very much she wasnt going to take the nature out of her she could study up as she went along she had got the great thing that you couldnt learn a kind of divine afflatus as the ancients used to say and she had better just begin on that he wouldnt deny what was the matter with him he was quite under the spell and his admiration made him want to see her where she belonged he shouldnt care so much how she got there but it would certainly add to his pleasure if he could show her up to her place therefore would miss chancellor just tell him this how long did she expect to hold her back how long did she expect a humble admirer to wait of course he hadnt come there to crossquestion her there was one thing he trusted he always kept clear of when he was indiscreet he wanted to know it he had come with a proposal of his own and he hoped it would seem a sufficient warrant for his visit would miss chancellor be willing to divide athewell he might call it the responsibilities couldnt they run miss verena together in this case every one would be satisfied she could travel round with her as her companion and he would see that the american people walked up if miss chancellor would just let her go a little he would look after the rest he wanted no odds he only wanted her for about an hour and a half three or four evenings a week  olive had time in the course of this appeal to make her faculties converge to ask herself what she could say to this prodigious young man that would make him feel as how base a thing she held his proposal that they should constitute themselves into a company for drawing profit from verena unfortunately the most sarcastic inquiry that could occur to her as a response was also the most obvious one so that he hesitated but a moment with his rejoinder after she had asked him how many thousands of dollars he expected to make  for miss verena it depends upon the time shed run for ten years at least i cant figure it up till all the states have been heard from he said smiling  i dont mean for miss tarrant i mean for you olive returned with the impression that she was looking him straight in the eye  oh as many as youll leave me matthias pardon answered with a laugh that contained all and more than all the jocularity of the american press to speak seriously he added i dont want to make money out of it  what do you want to make then  well i want to make history i want to help the ladies  the ladies olive murmured what do you know about ladies she was on the point of adding when his promptness checked her  all over the world i want to work for their emancipation i regard it as the great modern question  miss chancellor got up now this was rather too strong whether eventually she was successful in what she attempted the reader of her history will judge but at this moment she had not that promise of success which resides in a willingness to make use of every aid that offers such is the penalty of being of a fastidious exclusive uncompromising nature of seeing things not simply and sharply but in perverse relations in intertwisted strands it seemed to our young lady that nothing could be less attractive than to owe her emancipation to such a one as matthias pardon and it is curious that those qualities which he had in common with verena and which in her seemed to olive romantic and touchingher having sprung from the people had an acquaintance with poverty a handtomouth development and an experience of the seamy side of lifeavailed in no degree to conciliate miss chancellor i suppose it was because he was a man she told him that she was much obliged to him for his offer but that he evidently didnt understand verena and herself no not even miss tarrant in spite of his long acquaintance with her they had no desire to be notorious they only wanted to be useful they had no wish to make money there would always be plenty of money for miss tarrant certainly she should come before the public and the world would acclaim her and hang upon her words but crude precipitate action was what both of them least desired the change in the dreadful position of women was not a question for today simply or for tomorrow but for many years to come and there would be a great deal to think of to map out one thing they were determined uponthat men shouldnt taunt them with being superficial when verena should appear it would be armed at all points like joan of arc this analogy had lodged itself in olives imagination she should have facts and figures she should meet men on their own ground what we mean to do we mean to do well miss chancellor said to her visitor with considerable sternness leaving him to make such an application to himself as his fancy might suggest  this announcement had little comfort for him he felt baffled and disheartenedindeed quite sick was it not sickening to hear her talk of this dreary process of preparationas if any one cared about that and would know whether verena were prepared or not had miss chancellor no faith in her girlhood didnt she know what a card that would be this was the last inquiry olive allowed him the opportunity of making she remarked to him that they might talk for ever without coming to an agreementtheir points of view were so far apart besides it was a womans question what they wanted was for women and it should be by women it had happened to the young matthias more than once to be shown the way to the door but the path of retreat had never yet seemed to him so unpleasant he was naturally amiable but it had not hitherto befallen him to be made to feel that he was notand could not bea factor in contemporary history here was a rapacious woman who proposed to keep that favourable setting for herself he let her know that she was rightdown selfish and that if she chose to sacrifice a beautiful nature to her antediluvian theories and love of power a vigilant daily presswhose business it was to expose wrongdoingwould demand an account from her she replied that if the newspapers chose to insult her that was their own affair one outrage the more to the sex in her person was of little account and after he had left her she seemed to see the glow of dawning success the battle had begun and something of the ecstasy of the martyr     xviii   verena told her a week after this that mr pardon wanted so much she should say she would marry him and she added with evident pleasure at being able to give her so agreeable a piece of news that she had declined to say anything of the sort she thought that now at least olive must believe in her for the proposal was more attractive than miss chancellor seemed able to understand he does place things in a very seductive light verena said he says that if i become his wife i shall be carried straight along by a force of excitement of which at present i have no idea i shall wake up famous if i marry him i have only got to give out my feelings and he will take care of the rest he says every hour of my youth is precious to me and that we should have a lovely time travelling round the country i think you ought to allow that all that is rather dazzlingfor i am not naturally concentrated like you  he promises you success what do you call success olive inquired looking at her friend with a kind of salutary coldnessa suspension of sympathywith which verena was now familiar though she liked it no better than at first and which made approbation more gracious when approbation came  verena reflected a moment and then answered smiling but with confidence producing a pressure that shall be irresistible causing certain laws to be repealed by congress and by the state legislatures and others to be enacted she repeated the words as if they had been part of a catechism committed to memory while olive saw that this mechanical tone was in the nature of a joke that she could not deny herself they had had that definition so often before and miss chancellor had had occasion so often to remind her what success really was of course it was easy to prove to her now that mr pardons glittering bait was a very different thing was a mere trap and lure a bribe to vanity and impatience a device for making her give herself awaylet alone fill his pockets while she did so olive was conscious enough of the girls want of continuity she had seen before how she could be passionately serious at times and then perversely even if innocently trivialas just now when she seemed to wish to convert one of their most sacred formulas into a pleasantry she had already quite recognised however that it was not of importance that verena should be just like herself she was all of one piece and verena was of many pieces which had where they fitted together little capricious chinks through which mocking inner lights seemed sometimes to gleam it was a part of verenas being unlike her that she should feel mr pardons promise of eternal excitement to be a brilliant thing should indeed consider mr pardon with any tolerance at all but olive tried afresh to allow for such aberrations as a phase of youth and suburban culture the more so that even when she tried most verena reproached herso far as verenas incurable softness could reproachwith not allowing enough olive didnt appear to understand that while matthias pardon drew that picture and tried to hold her hand this image was unfortunate she had given one long fixed wistful look through the door he opened at the bright tumult of the world and then had turned away solely for her friends sake to an austerer probation and a purer effort solely for her friends that is and that of the whole enslaved sisterhood the fact remained at any rate that verena had made a sacrifice and this thought after a while gave olive a greater sense of security it seemed almost to seal the future for olive knew that the young interviewer would not easily be shaken off and yet she was sure that verena would never yield to him  it was true that at present mr burrage came a great deal to the little house at cambridge verena told her about that told her so much that it was almost as good as if she had told her all he came without mr gracie now he could find his way alone and he seemed to wish that there should be no one else he had made himself so pleasant to her mother that she almost always went out of the room that was the highest proof mrs tarrant could give of her appreciation of a gentlemancaller they knew everything about him by this time that his father was dead his mother very fashionable and prominent and he himself in possession of a handsome patrimony they thought ever so much of him in new york he collected beautiful things pictures and antiques and objects that he sent for to europe on purpose many of which were arranged in his rooms at cambridge he had intaglios and spanish altarcloths and drawings by the old masters he was different from most others he seemed to want so much to enjoy life and to think you easily could if you would only let yourself go of coursejudging by what he hadhe appeared to think you required a great many things to keep you up and then verena told oliveshe could see it was after a little delaythat he wanted her to come round to his place and see his treasures he wanted to show them to her he was so sure she would admire them verena was sure also but she wouldnt go alone and she wanted olive to go with her they would have tea and there would be other ladies and olive would tell her what she thought of a life that was so crowded with beauty miss chancellor made her reflexions on all this and the first of them was that it was happy for her that she had determined for the present to accept these accidents for otherwise might she not now have had a deeper alarm she wished to heaven that conceited young men with time on their hands would leave verena alone but evidently they wouldnt and her best safety was in seeing as many as should turn up if the type should become frequent she would very soon judge it if olive had not been so grim she would have had a smile to spare for the frankness with which the girl herself adopted this theory she was eager to explain that mr burrage didnt seem at all to want what poor mr pardon had wanted he made her talk about her views far more than that gentleman but gave no sign of offering himself either as a husband or as a lectureagent the furthest he had gone as yet was to tell her that he liked her for the same reason that he liked old enamels and old embroideries and when she said that she didnt see how she resembled such things he had replied that it was because she was so peculiar and so delicate she might be peculiar but she had protested against the idea that she was delicate it was the last thing that she wanted to be thought and olive could see from this how far she was from falling in with everything he said when miss chancellor asked if she respected mr burrage and how solemn olive could make that word she by this time knew she answered with her sweet vain laugh but apparently with perfect good faith that it didnt matter whether she did or not for what was the whole thing but simply a phasethe very one they had talked about the sooner she got through it the better was it notand she seemed to think that her transit would be materially quickened by a visit to mr burrages rooms as i say verena was pleased to regard the phase as quite inevitable and she had said more than once to olive that if their struggle was to be with men the more they knew about them the better miss chancellor asked her why her mother should not go with her to see the curiosities since she mentioned that their possessor had not neglected to invite mrs tarrant and verena said that this of course would be very simpleonly her mother wouldnt be able to tell her so well as olive whether she ought to respect mr burrage this decision as to whether mr burrage should be respected assumed in the life of these two remarkable young women pitched in so high a moral key the proportions of a momentous event olive shrank at first from facing itnot indeed the decisionfor we know that her own mind had long since been made up in regard to the quantity of esteem due to almost any member of the other sexbut the incident itself which if mr burrage should exasperate her further might expose her to the danger of appearing to verena to be unfair to him it was her belief that he was playing a deeper game than the young matthias and she was very willing to watch him but she thought it prudent not to attempt to cut short the phase she adopted that classification prematurelyan imputation she should incur if without more delay she were to shut down as verena said on the young connoisseur  it was settled therefore that mrs tarrant should with her daughter accept mr burrages invitation and in a few days these ladies paid a visit to his apartments verena subsequently of course had much to say about it but she dilated even more upon her mothers impressions than upon her own mrs tarrant had carried away a supply which would last her all winter there had been some new york ladies present who were on at that moment and with whom her intercourse was rich in emotions she had told them all that she should be happy to see them in her home but they had not yet picked their way along the little planks of the front yard mr burrage at all events had been quite lovely and had talked about his collections which were wonderful in the most interesting manner verena inclined to think he was to be respected he admitted that he was not really studying law at all he had only come to cambridge for the form but she didnt see why it wasnt enough when you made yourself as pleasant as that she went so far as to ask olive whether taste and art were not something and her friend could see that she was certainly very much involved in the phase miss chancellor of course had her answer ready taste and art were good when they enlarged the mind not when they narrowed it verena assented to this and said it remained to be seen what effect they had had upon mr burragea remark which led olive to fear that at such a rate much would remain especially when verena told her later that another visit to the young mans rooms was projected and that this time she must come he having expressed the greatest desire for the honour and her own wish being greater still that they should look at some of his beautiful things together  a day or two after this mr henry burrage left a card at miss chancellors door with a note in which he expressed the hope that she would take tea with him on a certain day on which he expected the company of his mother olive responded to this invitation in conjunction with verena but in doing so she was in the position singular for her of not quite understanding what she was about it seemed to her strange that verena should urge her to take such a step when she was free to go without her and it proved two things first that she was much interested in mr henry burrage and second that her nature was extraordinarily beautiful could anything in effect be less underhand than such an indifference to what she supposed to be the best opportunities for carrying on a flirtation verena wanted to know the truth and it was clear that by this time she believed olive chancellor to have it for the most part in her keeping her insistence therefore proved above all that she cared more for her friends opinion of henry burrage than for her owna reminder certainly of the responsibility that olive had incurred in undertaking to form this generous young mind and of the exalted place that she now occupied in it such revelations ought to have been satisfactory if they failed to be completely so it was only on account of the elder girls regret that the subject as to which her judgement was wanted should be a young man destitute of the worst vices henry burrage had contributed to throw miss chancellor into a state as these young ladies called it the night she met him at mrs tarrants but it had none the less been conveyed to olive by the voices of the air that he was a gentleman and a good fellow  this was painfully obvious when the visit to his rooms took place he was so goodhumoured so amusing so friendly and considerate so attentive to miss chancellor he did the honours of his bachelornest with so easy a grace that olive part of the time sat dumbly shaking her conscience like a watch that wouldnt go to make it tell her some better reason why she shouldnt like him she saw that there would be no difficulty in disliking his mother but that unfortunately would not serve her purpose nearly so well mrs burrage had come to spend a few days near her son she was staying at an hotel in boston it presented itself to olive that after this entertainment it would be an act of courtesy to call upon her but here at least was the comfort that she could cover herself with the general absolution extended to the boston temperament and leave her alone it was slightly provoking indeed that mrs burrage should have so much the air of a new yorker who didnt particularly notice whether a bostonian called or not but there is ever an imperfection i suppose in even the sweetest revenge she was a woman of society large and voluminous fair in complexion and regularly ugly looking as if she ought to be slow and rather heavy but disappointing this expectation by a quick amused utterance a short bright summary laugh with which she appeared to dispose of the joke whatever it was for ever and an air of recognising on the instant everything she saw and heard she was evidently accustomed to talk and even to listen if not kept waiting too long for details and parentheses she was not continuous but frequent as it were and you could see that she hated explanations though it was not to be supposed that she had anything to fear from them her favours were general not particular she was civil enough to every one but not in any case endearing and perfectly genial without being confiding as people were in boston when in moments of exaltation they wished to mark that they were not suspicious there was something in her whole manner which seemed to say to olive that she belonged to a larger world than hers and our young lady was vexed at not hearing that she had lived for a good many years in europe as this would have made it easy to classify her as one of the corrupt she learned almost with a sense of injury that neither the mother nor the son had been longer beyond the seas than she herself and if they were to be judged as triflers they must be dealt with individually was it an aid to such a judgement to see that mrs burrage was very much pleased with boston with harvard college with her sons interior with her cup of tea it was old sèvres which was not half so bad as she had expected with the company he had asked to meet her there were three or four gentlemen one of whom was mr gracie and last not least with verena tarrant whom she addressed as a celebrity kindly cleverly but without maternal tenderness or anything to mark the difference in their age she spoke to her as if they were equals in that respect as if verenas genius and fame would make up the disparity and the girl had no need of encouragement and patronage she made no direct allusion however to her particular views and asked her no question about her giftan omission which verena thought strange and with the most speculative candour spoke of to olive afterwards mrs burrage seemed to imply that every one present had some distinction and some talent that they were all good company together there was nothing in her manner to indicate that she was afraid of verena on her sons account she didnt resemble a person who would like him to marry the daughter of a mesmeric healer and yet she appeared to think it charming that he should have such a young woman there to give gusto to her hour at cambridge poor olive was in the nature of things entangled in contradictions she had a horror of the idea of verenas marrying mr burrage and yet she was angry when his mother demeaned herself as if the little girl with red hair whose freshness she enjoyed could not be a serious danger she saw all this through the blur of her shyness the conscious anxious silence to which she was so much of the time condemned it may therefore be imagined how sharp her vision would have been could she only have taken the situation more simply for she was intelligent enough not to have needed to be morbid even for purposes of selfdefence  i must add however that there was a moment when she came near being happyor at any rate reflected that it was a pity she could not be so mrs burrage asked her son to play some little thing and he sat down to his piano and revealed a talent that might well have gratified that ladys pride olive was extremely susceptible to music and it was impossible to her not to be soothed and beguiled by the young mans charming art one little thing succeeded another his selections were all very happy his guests sat scattered in the red firelight listening silent in comfortable attitudes there was a faint fragrance from the burning logs which mingled with the perfume of schubert and mendelssohn the covered lamps made a glow here and there and the cabinets and brackets produced brown shadows out of which some precious object gleamedsome ivory carving or cinquecento cup it was given to olive under these circumstances for half an hour to surrender herself to enjoy the music to admit that mr burrage played with exquisite taste to feel as if the situation were a kind of truce her nerves were calmed her problemsfor the timesubsided civilisation under such an influence in such a setting appeared to have done its work harmony ruled the scene human life ceased to be a battle she went so far as to ask herself why one should have a quarrel with it the relations of men and women in that picturesque grouping had not the air of being internecine in short she had an interval of unexpected rest during which she kept her eyes mainly on verena who sat near mrs burrage letting herself go evidently more completely than olive to her too music was a delight and her listening face turned itself to different parts of the room unconsciously while her eyes vaguely rested on the bibelots that emerged into the firelight at moments mrs burrage bent her countenance upon her and smiled at random kindly and then verena smiled back while her expression seemed to say that oh yes she was giving up everything all principles all projects even before it was time to go olive felt that they were both verena and she quite demoralised and she only summoned energy to take her companion away when she heard mrs burrage propose to her to come and spend a fortnight in new york then olive exclaimed to herself is it a plot why in the world cant they let her alone and prepared to throw a fold of her mantle as she had done before over her young friend verena answered somewhat impetuously that she should be delighted to visit mrs burrage then checked her impetuosity after a glance from olive by adding that perhaps this lady wouldnt ask her if she knew what strong ground she took on the emancipation of women mrs burrage looked at her son and laughed she said she was perfectly aware of verenas views and that it was impossible to be more in sympathy with them than she herself she took the greatest interest in the emancipation of women she thought there was so much to be done these were the only remarks that passed in reference to the great subject and nothing more was said to verena either by henry burrage or by his friend gracie about her addressing the harvard students verena had told her father that olive had put her veto upon that and tarrant had said to the young men that it seemed as if miss chancellor was going to put the thing through in her own way we know that he thought this way very circuitous but miss chancellor made him feel that she was in earnest and that idea frightened the resistance out of himit had such terrible associations the people he had ever seen who were most in earnest were a committee of gentlemen who had investigated the phenomena of the materialisation of spirits some ten years before and had bent the fierce light of the scientific method upon him to olive it appeared that mr burrage and mr gracie had ceased to be jocular but that did not make them any less cynical henry burrage said to verena as she was going that he hoped she would think seriously of his mothers invitation and she replied that she didnt know whether she should have much time in the future to give to people who already approved of her views she expected to have her hands full with the others who didnt  does your scheme of work exclude all distraction all recreation then the young man inquired and his look expressed real suspense  verena referred the matter as usual with her air of bright ungrudging deference to her companion does it should you sayour scheme of work  i am afraid the distraction we have had this afternoon must last us for a long time olive said without harshness but with considerable majesty  well now is he to be respected verena demanded as the two young women took their way through the early darkness pacing quietly side by side in their winterrobes like women consecrated to some holy office  olive turned it over a moment yes very muchas a pianist  verena went into town with her in the horsecarshe was staying in charles street for a few daysand that evening she startled olive by breaking out into a reflexion very similar to the whimsical falterings of which she herself had been conscious while they sat in mr burrages pretty rooms but against which she had now violently reacted  it would be very nice to do that alwaysjust to take men as they are and not to have to think about their badness it would be very nice not to have so many questions but to think they were all comfortably answered so that one could sit there on an old spanish leather chair with the curtains drawn and keeping out the cold the darkness all the big terrible cruel worldsit there and listen for ever to schubert and mendelssohn they didnt care anything about female suffrage and i didnt feel the want of a vote today at all did you verena inquired ending as she always ended in these few speculations with an appeal to olive  this young lady thought it necessary to give her a very firm answer i always feel iteverywherenight and day i feel it here and olive laid her hand solemnly on her heart i feel it as a deep unforgettable wrong i feel it as one feels a stain that is on ones honour  verena gave a clear laugh and after that a soft sigh and then said do you know olive i sometimes wonder whether if it wasnt for you i should feel it so very much  my own friend olive replied you have never yet said anything to me which expressed so clearly the closeness and sanctity of our union  you do keep me up verena went on you are my conscience  i should like to be able to say that you are my formmy envelope but you are too beautiful for that so olive returned her friends compliment and later she said that of course it would be far easier to give up everything and draw the curtains to and pass ones life in an artificial atmosphere with rosecoloured lamps it would be far easier to abandon the struggle to leave all the unhappy women of the world to their immemorial misery to lay down ones burden close ones eyes to the whole dark picture and in short simply expire to this verena objected that it would not be easy for her to expire at all that such an idea was darker than anything the world contained that she had not done with life yet and that she didnt mean to allow her responsibilities to crush her and then the two young women concluded as they had concluded before by finding themselves completely inspiringly in agreement full of the purpose to live indeed and with high success to become great in order not to be obscure and powerful in order not to be useless olive had often declared before that her conception of life was as something sublime or as nothing at all the world was full of evil but she was glad to have been born before it had been swept away while it was still there to face to give one a task and a reward when the great reforms should be consummated when the day of justice should have dawned would not life perhaps be rather poor and pale she had never pretended to deny that the hope of fame of the very highest distinction was one of her strongest incitements and she held that the most effective way of protesting against the state of bondage of women was for an individual member of the sex to become illustrious a person who might have overheard some of the talk of this possibly infatuated pair would have been touched by their extreme familiarity with the idea of earthly glory verena had not invented it but she had taken it eagerly from her friend and she returned it with interest to olive it appeared that just this partnership of their two mindseach of them by itself lacking an important group of facetsmade an organic whole which for the work in hand could not fail to be brilliantly effective verena was often far more irresponsive than she liked to see her but the happy thing in her composition was that after a short contact with the divine ideaolive was always trying to flash it at her like a jewel in an uncovered caseshe kindled flamed up took the words from her friends less persuasive lips resolved herself into a magical voice became again the pure young sibyl then olive perceived how fatally without verenas tender notes her crusade would lack sweetness what the catholics call unction and on the other hand how weak verena would be on the statistical and logical side if she herself should not bring up the rear together in short they would be complete they would have everything and together they would triumph     xix   this idea of their triumph a triumph as yet ultimate and remote but preceded by the solemn vista of an effort so religious as never to be wanting in ecstasy became tremendously familiar to the two friends but especially to olive during the winter of 187 a season which ushered in the most momentous period of miss chancellors life about christmas a step was taken which advanced her affairs immensely and put them to her apprehension on a regular footing this consisted in verenas coming in to charles street to stay with her in pursuance of an arrangement on olives part with selah tarrant and his wife that she should remain for many months the coast was now perfectly clear mrs farrinder had started on her annual grand tour she was rousing the people from maine to texas matthias pardon it was to be supposed had received temporarily at least his quietus and mrs luna was established in new york where she had taken a house for a year and whence she wrote to her sister that she was going to engage basil ransom with whom she was in communication for this purpose to do her lawbusiness olive wondered what lawbusiness adeline could have and hoped she would get into a pickle with her landlord or her milliner so that repeated interviews with mr ransom might become necessary mrs luna let her know very soon that these interviews had begun the young mississippian had come to dine with her he hadnt got started much by what she could make out and she was even afraid that he didnt dine every day but he wore a tall hat now like a northern gentleman and adeline intimated that she found him really attractive he had been very nice to newton told him all about the war quite the southern version of course but mrs luna didnt care anything about american politics and she wanted her son to know all sides and newton did nothing but talk about him calling him rannie and imitating his pronunciation of certain words adeline subsequently wrote that she had made up her mind to put her affairs into his hands olive sighed not unmagnanimously as she thought of her sisters affairs and later still she mentioned that she was thinking strongly of taking him to be newtons tutor she wished this interesting child to be privately educated and it would be more agreeable to have in that relation a person who was already as it were a member of the family mrs luna wrote as if he were prepared to give up his profession to take charge of her son and olive was pretty sure that this was only a part of her grandeur of the habit she had contracted especially since living in europe of speaking as if in every case she required special arrangements  in spite of the difference in their age olive had long since judged her and made up her mind that adeline lacked every quality that a person needed to be interesting in her eyes she was rich or sufficiently so she was conventional and timid very fond of attentions from men with whom indeed she was reputed bold but olive scorned such boldness as that given up to a merely personal egotistical instinctive life and as unconscious of the tendencies of the age the revenges of the future the new truths and the great social questions as if she had been a mere bundle of dresstrimmings which she very nearly was it was perfectly observable that she had no conscience and it irritated olive deeply to see how much trouble a woman was spared when she was constructed on that system adelines affairs as i have intimated her social relations her views of newtons education her practice and her theory for she had plenty of that such as it was heaven save the mark her spasmodic disposition to marry again and her still sillier retreats in the presence of danger for she had not even the courage of her frivolity these things had been a subject of tragic consideration to olive ever since the return of the elder sister to america the tragedy was not in any particular harm that mrs luna could do her for she did her good rather that is she did her honour by laughing at her but in the spectacle itself the drama guided by the hand of fate of which the small ignoble scenes unrolled themselves so logically the dénouement would of course be in keeping and would consist simply of the spiritual death of mrs luna who would end by understanding no common speech of olives at all and would sink into mere worldly plumpness into the last complacency the supreme imbecility of petty genteel conservatism as for newton he would be more utterly odious if possible as he grew up than he was already in fact he would not grow up at all but only grow down if his mother should continue her infatuated system with him he was insufferably forward and selfish under the pretext of keeping him at any cost refined adeline had coddled and caressed him having him always in her petticoats remitting his lessons when he pretended he had an earache drawing him into the conversation letting him answer her back with an impertinence beyond his years when she administered the smallest check the place for him in olives eyes was one of the public schools where the children of the people would teach him his small importance teach it if necessary by the aid of an occasional drubbing and the two ladies had a grand discussion on this point before mrs luna left bostona scene which ended in adelines clutching the irrepressible newton to her bosom he came in at the moment and demanding of him a vow that he would live and die in the principles of his mother mrs luna declared that if she must be trampled uponand very likely it was her fateshe would rather be trampled upon by men than by women and that if olive and her friends should get possession of the government they would be worse despots than those who were celebrated in history newton took an infant oath that he would never be a destructive impious radical and olive felt that after this she neednt trouble herself any more about her sister whom she simply committed to her fate that fate might very properly be to marry an enemy of her country a man who no doubt desired to treat women with the lash and manacles as he and his people had formerly treated the wretched coloured race if she was so fond of the fine old institutions of the past he would supply them to her in abundance and if she wanted so much to be a conservative she could try first how she liked being a conservatives wife if olive troubled herself little about adeline she troubled herself more about basil ransom she said to herself that since he hated women who respected themselves and each other destiny would use him rightly in hanging a person like adeline round his neck that would be the way poetic justice ought to work for himand the law that our prejudices when they act themselves out punish us in doing so olive considered all this as it was her effort to consider everything from a very high point of view and ended by feeling sure it was not for the sake of any nervous personal security that she desired to see her two relations in new york get mixed up together if such an event as their marriage would gratify her sense of fitness it would be simply as an illustration of certain laws olive thanks to the philosophic cast of her mind was exceedingly fond of illustrations of laws  i hardly know however what illumination it was that sprang from her consciousness now a source of considerable comfort that mrs farrinder was carrying the war into distant territories and would return to boston only in time to preside at a grand female convention already advertised to take place in boston in the month of june it was agreeable to her that this imperial woman should be away it made the field more free the air more light it suggested an exemption from official criticism i have not taken space to mention certain episodes of the more recent intercourse of these ladies and must content myself with tracing them lightly in their consequences these may be summed up in the remark which will doubtless startle no one by its freshness that two imperial women are scarcely more likely to hit it off together as the phrase is than two imperial men since that party at miss birdseyes so important in its results for olive she had had occasion to approach mrs farrinder more nearly and those overtures brought forth the knowledge that the great leader of the feminine revolution was the one person in that part of the world more concentrated more determined than herself miss chancellors aspirations of late had been immensely quickened she had begun to believe in herself to a livelier tune than she had ever listened to before and she now perceived that when spirit meets spirit there must either be mutual absorption or a sharp concussion it had long been familiar to her that she should have to count with the obstinacy of the world at large but she now discovered that she should have to count also with certain elements in the feminine camp this complicated the problem and such a complication naturally could not make mrs farrinder appear more easy to assimilate if olives was a high nature and so was hers the fault was in neither it was only an admonition that they were not needed as landmarks in the same part of the field if such perceptions are delicate as between men the reader need not be reminded of the exquisite form they may assume in natures more refined so it was that olive passed in three months from the stage of veneration to that of competition and the process had been accelerated by the introduction of verena into the fold mrs farrinder had behaved in the strangest way about verena first she had been struck with her and then she hadnt first she had seemed to want to take her in then she had shied at her unmistakablyintimating to olive that there were enough of that kind already of that kind indeedthe phrase reverberated in miss chancellors resentful soul was it possible she didnt know the kind verena was of and with what vulgar aspirants to notoriety did she confound her it had been olives original desire to obtain mrs farrinders stamp for her protégée she wished her to hold a commission from the commanderinchief with this view the two young women had made more than one pilgrimage to roxbury and on one of these occasions the sibylline mood in its most charming form had descended upon verena she had fallen into it naturally and gracefully in the course of talk and poured out a stream of eloquence even more touching than her regular discourse at miss birdseyes mrs farrinder had taken it rather dryly and certainly it didnt resemble her own style of oratory remarkable and cogent as this was there had been considerable question of her writing a letter to the new york tribune the effect of which should be to launch miss tarrant into renown but this beneficent epistle never appeared and now olive saw that there was no favour to come from the prophetess of roxbury there had been primnesses pruderies small reserves which ended by staying her pen if olive didnt say at once that she was jealous of verenas more attractive manner it was only because such a declaration was destined to produce more effect a little later what she did say was that evidently mrs farrinder wanted to keep the movement in her own handsviewed with suspicion certain romantic esthetic elements which olive and verena seemed to be trying to introduce into it they insisted so much for instance on the historic unhappiness of women but mrs farrinder didnt appear to care anything for that or indeed to know much about history at all she seemed to begin just today and she demanded their rights for them whether they were unhappy or not the upshot of this was that olive threw herself on verenas neck with a movement which was half indignation half rapture she exclaimed that they would have to fight the battle without human help but after all it was better so if they were all in all to each other what more could they want they would be isolated but they would be free and this view of the situation brought with it a feeling that they had almost already begun to be a force it was not indeed that olives resentment faded quite away for not only had she the sense doubtless very presumptuous that mrs farrinder was the only person thereabouts of a stature to judge her a sufficient cause of antagonism in itself for if we like to be praised by our betters we prefer that censure should come from the other sort but the kind of opinion she had unexpectedly betrayed after implying such esteem in the earlier phase of their intercourse made olives cheeks occasionally flush she prayed heaven that she might never become so personal so narrow she was frivolous worldly an amateur a trifler a frequenter of beacon street her taking up verena tarrant was only a kind of elderly ridiculous dolldressing this was the light in which miss chancellor had reason to believe that it now suited mrs farrinder to regard her it was fortunate perhaps that the misrepresentation was so gross yet none the less tears of wrath rose more than once to olives eyes when she reflected that this particular wrong had been put upon her frivolous worldly beacon street she appealed to verena to share in her pledge that the world should know in due time how much of that sort of thing there was about her as i have already hinted verena at such moments quite rose to the occasion she had private pangs at committing herself to give the cold shoulder to beacon street for ever but she was now so completely in olives hands that there was no sacrifice to which she would not have consented in order to prove that her benefactress was not frivolous  the matter of her coming to stay for so long in charles street was arranged during a visit that selah tarrant paid there at miss chancellors request this interview which had some curious features would be worth describing but i am forbidden to do more than mention the most striking of these olive wished to have an understanding with him wished the situation to be clear so that disagreeable as it would be to her to receive him she sent him a summons for a certain houran hour at which she had planned that verena should be out of the house she withheld this incident from the girls knowledge reflecting with some solemnity that it was the first deception for olive her silence was a deception that she had yet practised on her friend and wondering whether she should have to practise others in the future she then and there made up her mind that she would not shrink from others should they be necessary she notified tarrant that she should keep verena a long time and tarrant remarked that it was certainly very pleasant to see her so happily located but he also intimated that he should like to know what miss chancellor laid out to do with her and the tone of this suggestion made olive feel how right she had been to foresee that their interview would have the stamp of business it assumed that complexion very definitely when she crossed over to her desk and wrote mr tarrant a cheque for a very considerable amount leave us aloneentirely alonefor a year and then i will write you another it was with these words she handed him the little strip of paper that meant so much feeling as she did so that surely mrs farrinder herself could not be less amateurish than that selah looked at the cheque at miss chancellor at the cheque again at the ceiling at the floor at the clock and once more at his hostess then the document disappeared beneath the folds of his waterproof and she saw that he was putting it into some queer place on his queer person well if i didnt believe you were going to help her to develop he remarked and he stopped while his hands continued to fumble out of sight and he treated olive to his large joyless smile she assured him that he need have no fear on that score verenas development was the thing in the world in which she took most interest she should have every opportunity for a free expansion yes thats the great thing selah said its more important than attracting a crowd thats all we shall ask of you let her act out her nature dont all the trouble of humanity come from our being pressed back dont shut down the cover miss chancellor just let her overflow and again tarrant illuminated his inquiry his metaphor by the strange and silent lateral movement of his jaws he added presently that he supposed he should have to fix it with mis tarrant but olive made no answer to that she only looked at him with a face in which she intended to express that there was nothing that need detain him longer she knew it had been fixed with mrs tarrant she had been over all that with verena who had told her that her mother was willing to sacrifice her for her highest good she had reason to know not through verena of course that mrs tarrant had embraced tenderly the idea of a pecuniary compensation and there was no fear of her making a scene when tarrant should come back with a cheque in his pocket well i trust she may develop richly and that you may accomplish what you desire it seems as if we had only a little way to go further that worthy observed as he erected himself for departure  its not a little way its a very long way olive replied rather sternly  tarrant was on the threshold he lingered a little embarrassed by her grimness for he himself had always inclined to rosecoloured views of progress of the march of truth he had never met any one so much in earnest as this definite literal young woman who had taken such an unhopedfor fancy to his daughter whose longing for the new day had such perversities of pessimism and who in the midst of something that appeared to be terribly searching in her honesty was willing to corrupt him as a father with the most extravagant orders on her bank he hardly knew in what language to speak to her it seemed as if there was nothing soothing enough when a lady adopted that tone about a movement which was thought by some of the brightest to be so promising oh well i guess theres some kind of mysterious law he murmured almost timidly and so he passed from miss chancellors sight     xx   she hoped she should not soon see him again and there appeared to be no reason she should if their intercourse was to be conducted by means of cheques the understanding with verena was of course complete she had promised to stay with her friend as long as her friend should require it she had said at first that she couldnt give up her mother but she had been made to feel that there was no question of giving up she should be as free as air to go and come she could spend hours and days with her mother whenever mrs tarrant required her attention all that olive asked of her was that for the time she should regard charles street as her home there was no struggle about this for the simple reason that by the time the question came to the front verena was completely under the charm the idea of olives charm will perhaps make the reader smile but i use the word not in its derived but in its literal sense the fine web of authority of dependence that her strenuous companion had woven about her was now as dense as a suit of golden mail and verena was thoroughly interested in their great undertaking she saw it in the light of an active enthusiastic faith the benefit that her father desired for her was now assured she expanded developed on the most liberal scale olive saw the difference and you may imagine how she rejoiced in it she had never known a greater pleasure verenas former attitude had been girlish submission grateful curious sympathy she had given herself in her young amused surprise because olives stronger will and the incisive proceedings with which she pointed her purpose drew her on besides she was held by hospitality the vision of new social horizons the sense of novelty and the love of change but now the girl was disinterestedly attached to the precious things they were to do together she cared about them for themselves believed in them ardently had them constantly in mind her share in the union of the two young women was no longer passive purely appreciative it was passionate too and it put forth a beautiful energy if olive desired to get verena into training she could flatter herself that the process had already begun and that her colleague enjoyed it almost as much as she therefore she could say to herself without the imputation of heartlessness that when she left her mother it was for a noble a sacred use in point of fact she left her very little and she spent hours in jingling aching jostled journeys between charles street and the stale suburban cottage mrs tarrant sighed and grimaced wrapped herself more than ever in her mantle said she didnt know as she was fit to struggle alone and that half the time if verena was away she wouldnt have the nerve to answer the doorbell she was incapable of course of neglecting such an opportunity to posture as one who paid with her hearts blood for leading the van of human progress but verena had an inner sense she judged her mother now a little for the first time that she would be sorry to be taken at her word and that she felt safe enough in trusting to her daughters generosity she could not divest herself of the faitheven now that mrs luna was gone leaving no trace and the grey walls of a sedentary winter were apparently closing about the two young womenshe could not renounce the theory that a residence in charles street must at least produce some contact with the brilliant classes she was vexed at her daughters resignation to not going to parties and to miss chancellors not giving them but it was nothing new for her to have to practise patience and she could feel at least that it was just as handy for mr burrage to call on the child in town where he spent half his time sleeping constantly at parkers  it was a fact that this fortunate youth called very often and verena saw him with olives full concurrence whenever she was at home it had now been quite agreed between them that no artificial limits should be set to the famous phase and olive had while it lasted a sense of real heroism in steeling herself against uneasiness it seemed to her moreover only justice that she should make some concession if verena made a great sacrifice of filial duty in coming to live with her this of course should be permanentshe would buy off the tarrants from year to year she must not incur the imputation the world would judge her in that case ferociously of keeping her from forming common social ties the friendship of a young man and a young woman was according to the pure code of new england a common social tie and as the weeks elapsed miss chancellor saw no reason to repent of her temerity verena was not falling in love she felt that she should know it should guess it on the spot verena was fond of human intercourse she was essentially a sociable creature she liked to shine and smile and talk and listen and so far as henry burrage was concerned he introduced an element of easy and convenient relaxation into a life now a good deal stiffened olive was perfectly willing to own it by great civic purposes but the girl was being saved without interference by the simple operation of her interest in those very designs from this time there was no need of putting pressure on her her own springs were working the fire with which she glowed came from within sacredly brightly single she would remain her only espousals would be at the altar of a great cause olive always absented herself when mr burrage was announced and when verena afterwards attempted to give some account of his conversation she checked her said she would rather know nothing about itall with a very solemn mildness this made her feel very superior truly noble she knew by this time i scarcely can tell how since verena could give her no report exactly what sort of a youth mr burrage was he was weakly pretentious softly original cultivated eccentricity patronised progress liked to have mysteries sudden appointments to keep anonymous persons to visit the air of leading a double life of being devoted to a girl whom people didnt know or at least didnt meet of course he liked to make an impression on verena but what he mainly liked was to play her off upon the other girls the daughters of fashion with whom he danced at papantis such were the images that proceeded from olives rich moral consciousness well he is greatly interested in our movement so much verena once managed to announce but the words rather irritated miss chancellor who as we know did not care to allow for accidental exceptions in the great masculine conspiracy  in the month of march verena told her that mr burrage was offering matrimonyoffering it with much insistence begging that she would at least wait and think of it before giving him a final answer verena was evidently very glad to be able to say to olive that she had assured him she couldnt think of it and that if he expected this he had better not come any more he continued to come and it was therefore to be supposed that he had ceased to count on such a concession it was now olives opinion that he really didnt desire it she had a theory that he proposed to almost any girl who was not likely to accept himdid it because he was making a collection of such episodesa mental album of declarations blushes hesitations refusals that just missed imposing themselves as acceptances quite as he collected enamels and cremona violins he would be very sorry indeed to ally himself to the house of tarrant but such a fear didnt prevent him from holding it becoming in a man of taste to give that encouragement to lowborn girls who were pretty for one looked out for the special cases in which for reasons even the lowest might have reasons they wouldnt rise i told you i wouldnt marry him and i wont verena said delightedly to her friend her tone suggested that a certain credit belonged to her for the way she carried out her assurance i never thought you would if you didnt want to olive replied to this and verena could have no rejoinder but the goodhumour that sat in her eyes unable as she was to say that she had wanted to they had a little discussion however when she intimated that she pitied him for his discomfiture olives contention being that selfish conceited pampered and insincere he might properly be left now to digest his affront miss chancellor felt none of the remorse now that she would have felt six months before at standing in the way of such a chance for verena and she would have been very angry if any one had asked her if she were not afraid of taking too much upon herself she would have said moreover that she stood in no ones way and that even if she were not there verena would never think seriously of a frivolous little man who fiddled while rome was burning this did not prevent olive from making up her mind that they had better go to europe in the spring a years residence in that quarter of the globe would be highly agreeable to verena and might even contribute to the evolution of her genius it cost miss chancellor an effort to admit that any virtue still lingered in the elder world and that it could have any important lesson for two such good americans as her friend and herself but it suited her just then to make this assumption which was not altogether sincere it was recommended by the idea that it would get her companion out of the wayout of the way of officious fellowcitizenstill she should be absolutely firm on her feet and would also give greater intensity to their own long conversation on that continent of strangers they would cleave more closely still to each other this of course would be to fly before the inevitable phase much more than to face it but olive decided that if they should reach unscathed the term of their delay the first of july she should have faced it as much as either justice or generosity demanded i may as well say at once that she traversed most of this period without further serious alarms and with a great many little thrills of bliss and hope  nothing happened to dissipate the good omens with which her partnership with verena tarrant was at present surrounded they threw themselves into study they had innumerable big books from the athenæum and consumed the midnight oil henry burrage after verena had shaken her head at him so sweetly and sadly returned to new york giving no sign they only heard that he had taken refuge under the ruffled maternal wing olive at least took for granted the wing was ruffled she could fancy how mrs burrage would be affected by the knowledge that her son had been refused by the daughter of a mesmeric healer she would be almost as angry as if she had learnt that he had been accepted matthias pardon had not yet taken his revenge in the newspapers he was perhaps nursing his thunderbolts at any rate now that the operatic season had begun he was much occupied in interviewing the principal singers one of whom he described in one of the leading journals olive at least was sure it was only he who could write like that as a dear little woman with baby dimples and kittenish movements the tarrants were apparently given up to a measure of sensual ease with which they had not hitherto been familiar thanks to the increase of income that they drew from their eccentric protectress mrs tarrant now enjoyed the ministrations of a girl it was partly her pride at any rate she chose to give it this turn that her house had for many years been conducted without the elementso debasing on both sidesof servile mercenary labour she wrote to olive she was perpetually writing to her now but olive never answered that she was conscious of having fallen to a lower plane but she admitted that it was a prop to her wasted spirit to have some one to converse with when selah was off verena of course perceived the difference which was inadequately explained by the theory of a sudden increase of her fathers practice nothing of her fathers had ever increased like that and ended by guessing the cause of ita discovery which did not in the least disturb her equanimity she accepted the idea that her parents should receive a pecuniary tribute from the extraordinary friend whom she had encountered on the threshold of womanhood just as she herself accepted that friends irresistible hospitality she had no worldly pride no traditions of independence no ideas of what was done and what was not done but there was only one thing that equalled this perfectly gentle and natural insensibility to favoursnamely the inveteracy of her habit of not asking them olive had had an apprehension that she would flush a little at learning the terms on which they should now be able to pursue their career together but verena never changed colour it was either not new or not disagreeable to her that the authors of her being should be bought off silenced by money treated as the troublesome of the lower orders are treated when they are not locked up so that her friend had a perception after this that it would probably be impossible in any way ever to offend her she was too rancourless too detached from conventional standards too free from private selfreference it was too much to say of her that she forgave injuries since she was not conscious of them there was in forgiveness a certain arrogance of which she was incapable and her bright mildness glided over the many traps that life sets for our consistency olive had always held that pride was necessary to character but there was no peculiarity of verenas that could make her spirit seem less pure the added luxuries in the little house at cambridge which even with their help was still such a penal settlement made her feel afresh that before she came to the rescue the daughter of that house had traversed a desert of sordid misery she had cooked and washed and swept and stitched she had worked harder than any of miss chancellors servants these things had left no trace upon her person or her mind everything fresh and fair renewed itself in her with extraordinary facility everything ugly and tiresome evaporated as soon as it touched her but olive deemed that being what she was she had a right to immense compensations in the future she should have exceeding luxury and ease and miss chancellor had no difficulty in persuading herself that persons doing the high intellectual and moral work to which the two young ladies in charles street were now committed owed it to themselves owed it to the groaning sisterhood to cultivate the best material conditions she herself was nothing of a sybarite and she had proved visiting the alleys and slums of boston in the service of the associated charities that there was no foulness of disease or misery she feared to look in the face but her house had always been thoroughly well regulated she was passionately clean and she was an excellent woman of business now however she elevated daintiness to a religion her interior shone with superfluous friction with punctuality with winter roses among these soft influences verena herself bloomed like the flower that attains such perfection in boston olive had always rated high the native refinement of her countrywomen their latent adaptability their talent for accommodating themselves at a glance to changed conditions but the way her companion rose with the level of the civilisation that surrounded her the way she assimilated all delicacies and absorbed all traditions left this friendly theory halting behind the winter days were still indoors in charles street and the winter nights secure from interruption our two young women had plenty of duties but olive had never favoured the custom of running in and out much conference on social and reformatory topics went forward under her roof and she received her colleaguesshe belonged to twenty associations and committeesonly at preappointed hours which she expected them to observe rigidly verenas share in these proceedings was not active she hovered over them smiling listening dropping occasionally a fanciful though never an idle word like some gently animated image placed there for good omen it was understood that her part was before the scenes not behind that she was not a prompter but potentially at least a popular favourite and that the work over which miss chancellor presided so efficiently was a general preparation of the platform on which later her companion would execute the most striking steps  the western windows of olives drawingroom looking over the water took in the red sunsets of winter the long low bridge that crawled on its staggering posts across the charles the casual patches of ice and snow the desolate suburban horizons peeled and made bald by the rigour of the season the general hard cold void of the prospect the extrusion at charlestown at cambridge of a few chimneys and steeples straight sordid tubes of factories and engineshops or spare heavenward finger of the new england meetinghouse there was something inexorable in the poverty of the scene shameful in the meanness of its details which gave a collective impression of boards and tin and frozen earth sheds and rotting piles railwaylines striding flat across a thoroughfare of puddles and tracks of the humbler the universal horsecar traversing obliquely this path of danger loose fences vacant lots mounds of refuse yards bestrewn with iron pipes telegraph poles and bare wooden backs of places verena thought such a view lovely and she was by no means without excuse when as the afternoon closed the ugly picture was tinted with a clear cold rosiness the air in its windless chill seemed to tinkle like a crystal the faintest gradations of tone were perceptible in the sky the west became deep and delicate everything grew doubly distinct before taking on the dimness of evening there were pink flushes on snow tender reflexions in patches of stiffened marsh sounds of carbells no longer vulgar but almost silvery on the long bridge lonely outlines of distant dusky undulations against the fading glow these agreeable effects used to light up that end of the drawingroom and olive often sat at the window with her companion before it was time for the lamp they admired the sunsets they rejoiced in the ruddy spots projected upon the parlourwall they followed the darkening perspective in fanciful excursions they watched the stellar points come out at last in a colder heaven and then shuddering a little arm in arm they turned away with a sense that the winter night was even more cruel than the tyranny of menturned back to drawn curtains and a brighter fire and a glittering teatray and more and more talk about the long martyrdom of women a subject as to which olive was inexhaustible and really most interesting there were some nights of deep snowfall when charles street was white and muffled and the doorbell foredoomed to silence which seemed little islands of lamplight of enlarged and intensified vision they read a great deal of history together and read it ever with the same thoughtthat of finding confirmation in it for this idea that their sex had suffered inexpressibly and that at any moment in the course of human affairs the state of the world would have been so much less horrible history seemed to them in every way horrible if women had been able to press down the scale verena was full of suggestions which stimulated discussions it was she oftenest who kept in view the fact that a good many women in the past had been entrusted with power and had not always used it amiably who brought up the wicked queens the profligate mistresses of kings these ladies were easily disposed of between the two and the public crimes of bloody mary the private misdemeanours of faustina wife of the pure marcus aurelius were very satisfactorily classified if the influence of women in the past accounted for every act of virtue that men had happened to achieve it only made the matter balance properly that the influence of men should explain the casual irregularities of the other sex olive could see how few books had passed through verenas hands and how little the home of the tarrants had been a house of reading but the girl now traversed the fields of literature with her characteristic lightness of step everything she turned to or took up became an illustration of the facility the giftedness which olive who had so little of it never ceased to wonder at and prize nothing frightened her she always smiled at it she could do anything she tried as she knew how to do other things she knew how to study she read quickly and remembered infallibly could repeat days afterward passages that she appeared only to have glanced at olive of course was more and more happy to think that their cause should have the services of an organisation so rare  all this doubtless sounds rather dry and i hasten to add that our friends were not always shut up in miss chancellors strenuous parlour in spite of olives desire to keep her precious inmate to herself and to bend her attention upon their common studies in spite of her constantly reminding verena that this winter was to be purely educative and that the platitudes of the satisfied and unregenerate would have little to teach her in spite in short of the severe and constant duality of our young women it must not be supposed that their life had not many personal confluents and tributaries individual and original as miss chancellor was universally acknowledged to be she was yet a typical bostonian and as a typical bostonian she could not fail to belong in some degree to a set it had been said of her that she was in it but not of it but she was of it enough to go occasionally into other houses and to receive their occupants in her own it was her belief that she filled her teapot with the spoon of hospitality and made a good many select spirits feel that they were welcome under her roof at convenient hours she had a preference for what she called real people and there were several whose reality she had tested by arts known to herself this little society was rather suburban and miscellaneous it was prolific in ladies who trotted about early and late with books from the athenæum nursed behind their muff or little nosegays of exquisite flowers that they were carrying as presents to each other verena who when olive was not with her indulged in a good deal of desultory contemplation at the window saw them pass the house in charles street always apparently straining a little as if they might be too late for something at almost any time for she envied their preoccupation she would have taken the chance with them very often when she described them to her mother mrs tarrant didnt know who they were there were even days she had so many discouragements when it seemed as if she didnt want to know so long as they were not some one else it seemed to be no use that they were themselves whoever they were they were sure to have that defect even after all her mothers disquisitions verena had but vague ideas as to whom she would have liked them to be and it was only when the girl talked of the concerts to all of which olive subscribed and conducted her inseparable friend that mrs tarrant appeared to feel in any degree that her daughter was living up to the standard formed for her in their cambridge home as all the world knows the opportunities in boston for hearing good music are numerous and excellent and it had long been miss chancellors practice to cultivate the best she went in as the phrase is for the superior programmes and that high dim dignified music hall which has echoed in its time to so much eloquence and so much melody and of which the very proportions and colour seem to teach respect and attention shed the protection of its illuminated cornice this winter upon no faces more intelligently upturned than those of the young women for whom bach and beethoven only repeated in a myriad forms the idea that was always with them symphonies and fugues only stimulated their convictions excited their revolutionary passion led their imagination further in the direction in which it was always pressing it lifted them to immeasurable heights and as they sat looking at the great florid sombre organ overhanging the bronze statue of beethoven they felt that this was the only temple in which the votaries of their creed could worship  and yet their music was not their greatest joy for they had two others which they cultivated at least as zealously one of these was simply the society of old miss birdseye of whom olive saw more this winter than she had ever seen before it had become apparent that her long and beautiful career was drawing to a close her earnest unremitting work was over her oldfashioned weapons were broken and dull olive would have liked to hang them up as venerable relics of a patient fight and this was what she seemed to do when she made the poor lady relate her battlesnever glorious and brilliant but obscure and wastefully heroiccall back the figures of her companions in arms exhibit her medals and scars miss birdseye knew that her uses were ended she might pretend still to go about the business of unpopular causes might fumble for papers in her immemorial satchel and think she had important appointments might sign petitions attend conventions say to doctor prance that if she would only make her sleep she should live to see a great many improvements yet she ached and was weary growing almost as glad to look back a great anomaly for miss birdseye as to look forward she let herself be coddled now by her friends of the new generation there were days when she seemed to want nothing better than to sit by olives fire and ramble on about the old struggles with a vague comfortable senseno physical rapture of miss birdseyes could be very acuteof immunity from wet feet from the draughts that prevail at thin meetings of independence of streetcars that would probably arrive overflowing and also a pleased perception not that she was an example to these fresh lives which began with more advantages than hers but that she was in some degree an encouragement as she helped them to measure the way the new truths had advancedbeing able to tell them of such a different state of things when she was a young lady the daughter of a very talented teacher indeed her mother had been a teacher too down in connecticut she had always had for olive a kind of aroma of martyrdom and her battered unremunerated unpensioned old age brought angry tears springing from depths of outraged theory into miss chancellors eyes for verena too she was a picturesque humanitary figure verena had been in the habit of meeting martyrs from her childhood up but she had seen none with so many reminiscences as miss birdseye or who had been so nearly scorched by penal fires she had had escapes in the early days of abolitionism which it was a marvel she could tell with so little implication that she had shown courage she had roamed through certain parts of the south carrying the bible to the slave and more than one of her companions in the course of these expeditions had been tarred and feathered she herself at one season had spent a month in a georgian jail she had preached temperance in irish circles where the doctrine was received with missiles she had interfered between wives and husbands mad with drink she had taken filthy children picked up in the street to her own poor rooms and had removed their pestilent rags and washed their sore bodies with slippery little hands in her own person she appeared to olive and verena a representative of suffering humanity the pity they felt for her was part of their pity for all who were weakest and most hardly used and it struck miss chancellor more especially that this frumpy little missionary was the last link in a tradition and that when she should be called away the heroic age of new england lifethe age of plain living and high thinking of pure ideals and earnest effort of moral passion and noble experimentwould effectually be closed it was the perennial freshness of miss birdseyes faith that had had such a contagion for these modern maidens the unquenched flame of her transcendentalism the simplicity of her vision the way in which in spite of mistakes deceptions the changing fashions of reform which make the remedies of a previous generation look as ridiculous as their bonnets the only thing that was still actual for her was the elevation of the species by the reading of emerson and the frequentation of tremont temple olive had been active enough for years in the citymissions she too had scoured dirty children and in squalid lodginghouses had gone into rooms where the domestic situation was strained and the noises made the neighbours turn pale but she reflected that after such exertions she had the refreshment of a pretty house a drawingroom full of flowers a crackling hearth where she threw in pinecones and made them snap an imported teaservice a chickering piano and the deutsche rundschau whereas miss birdseye had only a bare vulgar room with a hideous flowered carpet it looked like a dentists a cold furnace the evening paper and doctor prance olive and verena were present at another of her gatherings before the winter ended it resembled the occasion that we described at the beginning of this history with the difference that mrs farrinder was not there to oppress the company with her greatness and that verena made a speech without the cooperation of her father this young lady had delivered herself with even finer effect than before and olive could see how much she had gained in confidence and range of allusion since the educative process in charles street began her motif was now a kind of unprepared tribute to miss birdseye the fruit of the occasion and of the unanimous tenderness of the younger members of the circle which made her a willing mouthpiece she pictured her laborious career her early associates eliza p moseley was not neglected as verena passed her difficulties and dangers and triumphs her humanising effect upon so many her serene and honoured old ageexpressed in short as one of the ladies said just the very way they all felt about her verenas face brightened and grew triumphant as she spoke but she brought tears into the eyes of most of the others it was olives opinion that nothing could be more graceful and touching and she saw that the impression made was now deeper than on the former evening miss birdseye went about with her eighty years of innocence her undiscriminating spectacles asking her friends if it wasnt perfectly splendid she took none of it to herself she regarded it only as a brilliant expression of verenas gift olive thought afterwards that if a collection could only be taken up on the spot the good lady would be made easy for the rest of her days then she remembered that most of her guests were as impecunious as herself  i have intimated that our young friends had a source of fortifying emotion which was distinct from the hours they spent with beethoven and bach or in hearing miss birdseye describe concord as it used to be this consisted in the wonderful insight they had obtained into the history of feminine anguish they perused that chapter perpetually and zealously and they derived from it the purest part of their mission olive had pored over it so long so earnestly that she was now in complete possession of the subject it was the one thing in life which she felt she had really mastered she was able to exhibit it to verena with the greatest authority and accuracy to lead her up and down in and out through all the darkest and most tortuous passages we know that she was without belief in her own eloquence but she was very eloquent when she reminded verena how the exquisite weakness of women had never been their defence but had only exposed them to sufferings more acute than masculine grossness can conceive their odious partner had trampled upon them from the beginning of time and their tenderness their abnegation had been his opportunity all the bullied wives the stricken mothers the dishonoured deserted maidens who have lived on the earth and longed to leave it passed and repassed before her eyes and the interminable dim procession seemed to stretch out a myriad hands to her she sat with them at their trembling vigils listened for the tread the voice at which they grew pale and sick walked with them by the dark waters that offered to wash away misery and shame took with them even when the vision grew intense the last shuddering leap she had analysed to an extraordinary fineness their susceptibility their softness she knew or she thought she knew all the possible tortures of anxiety of suspense and dread and she had made up her mind that it was women in the end who had paid for everything in the last resort the whole burden of the human lot came upon them it pressed upon them far more than on the others the intolerable load of fate it was they who sat cramped and chained to receive it it was they who had done all the waiting and taken all the wounds the sacrifices the blood the tears the terrors were theirs their organism was in itself a challenge to suffering and men had practised upon it with an impudence that knew no bounds as they were the weakest most had been wrung from them and as they were the most generous they had been most deceived olive chancellor would have rested her case had it been necessary on those general facts and her simple and comprehensive contention was that the peculiar wretchedness which had been the very essence of the feminine lot was a monstrous artificial imposition crying aloud for redress she was willing to admit that women too could be bad that there were many about the world who were false immoral vile but their errors were as nothing to their sufferings they had expiated in advance an eternity if need be of misconduct olive poured forth these views to her listening and responsive friend she presented them again and again and there was no light in which they did not seem to palpitate with truth verena was immensely wrought upon a subtle fire passed into her she was not so hungry for revenge as olive but at the last before they went to europe i shall take no place to describe the manner in which she threw herself into that project she quite agreed with her companion that after so many ages of wrong it would also be after the european journey men must take their turn men must pay     book second     xxi   basil ransom lived in new york rather far to the eastward and in the upper reaches of the town he occupied two small shabby rooms in a somewhat decayed mansion which stood next to the corner of the second avenue the corner itself was formed by a considerable grocers shop the near neighbourhood of which was fatal to any pretensions ransom and his fellowlodgers might have had in regard to gentility of situation the house had a red rusty face and faded green shutters of which the slats were limp and at variance with each other in one of the lower windows was suspended a flyblown card with the words table board affixed in letters cut not very neatly out of coloured paper of graduated tints and surrounded with a small band of stamped gilt the two sides of the shop were protected by an immense penthouse shed which projected over a greasy pavement and was supported by wooden posts fixed in the curbstone beneath it on the dislocated flags barrels and baskets were freely and picturesquely grouped an open cellarway yawned beneath the feet of those who might pause to gaze too fondly on the savoury wares displayed in the window a strong odour of smoked fish combined with a fragrance of molasses hung about the spot the pavement toward the gutters was fringed with dirty panniers heaped with potatoes carrots and onions and a smart bright waggon with the horse detached from the shafts drawn up on the edge of the abominable road it contained holes and ruts a foot deep and immemorial accumulations of stagnant mud imparted an idle rural pastoral air to a scene otherwise perhaps expressive of a rank civilisation the establishment was of the kind known to new yorkers as a dutch grocery and redfaced yellowhaired barearmed vendors might have been observed to lounge in the doorway i mention it not on account of any particular influence it may have had on the life or the thoughts of basil ransom but for old acquaintance sake and that of local colour besides which a figure is nothing without a setting and our young man came and went every day with rather an indifferent unperceiving step it is true among the objects i have briefly designated one of his rooms was directly above the streetdoor of the house such a dormitory when it is so exiguous is called in the nomenclature of new york a hall bedroom the sittingroom beside it was slightly larger and they both commanded a row of tenements no less degenerate than ransoms own habitationhouses built forty years before and already sere and superannuated these were also painted red and the bricks were accentuated by a white line they were garnished on the first floor with balconies covered with small tin roofs striped in different colours and with an elaborate iron latticework which gave them a repressive cagelike appearance and caused them slightly to resemble the little boxes for peeping unseen into the street which are a feature of oriental towns such posts of observation commanded a view of the grocery on the corner of the relaxed and disjointed roadway enlivened at the curbstone with an occasional ashbarrel or with gaslamps drooping from the perpendicular and westward at the end of the truncated vista of the fantastic skeleton of the elevated railway overhanging the transverse longitudinal street which it darkened and smothered with the immeasurable spinal column and myriad clutching paws of an antediluvian monster if the opportunity were not denied me here i should like to give some account of basil ransoms interior of certain curious persons of both sexes for the most part not favourites of fortune who had found an obscure asylum there some picture of the crumpled little table dhôte at two dollars and a half a week where everything felt sticky which went forward in the lowceiled basement under the conduct of a couple of shuffling negresses who mingled in the conversation and indulged in low mysterious chuckles when it took a facetious turn but we need in strictness concern ourselves with it no further than to gather the implication that the young mississippian even a year and a half after that momentous visit of his to boston had not made his profession very lucrative  he had been diligent he had been ambitious but he had not yet been successful during the few weeks preceding the moment at which we meet him again he had even begun to lose faith altogether in his earthly destiny it became much of a question with him whether success in any form was written there whether for a hungry young mississippian without means without friends wanting too in the highest energy the wisdom of the serpent personal arts and national prestige the game of life was to be won in new york he had been on the point of giving it up and returning to the home of his ancestors where as he heard from his mother there was still just a sufficient supply of hot corncake to support existence he had never believed much in his luck but during the last year it had been guilty of aberrations surprising even to a constant an imperturbable victim of fate not only had he not extended his connexion but he had lost most of the little business which was an object of complacency to him a twelvemonth before he had had none but small jobs and he had made a mess of more than one of them such accidents had not had a happy effect upon his reputation he had been able to perceive that this fair flower may be nipped when it is so tender a bud as scarcely to be palpable he had formed a partnership with a person who seemed likely to repair some of his deficienciesa young man from rhode island acquainted according to his own expression with the inside track but this gentleman himself as it turned out would have been better for a good deal of remodelling and ransoms principal deficiency which was after all that of cash was not less apparent to him after his colleague prior to a sudden and unexplained departure for europe had drawn the slender accumulations of the firm out of the bank ransom sat for hours in his office waiting for clients who either did not come or if they did come did not seem to find him encouraging as they usually left him with the remark that they would think what they would do they thought to little purpose and seldom reappeared so that at last he began to wonder whether there were not a prejudice against his southern complexion perhaps they didnt like the way he spoke if they could show him a better way he was willing to adopt it but the manner of new york could not be acquired by precept and example somehow was not in this case contagious he wondered whether he were stupid and unskilled and he was finally obliged to confess to himself that he was unpractical  this confession was in itself a proof of the fact for nothing could be less fruitful than such a speculation terminating in such a way he was perfectly aware that he cared a great deal for the theory and so his visitors must have thought when they found him with one of his long legs twisted round the other reading a volume of de tocqueville that was the land of reading he liked he had thought a great deal about social and economical questions forms of government and the happiness of peoples the convictions he had arrived at were not such as mix gracefully with the timehonoured verities a young lawyer looking out for business is in the habit of taking for granted but he had to reflect that these doctrines would probably not contribute any more to his prosperity in mississippi than in new york indeed he scarcely could think of the country where they would be a particular advantage to him it came home to him that his opinions were stiff whereas in comparison his effort was lax and he accordingly began to wonder whether he might not make a living by his opinions he had always had a desire for public life to cause ones ideas to be embodied in national conduct appeared to him the highest form of human enjoyment but there was little enough that was public in his solitary studies and he asked himself what was the use of his having an office at all and why he might not as well carry on his profession at the astor library where in his spare hours and on chance holidays he did an immense deal of suggestive reading he took copious notes and memoranda and these things sometimes shaped themselves in a way that might possibly commend them to the editors of periodicals readers perhaps would come if clients didnt so he produced with a great deal of labour halfadozen articles from which when they were finished it seemed to him that he had omitted all the points he wished most to make and addressed them to the powers that preside over weekly and monthly publications they were all declined with thanks and he would have been forced to believe that the accent of his languid clime brought him luck as little under the pen as on the lips had not another explanation been suggested by one of the more explicit of his oracles in relation to a paper on the rights of minorities this gentleman pointed out that his doctrines were about three hundred years behind the age doubtless some magazine of the sixteenth century would have been very happy to print them this threw light on his own suspicion that he was attached to causes that could only in the nature of things be unpopular the disagreeable editor was right about his being out of date only he had got the time wrong he had come centuries too soon he was not too old but too new such an impression however would not have prevented him from going into politics if there had been any other way to represent constituencies than by being elected people might be found eccentric enough to vote for him in mississippi but meanwhile where should he find the twentydollar greenbacks which it was his ambition to transmit from time to time to his female relations confined so constantly to a farinaceous diet it came over him with some force that his opinions would not yield interest and the evaporation of this pleasing hypothesis made him feel like a man in an open boat at sea who should just have parted with his last rag of canvas  i shall not attempt a complete description of ransoms illstarred views being convinced that the reader will guess them as he goes for they had a frolicsome ingenious way of peeping out of the young mans conversation i shall do them sufficient justice in saying that he was by natural disposition a good deal of a stoic and that as the result of a considerable intellectual experience he was in social and political matters a reactionary i suppose he was very conceited for he was much addicted to judging his age he thought it talkative querulous hysterical maudlin full of false ideas of unhealthy germs of extravagant dissipated habits for which a great reckoning was in store he was an immense admirer of the late thomas carlyle and was very suspicious of the encroachments of modern democracy i know not exactly how these queer heresies had planted themselves but he had a longish pedigree it had flowered at one time with english royalists and cavaliers and he seemed at moments to be inhabited by some transmitted spirit of a robust but narrow ancestor some broadfaced wigwearer or swordbearer with a more primitive conception of manhood than our modern temperament appears to require and a programme of human felicity much less varied he liked his pedigree he revered his forefathers and he rather pitied those who might come after him in saying so however i betray him a little for he never mentioned such feelings as these though he thought the age too talkative as i have hinted he liked to talk as well as any one but he could hold his tongue if that were more expressive and he usually did so when his perplexities were greatest he had been sitting for several evenings in a beercellar smoking his pipe with a profundity of reticence this attitude was so unbroken that it marked a crisisthe complete the acute consciousness of his personal situation it was the cheapest way he knew of spending an evening at this particular establishment the schoppen were very tall and the beer was very good and as the host and most of the guests were german and their colloquial tongue was unknown to him he was not drawn into any undue expenditure of speech he watched his smoke and he thought thought so hard that at last he appeared to himself to have exhausted the thinkable when this moment of combined relief and dismay arrived on the last of the evenings that we are concerned with he took his way down third avenue and reached his humble dwelling till within a short time there had been a resource for him at such an hour and in such a mood a little varietyactress who lived in the house and with whom he had established the most cordial relations was often having her supper she took it somewhere every night after the theatre in the dim close diningroom and he used to drop in and talk to her but she had lately married to his great amusement and her husband had taken her on a weddingtour which was to be at the same time professional on this occasion he mounted with rather a heavy tread to his rooms where on the rickety writingtable in the parlour he found a note from mrs luna i need not reproduce it in extenso a pale reflexion of it will serve she reproached him with neglecting her wanted to know what had become of him whether he had grown too fashionable for a person who cared only for serious society she accused him of having changed and inquired as to the reason of his coldness was it too much to ask whether he could tell her at least in what manner she had offended him she used to think they were so much in sympathyhe expressed her own ideas about everything so vividly she liked intellectual companionship and she had none now she hoped very much he would come and see heras he used to do six months beforethe following evening and however much she might have sinned or he might have altered she was at least always his affectionate cousin adeline  what the deuce does she want of me now it was with this somewhat ungracious exclamation that he tossed away his cousin adelines missive the gesture might have indicated that he meant to take no notice of her nevertheless after a day had elapsed he presented himself before her he knew what she wanted of oldthat is a year ago she had wanted him to look after her property and to be tutor to her son he had lent himself goodnaturedly to this desirehe was touched by so much confidencebut the experiment had speedily collapsed mrs lunas affairs were in the hands of trustees who had complete care of them and ransom instantly perceived that his function would be simply to meddle in things that didnt concern him the levity with which she had exposed him to the derision of the lawful guardians of her fortune opened his eyes to some of the dangers of cousinship nevertheless he said to himself that he might turn an honest penny by giving an hour or two every day to the education of her little boy but this too proved a brief illusion ransom had to find his time in the afternoon he left his business at five oclock and remained with his young kinsman till the hour of dinner at the end of a few weeks he thought himself lucky in retiring without broken shins that newtons little nature was remarkable had often been insisted on by his mother but it was remarkable ransom saw for the absence of any of the qualities which attach a teacher to a pupil he was in truth an insufferable child entertaining for the latin language a personal physical hostility which expressed itself in convulsions of rage during these paroxysms he kicked furiously at every one and everythingat poor rannie at his mother at messrs andrews and stoddard at the illustrious men of rome at the universe in general to which as he lay on his back on the carpet he presented a pair of singularly active little heels mrs luna had a way of being present at his lessons and when they passed as sooner or later they were sure to into the stage i have described she interceded for her overwrought darling reminded ransom that these were the signs of an exquisite sensibility begged that the child might be allowed to rest a little and spent the remainder of the time in conversation with the preceptor it came to seem to him very soon that he was not earning his fee besides which it was disagreeable to him to have pecuniary relations with a lady who had not the art of concealing from him that she liked to place him under obligations he resigned his tutorship and drew a long breath having a vague feeling that he had escaped a danger he could not have told you exactly what it was and he had a certain sentimental provincial respect for women which even prevented him from attempting to give a name to it in his own thoughts he was addicted with the ladies to the old forms of address and of gallantry he held that they were delicate agreeable creatures whom providence had placed under the protection of the bearded sex and it was not merely a humorous idea with him that whatever might be the defects of southern gentlemen they were at any rate remarkable for their chivalry he was a man who still in a slangy age could pronounce that word with a perfectly serious face  this boldness did not prevent him from thinking that women were essentially inferior to men and infinitely tiresome when they declined to accept the lot which men had made for them he had the most definite notions about their place in nature in society and was perfectly easy in his mind as to whether it excluded them from any proper homage the chivalrous man paid that tax with alacrity he admitted their rights these consisted in a standing claim to the generosity and tenderness of the stronger race the exercise of such feelings was full of advantage for both sexes and they flowed most freely of course when women were gracious and grateful it may be said that he had a higher conception of politeness than most of the persons who desired the advent of female lawmakers when i have added that he hated to see women eager and argumentative and thought that their softness and docility were the inspiration the opportunity the highest of man i shall have sketched a state of mind which will doubtless strike many readers as painfully crude it had prevented basil ransom at any rate from putting the dots on his is as the french say in this gradual discovery that mrs luna was making love to him the process went on a long time before he became aware of it he had perceived very soon that she was a tremendously familiar little womanthat she took more rapidly than he had ever known a high degree of intimacy for granted but as she had seemed to him neither very fresh nor very beautiful so he could not easily have represented to himself why she should take it into her head to marry it would never have occurred to him to doubt that she wanted marriage an obscure and penniless mississippian with womenkind of his own to provide for he could not guess that he answered to a certain secret ideal of mrs lunas who loved the landed gentry even when landless who adored a southerner under any circumstances who thought her kinsman a fine manly melancholy disinterested type and who was sure that her views of public matters the questions of the age the vulgar character of modern life would meet with a perfect response in his mind she could see by the way he talked that he was a conservative and this was the motto inscribed upon her own silken banner she took this unpopular line both by temperament and by reaction from her sisters extreme views the sight of the dreadful people that they brought about her in reality olive was distinguished and discriminating and adeline was the dupe of confusions in which the worse was apt to be mistaken for the better she talked to ransom about the inferiority of republics the distressing persons she had met abroad in the legations of the united states the bad manners of servants and shopkeepers in that country the hope she entertained that the good old families would make a stand but he never suspected that she cultivated these topics her treatment of them struck him as highly comical for the purpose of leading him to the altar of beguiling the way least of all could he suppose that she would be indifferent to his want of incomea point in which he failed to do her justice for thinking the fact that he had remained poor a proof of delicacy in that shopkeeping age it gave her much pleasure to reflect that as newtons little property was settled on him with safeguards which showed how longheaded poor mr luna had been and largehearted too since to what he left her no disagreeable conditions such as eternal mourning for instance were attachedthat as newton i say enjoyed the pecuniary independence which befitted his character her own income was ample even for two and she might give herself the luxury of taking a husband who should owe her something basil ransom did not divine all this but he divined that it was not for nothing that mrs luna wrote him little notes every other day that she proposed to drive him in the park at unnatural hours and that when he said he had his business to attend to she replied oh a plague on your business i am sick of that wordone hears of nothing else in america there are ways of getting on without business if you would only take them he seldom answered her notes and he disliked extremely the way in which in spite of her love of form and order she attempted to clamber in at the window of ones house when one had locked the door so that he began to interspace his visits considerably and at last made them very rare when i reflect on his habits of almost superstitious politeness to women it comes over me that some very strong motive must have operated to make him give his friendlyhis only too friendlycousin the cold shoulder nevertheless when he received her reproachful letter after it had had time to work a little he said to himself that he had perhaps been unjust and even brutal and as he was easily touched by remorse of this kind he took up the broken thread     xxii   as he sat with mrs luna in her little back drawingroom under the lamp he felt rather more tolerant than before of the pressure she could not help putting upon him several months had elapsed and he was no nearer to the sort of success he had hoped for it stole over him gently that there was another sort pretty visibly open to him not so elevated nor so manly it is true but on which he should after all perhaps be able to reconcile it with his honour to fall back mrs luna had had an inspiration for once in her life she had held her tongue she had not made him a scene there had been no question of an explanation she had received him as if he had been there the day before with the addition of a spice of mysterious melancholy she might have made up her mind that she had lost him as what she had hoped but that it was better than desolation to try and keep him as a friend it was as if she wished him to see now how she tried she was subdued and consolatory she waited upon him moved away a screen that intercepted the fire remarked that he looked very tired and rang for some tea she made no inquiry about his affairs never asked if he had been busy and prosperous and this reticence struck him as unexpectedly delicate and discreet it was as if she had guessed by a subtle feminine faculty that his professional career was nothing to boast of there was a simplicity in him which permitted him to wonder whether she had not improved the lamplight was soft the fire crackled pleasantly everything that surrounded him betrayed a womans taste and touch the place was decorated and cushioned in perfection delightfully private and personal the picture of a wellappointed home mrs luna had complained of the difficulties of installing ones self in america but ransom remembered that he had received an impression similar to this in her sisters house in boston and reflected that these ladies had as a familytrait the art of making themselves comfortable it was better for a winters evening than the german beercellar mrs lunas tea was excellent and his hostess herself appeared tonight almost as amiable as the varietyactress at the end of an hour he felt i will not say almost marriageable but almost married images of leisure played before him leisure in which he saw himself covering foolscap paper with his views on several subjects and with favourable illustrations of southern eloquence it became tolerably vivid to him that if editors wouldnt print ones lucubrations it would be a comfort to feel that one was able to publish them at ones own expense  he had a moment of almost complete illusion mrs luna had taken up her bit of crochet she was sitting opposite to him on the other side of the fire her white hands moved with little jerks as she took her stitches and her rings flashed and twinkled in the light of the hearth her head fell a little to one side exhibiting the plumpness of her chin and neck and her dropped eyes it gave her a little modest air rested quietly on her work a silence of a few moments had fallen upon their talk and adelinewho decidedly had improvedappeared also to feel the charm of it not to wish to break it basil ransom was conscious of all this and at the same time he was vaguely engaged in a speculation if it gave one time if it gave one leisure was not that in itself a high motive thorough study of the question he cared for mostwas not the chance for that an infinitely desirable good he seemed to see himself to feel himself in that very chair in the evenings of the future reading some indispensable book in the still lamplightmrs luna knew where to get such pretty mellowing shades should he not be able to act in that way upon the public opinion of his time to check certain tendencies to point out certain dangers to indulge in much salutary criticism was it not ones duty to put ones self in the best conditions for such action and as the silence continued he almost fell to musing on his duty almost persuaded himself that the moral law commanded him to marry mrs luna she looked up presently from her work their eyes met and she smiled he might have believed she had guessed what he was thinking of this idea startled him alarmed him a little so that when mrs luna said with her sociable manner there is nothing i like so much of a winters night as a cosy têteàtête by the fire its quite like darby and joan what a pity the kettle has ceased singingwhen she uttered these insinuating words he gave himself a little imperceptible shake which was however enough to break the spell and made no response more direct than to ask her in a moment in a tone of cold mild curiosity whether she had lately heard from her sister and how long miss chancellor intended to remain in europe  well you have been living in your hole mrs luna exclaimed olive came home six weeks ago how long did you expect her to endure it  i am sure i dont know i have never been there ransom replied  yes thats what i like you for mrs luna remarked sweetly if a man is nice without it its such a pleasant change  the young man started then gave a natural laugh lord how few reasons there must be  oh i mention that one because i can tell it i shouldnt care to tell the others  i am glad you have some to fall back upon the day i should go ransom went on i thought you thought so much of europe  so i do but it isnt everything said mrs luna philosophically you had better go there with me she added with a certain inconsequence  one would go to the end of the world with so irresistible a lady ransom exclaimed falling into the tone which mrs luna always found so unsatisfactory it was a part of his southern gallantryhis accent always came out strongly when he said anything of that sortand it committed him to nothing in particular she had had occasion to wish more than once that he wouldnt be so beastly polite as she used to hear people say in england she answered that she didnt care about ends she cared about beginnings but he didnt take up the declaration he returned to the subject of olive wanted to know what she had done over there whether she had worked them up much  oh of course she fascinated every one said mrs luna with her grace and beauty her general style how could she help that  but did she bring them round did she swell the host that is prepared to march under her banner  i suppose she saw plenty of the strongminded plenty of vicious old maids and fanatics and frumps but i havent the least idea what she accomplishedwhat they call wonders i suppose  didnt you see her when she returned basil ransom asked  how could i see her i can see pretty far but i cant see all the way to boston and then in explaining that it was at this port that her sister had disembarked mrs luna further inquired whether he could imagine olive doing anything in a firstrate way as long as there were inferior ones of course she likes bad shipsboston steamersjust as she likes common people and redhaired hoydens and preposterous doctrines  ransom was silent a moment do you mean thearather striking young lady whom i met in boston a year ago last october what was her namemiss tarrant does miss chancellor like her as much as ever  mercy dont you know she took her to europe it was to form her mind she went didnt i tell you that last summer you used to come to see me then  oh yes i remember ransom said rather musingly and did she bring her back  gracious you dont suppose she would leave her olive thinks shes born to regenerate the world  i remember you telling me that too it comes back to me well is her mind formed  as i havent seen it i cannot tell you  arent you going on there to see  to see whether miss tarrants mind is formed mrs luna broke in i will go if you would like me to i remember your being immensely excited about her that time you met her dont you recollect that  ransom hesitated an instant i cant say i do it is too long ago  yes i have no doubt thats the way you change about women poor miss tarrant if she thinks she made an impression on you  she wont think about such things as that if her mind has been formed by your sister ransom said it does come back to me now what you told me about the growth of their intimacy and do they mean to go on living together for ever  i suppose sounless some one should take it into his head to marry verena  verenais that her name ransom asked  mrs luna looked at him with a suspended needle well have you forgotten that too you told me yourself you thought it so pretty that time in boston when you walked me up the hill ransom declared that he remembered that walk but didnt remember everything he had said to her and she suggested very satirically that perhaps he would like to marry verena himselfhe seemed so interested in her ransom shook his head sadly and said he was afraid he was not in a position to marry whereupon mrs luna asked him what he meantdid he mean after a moments hesitation that he was too poor  never in the worldi am very rich i make an enormous income the young man exclaimed so that remarking his tone and the slight flush of annoyance that rose to his face mrs luna was quick enough to judge that she had overstepped the mark she remembered she ought to have remembered before that he had never taken her in the least into his confidence about his affairs that was not the southern way and he was at least as proud as he was poor in this surmise she was just basil ransom would have despised himself if he had been capable of confessing to a woman that he couldnt make a living such questions were none of their business their business was simply to be provided for practise the domestic virtues and be charmingly grateful and there was to his sense something almost indecent in talking about them mrs luna felt doubly sorry for him as she perceived that he denied himself the luxury of sympathy that is of hers and the vague but comprehensive sigh that passed her lips as she took up her crochet again was unusually expressive of helplessness she said that of course she knew how great his talents werehe could do anything he wanted and basil ransom wondered for a moment whether if she were to ask him pointblank to marry her it would be consistent with the high courtesy of a southern gentleman to refuse after she should be his wife he might of course confess to her that he was too poor to marry for in that relation even a southern gentleman of the highest tone must sometimes unbend but he didnt in the least long for this arrangement and was conscious that the most pertinent sequel to her conjecture would be for him to take up his hat and walk away  within five minutes however he had come to desire to do this almost as little as to marry mrs luna he wanted to hear more about the girl who lived with olive chancellor something had revived in himan old curiosity an image half effacedwhen he learned that she had come back to america he had taken a wrong impression from what mrs luna said nearly a year before about her sisters visit to europe he had supposed it was to be a long absence that miss chancellor wanted perhaps to get the little prophetess away from her parents possibly even away from some amorous entanglement then no doubt they wanted to study up the womanquestion with the facilities that europe would offer he didnt know much about europe but he had an idea that it was a great place for facilities his knowledge of miss chancellors departure accompanied by her young companion had checked at the time on ransoms part a certain habit of idle but none the less entertaining retrospect his life on the whole had not been rich in episode and that little chapter of his visit to his queer clever capricious cousin with his evening at miss birdseyes and his glimpse repeated on the morrow of the strange beautiful ridiculous redhaired young improvisatrice unrolled itself in his memory like a page of interesting fiction the page seemed to fade however when he heard that the two girls had gone for an indefinite time to unknown lands this carried them out of his range spoiled the perspective diminished their actuality so that for several months past with his increase of anxiety about his own affairs and the low pitch of his spirits he had not thought at all about verena tarrant the fact that she was once more in boston with a certain contiguity that it seemed to imply between boston and new york presented itself now as important and agreeable he was conscious that this was rather an anomaly and his consciousness made him had already made him dissimulate slightly he did not pick up his hat to go he sat in his chair taking his chance of the tax which mrs luna might lay upon his urbanity he remembered that he had not made as yet any very eager inquiry about newton who at this late hour had succumbed to the only influence that tames the untamable and was sleeping the sleep of childhood if not of innocence ransom repaired his neglect in a manner which elicited the most copious response from his hostess the boy had had a good many tutors since ransom gave him up and it could not be said that his education languished mrs luna spoke with pride of the manner in which he went through them if he did not master his lessons he mastered his teachers and she had the happy conviction that she gave him every advantage ransoms delay was diplomatic but at the end of ten minutes he returned to the young ladies in boston he asked why with their aggressive programme one hadnt begun to feel their onset why the echoes of miss tarrants eloquence hadnt reached his ears hadnt she come out yet in public was she not coming to stir them up in new york he hoped she hadnt broken down  she didnt seem to break down last summer at the female convention mrs luna replied have you forgotten that too didnt i tell you of the sensation she produced there and of what i heard from boston about it do you mean to say i didnt give you that transcript with the report of her great speech it was just before they sailed for europe she went off with flying colours in a blaze of fireworks ransom protested that he had not heard this affair mentioned till that moment and then when they compared dates they found it had taken place just after his last visit to mrs luna this of course gave her a chance to say that he had treated her even worse than she supposed it had been her impression at any rate that they had talked together about verenas sudden bound into fame apparently she confounded him with some one else that was very possible he was not to suppose that he occupied such a distinct place in her mind especially when she might die twenty deaths before he came near her ransom demurred to the implication that miss tarrant was famous if she were famous wouldnt she be in the new york papers he hadnt seen her there and he had no recollection of having encountered any mention at the time last june was it of her exploits at the female convention a local reputation doubtless she had but that had been the case a year and a half before and what was expected of her then was to become a firstclass national glory he was willing to believe that she had created some excitement in boston but he shouldnt attach much importance to that till one began to see her photograph in the stores of course one must give her time but he had supposed miss chancellor was going to put her through faster  if he had taken a contradictious tone on purpose to draw mrs luna out he could not have elicited more of the information he desired it was perfectly true that he had seen no reference to verenas performances in the preceding june there were periods when the newspapers seemed to him so idiotic that for weeks he never looked at one he learned from mrs luna that it was not olive who had sent her the transcript and in letters had added some private account of the doings at the convention to the testimony of that amiable sheet she had been indebted for this service to a gentlemanfriend who wrote her everything that happened in boston and what every one had every day for dinner not that it was necessary for her happiness to know but the gentleman she spoke of didnt know what to invent to please her a bostonian couldnt imagine that one didnt want to know and that was their idea of ingratiating themselves or at any rate it was his poor man olive would never have gone into particulars about verena she regarded her sister as quite too much one of the profane and knew adeline couldnt understand why when she took to herself a bosomfriend she should have been at such pains to select her in just the most dreadful class in the community verena was a perfect little adventuress and quite thirdrate into the bargain but of course she was a pretty girl enough if one cared for hair of the colour of cochineal as for her people they were too absolutely awful it was exactly as if she mrs luna had struck up an intimacy with the daughter of her chiropodist it took olive to invent such monstrosities and to think she was doing something great for humanity when she did so though in spite of her wanting to turn everything over and put the lowest highest she could be just as contemptuous and invidious when it came to really mixing as if she were some grand old duchess she must do her the justice to say that she hated the tarrants the father and mother but all the same she let verena run to and fro between charles street and the horrible hole they lived in and adeline knew from that gentleman who wrote so copiously that the girl now and then spent a week at a time at cambridge her mother who had been ill for some weeks wanted her to sleep there mrs luna knew further by her correspondent that verena hador had had the winter beforea great deal of attention from gentlemen she didnt know how she worked that into the idea that the female sex was sufficient to itself but she had grounds for saying that this was one reason why olive had taken her abroad she was afraid verena would give in to some man and she wanted to make a break of course any such giving in would be very awkward for a young woman who shrieked out on platforms that old maids were the highest type adeline guessed olive had perfect control of her now unless indeed she used the expeditions to cambridge as a cover for meeting gentlemen she was an artful little minx and cared as much for the rights of women as she did for the panama canal the only right of a woman she wanted was to climb up on top of something where the men could look at her she would stay with olive as long as it served her purpose because olive with her great respectability could push her and counteract the effect of her low relations to say nothing of paying all her expenses and taking her the tour of europe but mark my words said mrs luna she will give olive the greatest cut she has ever had in her life she will run off with some liontamer she will marry a circusman and mrs luna added that it would serve olive chancellor right but she would take it hard look out for tantrums then  basil ransoms emotions were peculiar while his hostess delivered herself in a manner at once casual and emphatic of these rather insidious remarks he took them all in for they represented to him certain very interesting facts but he perceived at the same time that mrs luna didnt know what she was talking about he had seen verena tarrant only twice in his life but it was no use telling him that she was an adventuressthough certainly it was very likely she would end by giving miss chancellor a cut he chuckled with a certain grimness as this image passed before him it was not unpleasing the idea that he should be avenged for it would avenge him to know it upon the wanton young woman who had invited him to come and see her in order simply to slap his face but he had an odd sense of having lost something in not knowing of the other girls appearance at the womens conventiona vague feeling that he had been cheated and trifled with the complaint was idle inasmuch as it was not probable he could have gone to boston to listen to her but it represented to him that he had not shared even dimly and remotely in an event which concerned her very closely why should he share and what was more natural than that the things which concerned her closely should not concern him at all this question came to him only as he walked home that evening for the moment it remained quite in abeyance therefore he was free to feel also that his imagination had been rather starved by his ignorance of the fact that she was near him again comparatively that she was in the dimness of the horizon no longer beyond the curve of the globe and yet he had not perceived it this sense of personal loss as i have called it made him feel further that he had something to make up to recover he could scarcely have told you how he would go about it but the idea formless though it was led him in a direction very different from the one he had been following a quarter of an hour before as he watched it dance before him he fell into another silence in the midst of which mrs luna gave him another mystic smile the effect of it was to make him rise to his feet the whole landscape of his mind had suddenly been illuminated decidedly it was not his duty to marry mrs luna in order to have means to pursue his studies he jerked himself back as if he had been on the point of it  you dont mean to say you are going already i havent said half i wanted to she exclaimed  he glanced at the clock saw it was not yet late took a turn about the room then sat down again in a different place while she followed him with her eyes wondering what was the matter with him ransom took good care not to ask her what it was she had still to say and perhaps it was to prevent her telling him that he now began to talk freely quickly in quite a new tone he stayed half an hour longer and made himself very agreeable it seemed to mrs luna now that he had every distinction she had known he had most that he was really a charming man he abounded in conversation till at last he took up his hat in earnest he talked about the state of the south its social peculiarities the ruin wrought by the war the dilapidated gentry the queer types of superannuated fireeaters ragged and unreconciled all the pathos and all the comedy of it making her laugh at one moment almost cry at another and say to herself throughout that when he took it into his head there was no one who could make a ladys evening pass so pleasantly it was only afterwards that she asked herself why he had not taken it into his head till the last so quickly she delighted in the dilapidated gentry her taste was completely different from her sisters who took an interest only in the lower class as it struggled to rise what adeline cared for was the fallen aristocracy it seemed to be falling everywhere very much was not basil ransom an example of it was he not like a french gentilhomme de province after the revolution or an old monarchical émigré from the languedoc the despoiled patriciate i say whose attitude was noble and touching and toward whom one might exercise a charity as discreet as their pride was sensitive in all mrs lunas visions of herself her discretion was the leading feature are you going to let ten years elapse again before you come she asked as basil ransom bade her goodnight you must let me know because between this and your next visit i shall have time to go to europe and come back i shall take care to arrive the day before  instead of answering this sally ransom said are you not going one of these days to boston are you not going to pay your sister another visit  mrs luna stared what good will that do you excuse my stupidity she added of course it gets me away thank you very much  i dont want you to go away but i want to hear more about miss olive  why in the world you know you loathe her here before ransom could reply mrs luna again overtook herself i verily believe that by miss olive you mean miss verena her eyes charged him a moment with this perverse intention then she exclaimed basil ransom are you in love with that creature  he gave a perfectly natural laugh not pleading guilty in order to practise on mrs luna but expressing the simple state of the case how should i be i have seen her but twice in my life  if you had seen her more i shouldnt be afraid fancy your wanting to pack me off to boston his hostess went on i am in no hurry to stay with olive again besides that girl takes up the whole house you had better go there yourself  i should like nothing better said ransom  perhaps you would like me to ask verena to spend a month with meit might be a way of attracting you to the house adeline went on in the tone of exuberant provocation  ransom was on the point of replying that it would be a better way than any other but he checked himself in time he had never yet even in joke made so crude so rude a speech to a lady you only knew when he was joking with women by his superadded civility i beg you to believe there is nothing i would do for any woman in the world that i wouldnt do for you he said bending for the last time over mrs lunas plump hand  i shall remember that and keep you up to it she cried after him as he went but even with this rather lively exchange of vows he felt that he had got off rather easily he walked slowly up fifth avenue into which out of adelines crossstreet he had turned by the light of a fine winter moon and at every corner he stopped a minute lingered in meditation while he exhaled a soft vague sigh this was an unconscious involuntary expression of relief such as a man might utter who had seen himself on the point of being run over and yet felt that he was whole he didnt trouble himself much to ask what had saved him whatever it was it had produced a reaction so that he felt rather ashamed of having found his lookout of late so blank by the time he reached his lodgings his ambition his resolution had rekindled he had remembered that he formerly supposed he was a man of ability that nothing particular had occurred to make him doubt it the evidence was only negative not positive and that at any rate he was young enough to have another try he whistled that night as he went to bed     xxiii   three weeks afterward he stood in front of olive chancellors house looking up and down the street and hesitating he had told mrs luna that he should like nothing better than to make another journey to boston and it was not simply because he liked it that he had come i was on the point of saying that a happy chance had favoured him but it occurs to me that one is under no obligation to call chances by nattering epithets when they have been waited for so long at any rate the darkest hour is before the dawn and a few days after that melancholy evening i have described which ransom spent in his german beercellar before a single glass soon emptied staring at his future with an unremunerated eye he found that the world appeared to have need of him yet the party as he would have said i cannot pretend that his speech was too heroic for that for whom he had transacted business in boston so many months before and who had expressed at the time but a limited appreciation of his services there had been between the lawyer and his client a divergence of judgement observing apparently that they proved more fruitful than he expected had reopened the affair and presently requested ransom to transport himself again to the sister city his errand demanded more time than before and for three days he gave it his constant attention on the fourth he found he was still detained he should have to wait till the eveningsome important papers were to be prepared he determined to treat the interval as a holiday and he wondered what one could do in boston to give ones morning a festive complexion the weather was brilliant enough to minister to any illusion and he strolled along the streets taking it in in front of the music hall and of tremont temple he stopped looking at the posters in the doorway for was it not possible that miss chancellors little friend might be just then addressing her fellowcitizens her name was absent however and this resource seemed to mock him he knew no one in the place but olive chancellor so there was no question of a visit to pay he was perfectly resolved that he would never go near her again she was doubtless a very superior being but she had been too rough with him to tempt him further politeness even a largelyinterpreted chivalry required nothing more than he had already done he had quitted her the other year without telling her that she was a vixen and that reticence was chivalrous enough there was also verena tarrant of course he saw no reason to dissemble when he spoke of her to himself and he allowed himself the entertainment of feeling that he should like very much to see her again very likely she wouldnt seem to him the same the impression she had made upon him was due to some accident of mood or circumstance and at any rate any charm she might have exhibited then had probably been obliterated by the coarsening effect of publicity and the tonic influence of his kinswoman it will be observed that in this reasoning of basil ransoms the impression was freely recognised and recognised as a phenomenon still present the attraction might have vanished as he said to himself but the mental picture of it was yet vivid the greater the pity that he couldnt call upon verena he called her by her name in his thoughts it was so pretty without calling upon olive and that olive was so disagreeable as to place that effort beyond his strength there was another consideration with ransom which eminently belonged to the man he believed that miss chancellor had conceived in the course of those few hours and in a manner that formed so absurd a sequel to her having gone out of her way to make his acquaintance such a dislike to him that it would be odious to her to see him again within her doors and he would have felt indelicate in taking warrant from her original invitation before she had seen him to inflict on her a presence which he had no reason to suppose the lapse of time had made less offensive she had given him no sign of pardon or penitence in any of the little ways that are familiar to womenby sending him a message through her sister or even a book a photograph a christmas card or a newspaper by the post he felt in a word not at liberty to ring at her door he didnt know what kind of a fit the sight of his long mississippian person would give her and it was characteristic of him that he should wish so to spare the sensibilities of a young lady whom he had not found tender being ever as willing to let women off easily in the particular case as he was fixed in the belief that the sex in general requires watching  nevertheless he found himself at the end of half an hour standing on the only spot in charles street which had any significance for him it had occurred to him that if he couldnt call upon verena without calling upon olive he should be exempt from that condition if he called upon mrs tarrant it was not her mother truly who had asked him it was the girl herself and he was conscious as a candid young american that a mother is always less accessible more guarded by social prejudice than a daughter but he was at a pass in which it was permissible to strain a point and he took his way in the direction in which he knew that cambridge lay remembering that miss tarrants invitation had reference to that quarter and that mrs luna had given him further evidence had she not said that verena often went back there for visits of several daysthat her mother had been ill and she gave her much care there was nothing inconceivable in her being engaged at that hour it was getting to be one oclock in one of those expeditionsnothing impossible in the chance that he might find her in cambridge the chance at any rate was worth taking cambridge moreover was worth seeing and it was as good a way as another of keeping his holiday it occurred to him indeed that cambridge was a big place and that he had no particular address this reflexion overtook him just as he reached olives house which oddly enough he was obliged to pass on his way to the mysterious suburb that is partly why he paused there he asked himself for a moment why he shouldnt ring the bell and obtain his needed information from the servant who would be sure to be able to give it to him he had just dismissed this method as of questionable taste when he heard the door of the house open within the deep embrasure in which in charles street the main portals are set and which are partly occupied by a flight of steps protected at the bottom by a second door whose upper half in either wing consists of a sheet of glass it was a minute before he could see who had come out and in that minute he had time to turn away and then to turn back again and to wonder which of the two inmates would appear to him or whether he should behold neither or both  the person who had issued from the house descended the steps very slowly as if on purpose to give him time to escape and when at last the glass doors were divided they disclosed a little old lady ransom was disappointed such an apparition was so scantily to his purpose but the next minute his spirits rose again for he was sure that he had seen the little old lady before she stopped on the sidewalk and looked vaguely about her in the manner of a person waiting for an omnibus or a streetcar she had a dingy looselyhabited air as if she had worn her clothes for many years and yet was even now imperfectly acquainted with them a large benignant face caged in by the glass of her spectacles which seemed to cover it almost equally everywhere and a fat rusty satchel which hung low at her side as if it wearied her to carry it this gave ransom time to recognise her he knew in boston no such figure as that save miss birdseye her party her person the exalted account miss chancellor gave of her had kept a very distinct place in his mind and while she stood there in dim circumspection she came back to him as a friend of yesterday his necessity gave a point to the reminiscences she evoked it took him only a moment to reflect that she would be able to tell him where verena tarrant was at that particular time and where if need be her parents lived her eyes rested on him and as she saw that he was looking at her she didnt go through the ceremony she had broken so completely with all conventions of removing them he evidently represented nothing to her but a sentient fellowcitizen in the enjoyment of his rights which included that of staring miss birdseyes modesty had never pretended that it was not to be publicly challenged there were so many bright new motives and ideas in the world that there might even be reasons for looking at her when ransom approached her and raising his hat with a smile said shall i stop this car for you miss birdseye she only looked at him more vaguely in her complete failure to seize the idea that this might be simply fame she had trudged about the streets of boston for fifty years and at no period had she received that amount of attention from darkeyed young men she glanced in an unprejudiced way at the big particoloured human van which now jingled toward them from out of the cambridge road well i should like to get into it if it will take me home she answered is this a south end car  the vehicle had been stopped by the conductor on his perceiving miss birdseye he evidently recognised her as a frequent passenger he went however through none of the forms of reassurance beyond remarking you want to get right in herequick but stood with his hand raised in a threatening way to the cord of his signalbell  you must allow me the honour of taking you home madam i will tell you who i am basil ransom said in obedience to a rapid reflexion he helped her into the car the conductor pressed a fraternal hand upon her back and in a moment the young man was seated beside her and the jingling had recommenced at that hour of the day the car was almost empty and they had it virtually to themselves  well i know you are some one i dont think you belong round here miss birdseye declared as they proceeded  i was once at your houseon a very interesting occasion do you remember a party you gave a year ago last october to which miss chancellor came and another young lady who made a wonderful speech  oh yes when verena tarrant moved us all so there were a good many there i dont remember all  i was one of them basil ransom said i came with miss chancellor who is a kind of relation of mine and you were very good to me  what did i do asked miss birdseye candidly then before he could answer her she recognised him i remember you now and olive bringing you youre a southern gentlemanshe told me about you afterwards you dont approve of our great struggleyou want us to be kept down the old lady spoke with perfect mildness as if she had long ago done with passion and resentment then she added well i presume we cant have the sympathy of all  doesnt it look as if you had my sympathy when i get into a car on purpose to see you homeone of the principal agitators ransom inquired laughing  did you get in on purpose  quite on purpose i am not so bad as miss chancellor thinks me  oh i presume you have your ideas said miss birdseye of course southerners have peculiar views i suppose they retain more than one might think i hope you wont ride too fari know my way round boston  dont object to me or think me officious ransom replied i want to ask you something  miss birdseye looked at him again oh yes i place you now you conversed some with doctor prance  to my great edification ransom exclaimed and i hope doctor prance is well  she looks after every ones health but her own said miss birdseye smiling when i tell her that she says she hasnt got any to look after she says shes the only woman in boston that hasnt got a doctor she was determined she wouldnt be a patient and it seemed as if the only way not to be one was to be a doctor she is trying to make me sleep thats her principal occupation  is it possible you dont sleep yet ransom asked almost tenderly  well just a little but by the time i get to sleep i have to get up i cant sleep when i want to live  you ought to come down south the young man suggested in that languid air you would doze deliciously  well i dont want to be languid said miss birdseye besides i have been down south in the old times and i cant say they let me sleep very much they were always round after me  do you mean on account of the negroes  yes i couldnt think of anything else then i carried them the bible  ransom was silent a moment then he said in a tone which evidently was carefully considerate i should like to hear all about that  well fortunately we are not required now we are required for something else and miss birdseye looked at him with a wandering tentative humour as if he would know what she meant  you mean for the other slaves he exclaimed with a laugh you can carry them all the bibles you want  i want to carry them the statutebook that must be our bible now  ransom found himself liking miss birdseye very much and it was quite without hypocrisy or a tinge too much of the local quality in his speech that he said wherever you go madam it will matter little what you carry you will always carry your goodness  for a minute she made no response then she murmured thats the way olive chancellor told me you talked  i am afraid she has told you little good of me  well i am sure she thinks she is right  thinks it said ransom why she knows it with supreme certainty by the way i hope she is well  miss birdseye stared again havent you seen her are you not visiting  oh no i am not visiting i was literally passing her house when i met you  perhaps you live here now said miss birdseye and when he had corrected this impression she added in a tone which showed with what positive confidence he had now inspired her hadnt you better drop in  it would give miss chancellor no pleasure basil ransom rejoined she regards me as an enemy in the camp  well she is very brave  precisely and i am very timid  didnt you fight once  yes but it was in such a good cause  ransom meant this allusion to the great secession and by comparison to the attitude of the resisting male laudable even as that might be to be decently jocular but miss birdseye took it very seriously and sat there for a good while as speechless as if she meant to convey that she had been going on too long now to be able to discuss the propriety of the late rebellion the young man felt that he had silenced her and he was very sorry for with all deference to the disinterested southern attitude toward the unprotected female what he had got into the car with her for was precisely to make her talk he had wished for general as well as for particular news of verena tarrant it was a topic on which he had proposed to draw miss birdseye out he preferred not to broach it himself and he waited awhile for another opening at last when he was on the point of exposing himself by a direct inquiry he reflected that the exposure would in any case not be long averted she anticipated him by saying in a manner which showed that her thoughts had continued in the same train i wonder very much that miss tarrant didnt affect you that evening  ah but she did ransom said with alacrity i thought her very charming  didnt you think her very reasonable  god forbid madam i consider women have no business to be reasonable  his companion turned upon him slowly and mildly and each of her glasses in her aspect of reproach had the glitter of an enormous tear do you regard us then simply as lovely baubles  the effect of this question as coming from miss birdseye and referring in some degree to her own venerable identity was such as to move him to irresistible laughter but he controlled himself quickly enough to say with genuine expression i regard you as the dearest thing in life the only thing which makes it worth living  worth living foryou but for us suggested miss birdseye  its worth any womans while to be admired as i admire you miss tarrant of whom we were speaking affected me as you say in this waythat i think more highly still if possible of the sex which produced such a delightful young lady  well we think everything of her here said miss birdseye it seems as if it were a real gift  does she speak oftenis there any chance of my hearing her now  she raises her voice a good deal in the places roundlike framingham and billerica it seems as if she were gathering strength just to break over boston like a wave in fact she did break last summer she is a growing power since her great success at the convention  ah her success at the convention was very great ransom inquired putting discretion into his voice  miss birdseye hesitated a moment in order to measure her response by the bounds of righteousness well she said with the tenderness of a long retrospect i have seen nothing like it since i last listened to eliza p moseley  what a pity she isnt speaking somewhere tonight ransom exclaimed  oh tonight shes out in cambridge olive chancellor mentioned that  is she making a speech there  no shes visiting her home  i thought her home was in charles street  well no thats her residenceher principal onesince she became so united to your cousin isnt miss chancellor your cousin  we dont insist on the relationship said ransom smiling are they very much united the two young ladies  you would say so if you were to see miss chancellor when verena rises to eloquence its as if the chords were strung across her own heart she seems to vibrate to echo with every word its a very close and very beautiful tie and we think everything of it here they will work together for a great good  i hope so ransom remarked but in spite of it miss tarrant spends a part of her time with her father and mother  yes she seems to have something for every one if you were to see her at home you would think she was all the daughter she leads a lovely life said miss birdseye  see her at home thats exactly what i want ransom rejoined feeling that if he was to come to this he neednt have had scruples at first i havent forgotten that she invited me when i met her  oh of course she attracts many visitors said miss birdseye limiting her encouragement to this statement  yes she must be used to admirers and where in cambridge do her family live  oh its on one of those little streets that dont seem to have very much of a name but they do call itthey do call it she meditated audibly  this process was interrupted by an abrupt allocution from the conductor i guess you change here for your place you want one of them blue cars  the good lady returned to a sense of the situation and ransom helped her out of the vehicle with the aid as before of a certain amount of propulsion from the conductor her road branched off to the right and she had to wait on the corner of a street there being as yet no blue car within hail the corner was quiet and the day favourable to patiencea day of relaxed rigour and intense brilliancy it was as if the touch of the air itself were gloved and the streetcolouring had the richness of a superficial thaw ransom of course waited with his philanthropic companion though she now protested more vigorously against the idea that a gentleman from the south should pretend to teach an old abolitionist the mysteries of boston he promised to leave her when he should have consigned her to the blue car and meanwhile they stood in the sun with their backs against an apothecarys window and she tried again at his suggestion to remember the name of doctor tarrants street i guess if you ask for doctor tarrant any one can tell you she said and then suddenly the address came to herthe residence of the mesmeric healer was in monadnoc place  but youll have to ask for that so it comes to the same she went on after this she added with a friendliness more personal aint you going to see your cousin too  not if i can help it  miss birdseye gave a little ineffectual sigh well i suppose every one must act out their ideal thats what olive chancellor does shes a very noble character  oh yes a glorious nature  you know their opinions are just the samehers and verenas miss birdseye placidly continued so why should you make a distinction  my dear madam said ransom does a woman consist of nothing but her opinions i like miss tarrants lovely face better to begin with  well she is prettylooking and miss birdseye gave another sigh as if she had had a theory submitted to herthat one about a ladys opinionswhich with all that was unfamiliar and peculiar lying behind it she was really too old to look into much it might have been the first time she really felt her age theres a blue car she said in a tone of mild relief  it will be some moments before it gets here moreover i dont believe that at bottom they are miss tarrants opinions ransom added  you mustnt think she hasnt a strong hold of them his companion exclaimed more briskly if you think she is not sincere you are very much mistaken those views are just her life  well she may bring me round to them said ransom smiling  miss birdseye had been watching her blue car the advance of which was temporarily obstructed at this she transferred her eyes to him gazing at him solemnly out of the pervasive window of her spectacles well i shouldnt wonder if she did yes that will be a good thing i dont see how you can help being a good deal shaken by her she has acted on so many  i see no doubt she will act on me then it occurred to ransom to add by the way miss birdseye perhaps you will be so kind as not to mention this meeting of ours to my cousin in case of your seeing her again i have a perfectly good conscience in not calling upon her but i shouldnt like her to think that i announced my slighting intention all over the town i dont want to offend her and she had better not know that i have been in boston if you dont tell her no one else will  do you wish me to conceal murmured miss birdseye panting a little  no i dont want you to conceal anything i only want you to let this incident passto say nothing  well i never did anything of that kind  of what kind ransom was half vexed half touched by her inability to enter into his point of view and her resistance made him hold to his idea the more it is very simple what i ask of you you are under no obligation to tell miss chancellor everything that happens to you are you  his request seemed still something of a shock to the poor old ladys candour well i see her very often and we talk a great deal and thenwont verena tell her  i have thought of thatbut i hope not  she tells her most everything their union is so close  she wont want her to be wounded ransom said ingeniously  well you are considerate and miss birdseye continued to gaze at him its a pity you cant sympathise  as i tell you perhaps miss tarrant will bring me round you have before you a possible convert ransom went on without i fear putting up the least little prayer to heaven that his dishonesty might be forgiven  i should be very happy to think thatafter i have told you her address in this secret way a smile of infinite mildness glimmered in miss birdseyes face and she added well i guess that will be your fate she has affected so many i would keep very quiet if i thought that yes she will bring you round  i will let you know as soon as she does basil ransom said here is your car at last  well i believe in the victory of the truth i wont say anything and she suffered the young man to lead her to the car which had now stopped at their corner  i hope very much i shall see you again he remarked as they went  well i am always round the streets in boston and while lifting and pushing he was helping again to insert her into the oblong receptacle she turned a little and repeated she will affect you if thats to be your secret i will keep it ransom heard her subjoin he raised his hat and waved her a farewell but she didnt see him she was squeezing further into the car and making the discovery that this time it was full and there was no seat for her surely however he said to himself every man in the place would offer his own to such an innocent old dear   end of vol i
