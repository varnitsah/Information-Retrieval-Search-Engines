63905662	reviews   to mrs carew  the apparently endless difficulties against which i have contended and am contending in the management of oscar wildes literary and dramatic property have brought me many valued friends but only one friendship which seemed as endless one friends kindness which seemed to annul the disappointments of eight years  that is why i venture to place your name on this volume with the assurance of the author himself who bequeathed to me his works and something of his indiscretion  robert ross  may 12th 1908     introduction   the editor of writings by any author not long deceased is censured sooner or later for his errors of omission or commission  i have decided to err on the side of commission and to include in the uniform edition of wildes works everything that could be identified as genuine  wildes literary reputation has survived so much that i think it proof against any exhumation of articles which he or his admirers would have preferred to forget  as a matter of fact i believe this volume will prove of unusual interest some of the reviews are curiously prophetic some are of course biassed by prejudice hostile or friendly others are conceived in the authors wittiest and happiest vein only a few are colourless and if according to lord beaconsfield the verdict of a continental nation may be regarded as that of posterity wilde is a much greater force in our literature than even friendly contemporaries ever supposed he would become  it should be remembered however that at the time when most of these reviews were written wilde had published scarcely any of the works by which his name has become famous in europe though the protagonist of the aesthetic movement was a wellknown figure in paris and london  later he was recognisedit would be truer to say he was ignoredas a young man who had never fulfilled the high promise of a distinguished university career although his volume of poems had reached its fifth edition an unusual event in those days  he had alienated a great many of his oxford contemporaries by his extravagant manner of dress and his methods of courting publicity  the great men of the previous generation wildes intellectual peers with whom he was in artistic sympathy looked on him askance  ruskin was disappointed with his former pupil and pater did not hesitate to express disapprobation to private friends while he accepted incense from a disciple he distrusted the thurifer  from a large private correspondence in my possession i gather that it was oddly enough in political and social centres that wildes amazing powers were rightly appreciated and where he was welcomed as the most brilliant of living talkers  before he had published anything except his poems the literary dovecots regarded him with dislike and when he began to publish essays and fairy stories the attitude was not changed it was merely emphasised in the public press  his first dramatic success at the st jamess theatre gave wilde of course a different position and the dislike became qualified with envy  some of the younger men indeed were dazzled but with few exceptions their appreciation was expressed in an unfortunate manner  it is a consolation or a misfortune that the wrong kind of people are too often correct in their prognostications of the future the farseeing are also the foolish  from these reviews which illustrate the middle period of wildes meteoric career between the aesthetic period and the production of lady windermeres fan we learn his opinion of the contemporaries who thought little enough of him  that he revised many of these opinions notably those that are harsh i need scarcely say and after his release from prison he lost much of his admiration for certain writers  i would draw special attention to those reviews of mr swinburne mr wilfrid blunt mr alfred austin the hon john collier mr brander matthews and sir edwin arnold rossetti pater henley and morris they have more permanent value than the others and are in accord with the wiser critical judgments of today  for leave to republish the articles from the pall mall gazette i am indebted to mr william waldorf astor the owner of the copyrights by arrangement with whom they are here reprinted  i have to thank most cordially messrs cassell and company for permitting me to reproduce the editorial articles and reviews contributed by wilde to the womans world the editor and proprietor of the nation for leave to include the two articles from the speaker and the editor of the saturday review for a similar courtesy  for identifying many of the anonymous articles i am indebted to mr arthur humphreys not the least of his kindnesses in assisting the publication of this edition for the trouble of editing arrangement and collecting of material i am under obligations to mr stuart mason for which this acknowledgment is totally inadequate  robert ross reform club may 12th 1908     dinners and dishes   pall mall gazette march 7 1885  a man can live for three days without bread but no man can live for one day without poetry was an aphorism of baudelaire  you can live without pictures and music but you cannot live without eating says the author of dinners and dishes and this latter view is no doubt the more popular who indeed in these degenerate days would hesitate between an ode and an omelette a sonnet and a salmis  yet the position is not entirely philistine cookery is an art are not its principles the subject of south kensington lectures and does not the royal academy give a banquet once a year  besides as the coming democracy will no doubt insist on feeding us all on penny dinners it is well that the laws of cookery should be explained for were the national meal burned or badly seasoned or served up with the wrong sauce a dreadful revolution might follow  under these circumstances we strongly recommend dinners and dishes to every one it is brief and concise and makes no attempt at eloquence which is extremely fortunate  for even on ortolans who could endure oratory  it also has the advantage of not being illustrated  the subject of a work of art has of course nothing to do with its beauty but still there is always something depressing about the coloured lithograph of a leg of mutton  as regards the authors particular views we entirely agree with him on the important question of macaroni  never he says ask me to back a bill for a man who has given me a macaroni pudding  macaroni is essentially a savoury dish and may be served with cheese or tomatoes but never with sugar and milk  there is also a useful description of how to cook risottoa delightful dish too rarely seen in england an excellent chapter on the different kinds of salads which should be carefully studied by those many hostesses whose imaginations never pass beyond lettuce and beetroot and actually a recipe for making brussels sprouts eatable  the last is of course a masterpiece  the real difficulty that we all have to face in life is not so much the science of cookery as the stupidity of cooks  and in this little handbook to practical epicureanism the tyrant of the english kitchen is shown in her proper light  her entire ignorance of herbs her passion for extracts and essences her total inability to make a soup which is anything more than a combination of pepper and gravy her inveterate habit of sending up bread poultices with pheasantsall these sins and many others are ruthlessly unmasked by the author  ruthlessly and rightly  for the british cook is a foolish woman who should be turned for her iniquities into a pillar of salt which she never knows how to use  but our author is not local merely  he has been in many lands he has eaten backhendl at vienna and kulibatsch at st petersburg he has had the courage to face the buffalo veal of roumania and to dine with a german family at one oclock he has serious views on the right method of cooking those famous white truffles of turin of which alexandre dumas was so fond and in the face of the oriental club declares that bombay curry is better than the curry of bengal  in fact he seems to have had experience of almost every kind of meal except the square meal of the americans  this he should study at once there is a great field for the philosophic epicure in the united states  boston beans may be dismissed at once as delusions but softshell crabs terrapin canvasback ducks blue fish and the pompono of new orleans are all wonderful delicacies particularly when one gets them at delmonicos  indeed the two most remarkable bits of scenery in the states are undoubtedly delmonicos and the yosemite valley and the former place has done more to promote a good feeling between england and america than anything else has in this century  we hope the wanderer will go there soon and add a chapter to dinners and dishes and that his book will have in england the influence it deserves  there are twenty ways of cooking a potato and three hundred and sixtyfive ways of cooking an egg yet the british cook up to the present moment knows only three methods of sending up either one or the other  dinners and dishes  by wanderer  simpkin and marshall     a modern epic   pall mall gazette march 13 1885  in an age of hurry like ours the appearance of an epic poem more than five thousand lines in length cannot but be regarded as remarkable whether such a form of art is the one most suited to our century is a question  edgar allan poe insisted that no poem should take more than an hour to read the essence of a work of art being its unity of impression and of effect  still it would be difficult to accept absolutely a canon of art which would place the divine comedy on the shelf and deprive us of the bothwell of mr swinburne  a work of art is to be estimated by its beauty not by its size and in mr willss melchior there is beauty of a rich and lofty character  remembering the various arts which have yielded up their secrets to mr wills it is interesting to note in his poems here the picturesque vision of the painter here the psychology of the novelist and here the playwrights sense of dramatic situation  yet these things which are the elements of his work of art though we arbitrarily separate them in criticism are in the work itself blended and made one by the true imaginative and informing power  for melchior is not a piece of poetic writing merely it is that very rare thing a poem  it is dedicated to mr robert browning not inappropriately as it deals with that problem of the possible expression of life through music the value of which as a motive in poetry mr browning was the first to see the story is this  in one of the little gothic towns of northern germany lives melchior a dreamer and a musician  one night he rescues by chance a girl from drowning and lodges her in a convent of holy women  he grows to love her and to see in her the incarnation of that st cecily whom with mystic and almost mediaeval passion he had before adored  but a priest separates them and melchior goes mad  an old doctor who makes a study of insanity determines to try and cure him and induces the girl to appear to him disguised as st cecily herself while he sits brooding at the organ  thinking her at first to be indeed the saint he had worshipped melchior falls in ecstasy at her feet but soon discovering the trick kills her in a sudden paroxysm of madness  the horror of the act restores his reason but with the return of sanity the dreams and visions of the artists nature begin to vanish the musician sees the world not through a glass but face to face and he dies just as the world is awakening to his music  the character of melchior who inherits his music from his father and from his mother his mysticism is extremely fascinating as a psychological study  mr wills has made a most artistic use of that scientific law of heredity which has already strongly influenced the literature of this century and to which we owe dr holmess fantastic elsie venner daniel derondathat dullest of masterpiecesand the dreadful rougonmacquart family with whose misdeeds m zola is never weary of troubling us  blanca the girl is a somewhat slight sketch but then like ophelia she is merely the occasion of a tragedy and not its heroine  the rest of the characters are most powerfully drawn and create themselves simply and swiftly before us as the story proceeds the method of the practised dramatist being here of great value  as regards the style we notice some accidental assonances of rhyme which in an unrhymed poem are never pleasing and the unfinished short line of five or six syllables however legitimate on the stage where the actor himself can make the requisite musical pause is not a beauty in a blank verse poem and is employed by mr wills far too frequently  still taken as a whole the style has the distinction of noble melody  there are many passages which did space permit us we would like to quote but we must content ourselves with saying that in melchior we find not merely pretty gems of rich imagery and delicate fancy but a fine imaginative treatment of many of the most important modern problems notably of the relation of life to art  it is a pleasure to herald a poem which combines so many elements of strength and beauty  melchior  by w g wills author of charles i olivia etc and writer of claudian  macmillan and co     shakespeare on scenery   dramatic review march 14 1885  i have often heard people wonder what shakespeare would say could he see mr irvings production of his much ado about nothing or mr wilson barretts setting of his hamlet  would he take pleasure in the glory of the scenery and the marvel of the colour  would he be interested in the cathedral of messina and the battlements of elsinore  or would he be indifferent and say the play and the play only is the thing  speculations like these are always pleasurable and in the present case happen to be profitable also  for it is not difficult to see what shakespeares attitude would be not difficult that is to say if one reads shakespeare himself instead of reading merely what is written about him  speaking for instance directly as the manager of a london theatre through the lips of the chorus in henry v he complains of the smallness of the stage on which he has to produce the pageant of a big historical play and of the want of scenery which obliges him to cut out many of its most picturesque incidents apologises for the scanty number of supers who had to play the soldiers and for the shabbiness of the properties and finally expresses his regret at being unable to bring on real horses  in the midsummer nights dream again he gives us a most amusing picture of the straits to which theatrical managers of his day were reduced by the want of proper scenery  in fact it is impossible to read him without seeing that he is constantly protesting against the two special limitations of the elizabethan stagethe lack of suitable scenery and the fashion of men playing womens parts just as he protests against other difficulties with which managers of theatres have still to contend such as actors who do not understand their words actors who miss their cues actors who overact their parts actors who mouth actors who gag actors who play to the gallery and amateur actors  and indeed a great dramatist as he was could not but have felt very much hampered at being obliged continually to interrupt the progress of a play in order to send on some one to explain to the audience that the scene was to be changed to a particular place on the entrance of a particular character and after his exit to somewhere else that the stage was to represent the deck of a ship in a storm or the interior of a greek temple or the streets of a certain town to all of which inartistic devices shakespeare is reduced and for which he always amply apologises  besides this clumsy method shakespeare had two other substitutes for scenerythe hanging out of a placard and his descriptions  the first of these could hardly have satisfied his passion for picturesqueness and his feeling for beauty and certainly did not satisfy the dramatic critic of his day  but as regards the description to those of us who look on shakespeare not merely as a playwright but as a poet and who enjoy reading him at home just as much as we enjoy seeing him acted it may be a matter of congratulation that he had not at his command such skilled machinists as are in use now at the princesss and at the lyceum  for had cleopatras barge for instance been a structure of canvas and dutch metal it would probably have been painted over or broken up after the withdrawal of the piece and even had it survived to our own day would i am afraid have become extremely shabby by this time  whereas now the beaten gold of its poop is still bright and the purple of its sails still beautiful its silver oars are not tired of keeping time to the music of the flutes they follow nor the nereids flowersoft hands of touching its silken tackle the mermaid still lies at its helm and still on its deck stand the boys with their coloured fans  yet lovely as all shakespeares descriptive passages are a description is in its essence undramatic  theatrical audiences are far more impressed by what they look at than by what they listen to and the modern dramatist in having the surroundings of his play visibly presented to the audience when the curtain rises enjoys an advantage for which shakespeare often expresses his desire  it is true that shakespeares descriptions are not what descriptions are in modern playsaccounts of what the audience can observe for themselves they are the imaginative method by which he creates in the mind of the spectators the image of that which he desires them to see  still the quality of the drama is action  it is always dangerous to pause for picturesqueness  and the introduction of selfexplanatory scenery enables the modern method to be far more direct while the loveliness of form and colour which it gives us seems to me often to create an artistic temperament in the audience and to produce that joy in beauty for beautys sake without which the great masterpieces of art can never be understood to which and to which only are they ever revealed  to talk of the passion of a play being hidden by the paint and of sentiment being killed by scenery is mere emptiness and folly of words a noble play nobly mounted gives us double artistic pleasure  the eye as well as the ear is gratified and the whole nature is made exquisitely receptive of the influence of imaginative work  and as regards a bad play have we not all seen large audiences lured by the loveliness of scenic effect into listening to rhetoric posing as poetry and to vulgarity doing duty for realism  whether this be good or evil for the public i will not here discuss but it is evident that the playwright at any rate never suffers  indeed the artist who really has suffered through the modern mounting of plays is not the dramatist at all but the scenepainter proper  he is rapidly being displaced by the stagecarpenter  now and then at drury lane i have seen beautiful old front cloths let down as perfect as pictures some of them and pure painters work and there are many which we all remember at other theatres in front of which some dialogue was reduced to graceful dumbshow through the hammer and tintacks behind but as a rule the stage is overcrowded with enormous properties which are not merely far more expensive and cumbersome than scenepaintings but far less beautiful and far less true  properties kill perspective a painted door is more like a real door than a real door is itself for the proper conditions of light and shade can be given to it and the excessive use of built up structures always makes the stage too glaring for as they have to be lit from behind as well as from the front the gasjets become the absolute light of the scene instead of the means merely by which we perceive the conditions of light and shadow which the painter has desired to show us  so instead of bemoaning the position of the playwright it were better for the critics to exert whatever influence they may possess towards restoring the scenepainter to his proper position as an artist and not allowing him to be built over by the property man or hammered to death by the carpenter  i have never seen any reason myself why such artists as mr beverley mr walter hann and mr telbin should not be entitled to become academicians  they have certainly as good a claim as have many of those ras whose total inability to paint we can see every may for a shilling  and lastly let those critics who hold up for our admiration the simplicity of the elizabethan stage remember that they are lauding a condition of things against which shakespeare himself in the spirit of a true artist always strongly protested     a bevy of poets   pall mall gazette march 27 1885  this spring the little singers are out before the little sparrows and have already begun chirruping  here are four volumes already and who knows how many more will be given to us before the laburnums blossom  the bestbound volume must of course have precedence  it is called echoes of memory by atherton furlong and is cased in creamy vellum and tied with ribbons of yellow silk  mr furlongs charm is the unsullied sweetness of his simplicity  indeed we can strongly recommend to the schoolboard the lines on the old town pump as eminently suitable for recitation by children  such a verse for instance as     i hear the little children say       for the tale will never die    how the old pump flowed both night and day       when the brooks and the wells ran dry  has all the ring of macaulay in it and is a form of poetry which cannot possibly harm anybody even if translated into french  any inaccurate ideas of the laws of nature which the children might get from the passage in question could easily be corrected afterwards by a lecture on hydrostatics  the poem however which gives us most pleasure is the one called the dear old knocker on the door  it is appropriately illustrated by mr tristram ellis  we quote the concluding verses of the first and last stanzas     blithe voices then so dear       send up their shouts once more    then sounds again on memrys ear       the dear old knocker on the door               when memry turns the key    where time has placed my score    encased mid treasured thoughts must be    the dear old knocker on the door  the cynic may mock at the subject of these verses but we do not  why not an ode on a knocker  does not victor hugos tragedy of lucrece borgia turn on the defacement of a doorplate  mr furlong must not be discouraged  perhaps he will write poetry some day  if he does we would earnestly appeal to him to give up calling a cock proud chanticleer few synonyms are so depressing  having been lured by the circe of a white vellum binding into the region of the pump and doormat we turn to a modest little volume by mr bowling of st johns college cambridge entitled sagittulae  and they are indeed delicate little arrows for they are winged with the lightness of the lyric and barbed daintily with satire  aesthesis and athletes is a sweet idyll and nothing can be more pathetic than the tragedy of the xix century which tells of a luckless examiner condemned in his public capacity to pluck for her littlego the girl graduate whom he privately adores  girton seems to be having an important influence on the cambridge school of poetry  we are not surprised  the graces are the graces always even when they wear spectacles  then comes tuberose and meadowsweet by mr mark andre raffalovich  this is really a remarkable little volume and contains many strange and beautiful poems  to say of these poems that they are unhealthy and bring with them the heavy odours of the hothouse is to point out neither their defect nor their merit but their quality merely  and though mr raffalovich is not a wonderful poet still he is a subtle artist in poetry  indeed in his way he is a boyish master of curious music and of fantastic rhyme and can strike on the lute of language so many lovely chords that it seems a pity he does not know how to pronounce the title of his book and the theme of his songs  for he insists on making tuberose a trisyllable always as if it were a potato blossom and not a flower shaped like a tiny trumpet of ivory  however for the sake of his meadowsweet and his springgreen binding this must be forgiven him  and though he cannot pronounce tuberose aright at least he can sing of it exquisitely  finally we come to sturm und drang the work of an anonymous writer opening the volume at hazard we come across these graceful lines     how sweet to spend in this blue bay    the close of lifes disastrous day    to watch the morn break faintly free    across the greyness of the sea    what time memnonian music fills    the shadows of the dewy hills  well here is the touch of a poet and we pluck up heart and read on  the book is a curious but not inartistic combination of the mental attitude of mr matthew arnold with the style of lord tennyson  sometimes as in the sicilian hermit we get merely the metre of locksley hall without its music merely its fine madness and not its fine magic  still elsewhere there is good work and caliban in east london has a great deal of power in it though we do not like the adjective knockery even in a poem on whitechapel  on the whole to those who watch the culture of the age the most interesting thing in young poets is not so much what they invent as what masters they follow  a few years ago it was all mr swinburne  that era has happily passed away  the mimicry of passion is the most intolerable of all poses  now it is all lord tennyson and that is better  for a young writer can gain more from the study of a literary poet than from the study of a lyrist  he may become the pupil of the one but he can never be anything but the slave of the other  and so we are glad to see in this volume direct and noble praise of him           who plucked in english meadows flowers fair    as any that in unforgotten stave    vied with the orient gold of venus hair    or fringed the murmur of the aegean wave  which are the fine words in which this anonymous poet pays his tribute to the laureate  1 echoes of memory  by atherton furlong  field and tuer  2 sagittulae  by e w bowling

in the pall mall gazette on march 30 1885 under the title of  the root of the matter  siri am sorry not to be able to accept the graceful etymology of your reviewer who calls me to task for not knowing how to pronounce the title of my book tuberose and meadowsweet  i insist he fancifully says on making tuberose a trisyllable always as if it were a potato blossom and not a flower shaped like a tiny trumpet of ivory  alas tuberose is a trisyllable if properly derived from the latin tuberosus the lumpy flower having nothing to do with roses or with trumpets of ivory in name any more than in nature  i am reminded by a great living poet that another correctly wrote     or as the moonlight fills the open sky    struggling with darknessas a tuberose    peoples some indian dell with scents

sir your obedient servant  andre raffalovich march 28     parnassus versus philology   pall mall gazette april 1 1885  to the editor of the pall mall gazette  siri am deeply distressed to hear that tuberose is so called from its being a lumpy flower  it is not at all lumpy and even if it were no poet should be heartless enough to say so  henceforth there really must be two derivations for every word one for the poet and one for the scientist  and in the present case the poet will dwell on the tiny trumpets of ivory into which the white flower breaks and leave to the man of science horrid allusions to its supposed lumpiness and indiscreet revelations of its private life below ground  in fact tuber as a derivation is disgraceful  on the roots of verbs philology may be allowed to speak but on the roots of flowers she must keep silence  we cannot allow her to dig up parnassus  and as regards the word being a trisyllable i am reminded by a great living poet that another correctly wrote     and the jessamine faint and the sweet tuberose    the sweetest flower for scent that blows    and all rare blossoms from every clime    grew in that garden in perfect prime  in justice to shelley whose lines i quote your readers will admit that i have good authority for making a dissyllable of tuberosei am sir your obedient servant  the critic who had to read four volumes of modern poetry march 30     hamlet at the lyceum   dramatic review may 9 1885  it sometimes happens that at a premiere in london the least enjoyable part of the performance is the play  i have seen many audiences more interesting than the actors and have often heard better dialogue in the foyer than i have on the stage  at the lyceum however this is rarely the case and when the play is a play of shakespeares and among its exponents are mr irving and miss ellen terry we turn from the gods in the gallery and from the goddesses in the stalls to enjoy the charm of the production and to take delight in the art  the lions are behind the footlights and not in front of them when we have a noble tragedy nobly acted  and i have rarely witnessed such enthusiasm as that which greeted on last saturday night the two artists i have mentioned  i would like in fact to use the word ovation but a pedantic professor has recently informed us with the batavian buoyancy of misapplied learning that this expression is not to be employed except when a sheep has been sacrificed at the lyceum last week i need hardly say nothing so dreadful occurred the only inartistic incident of the evening was the hurling of a bouquet from a box at mr irving while he was engaged in pourtraying the agony of hamlets death and the pathos of his parting with horatio  the dramatic college might take up the education of spectators as well as that of players and teach people that there is a proper moment for the throwing of flowers as well as a proper method  as regards mr irvings own performance it has been already so elaborately criticised and described from his business with the supposed pictures in the closet scene down to his use of peacock for paddock that little remains to be said nor indeed does a lyceum audience require the interposition of the dramatic critic in order to understand or to appreciate the hamlet of this great actor  i call him a great actor because he brings to the interpretation of a work of art the two qualities which we in this century so much desire the qualities of personality and of perfection  a few years ago it seemed to many and perhaps rightly that the personality overshadowed the art  no such criticism would be fair now  the somewhat harsh angularity of movement and faulty pronunciation have been replaced by exquisite grace of gesture and clear precision of word where such precision is necessary  for delightful as good elocution is few things are so depressing as to hear a passionate passage recited instead of being acted  the quality of a fine performance is its life more than its learning and every word in a play has a musical as well as an intellectual value and must be made expressive of a certain emotion  so it does not seem to me that in all parts of a play perfect pronunciation is necessarily dramatic  when the words are wild and whirling the expression of them must be wild and whirling also  mr irving i think manages his voice with singular art it was impossible to discern a false note or wrong intonation in his dialogue or his soliloquies and his strong dramatic power his realistic power as an actor is as effective as ever  a great critic at the beginning of this century said that hamlet is the most difficult part to personate on the stage that it is like the attempt to embody a shadow i cannot say that i agree with this idea  hamlet seems to me essentially a good acting part and in mr irvings performance of it there is that combination of poetic grace with absolute reality which is so eternally delightful  indeed if the words easy and difficult have any meaning at all in matters of art i would be inclined to say that ophelia is the more difficult part  she has i mean less material by which to produce her effects  she is the occasion of the tragedy but she is neither its heroine nor its chief victim  she is swept away by circumstances and gives the opportunity for situation of which she is not herself the climax and which she does not herself command  and of all the parts which miss terry has acted in her brilliant career there is none in which her infinite powers of pathos and her imaginative and creative faculty are more shown than in her ophelia  miss terry is one of those rare artists who needs for her dramatic effect no elaborate dialogue and for whom the simplest words are sufficient  i love you not says hamlet and all that ophelia answers is i was the more deceived  these are not very grand words to read but as miss terry gave them in acting they seemed to be the highest possible expression of ophelias character beautiful too was the quick remorse she conveyed by her face and gesture the moment she had lied to hamlet and told him her father was at home  this i thought a masterpiece of good acting and her mad scene was wonderful beyond all description  the secrets of melpomene are known to miss terry as well as the secrets of thalia  as regards the rest of the company there is always a high standard at the lyceum but some particular mention should be made of mr alexanders brilliant performance of laertes  mr alexander has a most effective presence a charming voice and a capacity for wearing lovely costumes with ease and elegance  indeed in the latter respect his only rival was mr norman forbes who played either guildenstern or rosencrantz very gracefully  i believe one of our budding hazlitts is preparing a volume to be entitled great guildensterns and remarkable rosencrantzes but i have never been able myself to discern any difference between these two characters  they are i think the only characters shakespeare has not cared to individualise  whichever of the two however mr forbes acted he acted it well  only one point in mr alexanders performance seemed to me open to question that was his kneeling during the whole of poloniuss speech for this i see no necessity at all and it makes the scene look less natural than it shouldgives it i mean too formal an air  however the performance was most spirited and gave great pleasure to every one mr alexander is an artist from whom much will be expected and i have no doubt he will give us much that is fine and noble  he seems to have all the qualifications for a good actor  there is just one other character i should like to notice  the first player seemed to me to act far too well  he should act very badly  the first player besides his position in the dramatic evolution of the tragedy is shakespeares caricature of the ranting actor of his day just as the passage he recites is shakespeares own parody on the dull plays of some of his rivals  the whole point of hamlets advice to the players seems to me to be lost unless the player himself has been guilty of the fault which hamlet reprehends unless he has sawn the air with his hand mouthed his lines torn his passion to tatters and outheroded herod  the very sensibility which hamlet notices in the actor such as his real tears and the like is not the quality of a good artist  the part should be played after the manner of a provincial tragedian  it is meant to be a satire and to play it well is to play it badly  the scenery and costumes were excellent with the exception of the kings dress which was coarse in colour and tawdry in effect  and the player queen should have come in boys attire to elsinore  however last saturday night was not a night for criticism  the theatre was filled with those who desired to welcome mr irving back to his own theatre and we were all delighted at his reappearance among us  i hope that some time will elapse before he and miss terry cross again that disappointing atlantic ocean     two new novels   pall mall gazette may 15 1885  the clever authoress of in the golden days has chosen for the scene of her story the england of two centuries ago as a relief she tells us in her preface from perpetual nineteenthcenturyism  upon the other hand she makes a pathetic appeal to her readers not to regard her book as an historical novel on the ground that such a title strikes terror into the public  this seems to us rather a curious position to take up esmond and notre dame are historical novels both of them and both of them popular successes  john inglesant and romola have gone through many editions and even salammbo has its enthusiasts  we think that the public is very fond of historical novels and as for perpetual nineteenthcenturyisma vile phrase by the waywe only wish that more of our english novelists studied our age and its society than do so at present  however in the golden days must not be judged by its foolish preface  it is really a very charming book and though dryden betterton and willss coffeehouse are dragged in rather a propos de bottes still the picture of the time is well painted  joyce the little puritan maiden is an exquisite creation and hugo wharncliffe her lover makes a fine hero  the sketch of algernon sidney is rather colourless but charles ii is well drawn  it seems to be a novel with a high purpose and a noble meaning  yet it is never dull  mrs macquoids louisa is modern and the scene is in italy  italy we fear has been a good deal overdone in fiction  a little more piccadilly and a little less perugia would be a relief  however the story is interesting  a young english girl marries an italian nobleman and after some time being bored with picturesqueness falls in love with an englishman  the story is told with a great deal of power and ends properly and pleasantly  it can safely be recommended to young persons  1 in the golden days  by edna lyall author of we two donovan etc hurst and blackett  2 louisa  by katherine s macquoid  bentley and son     henry the fourth at oxford   dramatic review may 23 1885  i have been told that the ambition of every dramatic club is to act henry iv  i am not surprised  the spirit of comedy is as fervent in this play as is the spirit of chivalry it is an heroic pageant as well as an heroic poem and like most of shakespeares historical dramas it contains an extraordinary number of thoroughly good acting parts each of which is absolutely individual in character and each of which contributes to the evolution of the plot  rumour from time to time has brought in tidings of a proposed production by the banks of the cam but it seems at the last moment box and cox has always had to be substituted in the bill  to oxford belongs the honour of having been the first to present on the stage this noble play and the production which i saw last week was in every way worthy of that lovely town that mother of sweetness and of light  for in spite of the roaring of the young lions at the union and the screaming of the rabbits in the home of the vivisector in spite of keble college and the tramways and the sporting prints oxford still remains the most beautiful thing in england and nowhere else are life and art so exquisitely blended so perfectly made one  indeed in most other towns art has often to present herself in the form of a reaction against the sordid ugliness of ignoble lives but at oxford she comes to us as an exquisite flower born of the beauty of life and expressive of lifes joy  she finds her home by the isis as once she did by the ilissus the magdalen walks and the magdalen cloisters are as dear to her as were ever the silver olives of colonus and the golden gateway of the house of pallas she covers with fanlike tracery the vaulted entrance to christ church hall and looks out from the windows of merton her feet have stirred the cumnor cowslips and she gathers fritillaries in the riverfields  to her the clamour of the schools and the dulness of the lectureroom are a weariness and a vexation of spirit she seeks not to define virtue and cares little for the categories she smiles on the swift athlete whose plastic grace has pleased her and rejoices in the young barbarians at their games she watches the rowers from the reedy bank and gives myrtle to her lovers and laurel to her poets and rue to those who talk wisely in the street she makes the earth lovely to all who dream with keats she opens high heaven to all who soar with shelley and turning away her head from pedant proctor and philistine she has welcomed to her shrine a band of youthful actors knowing that they have sought with much ardour for the stern secret of melpomene and caught with much gladness the sweet laughter of thalia  and to me this ardour and this gladness were the two most fascinating qualities of the oxford performance as indeed they are qualities which are necessary to any fine dramatic production  for without quick and imaginative observation of life the most beautiful play becomes dull in presentation and what is not conceived in delight by the actor can give no delight at all to others  i know that there are many who consider that shakespeare is more for the study than for the stage  with this view i do not for a moment agree shakespeare wrote the plays to be acted and we have no right to alter the form which he himself selected for the full expression of his work indeed many of the beauties of that work can be adequately conveyed to us only through the actors art  as i sat in the town hall of oxford the other night the majesty of the mighty lines of the play seemed to me to gain new music from the clear young voices that uttered them and the ideal grandeur of the heroism to be made more real to the spectators by the chivalrous bearing the noble gesture and the fine passion of its exponents  even the dresses had their dramatic value  their archaeological accuracy gave us immediately on the rise of the curtain a perfect picture of the time  as the knights and nobles moved across the stage in the flowing robes of peace and in the burnished steel of battle we needed no dreary chorus to tell us in what age or land the plays action was passing for the fifteenth century in all the dignity and grace of its apparel was living actually before us and the delicate harmonies of colour struck from the first a dominant note of beauty which added to the intellectual realism of archaeology the sensuous charm of art  as for individual actors mr mackinnons prince hal was a most gay and graceful performance lit here and there with charming touches of princely dignity and of noble feeling  mr coleridges falstaff was full of delightful humour though perhaps at times he did not take us sufficiently into his confidence  an audience looks at a tragedian but a comedian looks at his audience  however he gave much pleasure to every one and mr bourchiers hotspur was really most remarkable  mr bourchier has a fine stage presence a beautiful voice and produces his effects by a method as dramatically impressive as it is artistically right  once or twice he seemed to me to spoil his last line by walking through it  the part of harry percy is one full of climaxes which must not be let slip  but still there was always a freedom and spirit in his style which was very pleasing and his delivery of the colloquial passages i thought excellent notably of that in the first act        what d ye call the place    a plague upontit is in gloucestershire    twas where the madcap duke his uncle kept    his uncle york  lines by the way in which kemble made a great effect  mr bourchier has the opportunity of a fine career on the english stage and i hope he will take advantage of it  among the minor parts in the play glendower mortimer and sir richard vernon were capitally acted worcester was a performance of some subtlety mrs woods was a charming lady percy and lady edward spencer churchill as mortimers wife made us all believe that we understood welsh  her dialogue and her song were most pleasing bits of artistic realism which fully accounted for the celtic chair at oxford  but though i have mentioned particular actors the real value of the whole representation was to be found in its absolute unity in its delicate sense of proportion and in that breadth of effect which is to be got only by the most careful elaboration of detail  i have rarely seen a production better stagemanaged  indeed i hope that the university will take some official notice of this delightful work of art why should not degrees be granted for good acting  are they not given to those who misunderstand plato and who mistranslate aristotle  and should the artist be passed over  no  to prince hal hotspur and falstaff dcls should be gracefully offered  i feel sure they would be gracefully accepted  to the rest of the company the crimson or the sheep skin hood might be assigned honoris causa to the eternal confusion of the philistine and the rage of the industrious and the dull  thus would oxford confer honour on herself and the artist be placed in his proper position  however whether or not convocation recognises the claims of culture i hope that the oxford dramatic society will produce every summer for us some noble play like henry iv  for in plays of this kind plays which deal with bygone times there is always this peculiar charm that they combine in one exquisite presentation the passions that are living with the picturesqueness that is dead  and when we have the modern spirit given to us in an antique form the very remoteness of that form can be made a method of increased realism  this was shakespeares own attitude towards the ancient world this is the attitude we in this century should adopt towards his plays and with a feeling akin to this it seemed to me that these brilliant young oxonians were working  if it was so their aim is the right one  for while we look to the dramatist to give romance to realism we ask of the actor to give realism to romance     modern greek poetry   pall mall gazette may 27 1885  odysseus not achilles is the type of the modern greek  merchandise has taken precedence of the muses and politics are preferred to parnassus yet by the illissus there are sweet singers the nightingales are not silent in colonus and from the garden of greek nineteenthcentury poetry miss edmonds has made a very pleasing anthology and in pouring the wine from the golden into the silver cup she has still kept much of the beauty of the original  even when translated into english modern greek lyrics are preferable to modern greek loans  as regards the quality of this poetry if the old greek spirit can be traced at all it is the spirit of tyrtaeus and of theocritus  the warlike ballads of rhigas and aristotle valaorites have a fine ring of music and of passion in them and the folksongs of george drosines are full of charming pictures of rustic life and delicate idylls of shepherds courtships  these we acknowledge that we prefer  the flutes of the sheepfold are more delightful than the clarions of battle  still poetry played such a noble part in the greek war of independence that it is impossible not to look with reverence on the spirited warsongs that meant so much to those who were righting for liberty and mean so much even now to their children  other poets besides drosines have taken the legends that linger among the peasants and given to them an artistic form  the song of the seasons is full of beauty and there is a delightful poem on the building of st sophia which tells how the design of that noble building was suggested by the golden honeycomb of a bee which had flown from the kings palace with a crumb of blessed bread that had fallen from the kings hands  the story is still to be found in thrace  one of the ballads also has a good deal of spirit  it is by kostes palamas and was suggested by an interesting incident which occurred some years ago in athens  in the summer of 1881 there was borne through the streets the remains of an aged woman in the complete costume of a pallikar which dress she had worn at the siege of missolonghi and in it had requested to be buried  the life of this real greek heroine should be studied by those who are investigating the question of wherein womanliness consists  the view the poet takes of her is we need hardly say very different from that which canon liddon would entertain  yet it is none the less fine on this account and we are glad that this old lady has been given a place in art  the volume is on the whole delightful reading and though not much can be said for lines like these     there cometh from the west    the timid starry bands  still the translations are in many instances most felicitous and their style most pleasing  greek lays idylls legends etc  translated by e m edmonds  trubner and co     olivia at the lyceum   dramatic review may 30 1885  whether or not it is an advantage for a novel to be produced in a dramatic form is i think open to question  the psychological analysis of such work as that of mr george meredith for instance would probably lose by being transmuted into the passionate action of the stage nor does m zolas formule scientifique gain anything at all by theatrical presentation  with goldsmith it is somewhat different  in the vicar of wakefield he seeks simply to please his readers and desires not to prove a theory he looks on life rather as a picture to be painted than as a problem to be solved his aim is to create men and women more than to vivisect them his dialogue is essentially dramatic and his novel seems to pass naturally into the dramatic form  and to me there is something very pleasurable in seeing and studying the same subject under different conditions of art  for life remains eternally unchanged it is art which by presenting it to us under various forms enables us to realise its manysided mysteries and to catch the quality of its most fierycoloured moments  the originality i mean which we ask from the artist is originality of treatment not of subject  it is only the unimaginative who ever invents  the true artist is known by the use he makes of what he annexes and he annexes everything  looking in this light at mr willss olivia it seems to me a very exquisite work of art  indeed i know no other dramatist who could have retold this beautiful english tale with such tenderness and such power neither losing the charm of the old story nor forgetting the conditions of the new form  the sentiment of the poet and the science of the playwright are exquisitely balanced in it  for though in prose it is a poem and while a poem it is also a play  but fortunate as mr wills has been in the selection of his subject and in his treatment of it he is no less fortunate in the actors who interpret his work  to whatever character miss terry plays she brings the infinite charm of her beauty and the marvellous grace of her movements and gestures  it is impossible to escape from the sweet tyranny of her personality  she dominates her audience by the secret of cleopatra  in her olivia however it is not merely her personality that fascinates us but her power also her power over pathos and her command of situation  the scene in which she bade goodbye to her family was touching beyond any scene i remember in any modern play yet no harsh or violent note was sounded and when in the succeeding act she struck in natural and noble indignation the libertine who had betrayed her there was i think no one in the theatre who did not recognise that in miss terry our stage possesses a really great artist who can thrill an audience without harrowing it and by means that seem simple and easy can produce the finest dramatic effect  mr irving as dr primrose intensified the beautiful and blind idolatry of the old pastor for his daughter till his own tragedy seems almost greater than hers the scene in the third act where he breaks down in his attempt to reprove the lamb that has strayed from the fold was a masterpiece of fine acting and the whole performance while carefully elaborate in detail was full of breadth and dignity  i acknowledge that i liked him least at the close of the second act  it seems to me that here we should be made to feel not merely the passionate rage of the father but the powerlessness of the old man  the taking down of the pistols and the attempt to follow the young duellist are pathetic because they are useless and i hardly think that mr irving conveyed this idea  as regards the rest of the characters mr terrisss squire thornhill was an admirable picture of a fascinating young rake  indeed it was so fascinating that the moral equilibrium of the audience was quite disturbed and nobody seemed to care very much for the virtuous mr burchell  i was not sorry to see this triumph of the artistic over the ethical sympathy  perfect heroes are the monsters of melodramas and have no place in dramatic art  life possibly contains them but parnassus often rejects what peckham may welcome  i look forward to a reaction in favour of the cultured criminal  mr norman forbes was a very pleasing moses and gave his latin quotations charmingly miss emerys sophy was most winning and indeed every part seemed to me well acted except that of the virtuous mr burchell  this fact however rather pleased me than otherwise as it increased the charm of his attractive nephew  the scenery and costumes were excellent as indeed they always are at the lyceum when the piece is produced under mr irvings direction  the first scene was really very beautiful and quite as good as the famous cherry orchard of the theatre francais  a critic who posed as an authority on field sports assured me that no one ever went out hunting when roses were in full bloom  personally that is exactly the season i would select for the chase but then i know more about flowers than i do about foxes and like them much better  if the critic was right either the roses must wither or squire thornhill must change his coat  a more serious objection may be brought against the division of the last act into three scenes  there i think there was a distinct dramatic loss the room to which olivia returns should have been exactly the same room she had left  as a picture of the eighteenth century however the whole production was admirable and the details both of acting and of miseen scene wonderfully perfect  i wish olivia would take off her pretty mittens when her fortune is being told  cheiromancy is a science which deals almost entirely with the lines on the palm of the hand and mittens would seriously interfere with its mysticism  still when all is said how easily does this lovely play this artistic presentation survive criticisms founded on cheiromancy and cubhunting  the lyceum under mr irvings management has become a centre of art  we are all of us in his debt  i trust that we may see some more plays by living dramatists produced at his theatre for olivia has been exquisitely mounted and exquisitely played     as you like it at coombe house   dramatic review june 6 1885  in theophile gautiers first novel that golden book of spirit and sense that holy writ of beauty there is a most fascinating account of an amateur performance of as you like it in the large orangery of a french country house  yet lovely as gautiers description is the real presentation of the play last week at coombe seemed to me lovelier still for not merely were there present in it all those elements of poetry and picturesqueness which le maitre impeccable so desired but to them was added also the exquisite charm of the open woodland and the delightful freedom of the open air  nor indeed could the pastoral players have made a more fortunate selection of a play  a tragedy under the same conditions would have been impossible  for tragedy is the exaggeration of the individual and nature thinks nothing of dwarfing a hero by a holly bush and reducing a heroine to a mere effect of colour  the subtleties also of facial expression are in the open air almost entirely lost and while this would be a serious defect in the presentation of a play which deals immediately with psychology in the case of a comedy where the situations predominate over the characters we do not feel it nearly so much and shakespeare himself seems to have clearly recognised this difference for while he had hamlet and macbeth always played by artificial light he acted as you like it and the rest of his comedies en plein jour  the condition then under which this comedy was produced by lady archibald campbell and mr godwin did not place any great limitations on the actors art and increased tenfold the value of the play as a picture through an alley of white hawthorn and gold laburnum we passed into the green pavilion that served as the theatre the air sweet with odour of the lilac and with the blackbirds song and when the curtain fell into its trench of flowers and the play commenced we saw before us a real forest and we knew it to be arden  for with whoop and shout up through the rustling fern came the foresters trooping the banished duke took his seat beneath the tall elm and as his lords lay around him on the grass the rich melody of shakespeares blank verse began to reach our ears  and all through the performance this delightful sense of joyous woodland life was sustained and even when the scene was left empty for the shepherd to drive his flock across the sward or for rosalind to school orlando in lovemaking far away we could hear the shrill halloo of the hunter and catch now and then the faint music of some distant horn  one distinct dramatic advantage was gained by the mise en scene  the abrupt exits and entrances which are necessitated on the real stage by the inevitable limitations of space were in many cases done away with and we saw the characters coming gradually towards us through brake and underwood or passing away down the slope till they were lost in some deep recess of the forest the effect of distance thus gained being largely increased by the faint wreaths of blue mist that floated at times across the background  indeed i never saw an illustration at once so perfect and so practical of the aesthetic value of smoke  as for the players themselves the pleasing naturalness of their method harmonised delightfully with their natural surroundings  those of them who were amateurs were too artistic to be stagey and those who were actors too experienced to be artificial  the humorous sadness of jaques that philosopher in search of sensation found a perfect exponent in mr hermann vezin  touchstone has been so often acted as a low comedy part that mr elliotts rendering of the swift sententious fool was a welcome change and a more graceful and winning phebe than mrs plowden a more tender celia than miss schletter a more realistic audrey than miss fulton i have never seen  rosalind suffered a good deal through the omission of the first act we saw i mean more of the saucy boy than we did of the noble girl and though the persiflage always told the poetry was often lost still miss calhoun gave much pleasure and lady archibald campbells orlando was a really remarkable performance  too melancholy some seemed to think it  yet is not orlando lovesick  too dreamy i heard it said  yet orlando is a poet  and even admitting that the vigour of the lad who tripped up the dukes wrestler was hardly sufficiently emphasised still in the low music of lady archibald campbells voice and in the strange beauty of her movements and gestures there was a wonderful fascination and the visible presence of romance quite consoled me for the possible absence of robustness  among the other characters should be mentioned mr claude ponsonbys first lord mr de cordovas corin a bit of excellent acting and the silvius of mr webster  as regards the costumes the colour scheme was very perfect  brown and green were the dominant notes and yellow was most artistically used there were however two distinct discords  touchstones motley was far too glaring and the crude white of rosalinds bridal raiment in the last act was absolutely displeasing  a contrast may be striking but should never be harsh  and lovely in colour as mrs plowdens dress was a sort of panegyric on a pansy i am afraid that in shakespeares arden there were no chelsea china shepherdesses and i am sure that the romance of phebe does not need to be intensified by any reminiscences of porcelain still as you like it has probably never been so well mounted nor costumes worn with more ease and simplicity  not the least charming part of the whole production was the music which was under the direction of the rev arthur batson  the boys voices were quite exquisite and mr walsham sang with much spirit  on the whole the pastoral players are to be warmly congratulated on the success of their representation and to the artistic sympathies of lady archibald campbell and the artistic knowledge of mr godwin i am indebted for a most delightful afternoon  few things are so pleasurable as to be able by an hours drive to exchange piccadilly for parnassus     a handbook to marriage   pall mall gazette november 18 1885  in spite of its somewhat alarming title this book may be highly recommended to every one  as for the authorities the author quotes they are almost numberless and range from socrates down to artemus ward  he tells us of the wicked bachelor who spoke of marriage as a very harmless amusement and advised a young friend of his to marry early and marry often of dr johnson who proposed that marriage should be arranged by the lord chancellor without the parties concerned having any choice in the matter of the sussex labourer who asked why should i give a woman half my victuals for cooking the other half and of lord verulam who thought that unmarried men did the best public work  and indeed marriage is the one subject on which all women agree and all men disagree  our author however is clearly of the same opinion as the scotch lassie who on her father warning her what a solemn thing it was to get married answered i ken that father but its a great deal solemner to be single  he may be regarded as the champion of the married life  indeed he has a most interesting chapter on marriagemade men and though he dissents and we think rightly from the view recently put forward by a lady or two on the womens rights platform that solomon owed all his wisdom to the number of his wives still he appeals to bismarck john stuart mill mahommed and lord beaconsfield as instances of men whose success can be traced to the influence of the women they married  archbishop whately once defined woman as a creature that does not reason and pokes the fire from the top but since his day the higher education of women has considerably altered their position  women have always had an emotional sympathy with those they love girton and newnham have rendered intellectual sympathy also possible  in our day it is best for a man to be married and men must give up the tyranny in married life which was once so dear to them and which we are afraid lingers still here and there  do you wish to be my wife mabel said a little boy  yes incautiously answered mabel  then pull off my boots  on marriage vows our author has too very sensible views and very amusing stories  he tells of a nervous bridegroom who confusing the baptismal and marriage ceremonies replied when asked if he consented to take the bride for his wife i renounce them all of a hampshire rustic who when giving the ring said solemnly to the bride with my body i thee wash up and with all my hurdle goods i thee and thou of another who when asked whether he would take his partner to be his wedded wife replied with shameful indecision yes im willin but id a sight rather have her sister and of a scotch lady who on the occasion of her daughters wedding was asked by an old friend whether she might congratulate her on the event and answered yes yes upon the whole it is very satisfactory it is true jeannie hates her gudeman but then theres always a something  indeed the good stories contained in this book are quite endless and make it very pleasant reading while the good advice is on all points admirable  most young married people nowadays start in life with a dreadful collection of ormolu inkstands covered with sham onyxes or with a perfect museum of saltcellars  we strongly recommend this book as one of the best of wedding presents  it is a complete handbook to an earthly paradise and its author may be regarded as the murray of matrimony and the baedeker of bliss  how to be happy though married being a handbook to marriage  by a graduate in the university of matrimony  t fisher unwin     halfhours with the worst authors   pall mall gazette january 15 1886  i am very much pleased to see that you are beginning to call attention to the extremely slipshod and careless style of our ordinary magazinewriters  will you allow me to refer your readers to an article on borrow in the current number of macmillan which exemplifies very clearly the truth of your remarks  the author of the article is mr george saintsbury a gentleman who has recently written a book on prose style and here are some specimens of the prose of the future according to the systeme saintsbury  1  he saw the rise and in some instances the death of tennyson thackeray macaulay carlyle dickens  2  see a place which kingsley or mr ruskin or some other master of our decorative school have describedmuch more one which has fallen into the hands of the small fry of their imitatorsand you are almost sure to find that it has been overdone  3  the great mass of his translations published and unpublished and the smaller mass of his early hackwork no doubt deserves judicious excerption  4  the romany rye did not appear for six years that is to say in 1857  5  the elaborate apparatus which most prose tellers of fantastic tales use and generally fail in using  6  the great writers whether they try to be like other people or try not to be like them and sometimes in the first case most of all succeed only in being themselves  7  if he had a slight overdose of celtic blood and celticpeculiarity it was more than made up by the readiness of literary expression which it gave him  he if any one bore an english heart though as there often has been there was something perhaps more than english as well as less than it in his fashion of expression  8  his flashes of ethical reflection which though like all ethical reflections often onesided  9  he certainly was an unfriend to whiggery  10  that it contains a great deal of quaint and piquant writing is only to say that its writer wrote it  11  wild wales too because of its easy and direct opportunity of comparing its description with the originals  12  the capital and fulllength portraits  13  whose attraction is one neither mainly nor in any very great degree one of pure form  14  constantly right in general  these are merely a few examples of the style of mr saintsbury a writer who seems quite ignorant of the commonest laws both of grammar and of literary expression who has apparently no idea of the difference between the pronouns this and that and has as little hesitation in ending the clause of a sentence with a preposition as he has in inserting a parenthesis between a preposition and its object a mistake of which the most ordinary schoolboy would be ashamed  and why can not our magazine writers use plain simple english  unfriend quoted above is a quite unnecessary archaism and so is such a phrase as with this borrow could not away in the sense of this borrow could not endure  borrows abstraction from general society may i suppose pass muster  pope talks somewhere of a hermits abstraction but what is the meaning of saying that the author of lavengro quartered castile and leon in the most interesting manner riding everywhere with his servant  and what defence can be made for such an expression as scott and other black beasts of borrows  black beast for bete noire is really abominable  the object of my letter however is not to point out the deficiencies of mr saintsburys style but to express my surprise that his article should have been admitted into the pages of a magazine like macmillans surely it does not require much experience to know that such an article is a disgrace even to magazine literature  george borrow  by george saintsbury  macmillans magazine january 1886     one of mr conways remainders   pall mall gazette february 1 1886  most people know that in the concoction of a modern novel crime is a more important ingredient than culture  mr hugh conway certainly knew it and though for cleverness of invention and ingenuity of construction he cannot be compared to m gaboriau that master of murder and its mysteries still he fully recognised the artistic value of villainy  his last novel a cardinal sin opens very well  mr philip bourchier mp for westshire and owner of redhills is travelling home from london in a firstclass railway carriage when suddenly through the window enters a roughlooking middleaged man brandishing a longlost marriage certificate the effect of which is to deprive the right honourable member of his property and estate  however mr bourchier mp is quite equal to the emergency  on the arrival of the train at its destination he invites the unwelcome intruder to drive home with him and reaching a lonely road shoots him through the head and gives information to the nearest magistrate that he has rid society of a dangerous highwayman  mr bourchier is brought to trial and triumphantly acquitted  so far everything goes well with him  unfortunately however the murdered man with that superhuman strength which on the stage and in novels always accompanies the agony of death had managed in falling from the dogcart to throw the marriage certificate up a fir tree  there it is found by a worthy farmer who talks that conventional rustic dialect which though unknown in the provinces is such a popular element in every adelphi melodrama and it ultimately falls into the hands of an unscrupulous young man who succeeds in blackmailing mr bourchier and in marrying his daughter  mr bourchier suffers tortures from excess of chloral and of remorse and there is psychology of a weird and wonderful kind that kind which mr conway may justly be said to have invented and the result of which is not to be underrated  for if to raise a goose skin on the reader be the aim of art mr conway must be regarded as a real artist so harrowing is his psychology that the ordinary methods of punctuation are quite inadequate to convey it  agony and asterisks follow each other on every page and as the murderers conscience sinks deeper into chaos the chaos of commas increases  finally mr bourchier dies splendide mendax to the end  a confession he rightly argued would break up the harmony of the family circle particularly as his eldest son had married the daughter of his luckless victim  few criminals are so thoughtful for others as mr bourchier is and we are not without admiration for the unselfishness of one who can give up the luxury of a deathbed repentance  a cardinal sin then on the whole may be regarded as a crude novel of a common melodramatic type  what is painful about it is its style which is slipshod and careless  to describe a honeymoon as a rare occurrence in any one persons life is rather amusing  there is an american story of a young couple who had to be married by telephone as the bridegroom lived in nebraska and the bride in new york and they had to go on separate honeymoons though perhaps this is not what mr conway meant but what can be said for a sentence like thisthe established favourites in the musical world are never quite sure but the new comer may not be one among the many they have seen fail or thisas it is the fate of such a very small number of men to marry a prima donna i shall be doing little harm or be likely to change plans of life by enumerating some of the disadvantages  the nineteenth century may be a prosaic age but we fear that if we are to judge by the general run of novels it is not an age of prose  a cardinal sin  by hugh conway  remington and co     to read or not to read   pall mall gazette february 8 1886  books i fancy may be conveniently divided into three classes  1  books to read such as ciceros letters suetonius vasaris lives of the painters the autobiography of benvenuto cellini sir john mandeville marco polo st simons memoirs mommsen and till we get a better one grotes history of greece  2  books to reread such as plato and keats in the sphere of poetry the masters not the minstrels in the sphere of philosophy the seers not the savants  3  books not to read at all such as thomsons seasons rogerss italy paleys evidences all the fathers except st augustine all john stuart mill except the essay on liberty all voltaires plays without any exception butlers analogy grants aristotle humes england lewess history of philosophy all argumentative books and all books that try to prove anything  the third class is by far the most important  to tell people what to read is as a rule either useless or harmful for the appreciation of literature is a question of temperament not of teaching to parnassus there is no primer and nothing that one can learn is ever worth learning but to tell people what not to read is a very different matter and i venture to recommend it as a mission to the university extension scheme  indeed it is one that is eminently needed in this age of ours an age that reads so much that it has no time to admire and writes so much that it has no time to think  whoever will select out of the chaos of our modern curricula the worst hundred books and publish a list of them will confer on the rising generation a real and lasting benefit  after expressing these views i suppose i should not offer any suggestions at all with regard to the best hundred books but i hope you will allow me the pleasure of being inconsistent as i am anxious to put in a claim for a book that has been strangely omitted by most of the excellent judges who have contributed to your columns  i mean the greek anthology the beautiful poems contained in this collection seem to me to hold the same position with regard to greek dramatic literature as do the delicate little figurines of tanagra to the phidian marbles and to be quite as necessary for the complete understanding of the greek spirit  i am also amazed to find that edgar allan poe has been passed over surely this marvellous lord of rhythmic expression deserves a place  if in order to make room for him it be necessary to elbow out some one else i should elbow out southey and i think that baudelaire might be most advantageously substituted for keble  no doubt both in the curse of kehama and in the christian year there are poetic qualities of a certain kind but absolute catholicity of taste is not without its dangers  it is only an auctioneer who should admire all schools of art     twelfth night at oxford   dramatic review february 20 1886  on saturday last the new theatre at oxford was opened by the university dramatic society  the play selected was shakespeares delightful comedy of twelfth night a play eminently suitable for performance by a club as it contains so many good acting parts  shakespeares tragedies may be made for a single star but his comedies are made for a galaxy of constellations  in the first he deals with the pathos of the individual in the second he gives us a picture of life  the oxford undergraduates then are to be congratulated on the selection of the play and the result fully justified their choice  mr bourchier as festa the clown was easy graceful and joyous as fanciful as his dress and as funny as his bauble  the beautiful songs which shakespeare has assigned to this character were rendered by him as charmingly as they were dramatically to act singing is quite as great an art as to sing  mr letchmere stuart was a delightful sir andrew and gave much pleasure to the audience  one may hate the villains of shakespeare but one cannot help loving his fools  mr macpherson was perhaps hardly equal to such an immortal part as that of sir toby belch though there was much that was clever in his performance  mr lindsay threw new and unexpected light on the character of fabian and mr clarks malvolio was a most remarkable piece of acting  what a difficult part malvolio is  shakespeare undoubtedly meant us to laugh all through at the pompous steward and to join in the practical joke upon him and yet how impossible not to feel a good deal of sympathy with him  perhaps in this century we are too altruistic to be really artistic  hazlitt says somewhere that poetical justice is done him in the uneasiness which olivia suffers on account of her mistaken attachment to orsino as her insensibility to the violence of the dukes passion is atoned for by the discovery of violas concealed love for him but it is difficult not to feel malvolios treatment is unnecessarily harsh  mr clark however gave a very clever rendering full of subtle touches  if i ventured on a bit of advice which i feel most reluctant to do it would be to the effect that while one should always study the method of a great artist one should never imitate his manner  the manner of an artist is essentially individual the method of an artist is absolutely universal  the first is personality which no one should copy the second is perfection which all should aim at  miss arnold was a most sprightly maria and miss farmer a dignified olivia but as viola mrs bewicke was hardly successful  her manner was too boisterous and her method too modern  where there is violence there is no viola where there is no illusion there is no illyria and where there is no style there is no shakespeare  mr higgins looked the part of sebastian to perfection and some of the minor characters were excellently played by mr adderley mr kingharman mr coningsby disraeli and lord albert osborne  on the whole the performance reflected much credit on the dramatic society indeed its excellence was such that i am led to hope that the university will some day have a theatre of its own and that proficiency in scenepainting will be regarded as a necessary qualification for the slade professorship  on the stage literature returns to life and archaeology becomes art  a fine theatre is a temple where all the muses may meet a second parnassus and the dramatic spirit though she has long tarried at cambridge seems now to be migrating to oxford     thebes did her green unknowing youth engage    she chooses athens in her riper age     the letters of a great woman   pall mall gazette march 6 1886  of the many collections of letters that have appeared in this century few if any can rival for fascination of style and variety of incident the letters of george sand which have recently been translated into english by m ledos de beaufort  they extend over a space of more than sixty years from 1812 to 1876 in fact and comprise the first letters of aurore dupin a child of eight years old as well as the last letters of george sand a woman of seventytwo  the very early letters those of the child and of the young married woman possess of course merely a psychological interest but from 1831 the date of madame dudevants separation from her husband and her first entry into paris life the interest becomes universal and the literary and political history of france is mirrored in every page  for george sand was an indefatigable correspondent she longs in one of her letters it is true for a planet where reading and writing are absolutely unknown but still she had a real pleasure in letterwriting her greatest delight was the communication of ideas and she is always in the heart of the battle  she discusses pauperism with louis napoleon in his prison at ham and liberty with armand barbes in his dungeon at vincennes she writes to lamennais on philosophy to mazzini on socialism to lamartine on democracy and to ledrurollin on justice  her letters reveal to us not merely the life of a great novelist but the soul of a great woman of a woman who was one with all the noblest movements of her day and whose sympathy with humanity was boundless absolutely  for the aristocracy of intellect she had always the deepest veneration but the democracy of suffering touched her more  she preached the regeneration of mankind not with the noisy ardour of the paid advocate but with the enthusiasm of the true evangelist  of all the artists of this century she was the most altruistic she felt every ones misfortunes except her own  her faith never left her to the end of her life as she tells us she was able to believe without illusions  but the people disappointed her a little  she saw that they followed persons not principles and for the great man theory george sand had no respect  proper names are the enemies of principles is one of her aphorisms  so from 1850 her letters are more distinctly literary  she discusses modern realism with flaubert and playwriting with dumas fils and protests with passionate vehemence against the doctrine of lart pour lart  art for the sake of itself is an idle sentence she writes art for the sake of truth for the sake of what is beautiful and good that is the creed i seek  and in a delightful letter to m charles poncy she repeats the same idea very charmingly  people say that birds sing for the sake of singing but i doubt it  they sing their loves and happiness and in that they are in keeping with nature  but man must do something more and poets only sing in order to move people and to make them think  she wanted m poncy to be the poet of the people and if good advice were all that had been needed he would certainly have been the burns of the workshop  she drew out a delightful scheme for a volume to be called songs of all trades and saw the possibilities of making handicrafts poetic  perhaps she valued good intentions in art a little too much and she hardly understood that art for arts sake is not meant to express the final cause of art but is merely a formula of creation but as she herself had scaled parnassus we must not quarrel at her bringing proletarianism with her  for george sand must be ranked among our poetic geniuses  she regarded the novel as still within the domain of poetry  her heroes are not dead photographs they are great possibilities  modern novels are dissections hers are dreams  i make popular types she writes such as i do no longer see but such as they should and might be  for realism in m zolas acceptation of the word she had no admiration  art to her was a mirror that transfigured truths but did not represent realities  hence she could not understand art without personality  i am aware she writes to flaubert that you are opposed to the exposition of personal doctrine in literature  are you right  does not your opposition proceed rather from a want of conviction than from a principle of aesthetics  if we have any philosophy in our brain it must needs break forth in our writings  but you as soon as you handle literature you seem anxious i know not why to be another man the one who must disappear who annihilates himself and is no more  what a singular mania  what a deficient taste  the worth of our productions depends entirely on our own  besides if we withhold our own opinions respecting the personages we create we naturally leave the reader in uncertainty as to the opinion he should himself form of them  that amounts to wishing not to be understood and the result of this is that the reader gets weary of us and leaves us  she herself however may be said to have suffered from too dominant a personality and this was the reason of the failure of most of her plays  of the drama in the sense of disinterested presentation she had no idea and what is the strength and lifeblood of her novels is the weakness of her dramatic works  but in the main she was right  art without personality is impossible  and yet the aim of art is not to reveal personality but to please  this she hardly recognised in her aesthetics though she realised it in her work  on literary style she has some excellent remarks  she dislikes the extravagances of the romantic school and sees the beauty of simplicity  simplicity she writes is the most difficult thing to secure in this world it is the last limit of experience and the last effort of genius  she hated the slang and argot of paris life and loved the words used by the peasants in the provinces the provinces she remarks preserve the tradition of the original tongue and create but few new words  i feel much respect for the language of the peasantry in my estimation it is the more correct  she thought flaubert too much preoccupied with the sense of form and makes these excellent observations to himperhaps her best piece of literary criticism  you consider the form as the aim whereas it is but the effect  happy expressions are only the outcome of emotion and emotion itself proceeds from a conviction  we are only moved by that which we ardently believe in  literary schools she distrusted individualism was to her the keystone of art as well as of life  do not belong to any school do not imitate any model is her advice  yet she never encouraged eccentricity  be correct she writes to eugene pelletan that is rarer than being eccentric as the time goes  it is much more common to please by bad taste than to receive the cross of honour  on the whole her literary advice is sound and healthy  she never shrieks and she never sneers  she is the incarnation of good sense  and the whole collection of her letters is a perfect treasurehouse of suggestions both on art and on politics  the manner of the translation is often rather clumsy but the matter is always so intensely interesting that we can afford to be charitable  letters of george sand  translated and edited by raphael ledos de beaufort  ward and downey     news from parnassus   pall mall gazette april 12 1886  that most delightful of all french critics m edmond scherer has recently stated in an article on wordsworth that the english read far more poetry than any other european nation  we sincerely hope this may be true not merely for the sake of the public but for the sake of the poets also  it would be sad indeed if the many volumes of poems that are every year published in london found no readers but the authors themselves and the authors relations and the real philanthropist should recognise it as part of his duties to buy every new book of verse that appears  sometimes we acknowledge he will be disappointed often he will be bored still now and then he will be amply rewarded for his reckless benevolence  mr george francis armstrongs stories of wicklow for instance is most pleasant reading  mr armstrong is already well known as the author of ugone king saul and other dramas and his latest volume shows that the power and passion of his early work has not deserted him  most modern irish poetry is purely political and deals with the wickedness of the landlords and the tories but mr armstrong sings of the picturesqueness of erin not of its politics  he tells us very charmingly of the magic of its mists and the melody of its colour and draws a most captivating picture of the peasants of the county wicklow whom he describes as     a kindly folk in vale and moor       unvexed with rancours frank and free    in mood and mannersrich with poor       attuned in happiest amity    where still the cottage door is wide       the stranger welcomed at the hearth    and pleased the humbler hearts confide       still in the friend of gentler birth  the most ambitious poem in the volume is de verdun of darragh  it is at once lyrical and dramatic and though its manner reminds us of browning and its method of maud still all through it there is a personal and individual note  mr armstrong also carefully observes the rules of decorum and as he promises his readers in a preface keeps quite clear of the seas of sensual art  in fact an elderly maiden lady could read this volume without a blush a thrill or even an emotion  dr goodchild does not possess mr armstrongs literary touch but his somnia medici is distinguished by a remarkable quality of forcible and direct expression  the poem that opens his volume myrrha or a dialogue on creeds is quite as readable as a metrical dialogue on creeds could possibly be and the organ builder is a most romantic story charmingly told  dr goodchild seems to be an ardent disciple of mr browning and though he may not be able to reproduce the virtues of his master at least he can echo his defects very cleverly  such a verse as     tis the subtle essayal       of the jews and judas    such lying lisp    might hail a willothewisp       a thin somebodytheudas  is an excellent example of low comedy in poetry  one of the best poems in the book is the ballad of three kingdoms  indeed if the form were equal to the conception it would be a delightful work of art but dr goodchild though he may be a master of metres is not a master of music yet  his verse is often harsh and rugged  on the whole however his volume is clever and interesting  mr keene has not we believe a great reputation in england as yet but in india he seems to be well known  from a collection of criticisms appended to his volume it appears that the overland mail has christened him the laureate of hindostan and that the allahabad pioneer once compared him to keats  he is a pleasant rhymer as rhymers go and though we strongly object to his putting the song of solomon into bad blank verse still we are quite ready to admire his translations of the pervigilium veneris and of omar khayyam  we wish he would not write sonnets with fifteen lines  a fifteenline sonnet is as bad a monstrosity as a sonnet in dialogue  the volume has the merit of being very small and contains many stanzas quite suitable for valentines  finally we come to procris and other poems by mr w g hole  mr hole is apparently a very young writer  his work at least is full of crudities his syntax is defective and his grammar is questionable  and yet when all is said in the one poem of procris it is easy to recognise the true poetic ring  elsewhere the volume is amateurish and weak  the spanish main was suggested by a leader in the daily telegraph and bears all the traces of its lurid origin  sir jocellyns trust is a sort of pseudotennysonian idyll in which the damozel says to her gallant rescuer come come sir knight i catch my death of cold and recompenses him with        what noble minds    regard the first rewardan orphans thanks  nunc dimittis is dull and the wandering jew dreadful but procris is a beautiful poem  the richness and variety of its metaphors the music of its lines the fine opulence of its imagery all seem to point to a new poet  faults it is true there are in abundance but they are faults that come from want of trouble not from want of taste  mr hole shows often a rare and exquisite sense of beauty and a marvellous power of poetic vision and if he will cultivate the technique of his craft a little more we have no doubt but that he will some day give us work worthy to endure  it is true that there is more promise than perfection in his verse at present yet it is a promise that seems likely to be fulfilled  1 stories of wicklow  by george francis armstrong ma  longmans green and co  2 somnia medici  by john a goodchild  second series  kegan

twixt love and duty by mr tighe hopkins we confess ourselves unable to inform anxious inquirers who it is that is thus sandwiched and how he or she got into so unpleasant a predicament  the curious reader with a taste for enigmas may be advised to find out for himselfif he can  even if he be unsuccessful his trouble will be repaid by the pleasant writing and clever character drawing of mr hopkinss tale  the plot is less praiseworthy  the whole madeira episode seems to lead up to this dilemma and after all it comes to nothing  we brace up our nerves for a tragedy and are treated instead to the mildest of marivaudagewhich is disappointing  in conclusion one word of advice to mr hopkins let him refrain from apostrophising his characters after this fashion oh gilbert reade what are you about that you dally with this golden chance and so forth  this is one of the worst mannerisms of a bygone generation of story tellers  mr gallenga has written as he says a tale without a murder but having put a pistolball through his heros chest and left him alive and hearty notwithstanding he cannot be said to have produced a tale without a miracle  his heroine too if we may judge by his descriptions of her is all a wonder and a wild desire  at the age of seventeen she was one of the great makers masterpieces    a living likeness of the dresden madonna  one rather shudders to think of what she may become at forty but this is an impertinent prying into futurity  she hails from maryland my maryland and has received a careful if not a superior education  need we add that she marries the heir to an earldom who as aforesaid has had himself perforated by a pistolbullet on her behalf mr gallengas division of this book into acts and scenes is not justified by anything specially dramatic either in its structure or its method  the dialogue in truth is somewhat stilted  nevertheless its firsthand sketches of roman society are not without interest and one or two characters seem to be drawn from nature  the lifes mistake which forms the theme of mrs lovett camerons two volumes is not a mistake after all but results in unmixed felicity and as it is brought about by fraud on the part of the hero this conclusion is not as moral as it might be  for the rest the tale is a very familiar one  its personages are the embarrassed squire with his charming daughter the wealthy and amorous mortgagee and the sailor lover who is either supposed to be drowned or falsely represented to be ficklein mrs camerons tale he is both in succession  when we add that there is a stanza from byron on the titlepage and a poetical quotation at the beginning of each chapter we have possessed the discerning reader of all necessary information both as to the matter and the manner of mrs camerons performance  mr e o pleydellbouverie has endowed the novelwriting fraternity with a new formula for the composition of titles  after j s or trivialities there is no reason why we should not have a b or platitudes mn or sentimentalisms yz or inanities  there are many books which these simple titles would characterise much more aptly than any highflown phrasesas aptly in fact as mr bouveries title characterises the volume before us  it sets forth the uninteresting fortunes of an insignificant person one john stiles a briefless barrister  the said john falls in love with a young lady inherits a competence omits to tell his love and is killed by the bursting of a fowlingpiecethat is all  the only point of interest presented by the book is the problem as to how it ever came to be written  we can scarcely find the solution in mr bouveries elaborately smart style which cannot be said to transmute his trivialities into flies in amber  mr swinburne once proposed that it should be a penal offence against literature for any writer to affix a proverb a phrase or a quotation to a novel by way of tag or title  we wonder what he would say to the title of pen olivers last book  probably he would empty on it the bitter vial of his scorn and satire  all but is certainly an intolerable name to give to any literary production  the story however is quite an interesting one  at laxenford hall live lord and lady arthur winstanley lady arthur has two children by her first marriage the elder of whom walter hopekennedy by name is heir to the broad acres  walter is a pleasant english boy fonder of cricket than of culture healthy happy and susceptible  he falls in love with fanny taylor a pretty village girl is thrown out of his dogcart one night through the machinations of a jealous rival breaks one of his ribs and gets a violent fever  his stepfather tries to murder him by subcutaneous injections of morphia but is detected by the local doctor and walter recovers  however he does not marry fanny after all and the story ends ineffectually  to say of a dress that it was rather under than over adorned is not very pleasing english and such a phrase as almost always but by no means invariably is quite detestable  still we must not expect the master of the scalpel to be the master of the stilus as well  all but is a very charming tale and the sketches of village life are quite admirable  we recommend it to all who are tired of the productions of mr hugh conways dreadful disciples  1 twixt love and duty a novel  by tighe hopkins  chatto and windus  2 jenny

reading  they give us facts without form science without style and learning without life  an exception however must be made for m gaston boissiers promenades archeologiques  m boissier is a most pleasant and picturesque writer and is really able to give his readers useful information without ever boring them an accomplishment which is entirely unknown in germany and in england is extremely rare  the first essay in his book is on the probable site of horaces country house a subject that has interested many scholars from the renaissance down to our own day  m boissier following the investigations of signor rosa places it on a little hill overlooking the licenza and his theory has a great deal to recommend it  the plough still turns up on the spot the bricks and tiles of an old roman villa a spring of clear water like that of which the poet so often sang breaks babbling from the hollow rock and is still called by the peasants fonte dell oratini some faint echo possibly of the singers name the view from the hill is just what is described in the epistles continui montes nisi dissocientur opaca valle hard by is the site of the ruined temple of vacuna where horace tells us he wrote one of his poems and the local rustics still go to varia vicovaro on market days as they used to do when the graceful roman lyrist sauntered through his vines and played at being a country gentleman  m boissier however is not content merely with identifying the poets house he also warmly defends him from the charge that has been brought against him of servility in accepting it  he points out that it was only after the invention of printing that literature became a moneymaking profession and that as there was no copyright law at rome to prevent books being pirated patrons had to take the place that publishers hold or should hold nowadays  the roman patron in fact kept the roman poet alive and we fancy that many of our modern bards rather regret the old system  better surely the humiliation of the sportula than the indignity of a bill for printing  better to accept a countryhouse as a gift than to be in debt to ones landlady  on the whole the patron was an excellent institution if not for poetry at least for the poets and though he had to be propitiated by panegyrics still are we not told by our most shining lights that the subject is of no importance in a work of art  m boissier need not apologise for horace every poet longs for a maecenas  an essay on the etruscan tombs at corneto follows and the remainder of the volume is taken up by a most fascinating article called le pays de leneide  m boissier claims for virgils descriptions of scenery an absolute fidelity of detail  les poetes anciens he says ont le gout de la precision et de la fidelite ils nimaginent guere de paysages en lair and with this view he visited every place in italy and sicily that virgil has mentioned  sometimes it is true modern civilisation or modern barbarism has completely altered the aspect of the scene the desolate shore of drepanum for instance drepani illaetabilis ora is now covered with thriving manufactories and stucco villas and the birdhaunted forest through which the tiber flowed into the sea has long ago disappeared  still on the whole the general character of the italian landscape is unchanged and m boissiers researches show very clearly how personal and how vivid were virgils impressions of nature the subject is of course a most interesting one and those who love to make pilgrimages without stirring from home cannot do better than spend three shillings on the french academicians promenades archeologiques  nouvelles promenades archeologiques horace et virgile  by gaston boissier  hachette     beranger in england   pall mall gazette april 21 1886  a philosophic politician once remarked that the best possible form of government is an absolute monarchy tempered by street ballads  without at all agreeing with this aphorism we still cannot but regret that the new democracy does not use poetry as a means for the expression of political opinion  the socialists it is true have been heard singing the later poems of mr william morris but the street ballad is really dead in england  the fact is that most modern poetry is so artificial in its form so individual in its essence and so literary in its style that the people as a body are little moved by it and when they have grievances against the capitalist or the aristocrat they prefer strikes to sonnets and rioting to rondels  possibly mr william toynbees pleasant little volume of translations from beranger may be the herald of a new school  beranger had all the qualifications for a popular poet  he wrote to be sung more than to be read he preferred the pont neuf to parnassus he was patriotic as well as romantic and humorous as well as humane  translations of poetry as a rule are merely misrepresentations but the muse of beranger is so simple and naive that she can wear our english dress with ease and grace and mr toynbee has kept much of the mirth and music of the original  here and there undoubtedly the translation could be improved upon rapiers for instance is an abominable rhyme to forefathers the hated arms of albion in the same poem is a very feeble rendering of le leopard de langlais and such a verse as     mid frances miracles of art       rare trophies won from arts own land    ive lived to see with burning heart       the fogbred poor triumphant stand  reproduces very inadequately the charm of the original     dans nos palais ou pres de la victoire    brillaient les arts doux fruits des beaux climats    jai vu du nord les peuplades sans gloire    de leurs manteaux secouer les frimas  on the whole however mr toynbees work is good les champs for example is very well translated and so are the two delightful poems rosette and ma republique and there is a good deal of spirit in le marquis de carabas     whom have we here in conquerors role    our grand old marquis bless his soul    whose grand old charger mark his bone    has borne him back to claim his own    note if you please the grand old style    in which he nears his grand old pile    with what an air of grand old state    he waves that blade immaculate       hats off hats off for my lord to pass       the grand old marquis of carabas  though that blade immaculate has hardly got the sting of un sabre innocent and in the fourth verse of the same poem marquise youll have the bedchamber does not very clearly convey the sense of the line la marquise a le tabouret  the best translation in the book is the court suit lhabit de cour and if mr toynbee will give us some more work as clever as this we shall be glad to see a second volume from his pen  beranger is not nearly well enough known in england and though it is always better to read a poet in the original still translations have their value as echoes have their music  a selection from the songs of de beranger in english verse  by william toynbee  kegan paul     the poetry of the people   pall mall gazette may 13 1886  the countess martinengo deserves well of all poets peasants and publishers  folklore is so often treated nowadays merely from the point of view of the comparative mythologist that it is really delightful to come across a book that deals with the subject simply as literature  for the folktale is the father of all fiction as the folksong is the mother of all poetry and in the games the tales and the ballads of primitive people it is easy to see the germs of such perfected forms of art as the drama the novel and the epic  it is of course true that the highest expression of life is to be found not in the popular songs however poetical of any nation but in the great masterpieces of selfconscious art yet it is pleasant sometimes to leave the summit of parnassus to look at the wildflowers in the valley and to turn from the lyre of apollo to listen to the reed of pan  we can still listen to it  to this day the vineyard dressers of calabria will mock the passerby with satirical verses as they used to do in the old pagan days and the peasants of the olive woods of provence answer each other in amoebaean strains  the sicilian shepherd has not yet thrown his pipe aside and the children of modern greece sing the swallowsong through the villages in springtime though theognis is more than two thousand years dead  nor is this popular poetry merely the rhythmic expression of joy and sorrow it is in the highest degree imaginative and taking its inspiration directly from nature it abounds in realistic metaphor and in picturesque and fantastic imagery  it must of course be admitted that there is a conventionality of nature as there is a conventionality of art and that certain forms of utterance are apt to become stereotyped by too constant use yet on the whole it is impossible not to recognise in the folk songs that the countess martinengo has brought together one strong dominant note of fervent and flawless sincerity  indeed it is only in the more terrible dramas of the elizabethan age that we can find any parallel to the corsican voceri with their shrill intensity of passion their awful frenzies of grief and hate  and yet ardent as the feeling is the form is nearly always beautiful  now and then in the poems of the extreme south one meets with a curious crudity of realism but as a rule the sense of beauty prevails  some of the folkpoems in this book have all the lightness and loveliness of lyrics all of them have that sweet simplicity of pure song by which mirth finds its own melody and mourning its own music and even where there are conceits of thought and expression they are conceits born of fancy not of affectation  herrick himself might have envied that wonderful lovesong of provence     if thou wilt be the falling dew       and fall on me alway    then i will be the white white rose       on yonder thorny spray    if thou wilt be the white white rose       on yonder thorny spray    then i will be the honeybee       and kiss thee all the day     if thou wilt be the honeybee       and kiss me all the day    then i will be in yonder heaven       the star of brightest ray    if thou wilt be in yonder heaven       the star of brightest ray    then i will be the dawn and we       shall meet

the ringdoves are    and be lovely as a star  we hardly know what poems are sung to english babies but we hope they are as beautiful as these two  blake might have written them  the countess martinengo has certainly given us a most fascinating book in a volume of moderate dimensions not too long to be tiresome nor too brief to be disappointing she has collected together the best examples of modern folksongs and with her as a guide the lazy reader lounging in his armchair may wander from the melancholy pineforests of the north to sicilys orangegroves and the pomegranate gardens of armenia and listen to the singing of those to whom poetry is a passion not a profession and whose art coming from inspiration and not from schools if it has the limitations at least has also the loveliness of its origin and is one with blowing grasses and the flowers of the field  essays in the study of folksongs  by the countess evelyn martinengo cesaresco  redway     the cenci   dramatic review may 15 1886  the production of the cenci last week at the grand theatre islington may be said to have been an era in the literary history of this century and the shelley society deserves the highest praise and warmest thanks of all for having given us an opportunity of seeing shelleys play under the conditions he himself desired for it  for the cenci was written absolutely with a view to theatric presentation and had shelleys own wishes been carried out it would have been produced during his lifetime at covent garden with edmund kean and miss oneill in the principal parts  in working out his conception shelley had studied very carefully the aesthetics of dramatic art  he saw that the essence of the drama is disinterested presentation and that the characters must not be merely mouthpieces for splendid poetry but must be living subjects for terror and for pity  i have endeavoured he says as nearly as possible to represent the characters as they probably were and have sought to avoid the error of making them actuated by my own conception of right or wrong false or true thus under a thin veil converting names and actions of the sixteenth century into cold impersonations of my own mind     i have avoided with great care the introduction of what is commonly called mere poetry and i imagine there will scarcely be found a detached simile or a single isolated description unless beatrices description of the chasm appointed for her fathers murder should be judged to be of that nature  he recognised that a dramatist must be allowed far greater freedom of expression than what is conceded to a poet  in a dramatic composition to use his own words the imagery and the passion should interpenetrate one another the former being reserved simply for the full development and illustration of the latter  imagination is as the immortal god which should assume flesh for the redemption of mortal passion  it is thus that the most remote and the most familiar imagery may alike be fit for dramatic purposes when employed in the illustration of strong feeling which raises what is low and levels to the apprehension that which is lofty casting over all the shadow of its own greatness  in other respects i have written more carelessly that is without an overfastidious and learned choice of words  in this respect i entirely agree with those modern critics who assert that in order to move men to true sympathy we must use the familiar language of men  he knew that if the dramatist is to teach at all it must be by example not by precept  the highest moral purpose he remarks aimed at in the highest species of the drama is the teaching the human heart through its sympathies and antipathies the knowledge of itself in proportion to the possession of which knowledge every human being is wise just sincere tolerant and kind  if dogmas can do more it is well but a drama is no fit place for the enforcement of them  he fully realises that it is by a conflict between our artistic sympathies and our moral judgment that the greatest dramatic effects are produced  it is in the restless and anatomising casuistry with which men seek the justification of beatrice yet feel that she has done what needs justification it is in the superstitious horror with which they contemplate alike her wrongs and their revenge that the dramatic character of what she did and suffered consists  in fact no one has more clearly understood than shelley the mission of the dramatist and the meaning of the drama  and yet i hardly think that the production of the cenci its absolute presentation on the stage can be said to have added anything to its beauty its pathos or even its realism  not that the principal actors were at all unworthy of the work of art they interpreted mr hermann vezins cenci was a noble and magnificent performance miss alma murray stands now in the very first rank of our english actresses as a mistress of power and pathos and mr leonard outrams orsino was most subtle and artistic but that the cenci needs for the production of its perfect effect no interpretation at all  it is as we read it a complete work of artcapable indeed of being acted but not dependent on theatric presentation and the impression produced by its exhibition on the stage seemed to me to be merely one of pleasure at the gratification of an intellectual curiosity of seeing how far melpomene could survive the wagon of thespis  in producing the play however the members of the shelley society were merely carrying out the poets own wishes and they are to be congratulated on the success of their experimenta success due not to any gorgeous scenery or splendid pageant but to the excellence of the actors who aided them     helena in troas   dramatic review may 22 1880  one might have thought that to have produced as you like it in an english forest would have satisfied the most ambitious spirit but mr godwin has not contented himself with his sylvan triumphs  from shakespeare he has passed to sophocles and has given us the most perfect exhibition of a greek dramatic performance that has as yet been seen in this country for beautiful as were the productions of the agamemnon at oxford and the eumenides at cambridge their effects were marred in no small or unimportant degree by the want of a proper orchestra for the chorus with its dance and song a want that was fully supplied in mr godwins presentation by the use of the arena of a circus  in the centre of this circle which was paved with the semblance of tesselated marble stood the altar of dionysios and beyond it rose the long shallow stage faced with casts from the temple of bassae and bearing the huge portal of the house of paris and the gleaming battlements of troy  over the portal hung a great curtain painted with crimson lions which when drawn aside disclosed two massive gates of bronze in front of the house was placed a golden image of aphrodite and across the ramparts on either hand could be seen a stretch of blue waters and faint purple hills  the scene was lovely not merely in the harmony of its colour but in the exquisite delicacy of its architectural proportions  no nation has ever felt the pure beauty of mere construction so strongly as the greeks and in this respect mr godwin has fully caught the greek feeling  the play opened by the entrance of the chorus white vestured and gold filleted under the leadership of miss kinnaird whose fine gestures and rhythmic movements were quite admirable  in answer to their appeal the stage curtains slowly divided and from the house of paris came forth helen herself in a robe woven with all the wonders of war and broidered with the pageant of battle  with her were her two handmaidensone in white and yellow and one in green hecuba followed in sombre grey of mourning and priam in kingly garb of gold and purple and paris in phrygian cap and light archers dress and when at sunset the lover of helen was borne back wounded from the field down from the oaks of ida stole oenone in the flowing drapery of the daughter of a rivergod every fold of her garments rippling like dim water as she moved  as regards the acting the two things the greeks valued most in actors were grace of gesture and music of voice  indeed to gain these virtues their actors used to subject themselves to a regular course of gymnastics and a particular regime of diet health being to the greeks not merely a quality of art but a condition of its production  whether or not our english actors hold the same view may be doubted but mr vezin certainly has always recognised the importance of a physical as well as of an intellectual training for the stage and his performance of king priam was distinguished by stately dignity and most musical enunciation  with mr vezin grace of gesture is an unconscious resultnot a conscious effort  it has become nature because it was once art  mr beerbohm tree also is deserving of very high praise for his paris  ease and elegance characterised every movement he made and his voice was extremely effective  mr tree is the perfect proteus of actors  he can wear the dress of any century and the appearance of any age and has a marvellous capacity of absorbing his personality into the character he is creating  to have method without mannerism is given only to a few but among the few is mr tree  miss alma murray does not possess the physique requisite for our conception of helen but the beauty of her movements and the extremely sympathetic quality of her voice gave an indefinable charm to her performance  mrs jopling looked like a poem from the pantheon and indeed the personae mutae were not the least effective figures in the play  hecuba was hardly a success  in acting the impression of sincerity is conveyed by tone not by mere volume of voice and whatever influence emotion has on utterance it is certainly not in the direction of false emphasis  mrs beerbohm trees oenone was much better and had some fine moments of passion but the harsh realistic shriek with which the nymph flung herself from the battlements however effective it might have been in a comedy of sardou or in one of mr burnands farces was quite out of place in the representation of a greek tragedy  the classical drama is an imaginative poetic art which requires the grand style for its interpretation and produces its effects by the most ideal means  it is in the operas of wagner not in popular melodrama that any approximation to the greek method can be found better to wear mask and buskin than to mar by any modernity of expression the calm majesty of melpomene  as an artistic whole however the performance was undoubtedly a great success  it has been much praised for its archaeology but mr godwin is something more than a mere antiquarian  he takes the facts of archaeology but he converts them into artistic and dramatic effects and the historical accuracy that underlies the visible shapes of beauty that he presents to us is not by any means the distinguishing quality of the complete work of art  this quality is the absolute unity and harmony of the entire presentation the presence of one mind controlling the most minute details and revealing itself only in that true perfection which hides personality  on more than one occasion it seemed to me that the stage was kept a little too dark and that a purely picturesque effect of light and shade was substituted for the plastic clearness of outline that the greeks so desired some objection too might be made to the late character of the statue of aphrodite which was decidedly postpericlean these however are unimportant points  the performance was not intended to be an absolute reproduction of the greek stage in the fifth century before christ it was simply the presentation in greek form of a poem conceived in the greek spirit and the secret of its beauty was the perfect correspondence of form and matter the delicate equilibrium of spirit and sense  as for the play it had of course to throw away many sweet superfluous graces of expression before it could adapt itself to the conditions of theatrical presentation but much that is good was retained and the choruses which really possess some pure notes of lyric loveliness were sung in their entirety  here and there it is true occur such lines as     what wilt thou do  what can the handful still left  lines that owe their blank verse character more to the courtesy of the printer than to the genius of the poet for without rhythm and melody there is no verse at all and the attempt to fit greek forms of construction to our english language often gives the work the air of an awkward translation however there is a great deal that is pleasing in helena in troas and on the whole the play was worthy of its pageant and the poem deserved the peplums  it is much to be regretted that mr godwins beautiful theatre cannot be made a permanent institution  even looked at from the low standpoint of educational value such a performance as that given last monday might be of the greatest service to modern culture and who knows but a series of these productions might civilise south kensington and give tone to brompton  still it is something to have shown our artists a dream of form in days of thought and to have allowed the philistines to peer into paradise and this is what mr godwin has done     pleasing and prattling   pall mall gazette august 4 1880  sixty years ago when sir walter scott was inaugurating an era of historical romance the wolfe of badenoch was a very popular book  to us its interest is more archaeological than artistic and its characters seem merely puppets parading in fourteenthcentury costume  it is true our grandfathers thought differently  they liked novels in which the heroine exclaims peace with thine impudence sir knave  dost thou dare to speak thus in presence of the lady eleanore de selby     a greybeards ire shall never while the hero remarks that the welkin reddenes i the west  in fact they considered that language like this is exceedingly picturesque and gives the necessary historical perspective  nowadays however few people have the time to read a novel that requires a glossary to explain it and we fear that without a glossary the general reader will hardly appreciate the value of such expressions as gnoffe bowke herborow papelarde couepe rethes pankers agroted lorrel and horrow tallowcatch all of which occur in the first few pages of the wolfe of badenoch  in a novel we want life not learning and unfortunately sir thomas lauder lays himself open to the criticism jonson made on spenser that in affecting the ancients he writ no language  still there is a healthy spirit of adventure in the book and no doubt many people will be interested to see the kind of novel the public liked in 1825  keep my secret by miss g m robins is very different  it is quite modern both in manner and in matter  the heroine miss olga damien when she is a little girl tries to murder mr victor burnside  mr burnside who is tall blueeyed and amberhaired makes her promise never to mention the subject to any one this in fact is the secret that gives the title to the book  the result is that miss damien is blackmailed by a fascinating and unscrupulous uncle and is nearly burnt to death in the secret chamber of an old castle  the novel at the end gets too melodramatic in character and the plot becomes a chaos of incoherent incidents but the writing is clever and bright  it is just the book in fact for a summer holiday as it is never dull and yet makes no demands at all upon the intellect  mrs chetwynd gives us a new type of widow  as a rule in fiction widows are delightful designing and deceitful but mrs dorriman is not by any means a cleopatra in crape  she is a weak retiring woman very feeble and very feminine and with the simplicity that is characteristic of such sweet and shallow natures she allows her brother to defraud her of all her property  the widow is rather a bore and the brother is quite a bear but margaret rivers who to save her sister from poverty marries a man she does not love is a cleverly conceived character and lady lyons is an admirable old dowager  the book can be read without any trouble and was probably written without any trouble also  the style is prattling and pleasing  the plot of delamere is not very new  on the death of her husband mrs de ruthven discovers that the estates belong by right not to her son raymond but to her niece fleurette  as she keeps her knowledge to herself a series of complications follows but the cousins are ultimately united in marriage and the story ends happily  mr curzon writes in a clever style and though its construction is rather clumsy the novel is a thoroughly interesting one  a daughter of fife tells us of the love of a young artist for a scotch fishergirl  the character sketches are exceptionally good especially that of david promoter a fisherman who leaves his nets to preach the gospel and the heroine is quite charming till she becomes civilised  the book is a most artistic combination of romantic feeling with realistic form and it is pleasant to read descriptions of scotch scenery that do not represent the land of mist and mountain as a sort of chromolithograph from the brompton road  in mr speights novel a barren title we have an impoverished earl who receives an allowance from his relations on condition of his remaining single being all the time secretly married and the father of a grownup son  the story is improbable and amusing  on the whole there is a great deal to be said for our ordinary english novelists  they have all some story to tell and most of them tell it in an interesting manner  where they fail is in concentration of style their characters are far too eloquent and talk themselves to tatters what we want is a little more reality and a little less rhetoric  we are most grateful to them that they have not as yet accepted any frigid formula nor stereotyped themselves into a school but we wish that they would talk less and think more  they lead us through a barren desert of verbiage to a mirage that they call life we wander aimlessly through a very wilderness of words in search of one touch of nature  however one should not be too severe on english

complained that balzac was very little read in england and although since then the public has become more familiar with the great masterpieces of french fiction still it may be doubted whether the comedie humaine is at all appreciated or understood by the general run of novel readers  it is really the greatest monument that literature has produced in our century and m taine hardly exaggerates when he says that after shakespeare balzac is our most important magazine of documents on human nature  balzacs aim in fact was to do for humanity what buffon had done for the animal creation  as the naturalist studied lions and tigers so the novelist studied men and women  yet he was no mere reporter  photography and procesverbal were not the essentials of his method  observation gave him the facts of life but his genius converted facts into truths and truths into truth  he was in a word a marvellous combination of the artistic temperament with the scientific spirit  the latter he bequeathed to his disciples the former was entirely his own  the distinction between such a book as m zolas lassommoir and such a book as balzacs illusions perdues is the distinction between unimaginative realism and imaginative reality  all balzacs characters said baudelaire are gifted with the same ardour of life that animated himself  all his fictions are as deeply coloured as dreams  every mind is a weapon loaded to the muzzle with will  the very scullions have genius  he was of course accused of being immoral  few writers who deal directly with life escape that charge  his answer to the accusation was characteristic and conclusive  whoever contributes his stone to the edifice of ideas he wrote whoever proclaims an abuse whoever sets his mark upon an evil to be abolished always passes for immoral  if you are true in your portraits if by dint of daily and nightly toil you succeed in writing the most difficult language in the world the word immoral is thrown in your face  the morals of the personages of the comedie humaine are simply the morals of the world around us  they are part of the artists subjectmatter they are not part of his method  if there be any need of censure it is to life not to literature that it should be given  balzac besides is essentially universal  he sees life from every point of view  he has no preferences and no prejudices  he does not try to prove anything  he feels that the spectacle of life contains its own secret  ii cree un monde et se tait  and what a world it is  what a panorama of passions  what a pellmell of men and women  it was said of trollope that he increased the number of our acquaintances without adding to our visiting list but after the comedie humaine one begins to believe that the only real people are the people who have never existed  lucien de rubempre le pere goriot ursule mirouet marguerite claes the baron hulot madame marneffe le cousin pons de marsayall bring with them a kind of contagious illusion of life  they have a fierce vitality about them their existence is fervent and fierycoloured we not merely feel for them but we see themthey dominate our fancy and defy scepticism  a steady course of balzac reduces our living friends to shadows and our acquaintances to the shadows of shades  who would care to go out to an evening party to meet tomkins the friend of ones boyhood when one can sit at home with lucien de rubempre  it is pleasanter to have the entree to balzacs society than to receive cards from all the duchesses in may fair  in spite of this there are many people who have declared the comedie humaine to be indigestible  perhaps it is but then what about truffles balzacs publisher refused to be disturbed by any such criticism as that indigestible is it he exclaimed with what for a publisher was rare good sense  well i should hope so who ever thinks of a dinner that isnt  and our english publisher mr routledge clearly agrees with m pouletmalassis as he is occupied in producing a complete translation of the comedie humaine  the two volumes that at present lie before us contain cesar birotteau that terrible tragedy of finance and llllustre gaudissart the apotheosis of the commercial traveller the duchesse de langeais most marvellous of modern love stories le chef doeuvre inconnu from which mr henry james took his madonna of the future and that extraordinary romance une passion dans le desert  the choice of stories is quite excellent but the translations are very unequal and some of them are positively bad  llllustre gaudissart for instance is full of the most grotesque mistakes mistakes that would disgrace a schoolboy  bon conseil vaut un oeil dans la main is translated good advice is an egg in the hand  ecus rebelles is rendered rebellious lucre and such common expressions as faire la barbe attendre la vente nentendre rien palir sur une affaire are all mistranslated des bois de quoi se faire un curedent is not a few trees to slice into toothpicks but as much timber as would make a toothpick son horloge enfermee dans une grande armoire oblongue is not a clock which he kept shut up in a large oblong closet but simply a clock in a tall clockcase journal viager is not an annuity garce is not the same as farce and dessins des indes are not drawings of the indies  on the whole nothing can be worse than this translation and if mr routledge wishes the public to read his version of the comedie humaine he should engage translators who have some slight knowledge of french  cesar birotteau is better though it is not by any means free from mistakes  to suffer under the maximum is an absurd rendering of subir le maximum perse is chintz not persian chintz rendre le pain benit is not to take the wafer riviere is hardly a fillet of diamonds and to translate son coeur avait un calus a lendroit du loyer by his heart was a callus in the direction of a lease is an insult to two languages  on the whole the best version is that of the duchesse de langeais though even this leaves much to be desired  such a sentence as to imitate the rough logician who marched before the pyrrhonians while denying his own movement entirely misses the point of balzacs imiter le rude logicien qui marchait devant les pyrrhoniens qui niaient le mouvement  we fear mr routledges edition will not do  it is well printed and nicely bound but his translators do not understand french  it is a great pity for la comedie humaine is one of the masterpieces of the age  balzacs novels in english  the duchesse de langeais and other stories cesar birotteau  routledge and sons     two new novels   pall mall gazette september 16 1880  most modern novels are more remarkable for their crime than for their culture and mr g manville fenns last venture is no exception to the general rule  the master of the ceremonies is turbid terrifying and thrilling  it contains besides many moving accidents by flood and field an elopement an abduction a bigamous marriage an attempted assassination a duel a suicide and a murder  the murder we must acknowledge is a masterpiece  it would do credit to gaboriau and should make miss braddon jealous  the newgate calendar itself contains nothing more fascinating and what higher praise than this can be given to a sensational novel  not that lady teigne the hapless victim is killed in any very new or subtle manner  she is merely strangled in bed like desdemona but the circumstances of the murder are so peculiar that claire denville in common with the reader suspects her own father of being guilty while the father is convinced that the real criminal is his eldest son  stuart denville himself the master of the ceremonies is most powerfully drawn  he is a penniless padded dandy who by a careful study of the grand style in deportment has succeeded in making himself the brummel of the promenade and the autocrat of the assembly rooms  a light comedian by profession he is suddenly compelled to play the principal part in a tragedy  his shallow trivial nature is forced into the loftiest heroism the noblest selfsacrifice  he becomes a hero against his will  the butterfly goes to martyrdom the fop has to become fine  round this character centres or rather should centre the psychological interest of the book but unfortunately mr fenn has insisted on crowding his story with unnecessary incident  he might have made of his novel a souls tragedy but he has produced merely a melodrama in three volumes  the master of the ceremonies is a melancholy example of the fatal influence of drury lane on literature  still it should be read for though mr fenn has offered up his genius as a holocaust to mr harris he is never dull and his style is on the whole very good  we wish however that he would not try to give articulate form to inarticulate exclamations  such a passage as this is quite dreadful and fails besides in producing the effect it aims at     hehehe hihihi hechechec hahaha hoho  bless    myheyha heyha hughhughhugh  oh dear me  ohwhy dont    youheckheckheckheckheck shut    thehohohohohughhughwindow before ihohohoho  this horrible jargon is supposed to convey the impression of a lady coughing  it is of course a mere meaningless monstrosity on a par with spelling a sneeze  we hope that mr fenn will not again try these theatrical tricks with language for he possesses a rare artthe art of telling a story well  a statesmans love the author tells us in a rather mystical preface was written to show that the alchemistlike transfiguration supposed to be wrought in our whole nature by that passion has no existence in fact but it cannot be said to prove this remarkable doctrine  it is an exaggerated psychological study of a modern woman a sort of picture by limelight full of coarse colours and violent contrasts not by any means devoid of cleverness but essentially false and overemphasised  the heroine helen rohan by name tells her own story and as she takes three volumes to do it in we weary of the one point of view  life to be intelligible should be approached from many sides and valuable though the permanent ego may be in philosophy the permanent ego in fiction soon becomes a bore  there are however some interesting scenes in the novel and a good portrait of the young pretender for though the heroine is absolutely a creation of the nineteenth century the background of the story is historical and deals with the rebellion of 45  as for the style it is often original and picturesque here and there are strong individual touches and brilliant passages but there is also a good deal of pretence and a good deal of carelessness  what can be said for instance about such expressions as these taken at random from the second volumeevanishing solitary loneness in my then mood the bees might advantage by today i would not listen reverently as did the other some who went entangling myself in the net of this retiari and why should bassanios beautiful speech in the trial scene be deliberately attributed to shylock  on the whole a statesmans love cannot be said to be an artistic success but still it shows promise and some day the author who to judge by the style is probably a woman may do good work  this however will require pruning prudence and patience  we shall see  1 the master of the ceremonies  by g manville fenn  ward and downey  2 a statesmans love  by emile bauche  blackwood and co     ben jonson   pall mall gazette september 20 1886  in selecting mr john addington symonds to write the life of ben jonson for his series of english worthies mr lang no doubt exercised a wise judgment  mr symonds like the author of volpone is a scholar and a man of letters his book on shakspeares predecessors showed a marvellous knowledge of the elizabethan period and he is a recognised authority on the italian renaissance  the last is not the least of his qualifications  without a full appreciation of the meaning of the humanistic movement it is impossible to understand the great struggle between the classical form and the romantic spirit which is the chief critical characteristic of the golden age of the english drama an age when shakespeare found his chief adversary not among his contemporaries but in seneca and when jonson armed himself with aristotle to win the suffrages of a london audience  mr symonds book consequently will be opened with interest  it does not of course contain much that is new about jonsons life  but the facts of jonsons life are already well known and in books of this kind what is true is of more importance than what is new appreciation more valuable than discovery  scotchmen however will no doubt be interested to find that mr symonds has succeeded in identifying jonsons crest with that of the johnstones of annandale and the story of the way the literary titan escaped from hanging by proving that he could read is graphically told  on the whole we have a vivid picture of the man as he lived  where picturesqueness is required mr symonds is always good  the usual comparison with dr johnson is of course brought out  few of rare bens biographers spare us that and the point is possibly a natural one to make  but when mr symonds calls upon us to notice that both men made a journey to scotland and that each found in a scotchman his biographer the parallel loses all value  there is an m in monmouth and an m in macedon and drummond of hawthornden and boswell of auchinleck were both born the other side of the tweed but from such analogies nothing is to be learned  there is no surer way of destroying a similarity than to strain it  as for mr symonds estimate of jonsons genius it is in many points quite excellent  he ranks him with the giants rather than with the gods with those who compel our admiration by their untiring energy and huge strength of intellectual muscle not with those who share the divine gifts of creative imagination and inevitable instinct  here he is right  pelion more than parnassus was jonsons home  his art has too much effort about it too much definite intention  his style lacks the charm of chance  mr symonds is right also in the stress he lays on the extraordinary combination in jonsons work of the most concentrated realism with encyclopaedic erudition  in jonsons comedies london slang and learned scholarship go hand in hand  literature was as living a thing to him as life itself  he used his classical lore not merely to give form to his verse but to give flesh and blood to the persons of his plays  he could build up a breathing creature out of quotations  he made the poets of greece and rome terribly modern and introduced them to the oddest company  his very culture is an element in his coarseness there are moments when one is tempted to liken him to a beast that has fed off books  we cannot however agree with mr symonds when he says that jonson rarely touched more than the outside of character that his men and women are the incarnations of abstract properties rather than living human beings that they are in fact mere masqueraders and mechanical puppets  eloquence is a beautiful thing but rhetoric ruins many a critic and mr symonds is essentially rhetorical  when for instance he tells us that jonson made masks while dekker and heywood created souls we feel that he is asking us to accept a crude judgment for the sake of a smart antithesis  it is of course true that we do not find in jonson the same growth of character that we find in shakespeare and we may admit that most of the characters in jonsons plays are so to speak readymade  but a readymade character is not necessarily either mechanical or wooden two epithets mr symonds uses constantly in his criticism  we cannot tell and shakespeare himself does not tell us why iago is evil why regan and goneril have hard hearts or why sir andrew aguecheek is a fool  it is sufficient that they are what they are and that nature gives warrant for their existence  if a character in a play is lifelike if we recognise it as true to nature we have no right to insist on the author explaining its genesis to us  we must accept it as it is and in the hands of a good dramatist mere presentation can take the place of analysis and indeed is often a more dramatic method because a more direct one  and jonsons characters are true to nature  they are in no sense abstractions they are types  captain bobadil and captain tucca sir john daw and sir amorous la foole volpone and mosca subtle and sir epicure mammon mrs purecraft and the rabbi busy are all creatures of flesh and blood none the less lifelike because they are labelled  in this point mr symonds seems to us unjust towards jonson  we think also that a special chapter might have been devoted to jonson as a literary critic  the creative activity of the english renaissance is so great that its achievements in the sphere of criticism are often overlooked by the student  then for the first time was language treated as an art  the laws of expression and composition were investigated and formularised  the importance of words was recognised romanticism realism and classicism fought their first battles  the dramatists are full of literary and art criticisms and amused the public with slashing articles on one another in the form of plays  mr symonds of course deals with jonson in his capacity as a critic and always with just appreciation but the whole subject is one that deserves fuller and more special treatment  some small inaccuracies too should be corrected in the second edition dryden for instance was not jonsons successor on the laureates throne as mr symonds eloquently puts it for sir william davenant came between them and when one remembers the predominance of rhyme in shakespeares early plays it is too much to say that after the production of the first part of tamburlaine blank verse became the regular dramatic metre of the public stage  shakespeare did not accept blank verse at once as a gift from marlowes hand but himself arrived at it after a long course of experiments in rhyme  indeed some of mr symonds remarks on marlowe are very curious  to say of his edward ii for instance that it is not at all inferior to the work of shakespeares younger age is very niggardly and inadequate praise and comes strangely from one who has elsewhere written with such appreciation of marlowes great genius while to call marlowe jonsons master is to make for him an impossible claim  in comedy marlowe has nothing whatever to teach jonson in tragedy jonson sought for the classical not the romantic form  as for mr symonds style it is as usual very fluent very picturesque and very full of colour  here and there however it is really irritating  such a sentence as the tavern had the defects of its quality is an awkward gallicism and when mr symonds after genially comparing jonsons blank verse to the front of whitehall a comparison by the way that would have enraged the poet beyond measure proceeds to play a fantastic aria on the same string and tells us that massinger reminds us of the intricacies of sansovino shakespeare of gothic aisles or heavens cathedral     ford of glittering corinthian colonnades webster of vaulted crypts     marlowe of masoned clouds and marston in his better moments of the fragmentary vigour of a roman ruin one begins to regret that any one ever thought of the unity of the arts similes such as these obscure they do not illumine  to say that ford is like a glittering corinthian colonnade adds nothing to our knowledge of either ford or greek architecture  mr symonds has written some charming poetry but his prose unfortunately is always poetical prose never the prose of a poet  still the volume is worth reading though decidedly mr symonds to use one of his own phrases has the defects of his quality  english worthies  edited by andrew lang  ben jonson  by john addington symonds

appearance among the nineteenthcentury poets is extremely remarkable  not that a tramps mode of life is at all unsuited to the development of the poetic faculty far from it  he if any one should possess that freedom of mood which is so essential to the artist for he has no taxes to pay and no relations to worry him  the man who possesses a permanent address and whose name is to be found in the directory is necessarily limited and localised  only the tramp has absolute liberty of living  was not homer himself a vagrant and did not thespis go about in a caravan  it is then with feelings of intense expectation that we open the little volume that lies before us  it is entitled low down by two tramps and is marvellous even to look at  it is clear that art has at last reached the criminal classes  the cover is of brown paper like the covers of mr whistlers brochures  the printing exhibits every fantastic variation of type and the pages range in colour from blue to brown from grey to sage green and from rose pink to chrome yellow  the philistines may sneer at this chromatic chaos but we do not  as the painters are always pilfering from the poets why should not the poet annex the domain of the painter and use colour for the expression of his moods and music blue for sentiment and red for passion grey for cultured melancholy and green for descriptions  the book then is a kind of miniature rainbow and with all its varied sheets is as lovely as an advertisement hoarding as for the peripateticsalas they are not nightingales  their note is harsh and rugged mr g r sims is the god of their idolatry their style is the style of the surrey theatre and we are sorry to see that that disregard of the rights of property which always characterises the ablebodied vagrant is extended by our tramps from the defensible pilfering from henroosts to the indefensible pilfering from poets  when we read such lines as     and builded him a pyramid four square       open to all the sky and every wind  we feel that bad as poultrysnatching is plagiarism is worse  facilis descensus averno  from highway robbery and crimes of violence one sinks gradually to literary petty larceny  however there are coarsely effective poems in the volume such as a supers philosophy dick hewlett a ballad of the californian school and gentleman bill and there is one rather pretty poem called the return of spring     when robins hop on naked boughs       and swell their throats with song    when labrers trudge behind their ploughs       and blithely whistle their teams along     when glints of summer sunshine chase       park shadows on the distant hills    and scented tufts of pansies grace       moist grots that scape rude borean chills  the last line is very disappointing  no poet nowadays should write of rude boreas he might just as well call the dawn aurora or say that flora decks the enamelled meads  but there are some nice touches in the poem and it is pleasant to find that tramps have their harmless moments  on the whole the volume if it is not quite worth reading is at least worth looking at  the fools motley in which it is arrayed is extremely curious and extremely characteristic  mr irwins muse comes to us more simply clad and more gracefully  she gains her coloureffect from the poet not from the publisher  no cockneyism or colloquialism mars the sweetness of her speech  she finds music for every mood and form for every feeling  in art as in life the law of heredity holds good  on est toujours fits de quelquun  and so it is easy to see that mr irwin is a fervent admirer of mr matthew arnold  but he is in no sense a plagiarist  he has succeeded in studying a fine poet without stealing from hima very difficult thing to doand though many of the reeds through which he blows have been touched by other lips yet he is able to draw new music from them  like most of our younger poets mr irwin is at his best in his sonnets and those entitled the seeker after god and the pillar of the empire are really remarkable  all through this volume however one comes across good work and the descriptions of indian scenery are excellent  india in fact is the picturesque background to these poems and her monstrous beasts strange flowers and fantastic birds are used with much subtlety for the production of artistic effect  perhaps there is a little too much about the pipaltree but when we have a proper sense of imperial unity no doubt the pipaltree will be as dear and as familiar to us as the oaks and elms of our own woodlands  1 low down wayside

among countries for though it lies westward of piccadilly yet it is purely oriental in character and though it is but three hours sail from europe yet it makes you feel to use the forcible expression of an american writer as if you had been taken up by the scruff of the neck and set down in the old testament  mr hugh stutfield has ridden twelve hundred miles through it penetrated to fez and wazan seen the lovely gate at mequinez and the hassen tower by rabat feasted with sheikhs and fought with robbers lived in an atmosphere of moors mosques and mirages visited the city of the lepers and the slavemarket of sus and played loo under the shadow of the atlas mountains  he is not an herodotus nor a sir john mandeville but he tells his stories very pleasantly  his book on the whole is delightful reading for though morocco is picturesque he does not weary us with word painting though it is poor he does not bore us with platitudes  now and then he indulges in a travellers licence and thrills the simple reader with statements as amazing as they are amusing  the moorish coinage he tells us is so cumbersome that if a man gives you change for halfacrown you have to hire a donkey to carry it away the moorish language is so guttural that no one can ever hope to pronounce it aright who has not been brought up within hearing of the grunting of camels a steady course of sneezing being consequently the only way by which a european can acquire anything like the proper accent the sultan does not know how much he is married but he unquestionably is so to a very large extent on the principle that you cannot have too much of a good thing a woman is valued in proportion to her stoutness and so far from there being any reduction made in the marriagemarket for taking a quantity you must pay so much per pound the arabs believe the shereef of wazan to be such a holy man that if he is guilty of taking champagne the forbidden wine is turned into milk as he quaffs it and if he gets extremely drunk he is merely in a mystical trance  mr stutfield however has his serious moments and his account of the commerce government and social life of the moors is extremely interesting  it must be confessed that the picture he draws is in many respects a very tragic one  the moors are the masters of a beautiful country and of many beautiful arts but they are paralysed by their fatalism and pillaged by their rulers  few races indeed have had a more terrible fall than these moors  of the great intellectual civilisation of the arabs no trace remains  the names of averroes and almaimon of al abbas and ben husa are quite unknown  fez once the athens of africa the cradle of the sciences is now a mere commercial caravansary  its universities have vanished its library is almost empty  freedom of thought has been killed by the koran freedom of living by bad government  but mr stutfield is not without hopes for the future  so far from agreeing with lord salisbury that morocco may go her own way he strongly supports captain warrens proposition that we should give up gibraltar to spain in exchange for ceuta and thereby prevent the mediterranean from becoming a french lake and give england a new granary for corn  the moorish empire he warns us is rapidly breaking up and if in the general scramble for africa that has already begun the french gain possession of morocco he points out that our supremacy over the straits will be lost  whatever may be thought of mr stutfields political views and his suggestions for multiple control and collective european action there is no doubt that in morocco england has interests to defend and a mission to pursue and this part of the book should be carefully studied  as for the general reader who we fear is not as a rule interested in the question of multiple control if he is a sportsman he will find in el magreb a capital account of pig sticking if he is artistic he will be delighted to know that the importation of magenta into morocco is strictly prohibited if criminal jurisprudence has any charms for him he can examine a code that punishes slander by rubbing cayenne pepper into the lips of the offender and if he is merely lazy he can take a pleasant ride of twelve hundred miles in mr stutfields company without stirring out of his armchair  el magreb twelve hundred miles ride through morocco  by hugh stutfield  sampson low marston and co     the children of the poets   pall mall gazette october 14 1886  the idea of this book is exceedingly charming  as children themselves are the perfect flowers of life so a collection of the best poems written on children should be the most perfect of all anthologies  yet the book itself is not by any means a success  many of the loveliest childpoems in our literature are excluded and not a few feeble and trivial poems are inserted  the editors work is characterised by sins of omission and of commission and the collection consequently is very incomplete and very unsatisfactory  andrew marvells exquisite poem the picture of little t c for instance does not appear in mr robertsons volume nor the young love of the same author nor the beautiful elegy ben jonson wrote on the death of salathiel pavy the little boyactor of his plays  wallers verses also to my young lady lucy sidney deserve a place in an anthology of this kind and so do mr matthew arnolds lines to a gipsy child and edgar allan poes annabel lee a little lyric full of strange music and strange romance  there is possibly much to be said in favour of such a poem as that which ends with     and i thank my god with falling tears    for the things in the bottom drawer  but how different it is from     i was a child and she was a child    in this kingdom by the sea    but we loved with a love that was more than love       i and my annabel lee    with a love that the winged seraphs of heaven       coveted her and me  the selection from blake again is very incomplete many of the loveliest poems being excluded such as those on the little girl lost and the little girl found the cradle song infant joy and others nor can we find sir henry wottons hymn upon the birth of prince charles sir william joness dainty fourline epigram on the babe or the delightful lines to t l h a child by charles lamb  the gravest omission however is certainly that of herrick  not a single poem of his appears in mr robertsons collection  and yet no english poet has written of children with more love and grace and delicacy  his ode on the birth of our saviour his poem to his saviour a child a present by a child his graces for children and his many lovely epitaphs on children are all of them exquisite works of art simple sweet and sincere  an english anthology of childpoems that excludes herrick is as an english garden without its roses and an english woodland without its singing birds and for one verse of herrick we would gladly give in exchange even those long poems by mr ashbysterry miss menella smedley and mr lewis morris of penrhyn to which mr robertson has assigned a place in his collection  mr robertson also should take care when he publishes a poem to publish it correctly  mr bret hartes dickens in camp for instance is completely spoiled by two ridiculous misprints  in the first line dimpling is substituted for drifting to the entire ruin of rhyme and reason and in the ninth verse the pensive glory that fills the kentish hills appears as the persian glory    with a large capital p  mistakes such as these are quite unpardonable and make one feel that perhaps after all it was fortunate for herrick that he was left out  a poet can survive everything but a misprint  as for mr robertsons preface like most of the prefaces in the canterbury series it is very carelessly written  such a sentence as i    believe that mrs piatts poems in particular will come to many readers fresh as well as delightful contributions from across the ocean is painful to read  nor is the matter much better than the manner  it is fantastic to say that raphaels pictures of the madonna and child dealt a deadly blow to the monastic life and to say with reference to greek art that cupid by the side of venus enables us to forget that most of her sighs are wanton is a very crude bit of art criticism indeed  wordsworth again should hardly be spoken of as one who was not in the general a man from whom human sympathies welled profusely but this criticism is as nothing compared to the passage where mr robertson tells us that the scene between arthur and hubert in king john is not true to nature because the childs pleadings for his life are playful as well as piteous  indeed mr robertson forgetting mamillius as completely as he misunderstands arthur states very clearly that shakespeare has not given us any deep readings of child nature paradoxes are always charming but judgments such as these are not paradoxical they are merely provincial  on the whole mr robertsons book will not do  it is we fully admit an industrious compilation but it is not an anthology it is not a selection of the best for it lacks the discrimination and good taste which is the essence of selection and for the want of which no amount of industry can atone  the childpoems of our literature have still to be edited  the children of the poets an anthology from english and american writers of three generations  edited with an introduction by eric s robertson  walter scott     new novels   pall mall gazette october 28 1886  astray a tale of a country town is a very serious volume  it has taken four people to write it and even to read it requires assistance  its dulness is premeditated and deliberate and comes from a laudable desire to rescue fiction from flippancy  it is in fact tedious from the noblest motives and wearisome through its good intentions  yet the story itself is not an uninteresting one  quite the contrary  it deals with the attempt of a young doctor to build up a noble manhood on the ruins of a wasted youth  burton king while little more than a reckless lad forges the name of a dying man is arrested and sent to penal servitude for seven years  on his discharge he comes to live with his sisters in a little country town and finds that his real punishment begins when he is free for prison has made him a pariah  still through the nobility and selfsacrifice of his life he gradually wins himself a position and ultimately marries the prettiest girl in the book  his character is on the whole well drawn and the authors have almost succeeded in making him good without making him priggish  the method however by which the story is told is extremely tiresome  it consists of an interminable series of long letters by different people and of extracts from various diaries  the book consequently is piecemeal and unsatisfactory  it fails in producing any unity of effect  it contains the rough material for a story but is not a completed work of art  it is in fact more of a notebook than a novel  we fear that too many collaborators are like too many cooks and spoil the dinner  still in this tale of a country town there are certain solid qualities and it is a book that one can with perfect safety recommend to other people  miss rhoda broughton belongs to a very different school  no one can ever say of her that she has tried to separate flippancy from fiction and whatever harsh criticisms may be passed on the construction of her sentences she at least possesses that one touch of vulgarity that makes the whole world kin  we are sorry however to see from a perusal of bettys visions that miss broughton has been attending the meetings of the psychical society in search of copy  mysticism is not her mission and telepathy should be left to messrs myers and gurney  in philistia lies miss broughtons true sphere and to philistia she should return she knows more about the vanities of this world than about this worlds visions and a possible garrison town is better than an impossible ghost land  that other person who gives mrs alfred hunt the title for her three volume novel is a young girl by name hester langdale who for the sake of mr godfrey daylesford sacrifices everything a woman can sacrifice and on his marrying some one else becomes a hospital nurse  the hospital nurse idea is perhaps used by novelists a little too often in cases of this kind still it has an artistic as well as an ethical value  the interest of the story centres however in mr daylesford who marries not for love but for ambition and is rather severely punished for doing so  mrs daylesford has a sister called polly who develops according to the approved psychological method from a hobbledehoy girl into a tender sweet woman  polly is delightfully drawn but the most attractive character in the book strangely enough is mr godfrey daylesford  he is very weak but he is very charming  so charming indeed is he that it is only when one closes the book that one thinks of censuring him  while we are in direct contact with him we are fascinated  such a character has at any rate the morality of truth about it  here literature has faithfully followed life  mrs hunt writes a very pleasing style bright and free from affectation  indeed everything in her work is clever except the title  a child of the revolution is by the accomplished authoress of the atelier du lys  the scene opens in france in 1793 and the plot is extremely ingenious  the wife of jacques vaudes a lyons deputy loses by illness her baby girl while her husband is absent in paris where he has gone to see danton  at the instigation of an old priest she adopts a child of the same age a little orphan of noble birth whose parents have died in the reign of terror and passes it off as her own  her husband a stern and ardent republican worships the child with a passion like that of jean valjean for cosette nor is it till she has grown to perfect womanhood that he discovers that he has given his love to the daughter of his enemy  this is a noble story but the workmanship though good of its kind is hardly adequate to the idea  the style lacks grace movement and variety  it is correct but monotonous  seriousness like property has its duties as well as its rights and the first duty of a novel is to please  a child of the revolution hardly does that  still it has merits  aphrodite is a romance of ancient hellas  the supposed date as given in the first line of miss saffords admirable translation is 551 bc  this however is probably a misprint  at least we cannot believe that so careful an archaeologist as ernst eckstein would talk of a famous school of sculpture existing at athens in the sixth century and the whole character of the civilisation is of a much later date  the book may be described as a new setting of the tale of acontius and cydippe and though eckstein is a sort of literary tadema and cares more for his backgrounds than he does for his figures still he can tell a story very well and his hero is made of flesh and blood  as regards the style the germans have not the same feeling as we have about technicalities in literature  to our ears such words as phoreion secos oionistes thyrides and the like sound harshly in a novel and give an air of pedantry not of picturesqueness  yet in its tone aphrodite reminds us of the late greek novels  indeed it might be one of the lost tales of miletus  it deserves to have many readers and a better binding  1 astray a tale of a country town  by charlotte m yonge mary bramston christabel coleridge and esme stuart  hatchards  2 bettys visions  by rhoda broughton  routledge and sons  3 that other person  by mrs alfred hunt  chatto and windus  4

and co     a politicians poetry   pall mall gazette november 3 1886  although it is against etiquette to quote greek in parliament homer has always been a great favourite with our statesmen and indeed may be said to be almost a factor in our political life  for as the crossbenches form a refuge for those who have no minds to make up so those who cannot make up their minds always take to homeric studies  many of our leaders have sulked in their tents with achilles after some violent political crisis and enraged at the fickleness of fortune more than one has given up to poetry what was obviously meant for party  it would be unjust however to regard lord carnarvons translation of the odyssey as being in any sense a political manifesto  between calypso and the colonies there is no connection and the search for penelope has nothing to do with the search for a policy  the love of literature alone has produced this version of the marvellous greek epic and to the love of literature alone it appeals  as lord carnarvon says very truly in his preface each generation in turn delights to tell the story of odysseus in its own language for the story is one that never grows old  of the labours of his predecessors in translation lord carnarvon makes ample recognition though we acknowledge that we do not consider popes homer the work of a great poet and we must protest that there is more in chapman than quaint elizabethan conceits  the metre he has selected is blank verse which he regards as the best compromise between the inevitable redundancy of rhyme and the stricter accuracy of prose  this choice is on the whole a sensible one  blank verse undoubtedly gives the possibility of a clear and simple rendering of the original  upon the other hand though we may get homers meaning we often miss his music  the tensyllabled line brings but a faint echo of the long roll of the homeric hexameter its rapid movement and continuous harmony besides except in the hands of a great master of song blank verse is apt to be tedious and lord carnarvons use of the weak ending his habit of closing the line with an unimportant word is hardly consistent with the stateliness of an epic however valuable it might be in dramatic verse  now and then also lord carnarvon exaggerates the value of the homeric adjective and for one word in the greek gives us a whole line in the english  the simple greek text for instance is converted into and when the shades of evening fall around in the second book and elsewhere purely decorative epithets are expanded into elaborate descriptions  however there are many pleasing qualities in lord carnarvons verse and though it may not contain much subtlety of melody still it has often a charm and sweetness of its own  the description of calypsos garden for example is excellent     around the grotto grew a goodly grove    alder and poplar and the cypress sweet    and the deepwinged seabirds found their haunt    and owls and hawks and longtongued cormorants    who joy to live upon the briny flood    and oer the face of the deep cave a vine    wove its wild tangles and clustering grapes    four fountains too each from the other turned    poured their white waters whilst the grassy meads    bloomed with the parsley and the violets flower  the story of the cyclops is not very well told  the grotesque humour of the giants promise hardly appears in        thee then noman last of all    will i devour and this thy gift shall be  and the bitter play on words odysseus makes the pun on greek text in fact is not noticed  the idyll of nausicaa however is very gracefully translated and there is a great deal that is delightful in the circe episode  for simplicity of diction this is also very good     so to olympus through the woody isle    hermes departed and i went my way    to circes halls sore troubled in my mind    but by the fairtressed goddess gate i stood    and called upon her and she heard my voice    and forth she came and oped the shining doors    and bade me in and sad at heart i went    then did she set me on a stately chair    studded with silver nails of cunning work    with footstool for my feet and mixed a draught    of her foul witcheries in golden cup    for evil was her purpose  from her hand    i took the cup and drained it to the dregs    nor felt the magic charm but with her rod    she smote me and she said go get thee hence    and herd thee with thy fellows in the stye    so spake she and straightway i drew my sword    upon the witch and threatened her with death  lord carnarvon on the whole has given us a very pleasing version of the first half of the odyssey  his translation is done in a scholarly and careful manner and deserves much praise  it is not quite homer of course but no translation can hope to be that for no work of art can afford to lose its style or to give up the manner that is essential to it  still those who cannot read greek will find much beauty in it and those who can will often gain a charming reminiscence  the odyssey of homer  books ixii  translated into english verse by the earl of carnarvon  macmillan and co     mr symonds history of the renaissance   pall mall gazette november 10 1886  mr symonds has at last finished his history of the italian renaissance the two volumes just published deal with the intellectual and moral conditions in italy during the seventy years of the sixteenth century which followed the coronation of charles the fifth at bologna an era to which mr symonds gives the name of the catholic reaction and they contain a most interesting and valuable account of the position of spain in the italian peninsula the conduct of the tridentine council the specific organisation of the holy office and the company of jesus and the state of society upon which those forces were brought to bear  in his previous volumes mr symonds had regarded the past rather as a picture to be painted than as a problem to be solved  in these two last volumes however he shows a clearer appreciation of the office of history  the art of the picturesque chronicler is completed by something like the science of the true historian the critical spirit begins to manifest itself and life is not treated as a mere spectacle but the laws of its evolution and progress are investigated also  we admit that the desire to represent life at all costs under dramatic conditions still accompanies mr symonds and that he hardly realises that what seems romance to us was harsh reality to those who were engaged in it  like most dramatists also he is more interested in the psychological exceptions than in the general rule  he has something of shakespeares sovereign contempt of the masses  the people stir him very little but he is fascinated by great personalities  yet it is only fair to remember that the age itself was one of exaggerated individualism and that literature had not yet become a mouthpiece for the utterances of humanity  men appreciated the aristocracy of intellect but with the democracy of suffering they had no sympathy  the cry from the brickfields had still to be heard  mr symonds style too has much improved  here and there it is true we come across traces of the old manner as in the apocalyptic vision of the seven devils that entered italy with the spaniard and the description of the inquisition as a belialmoloch a hideous idol whose face was blackened with soot from burning human flesh  such a sentence also as over the dead sea of social putrefaction floated the sickening oil of jesuitical hypocrisy reminds us that rhetoric has not yet lost its charms for mr symonds still on the whole the style shows far more reserve balance and sobriety than can be found in the earlier volumes where violent antithesis forms the predominant characteristic and accuracy is often sacrificed to an adjective  amongst the most interesting chapters of the book are those on the inquisition on sarpi the great champion of the severance of church from state and on giordano bruno  indeed the story of brunos life from his visit to london and oxford his sojourn in paris and wanderings through germany down to his betrayal at venice and martyrdom at rome is most powerfully told and the estimate of the value of his philosophy and the relation he holds to modern science is at once just and appreciative the account also of ignatius loyola and the rise of the society of jesus is extremely interesting though we cannot think that mr symonds is very happy in his comparison of the jesuits to fanatics laying stones upon a railway or dynamiters blowing up an emperor or a corner of westminster hall  such a judgment is harsh and crude in expression and more suitable to the clamour of the protestant union than to the dignity of the true historian  mr symonds however is rarely deliberately unfair and there is no doubt but that his work on the catholic reaction is a most valuable contribution to modern historyso valuable indeed that in the account he gives of the inquisition in venice it would be well worth his while to bring the picturesque fiction of the text into some harmony with the plain facts of the footnote  on the poetry of the sixteenth century mr symonds has of course a great deal to say and on such subjects he always writes with ease grace and delicacy of perception  we admit that we weary sometimes of the continual application to literature of epithets appropriate to plastic and pictorial art  the conception of the unity of the arts is certainly of great value but in the present condition of criticism it seems to us that it would be more useful to emphasise the fact that each art has its separate method of expression  the essay on tasso however is delightful reading and the position the poet holds towards modern music and modern sentiment is analysed with much subtlety  the essay on marino also is full of interest  we have often wondered whether those who talk so glibly of euphuism and marinism in literature have ever read either euphues or the adone  to the latter they can have no better guide than mr symonds whose description of the poem is most fascinating marino like many greater men has suffered much from his disciples but he himself was a master of graceful fancy and of exquisite felicity of phrase not of course a great poet but certainly an artist in poetry and one to whom language is indebted  even those conceits that mr symonds feels bound to censure have something charming about them  the continual use of periphrases is undoubtedly a grave fault in style yet who but a pedant would really quarrel with such periphrases as sirena de boschi for the nightingale or il novella edimione for galileo  from the poets mr symonds passes to the painters not those great artists of florence and venice of whom he has already written but the eclectics of bologna the naturalists of naples and rome  this chapter is too polemical to be pleasant  the one on music is much better and mr symonds gives us a most interesting description of the gradual steps by which the italian genius passed from poetry and painting to melody and song till the whole of europe thrilled with the marvel and mystery of this new language of the soul  some small details should perhaps be noticed  it is hardly accurate for instance to say that monteverdes orfeo was the first form of the recitativeopera as peris dafne and euridice and cavalieres rappresentazione preceded it by some years and it is somewhat exaggerated to say that under the regime of the commonwealth the national growth of english music received a check from which it never afterwards recovered as it was with cromwells auspices that the first english opera was produced thirteen years before any opera was regularly established in paris  the fact that england did not make such development in music as italy and germany did must be ascribed to other causes than the prevalence of puritan opinion  these however are minor points  mr symonds is to be warmly congratulated on the completion of his history of the renaissance in italy  it is a most wonderful monument of literary labour and its value to the student of humanism cannot be doubted  we have often had occasion to differ from mr symonds on questions of detail and we have more than once felt it our duty to protest against the rhetoric and overemphasis of his style but we fully recognise the importance of his work and the impetus he has given to the study of one of the vital periods of the worlds history  mr symonds learning has not made him a pedant his culture has widened not narrowed his sympathies and though he can hardly be called a great historian yet he will always occupy a place in english literature as one of the remarkable men of letters in the nineteenth century  renaissance in italy the catholic reaction  in two parts  by john addington symonds  smith elder and co     a jolly art critic   pall mall gazette november 18 1886  there is a healthy bankholiday atmosphere about this book which is extremely pleasant  mr quilter is entirely free from affectation of any kind  he rollicks through art with the recklessness of the tourist and describes its beauties with the enthusiasm of the auctioneer  to many no doubt he will seem to be somewhat blatant and bumptious but we prefer to regard him as being simply british  mr quilter is the apostle of the middle classes and we are glad to welcome his gospel  after listening so long to the don quixote of art to listen once to sancho panza is both salutary and refreshing  as for his sententiae they differ very widely in character and subject some of them are ethical such as humility may be carried too far some literary as for one froude there are a thousand mrs markhams and some scientific as objects which are near display more detail than those which are further off  some again breathe a fine spirit of optimism as picturesqueness is the birthright of the bargee others are jubilant as paint firm and be jolly and many are purely autobiographical such as no 97 few of us understand what it is that we mean by art  nor is mr quilters manner less interesting than his matter  he tells us that at this festive season of the year with christmas and roast beef looming before us similes drawn from eating and its results occur most readily to the mind  so he announces that subject is the diet of painting that perspective is the bread of art and that beauty is in some way like jam drawings he points out are not made by recipe like puddings nor is art composed of suet raisins and candied peel though mr cecil lawsons landscapes do smack of indigestion  occasionally it is true he makes daring excursions into other realms of fancy as when he says that in the best reynolds landscapes one seems to smell the sawdust or that advance in art is of a kangaroo character but on the whole he is happiest in his eating similes and the secret of his style is evidently la metaphore vient en mangeant  about artists and their work mr quilter has of course a great deal to say  sculpture he regards as paintings poor relation so with the exception of a jaunty allusion to the rough modelling of tanagra figurines he hardly refers at all to the plastic arts but on painters he writes with much vigour and joviality  holbeins wonderful court portraits naturally do not give him much pleasure in fact he compares them as works of art to the sham series of scottish kings at holyrood but dore he tells us had a wider imaginative range in all subjects where the gloomy and the terrible played leading parts than probably any artist who ever lived and may be called the carlyle of artists  in gainsborough he sees a plainness almost amounting to brutality while vulgarity and snobbishness are the chief qualities he finds in sir joshua reynolds  he has grave doubts whether sir frederick leightons work is really greek after all and can discover in it but little of rocky ithaca  mr poynter however is a carthorse compared to the president and frederick walker was a dull greek because he had no sympathy with poetry  linnells pictures are a sort of up guards and at em paintings and masons exquisite idylls are as national as a jingo poem  mr birket fosters landscapes smile at one much in the same way that mr carker used to flash his teeth and mr john collier gives his sitter a cheerful slap on the back before he says like a shampooer in a turkish bath next man  mr herkomers art is if not a catchpenny art at all events a catchmanypounds art and mr w b richmond is a clever trifler who might do really good work if he would employ his time in learning to paint  it is obviously unnecessary for us to point out how luminous these criticisms are how delicate in expression  the remarks on sir joshua reynolds alone exemplify the truth of sententia no 19 from a picture we gain but little more than we bring  on the general principles of art mr quilter writes with equal lucidity  that there is a difference between colour and colours that an artist be he portraitpainter or dramatist always reveals himself in his manner are ideas that can hardly be said to occur to him but mr quilter really does his best and bravely faces every difficulty in modern art with the exception of mr whistler  painting he tells us is of a different quality to mathematics and finish in art is adding more fact  portrait painting is a bad pursuit for an emotional artist as it destroys his personality and his sympathy however even for the emotional artist there is hope as a portrait can be converted into a picture by adding to the likeness of the sitter some dramatic interest or some picturesque adjunct  as for etchings they are of two kindsbritish and foreign  the latter fail in propriety  yet really fine etching is as free and easy as is the chat between old chums at midnight over a smokingroom fire  consonant with these rollicking views of art is mr quilters healthy admiration for the three primary colours red blue and yellow  any one he points out can paint in good tone who paints only in black and white and the great sign of a good decorator is his capability of doing without neutral tints indeed on decoration mr quilter is almost eloquent  he laments most bitterly the divorce that has been made between decorative art and what we usually call pictures makes the customary appeal to the last judgment and reminds us that in the great days of art michael angelo was the furnishing upholsterer  with the present tendencies of decorative art in england mr quilter consequently has but little sympathy and he makes a gallant appeal to the british householder to stand no more nonsense  let the honest fellow he says on his return from his countinghouse tear down the persian hangings put a chop on the anatolian plate mix some toddy in the venetian glass and carry his wife off to the national gallery to look at our own mulready  and then the picture he draws of the ideal home where everything though ugly is hallowed by domestic memories and where beauty appeals not to the heartless eye but the family affections babys chair there and the mothers workbasket    near the fire and the ornaments fred brought home from india on the mantelboard  it is really impossible not to be touched by so charming a description  how valuable also in connection with house decoration is sententia no 351 there is nothing furnishes a room like a bookcase and plenty of books in it  how cultivated the mind that thus raises literature to the position of upholstery and puts thought on a level with the antimacassar  and finally for the young workers in art mr quilter has loud words of encouragement  with a sympathy that is absolutely reckless of grammar he knows from experience what an amount of study and mental strain are involved in painting a bad picture honestly he exhorts them sententia no 267 to go on quite bravely and sincerely making mess after mess from nature and while sternly warning them that there is something wrong if they do not feel washed out after each drawing he still urges them to put a new piece of goods in the window every morning  in fact he is quite severe on mr ruskin for not recognising that a picture should denote the frailty of man and remarks with pleasing courtesy and felicitous grace that many phases of feeling    are as much a dead letter to this great art teacher as sanskrit to an islington cabman  nor is mr quilter one of those who fails to practice what he preaches  far from it  he goes on quite bravely and sincerely making mess after mess from literature and misquotes shakespeare wordsworth alfred de musset mr matthew arnold mr swinburne and mr fitzgeralds rubaiyat in strict accordance with sententia no 251 which tells us that work must be abominable if it is ever going to be good  only unfortunately his own work never does get good  not content with his misquotations he misspells the names of such wellknown painters as madoxbrown bastien lepage and meissonier hesitates between ingres and ingres talks of mr millais and mr linton alludes to mr frank holl simply as hall speaks with easy familiarity of mr burnejones as jones and writes of the artist whom he calls old chrome with an affection that reminds us of mr tullivers love for jeremy taylor  on the whole the book will not do  we fully admit that it is extremely amusing and no doubt mr quilter is quite earnest in his endeavours to elevate art to the dignity of manual labour but the extraordinary vulgarity of the style alone will always be sufficient to prevent these sententiae artis from being anything more than curiosities of literature mr quilter has missed his chance for he has failed even to make himself the tupper of painting  sententiae artis first principles of art for painters and picture lovers  by harry quilter ma  isbister  a reply to this review appeared on november 23     a sentimental journey through literature   pall mall gazette december 1 1886  this is undoubtedly an interesting book not merely through its eloquence and earnestness but also through the wonderful catholicity of taste that it displays  mr noel has a passion for panegyric  his eulogy on keats is closely followed by a eulogy on whitman and his praise of lord tennyson is equalled only by his praise of mr robert buchanan sometimes we admit we would like a little more fineness of discrimination a little more delicacy of perception  sincerity of utterance is valuable in a critic but sanity of judgment is more valuable still and mr noels judgments are not always distinguished by their sobriety  many of the essays however are well worth reading  the best is certainly that on the poetic interpretation of nature in which mr noel claims that what is called by mr ruskin the pathetic fallacy of literature is in reality a vital emotional truth but the essays on hugo and mr browning are good also the little paper entitled rambles by the cornish seas is a real marvel of delightful description and the monograph on chatterton has a good deal of merit though we must protest very strongly against mr noels idea that chatterton must be modernised before he can be appreciated  mr noel has absolutely no right whatsoever to alter chattertons yonge damoyselles and anlace fell into youthful damsels and weapon fell for chattertons archaisms were an essential part of his inspiration and his method  mr noel in one of his essays speaks with much severity of those who prefer sound to sense in poetry and no doubt this is a very wicked thing to do but he himself is guilty of a much graver sin against art when in his desire to emphasise the meaning of chatterton he destroys chattertons music  in the modernised version he gives of the wonderful songe to aella he mars by his corrections the poems metrical beauty ruins the rhymes and robs the music of its echo  nineteenthcentury restorations have done quite enough harm to english architecture without english poetry being treated in the same manner and we hope that when mr noel writes again about chatterton he will quote from the poets verse not from a publishers version  this however is not by any means the chief blot on mr noels book  the fault of his book is that it tells us far more about his own personal feelings than it does about the qualities of the various works of art that are criticised  it is in fact a diary of the emotions suggested by literature rather than any real addition to literary criticism and we fancy that many of the poets about whom he writes so eloquently would be not a little surprised at the qualities he finds in their work  byron for instance who spoke with such contempt of what he called twaddling about trees and babbling o green fields byron who cried away with this cant about nature  a good poet can imbue a pack of cards with more poetry than inhabits the forests of america is claimed by mr noel as a true natureworshipper and pantheist along with wordsworth and shelley and we wonder what keats would have thought of a critic who gravely suggests that endymion is a parable of the development of the individual soul  there are two ways of misunderstanding a poem  one is to misunderstand it and the other to praise it for qualities that it does not possess  the latter is mr noels method and in his anxiety to glorify the artist he often does so at the expense of the work of art  mr noel also is constantly the victim of his own eloquence  so facile is his style that it constantly betrays him into crude and extravagant statements  rhetoric and overemphasis are the dangers that mr noel has not always succeeded in avoiding  it is extravagant for instance to say that all great poetry has been pictorial or that coleridges knights grave is worth many kubla khans or that byron has the splendid imperfection of an aeschylus or that we had lately one dramatist living in england and only one who could be compared to hugo and that was richard hengist horne and that to find an english dramatist of the same order before him we must go back to sheridan if not to otway  mr noel again has a curious habit of classing together the most incongruous names and comparing the most incongruous works of art  what is gained by telling us that sardanapalus is perhaps hardly equal to sheridan that lord tennysons ballad of the revenge and his ode on the death of the duke of wellington are worthy of a place beside thomsons rule britannia that edgar allan poe disraeli and mr alfred austin are artists of note whom we may affiliate on byron and that if sappho and milton had not high genius they would be justly reproached as sensational  and surely it is a crude judgment that classes baudelaire of all poets with marini and mediaeval troubadours and a crude style that writes of goethe shelley scott and wilson for a mortal should not thus intrude upon the immortals even though he be guilty of holding with them that cain is one of the finest poems in the english language it is only fair however to add that mr noel subsequently makes more than ample amends for having opened parnassus to the public in this reckless manner by calling wilson an offalfeeder on the ground that he once wrote a severe criticism of some of lord tennysons early poems for mr noel does not mince his words  on the contrary he speaks with much scorn of all euphuism and delicacy of expression and preferring the affectation of nature to the affectation of art he thinks nothing of calling other people laura bridgmans jackasses and the like  this we think is to be regretted especially in a writer so cultured as mr noel  for though indignation may make a great poet bad temper always makes a poor critic  on the whole mr noels book has an emotional rather than an intellectual interest  it is simply a record of the moods of a man of letters and its criticisms merely reveal the critic without illuminating what he would criticise for us  the best that we can say of it is that it is a sentimental journey through literature the worst that any one could say of it is that it has all the merits of such an expedition  essays on poetry and poets  by the hon roden noel  kegan paul     commonsense in art   pall mall gazette january 8 1887  at this critical moment in the artistic development of england mr john collier has come forward as the champion of commonsense in art  it will be remembered that mr quilter in one of his most vivid and picturesque metaphors compared mr colliers method as a painter to that of a shampooer in a turkish bath 119  as a writer mr collier is no less interesting  it is true that he is not eloquent but then he censures with just severity the meaningless eloquence of the writers on aesthetics we admit that he is not subtle but then he is careful to remind us that leonardo da vincis views on painting are nonsensical his qualities are of a solid indeed we may say of a stolid order he is thoroughly honest sturdy and downright and he advises us if we want to know anything about art to study the works of helmholtz stokes or tyndall to which we hope we may be allowed to add mr colliers own manual of oil painting  for this art of painting is a very simple thing indeed according to mr collier  it consists merely in the representation of natural objects by means of pigments on a flat surface  there is nothing he tells us so very mysterious in it after all  every natural object appears to us as a sort of pattern of different shades and colours and the task of the artist is so to arrange his shades and colours on his canvas that a similar pattern is produced  this is obviously pure commonsense and it is clear that artdefinitions of this character can be comprehended by the very meanest capacity and indeed may be said to appeal to it  for the perfect development however of this patternproducing faculty a severe training is necessary  the art student must begin by painting china crockery and still life generally  he should rule his straight lines and employ actual measurements wherever it is possible  he will also find that a plumbline comes in very useful  then he should proceed to greek sculpture for from pottery to phidias is only one step ultimately he will arrive at the living model and as soon as he can faithfully represent any object that he has before him he is a painter after this there is of course only one thing to be considered the important question of subject  subjects mr collier tells us are of two kinds ancient and modern  modern subjects are more healthy than ancient subjects but the real difficulty of modernity in art is that the artist passes his life with respectable people and that respectable people are unpictorial  for picturesqueness consequently he should go to the rural poor and for pathos to the london slums  ancient subjects offer the artist a very much wider field  if he is fond of rich stuffs and costly accessories he should study the middle ages if he wishes to paint beautiful people untrammelled by any considerations of historical accuracy he should turn to the greek and roman mythology and if he is a mediocre painter he should choose his subject from the old and new testament a recommendation by the way that many of our royal academicians seem already to have carried out  to paint a real historical picture one requires the assistance of a theatrical costumier and a photographer  from the former one hires the dresses and the latter supplies one with the true background  besides subjectpictures there are also portraits and landscapes  portrait painting mr collier tells us makes no demands on the imagination  as is the sitter so is the work of art  if the sitter be commonplace for instance it would be contrary to the fundamental principles of portraiture to make the picture other than commonplace  there are however certain rules that should be followed  one of the most important of these is that the artist should always consult his sitters relations before he begins the picture  if they want a profile he must do them a profile if they require a full face he must give them a full face and he should be careful also to get their opinion as to the costume the sitter should wear and the sort of expression he should put on  after all says mr collier pathetically it is they who have to live with the picture  besides the difficulty of pleasing the victims family however there is the difficulty of pleasing the victim  according to mr collier and he is of course a high authority on the matter portrait painters bore their sitters very much  the true artist consequently should encourage his sitter to converse or get some one to read to him for if the sitter is bored the portrait will look sad  still if the sitter has not got an amiable expression naturally the artist is not bound to give him one nor if he is essentially ungraceful should the artist ever put him in a graceful attitude  as regards landscape painting mr collier tells us that a great deal of nonsense has been talked about the impossibility of reproducing nature but that there is nothing really to prevent a picture giving to the eye exactly the same impression that an actual scene gives for that when he visited the celebrated panorama of the siege of paris he could hardly distinguish the painted from the real cannons  the whole passage is extremely interesting and is really one out of many examples we might give of the swift and simple manner in which the commonsense method solves the great problems of art  the book concludes with a detailed exposition of the undulatory theory of light according to the most ancient scientific discoveries  mr collier points out how important it is for an artist to hold sound views on the subject of ether waves and his own thorough appreciation of science may be estimated by the definition he gives of it as being neither more nor less than knowledge  mr collier has done his work with much industry and earnestness  indeed nothing but the most conscientious seriousness combined with real labour could have produced such a book and the exact value of common sense in art has never before been so clearly demonstrated  a manual of oil painting  by the hon john collier  cassell and co     miner and minor poets   pall mall gazette february 1 1887  the conditions that precede artistic production are so constantly treated as qualities of the work of art itself that one sometimes is tempted to wish that all art were anonymous  yet there are certain forms of art so individual in their utterance so purely personal in their expression that for a full appreciation of their style and manner some knowledge of the artists life is necessary  to this class belongs mr skipseys carols from the coalfields a volume of intense human interest and high literary merit and we are consequently glad to see that dr spence watson has added a short biography of his friend to his friends poems for the life and the literature are too indissolubly wedded ever really to be separated  joseph skipsey dr watson tells us was sent into the coal pits at percy main near north shields when he was seven years of age  young as he was he had to work from twelve to sixteen hours in the day generally in the pitch dark and in the dreary winter months he saw the sun only upon sundays  when he went to work he had learned the alphabet and to put words of two letters together but he was really his own schoolmaster and taught himself to write for example by copying the letters from printed bills or notices when he could get a candle endhis paper being the trapdoor which it was his duty to open and shut as the wagons passed through and his pen a piece of chalk  the first book he really read was the bible and not content with reading it he learned by heart the chapters which specially pleased him  when sixteen years old he was presented with a copy of lindley murrays grammar by the aid of which he gained some knowledge of the structural rules of english  he had already become acquainted with paradise lost and was another proof of matthew priors axiom who often reads will sometimes want to write for he had begun to write verse when only a bonnie pit lad  for more than forty years of his life he laboured in the coaldark underground and is now the caretaker of a boardschool in newcastleupontyne  as for the qualities of his poetry they are its directness and its natural grace  he has an intellectual as well as a metrical affinity with blake and possesses something of blakes marvellous power of making simple things seem strange to us and strange things seem simple  how delightful for instance is this little poem     get up the caller calls get up       and in the dead of night    to win the bairns their bite and sup       i rise a weary wight     my flannel dudden donnd thrice oer       my birds are kissd and then    i with a whistle shut the door       i may not ope again  how exquisite and fanciful this stray lyric     the wind comes from the west tonight       so sweetly down the lane he bloweth    upon my lips with pure delight       from head to foot my body gloweth     where did the wind the magic find       to charm me thus say heart that knoweth    within a rose on which he blows       before upon thy lips he bloweth  we admit that mr skipseys work is extremely unequal but when it is at its best it is full of sweetness and strength and though he has carefully studied the artistic capabilities of language he never makes his form formal by overpolishing  beauty with him seems to be an unconscious result rather than a conscious aim his style has all the delicate charm of chance  we have already pointed out his affinity to blake but with burns also he may be said to have a spiritual kinship and in the songs of the northumbrian miner we meet with something of the ayrshire peasants wild gaiety and mad humour  he gives himself up freely to his impressions and there is a fine careless rapture in his laughter  the whole book deserves to be read and much of it deserves to be loved  mr skipsey can find music for every mood whether he is dealing with the real experiences of the pitman or with the imaginative experiences of the poet and his verse has a rich vitality about it  in these latter days of shallow rhymes it is pleasant to come across some one to whom poetry is a passion not a profession  mr f b doveton belongs to a different school  in his amazing versatility he reminds us of the gentleman who wrote the immortal handbills for mrs jarley for his subjects range from dr carter moffatt and the ammoniaphone to mr whiteley lady bicyclists and the immortality of the soul  his verses in praise of zoedone are a fine example of didactic poetry his elegy on the death of jumbo is quite up to the level of the subject and the stanzas on a wateringplace     who of its merits can eer think meanly       scattering ozone to all the land  are well worthy of a place in any shilling guidebook  mr doveton divides his poems into grave and gay but we like him least when he is amusing for in his merriment there is but little melody and he makes his muse grin through a horsecollar  when he is serious he is much better and his descriptive poems show that he has completely mastered the most approved poetical phraseology  our old friend boreas is as burly as ever zephyrs are consistently amorous and the welkin rings upon the smallest provocation birds are the feathered host or the sylvan throng the wind wantons oer the lea vernal gales murmur to crystal rills and lemprieres dictionary supplies the latin names for the sun and the moon  armed with these daring and novel expressions mr doveton indulges in fierce moods of natureworship and botanises recklessly through the provinces  now and then however we come across some pleasing passages  mr doveton apparently is an enthusiastic fisherman and sings merrily of the enchanting grayling and the crimson and gold trout that rise to the crafty anglers feathered wile  still we fear that he will never produce any real good work till he has made up his mind whether destiny intends him for a poet or for an advertising agent and we venture to hope that should he ever publish another volume he will find some other rhyme to vision than elysian a dissonance that occurs five times in this wellmeaning but tedious volume  as for mr ashbysterry those who object to the nude in art should at once read his lays of the lazy minstrel and be converted for over these poems the milliner not the muse presides and the result is a little alarming  as the chelsea sage investigated the philosophy of clothes so mr ashbysterry has set himself to discover the poetry of petticoats and seems to find much consolation in the thought that though art is long skirts are worn short  he is the only pedlar who has climbed parnassus since autolycus sang of     lawn as white as driven snow    cypress black as eer was crow  and his details are as amazing as his diminutives  he is capable of penning a canto to a crinoline and has a pathetic monody on a mackintosh  he sings of pretty puckers and pliant pleats and is eloquent on frills frocks and chemisettes  the latest french fashions stir him to a fine frenzy and the sight of a pair of balmoral boots thrills him with absolute ecstasy  he writes rondels on ribbons lyrics on linen and lace and his most ambitious ode is addressed to a tomboy in trouserettes  yet his verse is often dainty and delicate and many of his poems are full of sweet and pretty conceits  indeed of the thames at summer time he writes so charmingly and with such felicitous grace of epithet that we cannot but regret that he has chosen to make himself the poet of petticoats and the troubadour of trouserettes  1 carols from the coalfields and other songs and ballads  by joseph skipsey  walter scott  2 sketches in prose and verse  by f b doveton  sampson low marston and co  3 the lazy minstrel  by j ashbysterry  fisher unwin     a new calendar   pall mall gazette february 17 1887  most modern calendars mar the sweet simplicity of our lives by reminding us that each day that passes is the anniversary of some perfectly uninteresting event  their compilers display a degraded passion for chronicling small beer and rake out the dustheap of history in an ardent search after rubbish  mr walter scott however has made a new departure and has published a calendar in which every day of the year is made beautiful for us by means of an elegant extract from the poems of mr alfred austin  this undoubtedly is a step in the right direction it is true that such aphorisms as     graves are a mothers dimples       when we complain  or     the primrose wears a constant smile    and captive takes the heart  can hardly be said to belong to the very highest order of poetry still they are preferable on the whole to the date of hannah mores birth or of the burning down of exeter change or of the opening of the great exhibition and though it would be dangerous to make calendars the basis of culture we should all be much improved if we began each day with a fine passage of english poetry  how far this desirable result can be attained by a use of the volume now before us is perhaps open to question but it must be admitted that its anonymous compiler has done his work very conscientiously nor will we quarrel with him for the fact that he constantly repeats the same quotation twice over  no doubt it was difficult to find in mr austins work three hundred and sixtyfive different passages really worthy of insertion in an almanac and besides our climate has so degenerated of late that there is no reason at all why a motto perfectly suitable for february should not be equally appropriate when august has set in with its usual severity  for the misprints there is less excuse  even the most uninteresting poet cannot survive bad editing  prefixed to the calendar is an introductory note from the pen of mr william sharp written in that involved and affected style which is mr sharps distinguishing characteristic and displaying that intimate acquaintance with sapphos lost poems which is the privilege only of those who are not acquainted with greek literature  as a criticism it is not of much value but as an advertisement it is quite excellent  indeed mr sharp hints mysteriously at secret political influence and tells us that though mr austin sings with tityrus yet he has conversed with aeneas which we suppose is a euphemistic method of alluding to the fact that mr austin once lunched with lord beaconsfield  it is for the poet however not for the politician that mr sharp reserves his loftiest panegyric and in his anxiety to smuggle the author of leszko the bastard and grandmothers teaching into the charmed circle of the immortals he leaves no adjective unturned quoting and misquoting mr austin with a recklessness that is absolutely fatal to the cause he pleads  for mediocre critics are usually safe in their generalities it is in their reasons and examples that they come so lamentably to grief when for instance mr sharp tells us that lines with the natural magic of shakespeare keats and coleridge are far from infrequent in mr austins poems all that we can say is that we have never come across any lines of the kind in mr austins published works but it is difficult to help smiling when mr sharp gravely calls upon us to note the illuminative significance of such a commonplace verse as     my manhood keeps the dew of morn       and what have i to give    being right glad that i was born       and thankful that i live  nor do mr sharps constant misquotations really help him out of his difficulties  such a line as     a meadow ribbed with drying swathes of hay  has at least the merit of being a simple straightforward description of an ordinary scene in an english landscape but not much can be said in favour of     a meadow ribbed with dying swathes of hay  which is mr sharps own version and one that he finds delightfully suggestive  it is indeed suggestive but only of that want of care that comes from want of taste  on the whole mr sharp has attempted an impossible task  mr austin is neither an olympian nor a titan and all the puffing in paternoster row cannot set him on parnassus  his verse is devoid of all real rhythmical life it may have the metre of poetry but it has not often got its music nor can there be any true delicacy in the ear that tolerates such rhymes as chord and abroad even the claim that mr sharp puts forward for him that his muse takes her impressions directly from nature and owes nothing to books cannot be sustained for a moment  wordsworth is a great poet but bad echoes of wordsworth are extremely depressing and when mr austin calls the cuckoo a     voyaging voice  and tells us that        the stockdove broods    low to itself  we must really enter a protest against such silly plagiarisms  perhaps however we are treating mr sharp too seriously  he admits himself that it was at the special request of the compiler of the calendar that he wrote the preface at all and though he courteously adds that the task is agreeable to him still he shows only too clearly that he considers it a task and like a clever lawyer or a popular clergyman tries to atone for his lack of sincerity by a pleasing overemphasis  nor is there any reason why this calendar should not be a great success  if published as a broadsheet with a picture of mr austin conversing with aeneas it might gladden many a simple cottage home and prove a source of innocent amusement to the conservative workingman  days of the year a poetic calendar from the works of alfred austin selected and edited by a s  with introduction by william sharp  walter scott     the poets cornerii   pall mall gazette march 8 1837  a little schoolboy was once asked to explain the difference between prose and poetry  after some consideration he replied blue violets is prose and violets blue is poetry  the distinction we admit is not exhaustive but it seems to be the one that is extremely popular with our minor poets  opening at random the queens innocent we come across passages like this        full gladly would i sit    of such a potent magus at the feet  and this        the third while yet a youth    espoused a lady noble but not royal    one only son who gave himpharamond  lines that apparently rest their claim to be regarded as poetry on their unnecessary and awkward inversions  yet this poem is not without beauty and the character of nardi the little prince who is treated as the court fool shows a delicate grace of fancy and is both tender and true  the most delightful thing in the whole volume is a little lyric called april which is like a picture set to music  the chimneypiece of bruges is a narrative poem in blank verse and tells us of a young artist who having been unjustly convicted of his wifes murder spends his life in carving on the great chimneypiece of the prison the whole story of his love and suffering  the poem is full of colour but the blank verse is somewhat heavy in movement  there are some pretty things in the book and a poet without hysterics is rare  dr dawson burnss oliver cromwell is a pleasant panegyric on the protector and reads like a prize poem by a nice sixthform boy  the verses on the good old times should be sent as a leaflet to all tories of mr chaplins school and the lines on bunkers hill beginning     i stand on bunkers towering pile  are sure to be popular in america  k e vs little volume is a series of poems on the saints  each poem is preceded by a brief biography of the saint it celebrateswhich is a very necessary precaution as few of them ever existed  it does not display much poetic power and such lines as these on st stephen     did ever man before so fall asleep    a cruel shower of stones his only bed    for lullaby the curses loud and deep       his covering with blood red  may be said to add another horror to martyrdom  still it is a thoroughly wellintentioned book and eminently suitable for invalids  mr fosketts poems are very serious and deliberate  one of the best of them harold glynde is a cantata for total abstainers and has already been set to music  a hindoo tragedy is the story of an enthusiastic brahmin reformer who tries to break down the prohibition against widows marrying and there are other interesting tales  mr foskett has apparently forgotten to insert the rhymes in his sonnet to wordsworth but as he tells us elsewhere that poesy is uninspired by art perhaps he is only heralding a new and formless form  he is always sincere in his feelings and his apostrophe to canon farrar is equalled only by his apostrophe to shakespeare  the pilgrimage of memory suffers a good deal by being printed as poetry and mr barker should republish it at once as a prose work  take for instance this description of a lady on a runaway horse     her screams alarmed the squire who seeing the peril of his daughter    rode frantic after her  i saw at once the danger and stepping from    the footpath showd myself before the startled animal which    forthwith slackened pace and darting up adroitly i seized the rein    and in another moment had released the maidens foot and held her    all insensible within my arms  poor girl her head and face were    sorely bruised and i tried hard to staunch the blood which flowed    from many a scalpwound and wipe away the dust that disfigured her    lovely features  in another moment the squire was by my side  poor    child he cried alarmed is she dead  no sir not dead i    think said i but sorely bruised and injured  there is clearly nothing to be gained by dividing the sentences of this simple and straightforward narrative into lines of unequal length and mr barkers own arrangement of the metre           in another moment          the squire was by my side    poor child he cried alarmed is she dead       no sir not dead i think said i       but sorely bruised and injured  seems to us to be quite inferior to ours  we beg that the second edition of the pilgrimage of memory may be issued as a novel in prose  mr gladstone turner believes that we are on the verge of a great social cataclysm and warns us that our cradles are even now being rocked by slumbering volcanoes  we hope that there is no truth in this statement and that it is merely a startling metaphor introduced for the sake of effect for elsewhere in the volume there is a great deal of beauty which we should be sorry to think was doomed to immediate extinction  the choice for instance is a charming poem and the sonnet on evening would be almost perfect if it were not for an unpleasant assonance in the fifth line  indeed so good is much of mr gladstone turners work that we trust he will give up rhyming real to steal and feel as such bad habits are apt to grow on careless poets and to blunt their ear for music  nivalis is a fiveact tragedy in blank verse  most plays that are written to be read not to be acted miss that condensation and directness of expression which is one of the secrets of true dramatic diction and mr schwartzs tragedy is consequently somewhat verbose still it is full of fine lines and noble scenes  it is essentially a work of art and though as far as language is concerned the personages all speak through the lips of the poet yet in passion and purpose their characters are clearly differentiated and the queen nivalis and her lover giulio are drawn with real psychological power  we hope that some day mr schwartz will write a play for the stage as he has the dramatic instinct and the dramatic imagination and can make life pass into

of the world at a price so low as a shilling a volume  far be it from us to make any heartless allusion to the fact that shakespeares sonnets were brought out at fivepence or that for fourpencehalfpenny one could have bought a martial in ancient rome  every man a cynical american tells us has the right to beat a drum before his booth  still we must acknowledge that mr walter scott would have been much better employed in correcting some of the more obvious errors that appear in his series  when for instance we come across such a phrase as the brotherly liberality of the brothers wedgewood the awkwardness of the expression is hardly atoned for by the fact that the name of the great potter is misspelt longfellow is so essentially poor in rhymes that it is unfair to rob him even of one and the misquotation on page 77 is absolutely unkind the joke coleridge himself made upon the subject should have been sufficient to remind any one that comberbach sic was not the name under which he enlisted and no real beauty is added to the first line of his pathetic work without hope by printing lare sic instead of lair  the truth is that all premature panegyrics bring their own punishment upon themselves and in the present case though the series has only just entered upon existence already a great deal of the work done is careless disappointing unequal and tedious  mr eric robertsons longfellow is a most depressing book  no one survives being overestimated nor is there any surer way of destroying an authors reputation than to glorify him without judgment and to praise him without tact  henry wadsworth longfellow was one of the first true men of letters america produced and as such deserves a high place in any history of american civilisation  to a land out of breath in its greed for gain he showed the example of a life devoted entirely to the study of literature his lectures though not by any means brilliant were still productive of much good he had a most charming and gracious personality and he wrote some pretty poems  but his poems are not of the kind that call for intellectual analysis or for elaborate description or indeed for any serious discussion at all  they are as unsuited for panegyric as they are unworthy of censure and it is difficult to help smiling when mr robertson gravely tells us that few modern poets have given utterance to a faith so comprehensive as that expressed in the psalm of life or that evangeline should confer on longfellow the title of goldenmouthed and that the style of metre adopted carries the ear back to times in the worlds history when grand simplicities were sung surely mr robertson does not believe that there is any connection at all between longfellows unrhymed dactylics and the hexameter of greece and rome or that any one reading evangeline would be reminded of homers or virgils line  where also lies the advantage of confusing popularity with poetic power  though the psalm of life be shouted from maine to california that would not make it true poetry  why call upon us to admire a bad misquotation from the midnight mass for the dying year and why talk of longfellows hundreds of imitators  longfellow has no imitators for of echoes themselves there are no echoes and it is only style that makes a school  now and then however mr robertson considers it necessary to assume a critical attitude  he tells us for instance that whether or not longfellow was a genius of the first order it must be admitted that he loved social pleasures and was a good eater and judge of wines admiring basss ale more than anything else he had seen in england  the remarks on excelsior are even still more amazing  excelsior says mr robertson is not a ballad because a ballad deals either with real or with supernatural people and the hero of the poem cannot be brought under either category  for were he of human flesh his madcap notion of scaling a mountain with the purpose of getting to the sky would be simply drivelling lunacy to say nothing of the fact that the peak in question is much frequented by tourists while on the other hand it would be absurd to suppose him a spirit    for no spirit would be so silly as climb a snowy mountain for nothing  it is really painful to have to read such preposterous nonsense and if mr walter scott imagines that work of this kind is original and valuable he has much to learn  nor are mr robertsons criticisms upon other poets at all more felicitous the casual allusion to herricks confectioneries of verse is of course quite explicable coming as it does from an editor who excluded herrick from an anthology of the childpoems of our literature in favour of mr ashbysterry and mr william sharp but when mr robertson tells us that poes loftiest flights of imagination in verse    rise into no more empyreal realm than the fantastic we can only recommend him to read as soon as possible the marvellous lines to helen a poem as beautiful as a greek gem and as musical as apollos lute  the remarks too on poes critical estimate of his own work show that mr robertson has never really studied the poet on whom he pronounces such glib and shallow judgments and exemplify very clearly the fact that even dogmatism is no excuse for ignorance  after reading mr hall caines coleridge we are irresistibly reminded of what wordsworth once said about a bust that had been done of himself after contemplating it for some time he remarked it is not a bad wordsworth but it is not the real wordsworth it is not wordsworth the poet it is the sort of wordsworth who might be chancellor of the exchequer  mr caines coleridge is certainly not the sort of coleridge who might have been chancellor of the exchequer for the author of christabel was not by any means remarkable as a financier but for all that it is not the real coleridge it is not coleridge the poet  the incidents of the life are duly recounted the gunpowder plot at cambridge the egghot and oronokoo at the little tavern in newgate street the blue coat and white waistcoat that so amazed the worthy unitarians and the terrible smoking experiment at birmingham are all carefully chronicled as no doubt they should be in every popular biography but of the spiritual progress of the mans soul we hear absolutely nothing  never for one single instant are we brought near to coleridge the magic of that wonderful personality is hidden from us by a cloud of mean details an unholy jungle of facts and the critical history promised to us by mr walter scott in his unfortunate preface is conspicuous only by its absence  carlyle once proposed in jest to write a life of michael angelo without making any reference to his art and mr caine has shown that such a project is perfectly feasible  he has written the life of a great peripatetic philosopher and chronicled only the peripatetics  he has tried to tell us about a poet and his book might be the biography of the famous tallowchandler who would not appreciate the watchman  the real events of coleridges life are not his gig excursions and his walking tours they are his thoughts dreams and passions his moments of creative impulse their source and secret his moods of imaginative joy their marvel and their meaning and not his moods merely but the music and the melancholy that they brought him the lyric loveliness of his voice when he sang the sterile sorrow of the years when he was silent it is said that every mans life is a souls tragedy  coleridges certainly was so and though we may not be able to pluck out the heart of his mystery still let us recognise that mystery is there and that the goingsout and comingsin of a man his places of sojourn and his roads of travel are but idle things to chronicle if that which is the man be left unrecorded  so mediocre is mr caines book that even accuracy could not make it better  on the whole then mr walter scott cannot be congratulated on the success of his venture so far the one really admirable feature of the series is the bibliography that is appended to each volume  these bibliographies are compiled by mr anderson of the british museum and are so valuable to the student as well as interesting in themselves that it is much to be regretted that they should be accompanied by such tedious letterpress  1 life of henry wadsworth longfellow  by eric s robertson  2 life of samuel taylor coleridge  by hall caine  great writers series  walter scott     a new book on dickens   pall mall gazette march 31 1887  mr marzials dickens is a great improvement on the longfellow and coleridge of his predecessors  it is certainly a little sad to find our old friend the manager of the theatre royal portsmouth appearing as mr vincent crumules sic but such misprints are not by any means uncommon in mr walter scotts publications and on the whole this is a very pleasant book indeed  it is brightly and cleverly written admirably constructed and gives a most vivid and graphic picture of that strange modern drama the drama of dickenss life  the earlier chapters are quite excellent and though the story of the famous novelists boyhood has been often told before mr marzials shows that it can be told again without losing any of the charm of its interest while the account of dickens in the plenitude of his glory is most appreciative and genial  we are really brought close to the man with his indomitable energy his extraordinary capacity for work his high spirits his fascinating tyrannous personality  the description of his method of reading is admirable and the amazing stumpcampaign in america attains in mr marzials hands to the dignity of a mockheroic poem  one side of dickenss character however is left almost entirely untouched and yet it is one in every way deserving of close study  that dickens should have felt bitterly towards his father and mother is quite explicable but that while feeling so bitterly he should have caricatured them for the amusement of the public with an evident delight in his own humour has always seemed to us a most curious psychological problem  we are far from complaining that he did so  good novelists are much rarer than good sons and none of us would part readily with micawber and mrs nickleby still the fact remains that a man who was affectionate and loving to his children generous and warmhearted to his friends and whose books are the very bacchanalia of benevolence pilloried his parents to make the groundlings laugh and this fact every biographer of dickens should face and if possible explain  as for mr marzials critical estimate of dickens as a writer he tells us quite frankly that he believes that dickens at his best was one of the greatest masters of pathos who ever lived a remark that seems to us an excellent example of what novelists call the fine courage of despair  of course no biographer of dickens could say anything else just at present  a popular series is bound to express popular views and cheap criticisms may be excused in cheap books  besides it is always open to every one to accept g h lewess unfortunate maxim that any author who makes one cry possesses the gift of pathos and indeed there is something very flattering in being told that ones own emotions are the ultimate test of literature  when mr marzials discusses dickenss power of drawing human nature we are upon somewhat safer ground and we cannot but admire the cleverness with which he passes over his heros innumerable failures  for in some respects dickens might be likened to those old sculptors of our gothic cathedrals who could give form to the most fantastic fancy and crowd with grotesque monsters a curious world of dreams but saw little of the grace and dignity of the men and women among whom they lived and whose art lacking sanity was therefore incomplete  yet they at least knew the limitations of their art while dickens never knew the limitations of his  when he tries to be serious he succeeds only in being dull when he aims at truth he reaches merely platitude  shakespeare could place ferdinand and miranda by the side of caliban and life recognises them all as her own but dickenss mirandas are the young ladies out of a fashionbook and his ferdinands the walking gentlemen of an unsuccessful company of thirdrate players  so little sanity indeed had dickenss art that he was never able even to satirise he could only caricature and so little does mr marzials realise where dickenss true strength and weakness lie that he actually complains that cruikshanks illustrations are too much exaggerated and that he could never draw either a lady or a gentleman  the latter was hardly a disqualification for illustrating dickens as few such characters occur in his books unless we are to regard lord frederick verisopht and sir mulberry hawk as valuable studies of high life and for our own part we have always considered that the greatest injustice ever done to dickens has been done by those who have tried to illustrate him seriously  in conclusion mr marzials expresses his belief that a century hence dickens will be read as much as we now read scott and says rather prettily that as long as he is read there will be one gentle and humanising influence the more at work among men which is always a useful tag to append to the life of any popular author  remembering that of all forms of error prophecy is the most gratuitous we will not take upon ourselves to decide the question of dickenss immortality  if our descendants do not read him they will miss a great source of amusement and if they do we hope they will not model their style upon his  of this however there is but little danger for no age ever borrows the slang of its predecessor  as for the gentle and humanising influence this is taking dickens just a little too seriously  life of charles dickens  by frank t marzials  great writers series walter scott     our bookshelf   pall mall gazette april 12 1887  the master of tanagra is certainly one of ernst von wildenbruchs most delightful productions  it presents an exceedingly pretty picture of the bright external side of ancient greek life and tells how a handsome young tanagrian left his home for the sake of art and returned to it for loves sakean old story no doubt but one which gains a new charm from its new setting  the historical characters of the book such as praxiteles and phryne seem somehow less real than those that are purely imaginary but this is usually the case in all novels that would recreate the past for us and is a form of penalty that romance has often to pay when she tries to blend fact with fancy and to turn the great personages of history into puppets for a little play  the translation which is from the pen of the baroness von lauer reads very pleasantly and some of the illustrations are good though it is impossible to reproduce by any process the delicate and exquisite charm of the tanagra figurines  m paul stapfer in his book moliere et shakespeare shows very clearly that the french have not yet forgiven schlegel for having threatened that as a reprisal for the atrocities committed by napoleon he would prove that moliere was no poet  indeed m stapfer while admitting that one should be fair envers tout le monde meme envers les allemands charges down upon the german critics with the brilliancy and dash of a french cuirassier and mocks at them for their dulness at the very moment that he is annexing their erudition an achievement for which the french genius is justly renowned  as for the relative merits of moliere and shakespeare m stapfer has no hesitation in placing the author of le misanthrope by the side of the author of hamlet  shakespeares comedies seem to him somewhat wilful and fantastic he prefers orgon and tartuffe to oberon and titania and can hardly forgive beatrice for having been born to speak all mirth and no matter  perhaps he hardly realises that it is as a poet not as a playwright that we love shakespeare in england and that ariel singing by the yellow sands or fairies hiding in a wood near athens may be as real as alceste in his wooing of celimene and as true as harpagon weeping for his money box still his book is full of interesting suggestion many of his remarks on literature are quite excellent and his style has the qualities of grace distinction and ease of movement  not so much can be said for annals of the life of shakespeare which is a dull though wellmeaning little book  what we do not know about shakespeare is a most fascinating subject and one that would fill a volume but what we do know about him is so meagre and inadequate that when it is collected together the result is rather depressing  however there are many people no doubt who find a great source of interest in the fact that  he author of the merchant of venice once brought an action for the sum of 1 pound 15s 10d and gained his suit and for these this volume will have considerable charm  it is a pity that the finest line ben jonson ever wrote about shakespeare should be misquoted at the very beginning of the book and the illustration of shakespeares monument gives the inscription very badly indeed  also it was ben jonsons stepfather not his fatherinlaw as stated who was the bricklayer but it is quite useless to dwell upon these things as nobody nowadays seems to have any time either to correct proofs or to consult authorities  one of the most pleasing volumes that has appeared as yet in the canterbury series is the collection of allan ramsays poems  ramsay whose profession was the making of periwigs and whose pleasure was the making of poetry is always delightful reading except when he tries to write english and to imitate pope  his gentle shepherd is a charming pastoral play full of humour and romance his vision has a good deal of natural fire and some of his songs such as the yellowhaird laddie and the lass of paties mill might rank beside those of burns  the preface to this attractive little edition is from the pen of mr j logie robertson and the simple straightforward style in which it is written contrasts favourably with the silly pompous manner affected by so many of the other editors of the series  ramsays life is worth telling well and mr robertson tells it well and gives us a really capital picture of edinburgh society in the early half of the last century  dante for beginners by miss arabella shore is a sort of literary guide book  what virgil was to the great florentine miss shore would be to the british public and her modest little volume can do no possible harm to dante which is more than one can say of many commentaries on the divine comedy  miss phillimores studies in italian literature is a much more elaborate work and displays a good deal of erudition  indeed the erudition is sometimes displayed a little too much and we should like to see the lead of learning transmuted more often into the gold of thought  the essays on petrarch and tasso are tedious but those on aleardi and count arrivabene are excellent particularly the former  aleardi was a poet of wonderful descriptive power and though as he said himself he subordinated his love of poetry to his love of country yet in such service he found perfect freedom  the article on edoardo fusco also is full of interest and is a timely tribute to the memory of one who did so much for the education and culture of modern italy  on the whole the book is well worth reading so well worth reading indeed that we hope that the foolish remarks on the greek drama will be amended in a second edition or which would be better still struck out altogether  they show a want of knowledge

remarkable success and there seems no probability at present of the process being discontinued  the grass was hardly green upon the quiet grave in birchington churchyard when mr hall caine and mr william sharp rushed into print with their memoirs and recollections  then came the usual mob of magazinehacks with their various views and attitudes and now mr joseph knight has produced for the edification of the british public a popular biography of the poet of the blessed damozel the painter of dantes dream  it is only fair to state that mr knights work is much better than that of his predecessors in the same field  his book is on the whole modestly and simply written whatever its other faults may be it is at least free from affectation of any kind and it makes no serious pretence at being either exhaustive or definitive  yet the best we can say of it is that it is just the sort of biography guildenstern might have written of hamlet  nor does its unsatisfactory character come merely from the ludicrous inadequacy of the materials at mr knights disposal it is the whole scheme and method of the book that is radically wrong  rossettis was a great personality and personalities such as his do not easily survive shilling primers  sooner or later they have inevitably to come down to the level of their biographers and in the present instance nothing could be more absolutely commonplace than the picture mr knight gives us of the wonderful seer and singer whose life he has so recklessly essayed to write  no doubt there are many people who will be deeply interested to know that rossetti was once chased round his garden by an infuriated zebu he was trying to exhibit to mr whistler or that he had a great affection for a dog called dizzy or that sloshy was one of his favourite words of contempt or that mr gosse thought him very like chaucer in appearance or that he had an absolute disqualification for whistplaying or that he was very fond of quoting the bab ballads or that he once said that if he could live by writing poetry he would see painting dd  for our part however we cannot help expressing our regret that such a shallow and superficial biography as this should ever have been published  it is but a sorry task to rip the twisted ravel from the worn garment of life and to turn the grout in a drained cup  better after all that we knew a painter only through his vision and a poet through his song than that the image of a great man should be marred and made mean for us by the clumsy geniality of good intentions  a true artist and such rossetti undoubtedly was reveals himself so perfectly in his work that unless a biographer has something more valuable to give us than idle anecdotes and unmeaning tales his labour is misspent and his industry misdirected  bad however as is mr knights treatment of rossettis life his treatment of rossettis poetry is infinitely worse  considering the small size of the volume and the consequently limited number of extracts the amount of misquotation is almost incredible and puts all recent achievements in this sphere of modern literature completely into the shade  the fine line in the first canto of rose mary     what glints there like a lance that flees  appears as     what glints there like a glance that flees  which is very painful nonsense in the description of that graceful and fanciful sonnet autumn idleness the deer are represented as grazing from hillock eaves instead of gazing from hillockeaves the opening of dantis tenebrae is rendered quite incomprehensible by the substitution of my for thy in the second line even such a wellknown ballad as sister helen is misquoted and indeed from the burden of nineveh the blessed damozel the kings tragedy and guido cavalcantis lovely ballata down to the portrait and such sonnets as lovesweetness farewell to the glen and a match with the moon there is not one single poem that does not display some careless error or some stupid misprint  as for rossettis elaborate system of punctuation mr knight pays no attention to it whatsoever  indeed he shows quite a rollicking indifference to all the secrets and subtleties of style and inserts or removes stops in a manner that is absolutely destructive to the lyrical beauty of the verse  the hyphen also so constantly employed by rossetti in the case of such expressions as hillockeaves quoted above hillfire birthhour and the like is almost invariably disregarded and by the brilliant omission of a semicolon mr knight has succeeded in spoiling one of the best stanzas in the staff and scripa poem by the way that he speaks of as the staff and the scrip sic after this tedious comedy of errors it seems almost unnecessary to point out that the earliest italian poet is not called ciullo dalcano sic or that the bothie of topernafuosich sic is not the title of cloughs boisterous epic or that dante and his cycle sic is not the name rossetti gave to his collection of translations and why troy town should appear in the index as tory town is really quite inexplicable unless it is intended as a compliment to mr hall caine who once dedicated or rather tried to dedicate to rossetti a lecture on the relations of poets to politics  we are sorry too to find an english dramatic critic misquoting shakespeare as we had always been of opinion that this was a privilege reserved specially for our english actors  we sincerely hope that there will soon be an end to all biographies of this kind  they rob life of much of its dignity and its wonder add to death itself a new terror and make one wish that all art were anonymous  nor could there have been any more unfortunate choice of a subject for popular treatment than that to which we owe the memoir that now lies before us  a pillar of fire to the few who knew him and of cloud to the many who knew him not dante gabriel rossetti lived apart from the gossip and tittletattle of a shallow age  he never trafficked with the merchants for his soul nor brought his wares into the marketplace for the idle to gape at passionate and romantic though he was yet there was in his nature something of high austerity  he loved seclusion and hated notoriety and would have shuddered at the idea that within a few years after his death he was to make his appearance in a series of popular biographies sandwiched between the author of pickwick and the great lexicographer one man alone the friend his verse won for him did he desire should write his life and it is to mr theodore watts that we too must look to give us the real rossetti  it may be admitted at once that mr wattss subject has for the moment been a little spoiled for him  rude hands have touched it and unmusical voices have made it sound almost common in our ears  yet none the less is it for him to tell us of the marvel of this man whose art he has analysed with such exquisite insight whose life he knows as no one else can know it whom he so loyally loved and tended and by whom he was so loyally beloved in turn  as for the others the scribblers and nibblers of literature if they indeed reverence rossettis memory let them pay him the one homage he would most have valued the gracious homage of silence  though you can fret me yet you cannot play upon me says hamlet to his false friend and even so might rossetti speak to those wellintentioned mediocrities who would seem to know his stops and would sound him to the top of his compass  true they cannot fret him now for he has passed beyond the possibility of pain yet they cannot play upon him either it is not for them to pluck out the heart of his mystery  there is however one feature of this book that deserves unstinted praise  mr andersons bibliography will be found of immense use by every student of rossettis work and influence  perhaps youngs very powerful attack on preraphaelitism as expounded by mr ruskin longmans 1857 might be included but in all other respects it seems quite complete and the chronological list of paintings and drawings is really admirable  when this unfortunate great writers series comes to an end mr andersons bibliographies should be collected together and published in a separate volume  at present they are in a very second rate company indeed  life of dante gabriel rossetti  by joseph knight  great writers series  walter scott     mr morriss odyssey   pall mall gazette april 26 1887  of all our modern poets mr william morris is the one best qualified by nature and by art to translate for us the marvellous epic of the wanderings of odysseus  for he is our only true storysinger since chaucer if he is a socialist he is also a sagaman and there was a time when he was never wearied of telling us strange legends of gods and men wonderful tales of chivalry and romance  master as he is of decorative and descriptive verse he has all the greeks joy in the visible aspect of things all the greeks sense of delicate and delightful detail all the greeks pleasure in beautiful textures and exquisite materials and imaginative designs nor can any one have a keener sympathy with the homeric admiration for the workers and the craftsmen in the various arts from the stainers in white ivory and the embroiderers in purple and fold to the weaver sitting by the loom and the dyer dipping in the vat the chaser of shield and helmet the carver of wood or stone  and to all this is added the true temper of high romance the power to make the past as real to us as the present the subtle instinct to discern passion the swift impulse to portray life  it is no wonder the lovers of greek literature have so eagerly looked forward to mr morriss version of the odyssean epic and now that the first volume has appeared it is not extravagant to say that of all our english translations this is the most perfect and the most satisfying  in spite of coleridges wellknown views on the subject we have always held that chapmans odyssey is immeasurably inferior to his iliad the mere difference of metre alone being sufficient to set the former in a secondary place popes odyssey with its glittering rhetoric and smart antithesis has nothing of the grand manner of the original cowper is dull and bryant dreadful and worsley too full of spenserian prettinesses while excellent though messrs butcher and langs version undoubtedly is in many respects still on the whole it gives us merely the facts of the odyssey without providing anything of its artistic effect  avias translation even though better than almost all its predecessors in the same field is not worthy of taking rank beside mr morriss for here we have a true work of art a rendering not merely of language into language but of poetry into poetry and though the new spirit added in the transfusion may seem to many rather norse than greek and perhaps at times more boisterous than beautiful there is yet a vigour of life in every line a splendid ardour through each canto that stirs the blood while one reads like the sound of a trumpet and that producing a physical as well as a spiritual delight exults the senses no less than it exalts the soul  it may be admitted at once that here and there mr morris has missed something of the marvellous dignity of the homeric verse and that in his desire for rushing and ringing metre he has occasionally sacrificed majesty to movement and made stateliness give place to speed but it is really only in such blank verse as miltons that this effect of calm and lofty music can be attained and in all other respects blank verse is the most inadequate medium for reproducing the full flow and fervour of the greek hexameter  one merit at any rate mr morriss version entirely and absolutely possesses  it is in no sense of the word literary it seems to deal immediately with life itself and to take from the reality of things its own form and colour it is always direct and simple and at its best has something of the large utterance of the early gods  as for individual passages of beauty nothing could be better than the wonderful description of the house of the phoeacian king or the whole telling of the lovely legend of circe or the manner in which the pageant of the pale phantoms in hades is brought before our eyes  perhaps the huge epic humour of the escape from the cyclops is hardly realised but there is always a linguistic difficulty about rendering this fascinating story into english and where we are given so much poetry we should not complain about losing a pun and the exquisite idyll of the meeting and parting with the daughter of alcinous is really delightfully told  how good for instance is this passage taken at random from the sixth book     but therewith unto the handmaids goodly odysseus spake    stand off i bid you damsels while the work in hand i take    and wash the brine from my shoulders and sleek them all around    since verily now this long while sweet oil they have not found    but before you nought will i wash me for shame i have indeed    amidst of fairtressed damsels to be all bare of weed    so he spake and aloof they gat them and thereof they told the may    but odysseus with the river from his body washed away    the brine from his back and his shoulders wrought broad and mightily    and from his head was he wiping the foam of the untilled sea    but when he had throughly washed him and the oil about him had shed    he did upon the raiment the gift of the maid unwed    but athene zeusbegotten dealt with him in such wise    that bigger yet was his seeming and mightier to all eyes    with the hair on his head crisp curling as the bloom of the daffodil    and as when the silver with gold is oerlaid by a man of skill    yea a craftsman whom hephaestus and pallas athene have taught    to be master over masters and lovely work he hath wrought    so she round his head and his shoulders shed grace abundantly  it may be objected by some that the line     with the hair on his head crisp curling as the bloom of the daffodil  is a rather fanciful version of     greek text  and it certainly seems probable that the allusion is to the dark colour of the heros hair still the point is not one of much importance though it may be worth noting that a similar expression occurs in ogilbys superbly illustrated translation of the odyssey published in 1665 where charles iis master of the revels in ireland gives the passage thus     minerva renders him more tall and fair    curling in rings like daffodils his hair  no anthology however can show the true merit of mr morriss translation whose real merit does not depend on stray beauties nor is revealed by chance selections but lies in the absolute rightness and coherence of the whole in its purity and justice of touch its freedom from affectation and commonplace its harmony of form and matter  it is sufficient to say that this is a poets version of a poet and for such surely we should be thankful  in these latter days of coarse and vulgar literature it is something to have made the great seaepic of the south native and natural to our northern isle something to have shown that our english speech may be a pipe through which greek lips can blow something to have taught nausicaa to speak the same language as perdita  the odyssey of homer  done into

detail which is the essence of style his work is entirely free from any personal intention and by taking existence at its most fierycoloured moments he can distil into a few pages of perfect prose the moods and passions of many lives  count tolstois method is much larger and his field of vision more extended  he reminds us sometimes of paul veronese and like that great painter can crowd without overcrowding the giant canvas on which he works  we may not at first gain from his works that artistic unity of impression which is tourgenieffs chief charm but once that we have mastered the details the whole seems to have the grandeur and the simplicity of an epic  dostoieffski differs widely from both his rivals he is not so fine an artist as tourgenieff for he deals more with the facts than with the effects of life nor has he tolstois largeness of vision and epic dignity but he has qualities that are distinctively and absolutely his own such as a fierce intensity of passion and concentration of impulse a power of dealing with the deepest mysteries of psychology and the most hidden springs of life and a realism that is pitiless in its fidelity and terrible because it is true  some time ago we had occasion to draw attention to his marvellous novel crime and punishment where in the haunt of impurity and vice a harlot and an assassin meet together to read the story of dives

surroundings of the story may seem the heroine natasha is like one of the noble victims of greek tragedy she is antigone with the passion of phaedra and it is impossible to approach her without a feeling of awe  greek also is the gloom of nemesis that hangs over each character only it is a nemesis that does not stand outside of life but is part of our own nature and of the same material as life itself  aleosha the beautiful young lad whom natasha follows to her doom is a second tito melema and has all titos charm and grace and fascination  yet he is different  he would never have denied baldassare in the square at florence nor lied to romola about tessa  he has a magnificent momentary sincerity a boyish unconsciousness of all that life signifies an ardent enthusiasm for all that life cannot give  there is nothing calculating about him  he never thinks evil he only does it  from a psychological point of view he is one of the most interesting characters of modem fiction as from an artistic he is one of the most attractive  as we grow to know him he stirs strange questions for us and makes us feel that it is not the wicked only who do wrong nor the bad alone who work evil  and by what a subtle objective method does dostoieffski show us his characters  he never tickets them with a list nor labels them with a description  we grow to know them very gradually as we know people whom we meet in society at first by little tricks of manner personal appearance fancies in dress and the like and afterwards by their deeds and words and even then they constantly elude us for though dostoieffski may lay bare for us the secrets of their nature yet he never explains his personages away they are always surprising us by something that they say or do and keep to the end the eternal mystery of life  irrespective of its value as a work of art this novel possesses a deep autobiographical interest also as the character of vania the poor student who loves natasha through all her sin and shame is dostoieffskis study of himself  goethe once had to delay the completion of one of his novels till experience had furnished him with new situations but almost before he had arrived at manhood dostoieffski knew life in its most real forms poverty and suffering pain and misery prison exile and love were soon familiar to him and by the lips of vania he has told his own story  this note of personal feeling this harsh reality of actual experience undoubtedly gives the book something of its strange fervour and terrible passion yet it has not made it egotistic we see things from every point of view and we feel not that fiction has been trammelled by fact but that fact itself has become ideal and imaginative  pitiless too though dostoieffski is in his method as an artist as a man he is full of human pity for all for those who do evil as well as for those who suffer it for the selfish no less than for those whose lives are wrecked for others and whose sacrifice is in vain  since adam bede and le pere goriot no more powerful novel has been written than insult and injury  mr hardinges book willow garth deals strangely enough with something like the same idea though the treatment is of course entirely different  a girl of high birth falls passionately in love with a young farmbailiff who is a sort of arcadian antinous and a very ganymede in gaiters  social difficulties naturally intervene so she drowns her handsome rustic in a convenient pond  mr hardinge has a most charming style and as a writer possesses both distinction and grace  the book is a delightful combination of romance and satire and the heroines crime is treated in the most picturesque manner possible  marcella grace tells of modern life in ireland and is one of the best books miss mulholland has ever published  in its artistic reserve and the perfect simplicity of its style it is an excellent model for all ladynovelists to follow and the scene where the heroine finds the man who has been sent to shoot her lying feverstricken behind a hedge with his gun by his side is really remarkable  nor could anything be better than miss mulhollands treatment of external nature  she never shrieks over scenery like a tourist nor wearies us with sunsets like the scotch school but all through her book there is a subtle atmosphere of purple hills and silent moorland she makes us live with nature and not merely look at it  the accomplished authoress of soap was once compared to george eliot by the court journal and to carlyle by the daily news but we fear that we cannot compete with our contemporaries in these daring comparisons  her present book is very clever rather vulgar and contains some fine examples of bad french  as for a marked man that winter night and driven home the first shows some power of description and treatment but is sadly incomplete the second is quite unworthy of any man of letters and the third is absolutely silly  we sincerely hope that a few more novels like these will be published as the public will then find out that a bad book is very dear at a shilling  1 injury and insult  by fedor dostoieffski  translated from the russian by frederick

fiction in which real characters do not seem out of place is history  in novels they are detestable and miss bayles romance is entirely spoiled as a realistic presentation of life by the authors attempt to introduce into her story a whole mob of modern celebrities and notorieties including the heir apparent and mr edmund yates  the identity of the latter personage is delicately veiled under the pseudonym of mr atlas editor of the world but the former appears as the prince of wales pur et simple and is represented as spending his time yachting in the channel and junketing at homburg with a second rate american family who by the way always address him as prince and show in other respects an ignorance that even their ignorance cannot excuse  indeed his royal highness is no mere spectator of the story he is one of the chief actors in it and it is through his influence that the noisy chicago belle whose lack of romance gives the book its title achieves her chief social success  as for the conversation with which the prince is credited it is of the most amazing kind  we find him on one page gravely discussing the depression of trade with mr ezra p bayle a shoddy american millionaire who promptly replies depression of fiddlesticks prince in another passage he naively inquires of the same shrewd speculator whether the thunderstorms and prairie fires of the west are still on so grand a scale as when he visited illinois and we are told in the second volume that after contemplating the magnificent view from st ives he exclaimed with enthusiasm surely mr brett must have had a scene like this in his eye when he painted britannias realm i never saw anything more beautiful  even her majesty figures in this extraordinary story in spite of the excellent aphorism ne touchez pas a la reine and when miss alma j bayle is married to the duke of windsors second son she receives from the hands of royalty not merely the customary cashmere shawl of court tradition but also a copy of diaries in the highlands inscribed to the lady plowden eton with the kindest wishes of victoria ri a mistake that the queen of all persons in the world is the least likely to have committed  perhaps however we are treating miss bayles romance too seriously  the book has really no claim to be regarded as a novel at all  it is simply a society paragraph expanded into three volumes and like most paragraphs of the kind is in the worst possible taste  we are not by any means surprised that the author while making free with the names of others has chosen to conceal his own name for no reputation could possibly survive the production of such silly stupid work but we must say that we are surprised that this book has been brought out by the publishers in ordinary to her majesty the queen  we do not know what the duties attaching to this office are but we should not have thought that the issuing of vulgar stories about the royal family was one of them  from heather hills is very pleasant reading indeed  it is healthy without being affected and though mrs perks gives us many descriptions of scotch scenery we are glad to say that she has not adopted the common chromolithographic method of those popular north british novelists who have never yet fully realised the difference between colour and colours and who imagine that by emptying a paint box over every page they can bring before us the magic of mist and mountain the wonder of sea or glen  mrs perks has a grace and delicacy of touch that is quite charming and she can deal with nature without either botanising or being blatant which nowadays is a somewhat rare accomplishment  the interest of the story centres on margaret dalrymple a lovely scotch girl who is brought to london by her aunt takes every one by storm and falls in love with young lord erinwood who is on the brink of proposing to her when he is dissuaded from doing so by a philosophic man of the world who thinks that a woodland artemis is a bad wife for an english peer and that no woman who has a habit of saying exactly what she means can possibly get on in smart society  the wouldbe philosopher is ultimately hoist with his own petard as he falls in love himself with margaret dalrymple and as for the weak young hero he is promptly snatched up rather against his will by a sort of becky sharp who succeeds in becoming lady erinwood however a convenient railway accident the deus ex machina of nineteenth century novels carries miss norma novello off and everybody is finally made happy except of course the philosopher who gets only a lesson where he wanted to get love  there is just one part of the novel to which we must take exception  the whole story of alice morgan is not merely needlessly painful but it is of very little artistic value  a tragedy may be the basis of a story but it should never be simply a casual episode  at least if it is so it entirely fails to produce any artistic effect  we hope too that in mrs perkss next novel she will not allow her hero to misquote english poetry  this is a privilege reserved for mrs malaprop  a constancy that lasts through three volumes is often rather tedious so that we are glad to make the acquaintance of miss lilian ufford the heroine of mrs houstons a heart on fire  this young lady begins by being desperately in love with mr frank thorburn a struggling schoolmaster and ends by being desperately in love with colonel dallas a rich country gentleman who spends most of his time and his money in preaching a crusade against beer  after she gets engaged to the colonel she discovers that mr thorburn is in reality lord netherbys son and heir and for the moment she seems to have a true womans regret at having given up a pretty title but all ends well and the story is brightly and pleasantly told  the colonel is a middleaged romeo of the most impassioned character and as it is his heart that is on fire he may serve as a psychological pendant to la femme de quarante ans  mr g manville fenns a bag of diamonds belongs to the drury lane school of fiction and is a sort of fireside melodrama for the family circle  it is evidently written to thrill bayswater and no doubt bayswater will be thrilled  indeed there is a great deal that is exciting in the book and the scene in which a kindly policeman assists two murderers to convey their unconscious victim into a fourwheeled cab under the impression that they are a party of guests returning from a convivial supper in bloomsbury is quite excellent of its kind and on the whole not too improbable considering that shilling literature is always making demands on our credulity without ever appealing to our imagination  the great hesper by mr frank barrett has at least the merit of introducing into fiction an entirely new character  the villain is nyctalops and though we are not prepared to say that there is any necessary connection between nyctalopy and crime we are quite ready to accept mr barretts picture of jan van hoeck as an interesting example of the modern method of dealing with life  for pathology is rapidly becoming the basis of sensational literature and in art as in politics there is a great future for monsters  what a nyctalops is we leave mr barrett to explain  his novel belongs to a class of book that many people might read once for curiosity but nobody could read a second time for pleasure  a day after the fair is an account of a holiday tour through scotland taken by two young barristers one of whom rescues a pretty girl from drowning falls in love with her and is rewarded for his heroism by seeing her married to his friend  the idea of the book is not bad but the treatment is very unsatisfactory and combines the triviality of the tourist with the dulness of good intentions  mr winter is always amusing and audacious though we cannot say that we entirely approve of the names he gives to his stories  bootles baby was a masterpiece but houpla was a terrible title and that imp is not much better  the book however is undoubtedly clever and the imp in question is not a nyctalops nor a specimen for a travelling museum but a very pretty girl who because an officer has kissed her without any serious matrimonial intentions exerts all her fascinations to bring the unfortunate lovelace to her feet and having succeeded in doing so promptly rejects him with a virtuous indignation that is as delightful as it is out of place  we must confess that we have a good deal of sympathy for driver dallas of the royal horse who suffers fearful agonies at what he imagines is a heartless flirtation on the part of the lady of his dreams but the story is told from the imps point of view and as such we must accept it  there is a very brilliant description of a battle in the soudan and the account of barrack life is of course admirable  so admirable indeed is it that we hope that mr winter will soon turn his attention to new topics and try to handle fresh subjects  it would be sad if such a clever and observant writer became merely the garrison hack of literature  we would also earnestly beg mr winter not to write foolish prefaces about unappreciative critics for it is only mediocrities and old maids who consider it a grievance to be misunderstood  1 miss bayles romance a story of today  bentley and son publishers in ordinary to her

vortigern and rowena is a cantata about the britons and the danes  there is a druid priestess who sings of cynthia and endymion and a chorus of jubilant vikings  it is charmingly printed and as a libretto for music quite above the average  as truly religious people are resigned to everything even to mediocre poetry there is no reason at all why madame guyons verses should not be popular with a large section of the community  their editor mr dyer has reprinted the translations cowper made for mr bull added some versions of his own and written a pleasing preface about this gentle seventeenthcentury saint whose life was her best indeed her only true poem  mr pierce has discovered a tenth muse and writes impassioned verses to the goddess of chess whom he apostrophises as sublime caissa  zukertort and steinitz are his heroes and he is as melodious on mates as he is graceful on gambits  we are glad to say however that he has other subjects and one of his poems beginning     cedar boxes deeply cut       china bowls of quaint device       heapd with rosy leaves and spice    violets in old volumes shut  is very dainty and musical  mr clifford harrison is well known as the most poetic of our reciters but as a writer himself of poetry he is not so famous  yet his little volume in hours of leisure contains some charming pieces and many of the short fourteenline poems are really pretty though they are very defective in form  indeed of form mr harrison is curiously careless such rhymes as calm and charm baize and place jeu and knew are quite dreadful while operas and stars gautama and afar are too bad even for steinway hall  those who have keatss genius may borrow keatss cockneyisms but from minor poets we have a right to expect some regard to the ordinary technique of verse  however if mr harrison has not always form at least he has always feeling  he has a wonderful command over all the egotistic emotions is quite conscious of the artistic value of remorse and displays a sincere sympathy with his own moments of sadness playing upon his moods as a young lady plays upon the piano  now and then we come across some delicate descriptive touches such as     the cuckoo knew its latest day had come    and told its name once more to all the hills  and whenever mr harrison writes about nature he is certainly pleasing and picturesque but as a rule he is overanxious about himself and forgets that the personal expression of joy or sorrow is not poetry though it may afford excellent material for a sentimental diary  the daily increasing class of readers that likes unintelligible poetry should study aeonial  it is in many ways a really remarkable production very fantastic very daring crowded with strange metaphor and clouded by monstrous imagery it has a sort of turbid splendour about it and should the author some day add meaning to his music he may give us a true work of art  at present he hardly realises that an artist should be articulate  seymours inheritance is a short novel in blank verse  on the whole it is very harmless both in manner and matter but we must protest against such lines as     and in the windows of his heart the blinds    of happiness had been drawn down by grief  for a simile committing suicide is always a depressing spectacle  some of the other poems are so simple and modest that we hope mr ross will not carry out his threat of issuing a more pretentious volume pretentious volumes of poetry are very common and very worthless  mr brodies lyrics of the sea are spirited and manly and show a certain freedom of rhythmical movement pleasant in days of wooden verse  he is at his best however in his sonnets  their architecture is not always of the finest order but here and there one meets with lines that are graceful and felicitous     like silver swallows on a summer morn    cutting the air with momentary wings  is pretty and on flowers mr brodie writes quite charmingly  the only

portraits   pall mall gazette june 11 1887  to convey ideas through the medium of images has always been the aim of those who are artists as well as thinkers in literature and it is to a desire to give a sensuous environment to intellectual concepts that we owe mr paters last volume  for these imaginary or as we should prefer to call them imaginative portraits of his form a series of philosophic studies in which the philosophy is tempered by personality and the thought shown under varying conditions of mood and manner the very permanence of each principle gaining something through the change and colour of the life through which it finds expression  the most fascinating of all these pictures is undoubtedly that of sebastian van storck  the account of watteau is perhaps a little too fanciful and the description of him as one who was always a seeker after something in the world that is there in no satisfying measure or not at all seems to us more applicable to him who saw mona lisa sitting among the rocks than to the gay and debonair peintre des fetes galantes  but sebastian the grave young dutch philosopher is charmingly drawn  from the first glimpse we get of him skating over the watermeadows with his plume of squirrels tail and his fur muff in all the modest pleasantness of boyhood down to his strange death in the desolate house amid the sands of the helder we seem to see him to know him almost to hear the low music of his voice  he is a dreamer as the common phrase goes and yet he is poetical in this sense that his theorems shape life for him directly  early in youth he is stirred by a fine saying of spinoza and sets himself to realise the ideal of an intellectual disinterestedness separating himself more and more from the transient world of sensation accident and even affection till what is finite and relative becomes of no interest to him and he feels that as nature is but a thought of his so he himself is but a passing thought of god  this conception of the power of a mere metaphysical abstraction over the mind of one so fortunately endowed for the reception of the sensible world is exceedingly delightful and mr pater has never written a more subtle psychological study the fact that sebastian dies in an attempt to save the life of a little child giving to the whole story a touch of poignant pathos and sad irony  denys lauxerrois is suggested by a figure found or said to be found on some old tapestries in auxerre the figure of a flaxen and flowery creature sometimes wellnigh naked among the vineleaves sometimes muffled in skins against the cold sometimes in the dress of a monk but always with a strong impress of real character and incident from the veritable streets of the town itself  from this strange design mr pater has fashioned a curious mediaeval myth of the return of dionysus among men a myth steeped in colour and passion and old romance full of wonder and full of worship denys himself being half animal and half god making the world mad with a new ecstasy of living stirring the artists simply by his visible presence drawing the marvel of music from reed and pipe and slain at last in a stageplay by those who had loved him  in its rich affluence of imagery this story is like a picture by mantegna and indeed mantegna might have suggested the description of the pageant in which denys rides upon a gailypainted chariot in soft silken raiment and for headdress a strange elephant scalp with gilded tusks  if denys lauxerrois symbolises the passion of the senses and sebastian van storck the philosophic passion as they certainly seem to do though no mere formula or definition can adequately express the freedom and variety of the life that they portray the passion for the imaginative world of art is the basis of the story of duke carl of rosenmold  duke carl is not unlike the late king of bavaria in his love of france his admiration for the grand monarque and his fantastic desire to amaze and to bewilder but the resemblance is possibly only a chance one  in fact mr paters young hero is the precursor of the aufklarung of the last century the german precursor of herder and lessing and goethe himself and finds the forms of art ready to his hand without any national spirit to fill them or make them vital and responsive  he too dies trampled to death by the soldiers of the country he so much admired on the night of his marriage with a peasant girl the very failure of his life lending him a certain melancholy grace and dramatic interest  on the whole then this is a singularly attractive book  mr pater is an intellectual impressionist  he does not weary us with any definite doctrine or seek to suit life to any formal creed  he is always looking for exquisite moments and when he has found them he analyses them with delicate and delightful art and then passes on often to the opposite pole of thought or feeling knowing that every mood has its own quality and charm and is justified by its mere existence  he has taken the sensationalism of greek philosophy and made it a new method of art criticism  as for his style it is curiously ascetic  now and then we come across phrases with a strange sensuousness of expression as when he tells us how denys lauxerrois on his return from a long journey ate flesh for the first time tearing the hot red morsels with his delicate fingers in a kind of wild greed but such passages are rare  asceticism is the keynote of mr paters prose at times it is almost too severe in its selfcontrol and makes us long for a little more freedom  for indeed the danger of such prose as his is that it is apt to become somewhat laborious  here and there one is tempted to say of mr pater that he is a seeker after something in language that is there in no satisfying measure or not at all  the continual preoccupation with phrase and epithet has its drawbacks as well as its virtues  and yet when all is said what wonderful prose it is with its subtle preferences its fastidious purity its rejection of what is common or ordinary  mr pater has the true spirit of selection the true tact of omission  if he be not among the greatest prose writers of our literature he is at least our greatest artist in prose and though it may be admitted that the best style is that which seems an unconscious result rather than a conscious aim still in these latter days when violent rhetoric does duty for eloquence and vulgarity usurps the name of nature we should be grateful for a style that deliberately aims at perfection of form that seeks to produce its effect by artistic means and sets before itself an ideal of grave and chastened beauty  imaginary portraits  by walter pater ma fellow of brasenose college oxford  macmillan and co     a good historical novel   pall mall gazette august 8 1887  most modern russian novelists look upon the historical novel as a faux genre or a sort of fancy dress ball in literature a mere puppet show not a true picture of life  yet their own history is full of such wonderful scenes and situations ready for dramatist or novelist to treat of that we are not surprised that in spite of the dogmas of the ecole naturaliste mr stephen coleridge has taken the russia of the sixteenth century as the background for his strange tale  indeed there is much to be said in favour of a form remote from actual experience  passion itself gains something from picturesqueness of surroundings distance of time unlike distance of space makes objects larger and more vivid over the common things of contemporary life there hangs a mist of familiarity that often makes their meaning obscure  there are also moments when we feel that but little artistic pleasure is to be gained from the study of the modern realistic school  its works are powerful but they are painful and after a time we tire of their harshness their violence and their crudity  they exaggerate the importance of facts and underrate the importance of fiction  such at any rate is the moodand what is criticism itself but a moodproduced in us by a perusal of mr coleridges demetrius  it is the story of a young lad of unknown parentage who is brought up in the household of a polish noble  he is a tall fairlooking youth by name alexis with a pride of bearing and grace of manner that seem strange in one of such low station  suddenly he is recognised by an exiled russian noble as demetrius the son of ivan the terrible who was supposed to have been murdered by the usurper boris his identity is still further established by a strange cross of seven emeralds that he wears round his neck and by a greek inscription in his book of prayers which discloses the secret of his birth and the story of his rescue  he himself feels that the blood of kings beats in his veins and appeals to the nobles of the polish diet to espouse his cause  by his passionate utterance he makes them acknowledge him as the true tsar and invades russia at the head of a large army  the people throng to him from every side and marfa the widow of ivan the terrible escapes from the convent in which she has been immured by boris and comes to meet her son  at first she seems not to recognise him but the music of his voice and the wonderful eloquence of his pleading win her over and she embraces him in presence of the army and admits him to be her child  the usurper terrified at the tidings and deserted by his soldiers commits suicide and alexis enters moscow in triumph and is crowned in the kremlin  yet he is not the true demetrius after all  he is deceived himself and he deceives others  mr coleridge has drawn his character with delicate subtlety and quick insight and the scene in which he discovers that he is no son of ivans and has no right to the name he claims is exceedingly powerful and dramatic  one point of resemblance does exist between alexis and the real demetrius  both of them are murdered and with the death of this strange hero mr coleridge ends his remarkable story  on the whole mr coleridge has written a really good historical novel and may be congratulated on his success  the style is particularly interesting and the narrative parts of the book are deserving of high praise for their clearness dignity and sobriety  the speeches and passages of dialogue are not so fortunate as they have an awkward tendency to lapse into bad blank verse  here for instance is a speech printed by mr coleridge as prose in which the true music of prose is sacrificed to a false metrical system which is at once monotonous and tiresome     but death who brings us freedom from all falsehood    who heals the heart when the physician fails    who comforts all whom life cannot console    who stretches out in sleep the tired watchers    he takes the king and proves him but a beggar    he speaks and we deaf to our makers voice    hear and obey the call of our destroyer    then let us murmur not at anything    for if our ills are curable tis idle    and if they are past remedy tis vain    the worst our strongest enemy can do    is take from us our life and this indeed    is in the power of the weakest also  this is not good prose it is merely blank verse of an inferior quality and we hope that mr coleridge in his next novel will not ask us to accept secondrate poetry as musical prose  for that mr coleridge is a young writer of great ability and culture cannot be doubted and indeed in spite of the error we have pointed out demetrius remains one of the most fascinating and delightful novels that has appeared this season  demetrius  by the hon stephen coleridge  kegan paul     new novels   saturday review august 20 1887  teutonic fiction as a rule is somewhat heavy and very sentimental but werners her son excellently translated by miss tyrrell is really a capital story and would make a capital play  old count steinruck has two grandsons raoul and michael  the latter is brought up like a peasants child cruelly treated by his grandfather and by the peasant to whose care he is confided his mother the countess louis steinruck having married an adventurer and a gambler  he is the rough hero of the tale the saint michael of that war with evil which is life while raoul spoiled by his grandfather and his french mother betrays his country and tarnishes his name  at every step in the narrative these two young men come into collision  there is a war of character a clash of personalities  michael is proud stern and noble  raoul is weak charming and evil  michael has the world against him and conquers  raoul has the world on his side and loses  the whole story is full of movement and life and the psychology of the characters is displayed by action not by analysis by deeds not by description  though there are three long volumes we do not tire of the tale  it has truth passion and power and there are no better things than these in fiction  the interest of mr sale lloyds scamp depends on one of those misunderstandings which is the stockintrade of secondrate novelists captain egerton falls in love with miss adela thorndyke who is a sort of feeble echo of some of miss broughtons heroines but will not marry her because he has seen her talking with a young man who lives in the neighbourhood and is one of his oldest friends  we are sorry to say that miss thorndyke remains quite faithful to captain egerton and goes so far as to refuse for his sake the rector of the parish a local baronet and a real live lord  there are endless pages of five oclock teaprattle and a good many tedious characters  such novels as scamp are possibly more easy to write than they are to read  james hepburn belongs to a very different class of book  it is not a mere chaos of conversation but a strong story of real life and it cannot fail to give miss veitch a prominent position among modern novelists  james hepburn is the free church minister of mossgiel and presides over a congregation of pleasant sinners and serious hypocrites two people interest him lady ellinor farquharson and a handsome young vagabond called robert blackwood  through his efforts to save lady ellinor from shame and ruin he is accused of being her lover through his intimacy with robert blackwood he is suspected of having murdered a young girl in his household  a meeting of the elders and officebearers of the church is held to consider the question of the ministers resignation at which to the amazement of every one robert blackwood comes forth and confesses to the crime of which hepburn is accused  the whole story is exceedingly powerful and there is no extravagant use of the scotch dialect which is a great advantage to the reader  the titlepage of tiff informs us that it was written by the author of lucy or a great mistake which seems to us a form of anonymity as we have never heard of the novel in question  we hope however that it was better than tiff for tiff is undeniably tedious  it is the story of a beautiful girl who has many lovers and loses them and of an ugly girl who has one lover and keeps him  it is a rather confused tale and there are far too many lovescenes in it  if this favourite fiction series in which tiff appears is to be continued we would entreat the publisher to alter the type and the binding  the former is far too small while as for the cover it is of sham crocodile leather adorned with a blue spider and a vulgar illustration of the heroine in the arms of a young man in evening dress  dull as tiff isand its dulness is quite remarkableit does not deserve

alexander gardner  4 tiff  by the author of lucy or a great mistake  favourite fiction series  william stevens     two biographies of keats   pall mall gazette september 27 1887  a poet said keats once is the most unpoetical of all gods creatures and whether the aphorism be universally true or not this is certainly the impression produced by the two last biographies that have appeared of keats himself  it cannot be said that either mr colvin or mr william rossetti makes us love keats more or understand him better  in both these books there is much that is like chaff in the mouth and in mr rossettis there is not a little that is like brass on the palate  to a certain degree this is no doubt inevitable nowadays  everybody pays a penalty for peeping through keyholes and the keyhole and the backstairs are essential parts of the method of the modern biographers it is only fair however to state at the outset that mr colvin has done his work much better than mr rossetti  the account mr colvin gives of keatss boyhood for instance is very pleasing and so is the sketch of keatss circle of friends both leigh hunt and haydon being admirably drawn  here and there trivial family details are introduced without much regard to proportion and the posthumous panegyrics of devoted friends are not really of so much value in helping us to form any true estimate of keatss actual character as mr colvin seems to imagine  we have no doubt that when bailey wrote to lord houghton that commonsense and gentleness were keatss two special characteristics the worthy archdeacon meant extremely well but we prefer the real keats with his passionate wilfulness his fantastic moods and his fine inconsistence part of keatss charm as a man is his fascinating incompleteness  we do not want him reduced to a sandpaper smoothness or made perfect by the addition of popular virtues  still if mr colvin has not given us a very true picture of keatss character he has certainly told the story of his life in a pleasant and readable manner  he may not write with the ease and grace of a man of letters but he is never pretentious and not often pedantic  mr rossettis book is a great failure  to begin with mr rossetti commits the great mistake of separating the man from the artist  the facts of keatss life are interesting only when they are shown in their relation to his creative activity  the moment they are isolated they are either uninteresting or painful  mr rossetti complains that the early part of keatss life is uneventful and the latter part depressing but the fault lies with the biographer not with the subject  the book opens with a detailed account of keatss life in which he spares us nothing from what he calls the sexual misadventure at oxford down to the six weeks dissipation after the appearance of the blackwood article and the hysterical and morbid ravings of the dying man  no doubt most if not all of the things mr rossetti tells us are facts but there is neither tact shown in the selection that is made of the facts nor sympathy in the use to which they are put  when mr rossetti writes of the man he forgets the poet and when he criticises the poet he shows that he does not understand the man  his first error as we have said is isolating the life from the work his second error is his treatment of the work itself  take for instance his criticism of that wonderful ode to a nightingale with all its marvellous magic of music colour and form  he begins by saying that the first point of weakness in the poem is the surfeit of mythological allusions a statement which is absolutely untrue as out of the eight stanzas of the poem only three contain any mythological allusions at all and of these not one is either forced or remote  then coming to the second verse     oh for a draught of vintage that hath been       coold a long age in the deepdelved earth    tasting of flora and the countrygreen       dance and provencal song and sunburnt mirth  mr rossetti exclaims in a fine fit of blue ribbon enthusiasm surely nobody wants wine as a preparation for enjoying a nightingales music whether in a literal or in a fanciful relation  to call wine the true the blushful hippocrene    seems to him both stilted and repulsive the phrase with beaded bubbles winking at the brim is though picturesque trivial the succeeding image not charioted by bacchus and his pards is far worse while such an expression as lightwinged dryad of the trees is an obvious pleonasm for dryad really means oaknymph  as for that superb burst of passion     thou wast not born for death immortal bird       no hungry generations tread thee down    the voice i hear this passing night was heard       in ancient days by emperor and clown  mr rossetti tells us that it is a palpable or rather palpaple sic fact that this address    is a logical solecism as men live longer than nightingales  as mr colvin makes very much the same criticism talking of a breach of logic which is also    a flaw in the poetry it may be worth while to point out to these two last critics of keatss work that what keats meant to convey was the contrast between the permanence of beauty and the change and decay of human life an idea which receives its fullest expression in the ode on a grecian urn  nor do the other poems fare much better at mr rossettis hands  the fine invocation in isabella     moan hither all ye syllables of woe       from the deep throat of sad melpomene    through bronzed lyre in tragic order go       and touch the strings into a mystery  seems to him a fadeur the indian bacchante of the fourth book of endymion he calls a sentimental and beguiling winebibber and as for endymion himself he declares that he cannot understand how his human organism with respirative and digestive processes continues to exist and gives us his own idea of how keats should have treated the subject  an eminent french critic once exclaimed in despair je trouve des physiologistes partout but it has been reserved for mr rossetti to speculate on endymions digestion and we readily accord to him all the distinction of the position  even where mr rossetti seeks to praise he spoils what he praises  to speak of hyperion as a monument of cyclopean architecture in verse is bad enough but to call it a stonehenge of reverberance is absolutely detestable nor do we learn much about the eve of st mark by being told that its simplicity is full blooded as well as quaint  what is the meaning also of stating that keatss notes on shakespeare are somewhat strained and bloated and is there nothing better to be said of madeline in the eve of st agnes than that she is made a very charming and loveable figure although she does nothing very particular except to undress without looking behind her and to elope  there is no necessity to follow mr rossetti any further as he flounders about through the quagmire that he has made for his own feet  a critic who can say that not many of keatss poems are highly admirable need not be too seriously treated  mr rossetti is an industrious man and a painstaking writer but he entirely lacks the temper necessary for the interpretation of such poetry as was written by john keats  it is pleasant to turn again to mr colvin who criticises always with modesty and often with acumen  we do not agree with him when he accepts mrs owenss theory of a symbolic and allegoric meaning underlying endymion his final judgment on keats as the most shaksperean spirit that has lived since shakspere is not very fortunate and we are surprised to find him suggesting on the evidence of a rather silly story of severns that sir walter scott was privy to the blackwood article there is nothing however about his estimate of the poets work that is harsh irritating or uncouth  the true marcellus of english song has not yet found his virgil but mr colvin makes a tolerable statius  1 keats  by sidney colvin  english men of letters series macmillan and co  2 life of john keats  by william michael rossetti  great writers series  walter scott     a scotchman on scottish poetry   pall mall gazette october 24 1887  a distinguished living critic born south of the tweed once whispered in confidence to a friend that he believed that the scotch knew really very little about their own national literature  he quite admitted that they love their robbie burns and their sir walter with a patriotic enthusiasm that makes them extremely severe upon any unfortunate southron who ventures to praise either in their presence but he claimed that the works of such great national poets as dunbar henryson and sir david lyndsay are sealed books to the majority of the reading public in edinburgh aberdeen and glasgow and that few scotch people have any idea of the wonderful outburst of poetry that took place in their country during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries at a time when there was little corresponding development in england  whether this terrible accusation be absolutely true or not it is needless to discuss at present  it is probable that the archaism of language alone will always prevent a poet like dunbar from being popular in the ordinary acceptation of the word  professor veitchs book however shows that there are some at any rate in the land o cakes who can admire and appreciate their marvellous early singers and whose admiration for the lord of the isles and the verses to a mountain daisy does not blind them to the exquisite beauties of the testament of cresseid the thistle and the rose and the dialog betwix experience and ane courteour  taking as the subject of his two interesting volumes the feeling for nature in scottish poetry professor veitch starts with a historical disquisition on the growth of the sentiment in humanity  the primitive state he regards as being simply a sort of openair feeling  the chief sources of pleasure are the warmth of the sunshine the cool of the breeze and the general fresh aspect of the earth and sky connecting itself with a consciousness of life and sensuous enjoyment while darkness storm and cold are regarded as repulsive  this is followed by the pastoral stage in which we find the love of green meadows and of shady trees and of all things that make life pleasant and comfortable this again by the stage of agriculture the era of the war with earth when men take pleasure in the cornfield and in the garden but hate everything that is opposed to tillage such as woodland and rock or that cannot be subdued to utility such as mountain and sea  finally we come to the pure naturefeeling the free delight in the mere contemplation of the external world the joy in senseimpressions irrespective of all questions of natures utility and beneficence  but here the growth does not stop  the greek desiring to make nature one with humanity peopled the grove and hillside with beautiful and fantastic forms saw the god hiding in the thicket and the naiad drifting with the stream  the modern wordsworthian desiring to make man one with nature finds in external things the symbols of our inner life the workings of a spirit akin to our own  there is much that is suggestive in these early chapters of professor veitchs book but we cannot agree with him in the view he takes of the primitive attitude towards nature  the openair feeling of which he talks seems to us comparatively modern  the earliest naturemyths tell us not of mans sensuous enjoyment of nature but of the terror that nature inspires  nor are darkness and storm regarded by the primitive man as simply repulsive they are to him divine and supernatural things full of wonder and full of awe  some reference also should have been made to the influence of towns on the development of the naturefeeling for paradox though it may seem it is none the less true that it is largely to the creation of cities that we owe the love of the country  professor veitch is on a safer ground when he comes to deal with the growth and manifestations of this feeling as displayed in scotch poetry the early singers as he points out had all the mediaeval love of gardens all the artistic delight in the bright colours of flowers and the pleasant song of birds but they felt no sympathy for the wild solitary moorland with its purple heather its grey rocks and its waving bracken  montgomerie was the first to wander out on the banks and braes and to listen to the music of the burns and it was reserved for drummond of hawthornden to sing of flood and forest and to notice the beauty of the mists on the hillside and the snow on the mountain tops  then came allan ramsay with his honest homely pastorals thomson who writes about nature like an eloquent auctioneer and yet was a keen observer with a fresh eye and an open heart beattie who approached the problems that wordsworth afterwards solved the great celtic epic of ossian such an important factor in the romantic movement of germany and france fergusson to whom burns is so much indebted burns himself leyden sir walter scott james hogg and longo intervallo christopher north and the late professor shairp  on nearly all these poets professor veitch writes with fine judgment and delicate feeling and even his admiration for burns has nothing absolutely aggressive about it  he shows however a certain lack of the true sense of literary proportion in the amount of space he devotes to the two last writers on our list  christopher north was undoubtedly an interesting personality to the edinburgh of his day but he has not left behind him anything of real permanent value  there was too much noise in his criticism too little music in his poetry  as for professor shairp looked on as a critic he was a tragic example of the unfortunate influence of wordsworth for he was always confusing ethical with aesthetical questions and never had the slightest idea how to approach such poets as shelley and rossetti whom it was his mission to interpret to young oxford in his later years 189 while considered as a poet he deserves hardly more than a passing reference  professor veitch gravely tells us that one of the descriptions of kilmahoe is not surpassed in the language for real presence felicity of epithet and purity of reproduction and statements of this kind serve to remind us of the fact that a criticism which is based on patriotism is always provincial in its result  but it is only fair to add that it is very rarely that professor veitch is so extravagant and so grotesque  his judgment and taste are as a rule excellent and his book is on the whole a very fascinating and delightful contribution to the history of literature  the feeling for nature in scottish poetry  by john veitch professor of logic and rhetoric in the university of glasgow  blackwood and son     literary and other notesi   womans world november 1887  the princess christians translation of the memoirs of wilhelmine margravine of baireuth is a most fascinating and delightful book  the margravine and her brother frederick the great were as the princess herself points out in an admirably written introduction among the first of those questioning minds that strove after spiritual freedom in the last century  they had studied says the princess the english philosophers newton locke and shaftesbury and were roused to enthusiasm by the writings of voltaire and rousseau  their whole lives bore the impress of the influence of french thought on the burning questions of the day  in the eighteenth century began that great struggle of philosophy against tyranny and wornout abuses which culminated in the french revolution  the noblest minds were engaged in the struggle and like most reformers they pushed their conclusions to extremes and too often lost sight of the need of a due proportion in things  the margravines influence on the intellectual development of her country is untold  she formed at baireuth a centre of culture and learning which had before been undreamt of in germany  the historical value of these memoirs is of course well known  carlyle speaks of them as being by far the best authority on the early life of frederick the great  but considered merely as the autobiography of a clever and charming woman they are no less interesting and even those who care nothing for eighteenthcentury politics and look upon history itself as an unattractive form of fiction cannot fail to be fascinated by the margravines wit vivacity and humour by her keen powers of observation and by her brilliant and assertive egotism  not that her life was by any means a happy one  her father to quote the princess christian ruled his family with the same harsh despotism with which he ruled his country taking pleasure in making his power felt by all in the most galling manner and the margravine and her brother had much to suffer not only from his ungovernable temper but also from the real privations to which they were subjected  indeed the picture the margravine gives of the king is quite extraordinary  he despised all learning she writes and wished me to occupy myself with nothing but needlework and household duties or details  had he found me writing or reading he would probably have whipped me  he considered music a capital offence and maintained that every one should devote himself to one object men to the military service and women to their household duties  science and the arts he counted among the seven deadly sins sometimes he took to religion and then says the margravine we lived like trappists to the great grief of my brother and myself  every afternoon the king preached a sermon to which we had to listen as attentively as if it proceeded from an apostle  my brother and i were often seized with such an intense sense of the ridiculous that we burst out laughing upon which an apostolic curse was poured out on our heads which we had to accept with a show of humility and penitence  economy and soldiers were his only topics of conversation his chief social amusement was to make his guests intoxicated and as for his temper the accounts the margravine gives of it would be almost incredible if they were not amply corroborated from other sources  suetonius has written of the strange madness that comes on kings but even in his melodramatic chronicles there is hardly anything that rivals what the margravine has to tell us  here is one of her pictures of family life at a royal court in the last century and it is not by any means the worst scene she describes     on one occasion when his temper was more than usually bad he told    the queen that he had received letters from anspach in which the    margrave announced his arrival at berlin for the beginning of may  he    was coming there for the purpose of marrying my sister and one of his    ministers would arrive previously with the betrothal ring  my father    asked my sister whether she were pleased at this prospect and how she    would arrange her household  now my sister had always made a point of    telling him whatever came into her head even the greatest    hometruths and he had never taken her outspokenness amiss  on this    occasion therefore relying on former experience she answered him as    follows when i have a house of my own i shall take care to have a    wellappointed dinnertable better than yours is and if i have    children of my own i shall not plague them as you do yours and force    them to eat things they thoroughly dislike     what is amiss with my dinnertable the king enquired getting very    red in the face     you ask what is the matter with it my sister replied there is not    enough on it for us to eat and what there is is cabbage and carrots    which we detest  her first answer had already angered my father but    now he gave vent to his fury  but instead of punishing my sister he    poured it all on my mother my brother and myself  to begin with he    threw his plate at my brothers head who would have been struck had    he not got out of the way a second one he threw at me which i also    happily escaped then torrents of abuse followed these first signs of    hostility  he reproached the queen with having brought up her    children so badly  you will curse your mother he said to my    brother for having made you such a goodfornothing creature       as my brother and i passed near him to leave the room he hit out at    us with his crutch  happily we escaped the blow for it would    certainly have struck us down and we at last escaped without harm  yet as the princess christian remarks despite the almost cruel treatment wilhelmine received from her father it is noticeable that throughout her memoirs she speaks of him with the greatest affection  she makes constant reference to his good heart and says that his faults were more those of temper than of nature  nor could all the misery and wretchedness of her home life dull the brightness of her intellect  what would have made others morbid made her satirical  instead of weeping over her own personal tragedies she laughs at the general comedy of life  here for instance is her description of peter the great and his wife who arrived at berlin in 1718     the czarina was small broad and brownlooking without the slightest    dignity or appearance  you had only to look at her to detect her low    origin  she might have passed for a german actress she had decked    herself out in such a manner  her dress had been bought secondhand    and was trimmed with some dirty looking silver embroidery the bodice    was trimmed with precious stones arranged in such a manner as to    represent the double eagle  she wore a dozen orders and round the    bottom of her dress hung quantities of relics and pictures of saints    which rattled when she walked and reminded one of a smartly harnessed    mule  the orders too made a great noise knocking against each other     the czar on the other hand was tall and well grown with a handsome    face but his expression was coarse and impressed one with fear  he    wore a simple sailors dress  his wife who spoke german very badly    called her court jester to her aid and spoke russian with her  this    poor creature was a princess gallizin who had been obliged to    undertake this sorry office to save her life as she had been mixed up    in a conspiracy against the czar and had twice been flogged with the    knout               the following day the czar visited all the sights of berlin amongst    others the very curious collection of coins and antiques  amongst    these last named was a statue representing a heathen god  it was    anything but attractive but was the most valuable in the collection    the czar admired it very much and insisted on the czarina kissing it    on her refusing he said to her in bad german that she should lose her    head if she did not at once obey him  being terrified at the czars    anger she immediately complied with his orders without the least    hesitation  the czar asked the king to give him this and other    statues a request which he could not refuse  the same thing happened    about a cupboard inlaid with amber  it was the only one of its kind    and had cost king frederick i an enormous sum and the consternation    was general on its having to be sent to petersburg     this barbarous court happily left after two days  the queen rushed at    once to monbijou which she found in a state resembling that of the    fall of jerusalem  i never saw such a sight  everything was    destroyed so that the queen was obliged to rebuild the whole house  nor are the margravines descriptions of her reception as a bride in the principality of baireuth less amusing  hof was the first town she came to and a deputation of nobles was waiting there to welcome her  this is her account of them     their faces would have frightened little children and to add to    their beauty they had arranged their hair to resemble the wigs that    were then in fashion  their dresses clearly denoted the antiquity of    their families as they were composed of heirlooms and were cut    accordingly so that most of them did not fit  in spite of their    costumes being the court dresses the gold and silver trimmings were    so black that you had a difficulty in making out of what they were    made  the manners of these nobles suited their faces and their    clothes  they might have passed for peasants  i could scarcely    restrain my laughter when i first beheld these strange figures  i    spoke to each in turn but none of them understood what i said and    their replies sounded to me like hebrew because the dialect of the    empire is quite different from that spoken in brandenburg     the clergy also presented themselves  these were totally different    creatures  round their necks they wore great ruffs which resembled    washing baskets  they spoke very slowly so that i might be able to    understand them better  they said the most foolish things and it was    only with much difficulty that i was able to prevent myself from    laughing  at last i got rid of all these people and we sat down to    dinner  i tried my best to converse with those at table but it was    useless  at last i touched on agricultural topics and then they    began to thaw  i was at once informed of all their different    farmsteads and herds of cattle  an almost interesting discussion took    place as to whether the oxen in the upper part of the country were    fatter than those in the lowlands              i was told that as the next day was sunday i must spend it at hof    and listen to a sermon  never before had i heard such a sermon  the    clergyman began by giving us an account of all the marriages that had    taken place from adams time to that of noah  we were spared no    detail so that the gentlemen all laughed and the poor ladies blushed    the dinner went off as on the previous day  in the afternoon all the    ladies came to pay me their respects  gracious heavens  what ladies    too  they were all as ugly as the gentlemen and their headdresses    were so curious that swallows might have built their nests in them  as for baireuth itself and its petty court the picture she gives of it is exceedingly curious  her fatherinlaw the reigning margrave was a narrowminded mediocrity whose conversation resembled that of a sermon read aloud for the purpose of sending the listener to sleep and he had only two topics telemachus and amelot de la houssayes roman history the ministers from baron von stein who always said yes to everything to baron von voit who always said no were not by any means an intellectual set of men  their chief amusement says the margravine was drinking from morning till night and horses and cattle were all they talked about  the palace itself was shabby decayed and dirty  i was like a lamb among wolves cries the poor margravine i was settled in a strange country at a court which more resembled a peasants farm surrounded by coarse bad dangerous and tiresome people  yet her esprit never deserted her  she is always clever witty and entertaining  her stories about the endless squabbles over precedence are extremely amusing  the society of her day cared very little for good manners knew indeed very little about them but all questions of etiquette were of vital importance and the margravine herself though she saw the shallowness of the whole system was far too proud not to assert her rights when circumstances demanded it as the description she gives of her visit to the empress of germany shows very clearly  when this meeting was first proposed the margravine declined positively to entertain the idea  there was no precedent she writes of a kings daughter and the empress having met and i did not know to what rights i ought to lay claim  finally however she is induced to consent but she lays down three conditions for her reception     i desired first of all that the empresss court should receive me at    the foot of the stairs secondly that she should meet me at the door    of her bedroom and thirdly that she should offer me an armchair to    sit on              they disputed all day over the conditions i had made  the two first    were granted me but all that could be obtained with respect to the    third was that the empress would use quite a small armchair whilst    she gave me a chair     next day i saw this royal personage  i own that had i been in her    place i would have made all the rules of etiquette and ceremony the    excuse for not being obliged to appear  the empress was small and    stout round as a ball very ugly and without dignity or manner  her    mind corresponded to her body  she was terribly bigoted and spent    her whole day praying  the old and ugly are generally the almightys    portion  she received me trembling all over and was so upset that    she could not say a word     after some silence i began the conversation in french  she answered    me in her austrian dialect that she could not speak in that language    and begged i would speak in german  the conversation did not last    long for the austrian and low saxon tongues are so different from    each other that to those acquainted with only one the other is    unintelligible  this is what happened to us  a third person would    have laughed at our misunderstandings for we caught only a word here    and there and had to guess the rest  the poor empress was such a    slave to etiquette that she would have thought it high treason had she    spoken to me in a foreign language though she understood french quite    well  many other extracts might be given from this delightful book but from the few that have been selected some idea can be formed of the vivacity and picturesqueness of the margravines style  as for her character it is very well summed up by the princess christian who while admitting that she often appears almost heartless and inconsiderate yet claims that taken as a whole she stands out in marked prominence among the most gifted women of the eighteenth century not only by her mental powers but by her goodness of heart her selfsacrificing devotion and true friendship  an interesting sequel to her memoirs would be her correspondence with voltaire and it is to be hoped that we may shortly see a translation of these letters from the same accomplished pen to which we owe the present volume 198        womens voices is an anthology of the most characteristic poems by english scotch and irish women selected and arranged by mrs william sharp  the idea of making this anthology says mrs sharp in her preface arose primarily from the conviction that our womenpoets had never been collectively represented with anything like adequate justice that the works of many are not so widely known as they deserve to be and that at least some fine fugitive poetry could be thus rescued from oblivion and mrs sharp proceeds to claim that the selections will further emphasise the value of womens work in poetry for those who are already well acquainted with english literature and that they will convince many it is as possible to form an anthology of pure poetry from the writings of women as from those of men  it is somewhat difficult to define what pure poetry really is but the collection is certainly extremely interesting extending as it does over nearly three centuries of our literature  it opens with revenge a poem by the learned virtuous and truly noble ladie elizabeth carew who published a tragedie of marian the faire queene of iewry in 1613 from which revenge is taken  then come some very pretty verses by margaret duchess of newcastle who produced a volume of poems in 1653  they are supposed to be sung by a seagoddess and their fantastic charm and the graceful wilfulness of their fancy are well worthy of note as these first stanzas show     my cabinets are oystershells    in which i keep my orient pearls    and modest coral i do wear    which blushes when it touches air     on silvery waves i sit and sing    and then the fish lie listening    then resting on a rocky stone    i comb my hair with fishes bone     the whilst apollo with his beams    doth dry my hair from soaking streams    his light doth glaze the waters face    and make the sea my lookingglass  then follow friendships mystery by the matchless orinda mrs katherine philips a song by mrs aphra behn the first english woman who adopted literature as a profession and the countess of winchelseas nocturnal reverie  wordsworth once said that with the exception of this poem and popes windsor forest the poetry of the period intervening between paradise lost and the seasons does not contain a single new image of external nature and though the statement is hardly accurate as it leaves gay entirely out of account it must be admitted that the simple naturalism of lady winchelseas description is extremely remarkable passing on through mrs sharps collection we come across poems by lady grisell baillie by jean adams a poor sewingmaid in a scotch manse who died in the greenock workhouse by isobel pagan an ayrshire lucky who kept an alehouse and sold whiskey without a license and sang her own songs as a means of subsistence by mrs thrale dr johnsons friend by mrs hunter the wife of the great anatomist by the worthy mrs barbauld and by the excellent mrs hannah more  here is miss anna seward called by her admirers the swan of lichfield who was so angry with dr darwin for plagiarising some of her verses lady anne barnard whose auld robin gray was described by sir walter scott as worth all the dialogues corydon and phyllis have together spoken from the days of theocritus downwards jean glover a scottish weavers daughter who married a strolling player and became the best singer and actor of his troop joanna baillie whose tedious dramas thrilled our grandfathers mrs tighe whose psyche was very much admired by keats in his youthful days frances kemble mrs siddonss niece poor l e l whom disraeli described as the personification of brompton pink satin dress white satin shoes red cheeks snub nose and her hair a la sappho the two beautiful sisters lady dufferin and mrs norton emily bronte whose poems are instinct with tragic power and quite terrible in their bitter intensity of passion the fierce fire of feeling seeming almost to consume the raiment of form eliza cook a kindly vulgar writer george eliot whose poetry is too abstract and lacks all rhythmical life mrs carlyle who wrote much better poetry than her husband though this is hardly high praise and mrs browning the first really great poetess in our literature  nor are contemporary writers forgotten  christina rossetti some of whose poems are quite priceless in their beauty mrs augusta webster mrs hamilton king miss mary robinson mrs craik jean ingelow whose sonnet on an ancient chess king is like an exquisitely carved gem mrs pfeiffer miss may probyn a poetess with the true lyrical impulse of song whose work is as delicate as it is delightful mrs nesbit a very pure and perfect artist miss rosa mulholland miss katharine tynan lady charlotte elliot and many other wellknown writers are duly and adequately represented  on the whole mrs sharps collection is very pleasant reading indeed and the extracts given from the works of living poetesses are extremely remarkable not merely for their absolute artistic excellence but also for the light they throw upon the spirit of modern culture  it is not however by any means a complete anthology  dame juliana berners is possibly too antiquated in style to be suitable to a modern audience  but where is anne askew who wrote a ballad in newgate and where is queen elizabeth whose most sweet and sententious ditty on mary stuart is so highly praised by puttenham as an example of exargasia or the gorgeous in literature  why is the countess of pembroke excluded  sidneys sister should surely have a place in any anthology of english verse  where is sidneys niece lady mary wroth to whom ben jonson dedicated the alchemist  where is the noble ladie diana primrose who wrote a chain of pearl or a memorial of the peerless graces and heroic virtues of queen elizabeth of glorious memory  where is mary morpeth the friend and admirer of drummond of hawthornden  where is the princess elizabeth daughter of james i and where is anne killigrew maid of honour to the duchess

interesting rachel lady russell constantia grierson mary barber laetitia pilkington eliza haywood whom pope honoured by a place in the dunciad lady luxborough lord bolingbrokes halfsister lady mary wortley montagu lady temple whose poems were printed by horace walpole perdita whose lines on the snowdrop are very pathetic the beautiful duchess of devonshire of whom gibbon said that she was made for something better than a duchess mrs ratcliffe mrs chapone and amelia opie all deserve a place on historical if not on artistic grounds  in fact the space given by mrs sharp to modern and living poetesses is somewhat disproportionate and i am sure that those on whose brows the laurels are still green would not grudge a little room to those the green of whose laurels is withered and the music of whose lyres is mute        one of the most powerful and pathetic novels that has recently appeared is a village tragedy by margaret l woods  to find any parallel to this lurid little story one must go to dostoieffski or to guy de maupassant not that mrs woods can be said to have taken either of these two great masters of fiction as her model but there is something in her work that recalls their method she has not a little of their fierce intensity their terrible concentration their passionless yet poignant objectivity like them she seems to allow life to suggest its own mode of presentation and like them she recognises that a frank acceptance of the facts of life is the true basis of all modern imitative art  the scene of mrs woodss story lies in one of the villages near oxford the characters are very few in number and the plot is extremely simple  it is a romance of modern arcadiaa tale of the love of a farmlabourer for a girl who though slightly above him in social station and education is yet herself also a servant on a farm  true arcadians they are both of them and their ignorance and isolation serve only to intensify the tragedy that gives the story its title  it is the fashion nowadays to label literature so no doubt mrs woodss novel will be spoken of as realistic  its realism however is the realism of the artist not of the reporter its tact of treatment subtlety of perception and fine distinction of style make it rather a poem than a procesverbal and though it lays bare to us the mere misery of life it suggests something of lifes mystery also  very delicate too is the handling of external nature  there are no formal guidebook descriptions of scenery nor anything of what byron petulantly called twaddling about trees but we seem to breathe the atmosphere of the country to catch the exquisite scent of the beanfields so familiar to all who have ever wandered through the oxfordshire lanes in june to hear the birds singing in the thicket and the sheepbells tinkling from the hill  characterisation that enemy of literary form is such an essential part of the method of the modern writer of fiction that nature has almost become to the novelist what light and shade are to the painterthe one permanent element of style and if the power of a village tragedy be due to its portrayal of human life no small portion of its charm comes from its theocritean setting        it is however not merely in fiction and in poetry that the women of this century are making their mark  their appearance amongst the prominent speakers at the church congress some weeks ago was in itself a very remarkable proof of the growing influence of womens opinions on all matters connected with the elevation of our national life and the amelioration of our social conditions  when the bishops left the platform to their wives it may be said that a new era began and the change will no doubt be productive of much good  the apostolic dictum that women should not be suffered to teach is no longer applicable to a society such as ours with its solidarity of interests its recognition of natural rights and its universal education however suitable it may have been to the greek cities under roman rule  nothing in the united states struck me more than the fact that the remarkable intellectual progress of that country is very largely due to the efforts of american women who edit many of the most powerful magazines and newspapers take part in the discussion of every question of public interest and exercise an important influence upon the growth and tendencies of literature and art  indeed the women of america are the one class in the community that enjoys that leisure which is so necessary for culture  the men are as a rule so absorbed in business that the task of bringing some element of form into the chaos of daily life is left almost entirely to the opposite sex and an eminent bostonian once assured me that in the twentieth century the whole culture of his country would be in petticoats  by that time however it is probable that the dress of the two sexes will be assimilated as similarity of costume always follows similarity of pursuits        in a recent article in la france m sarcey puts this point very well the further we advance he says the more apparent does it become that women are to take their share as breadwinners in the world  the task is no longer monopolised by men and will perhaps be equally shared by the sexes in another hundred years  it will be necessary however for women to invent a suitable costume as their present style of dress is quite inappropriate to any kind of mechanical labour and must be radically changed before they can compete with men upon their own ground  as to the question of desirability m sarcey refuses to speak  i shall not see the end of this revolution he remarks and i am glad of it  but as is pointed out in a very sensible article in the daily news there is no doubt that m sarcey has reason and commonsense on his side with regard to the absolute unsuitability of ordinary feminine attire to any sort of handicraft or even to any occupation which necessitates a daily walk to business and back again in all kinds of weather  womens dress can easily be modified and adapted to any exigencies of the kind but most women refuse to modify or adapt it  they must follow the fashion whether it be convenient or the reverse  and after all what is a fashion  from the artistic point of view it is usually a form of ugliness so intolerable that we have to alter it every six months  from the point of view of science it not unfrequently violates every law of health every principle of hygiene  while from the point of view of simple ease and comfort it is not too much to say that with the exception of m felixs charming teagowns and a few english tailormade costumes there is not a single form of really fashionable dress that can be worn without a certain amount of absolute misery to the wearer  the contortion of the feet of the chinese beauty said dr naftel at the last international medical congress held at washington is no more barbarous or unnatural than the panoply of the femme du monde  and yet how sensible is the dress of the london milkwoman of the irish or scotch fishwife of the northcountry factorygirl  an attempt was made recently to prevent the pitwomen from working on the ground that their costume was unsuited to their sex but it is really only the idle classes who dress badly  wherever physical labour of any kind is required the costume used is as a rule absolutely right for labour necessitates freedom and without freedom there is no such thing as beauty in dress at all  in fact the beauty of dress depends on the beauty of the human figure and whatever limits constrains and mutilates is essentially ugly though the eyes of many are so blinded by custom that they do not notice the ugliness till it has become unfashionable  what womens dress will be in the future it is difficult to say  the writer of the daily news article is of opinion that skirts will always be worn as distinctive of the sex and it is obvious that mens dress in its present condition is not by any means an example of a perfectly rational costume  it is more than probable however that the dress of the twentieth century will emphasise distinctions of occupation not distinctions of sex        it is hardly too much to say that by the death of the author of john halifax gentleman our literature has sustained a heavy loss  mrs craik was one of the finest of our womenwriters and though her art had always what keats called a palpable intention upon one still its imaginative qualities were of no mean order  there is hardly one of her books that has not some distinction of style there is certainly not one of them that does not show an ardent love of all that is beautiful and good in life  the good she perhaps loved somewhat more than the beautiful but her heart had room for both  her first novel appeared in 1849 the year of the publication of charlotte brontes jane eyre and mrs gaskells ruth and her last work was done for the magazine which i have the honour to edit  she was very much interested in the scheme for the foundation of the womans world suggested its title and promised to be one of its warmest supporters  one article from her pen is already in proof and will appear next month and in a letter i received from her a few days before she died she told me that she had almost finished a second to be called between schooldays and marriage  few women have enjoyed a greater popularity than mrs craik or have better deserved it it is sometimes said that john halifax is not a real man but only a womans ideal of a man  well let us be grateful for such ideals  no one can read the story of which john halifax is the hero without being the better for it  mrs craik will live long in the affectionate memory of all who knew her and one of her novels at any rate will always have a high and honourable place in english fiction  indeed for simple narrative power some of the chapters of john halifax gentleman are almost unequalled in our prose literature        the news of the death of lady brassey has been also received by the english people with every expression of sorrow and sympathy  though her books were not remarkable for any perfection of literary style they had the charm of brightness vivacity and unconventionality  they revealed a fascinating personality and their touches of domesticity made them classics in many an english household  in all modern movements lady brassey took a keen interest  she gained a firstclass certificate in the south kensington school of cookery scullery department and all was one of the most energetic members of the st johns ambulance association many branches of which she succeeded in founding and whether at normanhurst or in park lane always managed to devote some portion of her day to useful and practical work  it is sad to have to chronicle in the first number of the womans world the death of two of the most remarkable englishwomen of our day  1 memoirs of wilhelmine

characteristic poems by english scotch and irish women  selected edited and arranged by mrs william sharp  walter scott  3 a village tragedy  by margaret l woods  bentley and son     mr mahaffys new book   pall mall gazette november 9 1887  mr mahaffys new book will be a great disappointment to everybody except the paperunionists and the members of the primrose league  his subject the history of greek life and thought from the age of alexander to the roman conquest is extremely interesting but the manner in which the subject is treated is quite unworthy of a scholar nor can there be anything more depressing than mr mahaffys continual efforts to degrade history to the level of the ordinary political pamphlet of contemporary party warfare  there is of course no reason why mr mahaffy should be called upon to express any sympathy with the aspirations of the old greek cities for freedom and autonomy  the personal preferences of modern historians on these points are matters of no import whatsoever  but in his attempts to treat the hellenic world as tipperary writ large to use alexander the great as a means of whitewashing mr smith and to finish the battle of chaeronea on the plains of mitchelstown mr mahaffy shows an amount of political bias and literary blindness that is quite extraordinary  he might have made his book a work of solid and enduring interest but he has chosen to give it a merely ephemeral value and to substitute for the scientific temper of the true historian the prejudice the flippancy and the violence of the platform partisan  for the flippancy parallels can no doubt be found in some of mr mahaffys earlier books but the prejudice and the violence are new and their appearance is very much to be regretted  there is always something peculiarly impotent about the violence of a literary man  it seems to bear no reference to facts for it is never kept in check by action  it is simply a question of adjectives and rhetoric of exaggeration and over emphasis  mr balfour is very anxious that mr william obrien should wear prison clothes sleep on a plank bed and be subjected to other indignities but mr mahaffy goes far beyond such mild measures as these and begins his history by frankly expressing his regret that demosthenes was not summarily put to death for his attempt to keep the spirit of patriotism alive among the citizens of athens  indeed he has no patience with what he calls the foolish and senseless opposition to macedonia regards the revolt of the spartans against alexanders lord lieutenant for greece as an example of parochial politics indulges in primrose league platitudes against a low franchise and the iniquity of allowing every pauper to have a vote and tells us that the demagogues and pretended patriots were so lost to shame that they actually preached to the parasitic mob of athens the doctrine of autonomynot now extinct mr mahaffy adds regretfullyand propounded as a principle of political economy the curious idea that people should be allowed to manage their own affairs  as for the personal character of the despots mr mahaffy admits that if he had to judge by the accounts in the greek historians from herodotus downwards he would certainly have said that the ineffaceable passion for autonomy which marks every epoch of greek history and every canton within its limits must have arisen from the excesses committed by the officers of foreign potentates or local tyrants but a careful study of the cartoons published in united ireland has convinced him that a ruler may be the soberest the most conscientious the most considerate and yet have terrible things said of him by mere political malcontents  in fact since mr balfour has been caricatured greek history must be entirely rewritten  this is the pass to which the distinguished professor of a distinguished university has been brought  nor can anything equal mr mahaffys prejudice against the greek patriots unless it be his contempt for those few fine romans who sympathising with hellenic civilisation and culture recognised the political value of autonomy and the intellectual importance of a healthy national life  he mocks at what he calls their vulgar mawkishness about greek liberties their anxiety to redress historical wrongs and congratulates his readers that this feeling was not intensified by the remorse that their own forefathers had been the oppressors  luckily says mr mahaffy the old greeks had conquered troy and so the pangs of conscience which now so deeply afflict a gladstone and a morley for the sins of their ancestors could hardly affect a marcius or a quinctius  it is quite unnecessary to comment on the silliness and bad taste of passages of this kind but it is interesting to note that the facts of history are too strong even for mr mahaffy  in spite of his sneers at the provinciality of national feeling and his vague panegyrics on cosmopolitan culture he is compelled to admit that however patriotism may be superseded in stray individuals by larger benevolence bodies of men who abandon it will only replace it by meaner motives and cannot help expressing his regret that the better classes among the greek communities were so entirely devoid of public spirit that they squandered as idle absentees or still idler residents the time and means given them to benefit their country and failed to recognise their opportunity of founding a hellenic federal empire  even when he comes to deal with art he cannot help admitting that the noblest sculpture of the time was that which expressed the spirit of the first great national struggle the repulse of the gallic hordes which overran greece in 278 bc and that to the patriotic feeling evoked at this crisis we owe the belvedere apollo the artemis of the vatican the dying gaul and the finest achievements of the perganene school  in literature also mr mahaffy is loud in his lamentations over what he considers to be the shallow society tendencies of the new comedy and misses the fine freedom of aristophanes with his intense patriotism his vital interest in politics his large issues and his delight in vigorous national life  he confesses the decay of oratory under the blighting influences of imperialism and the sterility of those pedantic disquisitions upon style which are the inevitable consequence of the lack of healthy subjectmatter  indeed on the last page of his history mr mahaffy makes a formal recantation of most of his political prejudices  he is still of opinion that demosthenes should have been put to death for resisting the macedonian invasion but admits that the imperialism of rome which followed the imperialism of alexander produced incalculable mischief beginning with intellectual decay and ending with financial ruin  the touch of rome he says numbed greece and egypt syria and asia minor and if there are great buildings attesting the splendour of the empire where are the signs of intellectual and moral vigour if we except that stronghold of nationality the little land of palestine  this palinode is no doubt intended to give a plausible air of fairness to the book but such a deathbed repentance comes too late and makes the whole preceding history seem not fair but foolish  it is a relief to turn to the few chapters that deal directly with the social life and thought of the greeks  here mr mahaffy is very pleasant reading indeed  his account of the colleges at athens and alexandria for instance is extremely interesting and so is his estimate of the schools of zeno of epicurus and of pyrrho  excellent too in many points is the description of the literature and art of the period  we do not agree with mr mahaffy in his panegyric of the laocoon and we are surprised to find a writer who is very indignant at what he considers to be the modern indifference to alexandrine poetry gravely stating that no study is more wearisome and profitless than that of the greek anthology  the criticism of the new comedy also seems to us somewhat pedantic  the aim of social comedy in menander no less than in sheridan is to mirror the manners not to reform the morals of its day and the censure of the puritan whether real or affected is always out of place in literary criticism and shows a want of recognition of the essential distinction between art and life  after all it is only the philistine who thinks of blaming jack absolute for his deception bob acres for his cowardice and charles surface for his extravagance and there is very little use in airing ones moral sense at the expense of ones artistic appreciation valuable also though modernity of expression undoubtedly is still it requires to be used with tact and judgment  there is no objection to mr mahaffys describing philopoemen as the garibaldi and antigonus doson as the victor emmanuel of his age  such comparisons have no doubt a certain cheap popular value  but on the other hand a phrase like greek preraphaelitism is rather awkward not much is gained by dragging in an allusion to mr shorthouses john inglesant in a description of the argonautics of apollonius rhodius and when we are told that the superb pavilion erected in alexandria by ptolemy philadelphus was a sort of glorified holborn restaurant we must say that the elaborate description of the building given in athenaeus could have been summed up in a better and a more intelligible epigram  on the whole however mr mahaffys book may have the effect of drawing attention to a very important and interesting period in the history of hellenism  we can only regret that just as he has spoiled his account of greek politics by a foolish partisan bias so he should have marred the value of some of his remarks on literature by a bias that is quite as unmeaning  it is uncouth and harsh to say that the superannuated schoolboy who holds fellowships and masterships at english colleges knows nothing of the period in question except what he reads in theocritus or that a man may be considered in england a distinguished greek professor who does not know a single date in greek history between the death of alexander and the battle of cynoscephalae and the statement that lucian plutarch and the four gospels are excluded from english school and college studies in consequence of the pedantry of pure scholars as they are pleased to call themselves is of course quite inaccurate  in fact not merely does mr mahaffy miss the spirit of the true historian but he often seems entirely devoid of the temper of the true man of letters  he is clever and at times even brilliant but he lacks reasonableness moderation style and charm  he seems to have no sense of literary proportion and as a rule spoils his case by overstating it  with all his passion for imperialism there is something about mr mahaffy that is if not parochial at least provincial and we cannot say that this last book of his will add anything to his reputation either as an historian a critic or a man of taste  greek life and thought from the age of alexander to the roman conquest by j p mahaffy fellow of trinity college dublin  macmillan and co     mr morriss completion of the odyssey   pall mall gazette november 24 1887  mr morriss second volume brings the great romantic epic of greek literature to its perfect conclusion and although there can never be an ultimate translation of either iliad or odyssey as each successive age is sure to find pleasure in rendering the two poems in its own manner and according to its own canons of taste still it is not too much to say that mr morriss version will always be a true classic amongst our classical translations  it is not of course flawless  in our notice of the first volume we ventured to say that mr morris was sometimes far more norse than greek nor does the volume that now lies before us make us alter that opinion  the particular metre also selected by mr morris although admirably adapted to express the strongwinged music of homer as far as its flow and freedom are concerned misses something of its dignity and calm  here it must be admitted we feel a distinct loss for there is in homer not a little of miltons lofty manner and if swiftness be an essential of the greek hexameter stateliness is one of its distinguishing qualities in homers hands  this defect however if we must call it a defect seems almost unavoidable as for certain metrical reasons a majestic movement in english verse is necessarily a slow movement and after all that can be said is said how really admirable is this whole translation  if we set aside its noble qualities as a poem and look on it purely from the scholars point of view how straightforward it is how honest and direct  its fidelity to the original is far beyond that of any other versetranslation in our literature and yet it is not the fidelity of a pedant to his text but rather the fine loyalty of poet to poet  when mr morriss first volume appeared many of the critics complained that his occasional use of archaic words and unusual expressions robbed his version of the true homeric simplicity  this however is not a very felicitous criticism for while homer is undoubtedly simple in his clearness and largeness of vision his wonderful power of direct narration his wholesome sanity and the purity and precision of his method simple in language he undoubtedly is not  what he was to his contemporaries we have of course no means of judging but we know that the athenian of the fifth century bc found him in many places difficult to understand and when the creative age was succeeded by the age of criticism and alexandria began to take the place of athens as the centre of culture for the hellenistic world homeric dictionaries and glossaries seem to have been constantly published  indeed athenaeus tells us of a wonderful byzantine bluestocking a precieuse from the propontis who wrote a long hexameter poem called mnemosyne full of ingenious commentaries on difficulties in homer and in fact it is evident that as far as the language is concerned such a phrase as homeric simplicity would have rather amazed an ancient greek  as for mr morriss tendency to emphasise the etymological meaning of words a point commented on with somewhat flippant severity in a recent number of macmillans magazine here mr morris seems to us to be in complete accord not merely with the spirit of homer but with the spirit of all early poetry  it is quite true that language is apt to degenerate into a system of almost algebraic symbols and the modern cityman who takes a ticket for blackfriars bridge naturally never thinks of the dominican monks who once had their monastery by thamesside and after whom the spot is named  but in earlier times it was not so  men were then keenly conscious of the real meaning of words and early poetry especially is full of this feeling and indeed may be said to owe to it no small portion of its poetic power and charm  these old words then and this old use of words which we find in mr morriss odyssey can be amply justified upon historical grounds and as for their artistic effect it is quite excellent  pope tried to put homer into the ordinary language of his day with what result we know only too well but mr morris who uses his archaisms with the tact of a true artist and to whom indeed they seem to come absolutely naturally has succeeded in giving to his version by their aid that touch not of quaintness for homer is never quaint but of oldworld romance and oldworld beauty which we moderns find so pleasurable and to which the greeks themselves were so keenly sensitive  as for individual passages of special merit mr morriss translation is no robe of rags sewn with purple patches for critics to sample  its real value lies in the absolute rightness and coherence of the whole in the grand architecture of the swift strong verse and in the fact that the standard is not merely high but everywhere sustained  it is impossible however to resist the temptation of quoting mr morriss rendering of that famous passage in the twentythird book of the epic in which odysseus eludes the trap laid for him by penelope whose very faith in the certainty of her husbands return makes her sceptical of his identity when he stands before her an instance by the way of homers wonderful psychological knowledge of human nature as it is always the dreamer himself who is most surprised when his dream comes true     thus she spake to prove her husband but odysseus grieved at heart    spake thus unto his bedmate wellskilled in gainful art    o woman thou sayest a word exceeding grievous to me    who hath otherwhere shifted my bedstead full hard for him should it    be    for as deft as he were unless soothly a very god come here    who easily if he willed it might shift it otherwhere    but no mortal man is living how strong soeer in his youth    who shall lightly hale it elsewhere since a mighty wonder forsooth    is wrought in that fashioned bedstead and i wrought it and i alone    in the close grew a thicket of olive a longleaved tree fullgrown    that flourished and grew goodly as big as a pillar about    so round it i built my brideroom till i did the work right out    with ashlar stone closefitting and i roofed it overhead    and thereto joined doors i made me wellfitting in their stead    then i lopped away the boughs of the longleafed olivetree    and shearing the bole from the root up full well and cunningly    i planed it about with the brass and set the rule thereto    and shaping thereof a bedpost with the wimble i bored it through    so beginning i wrought out the bedstead and finished it utterly    and with gold enwrought it about and with silver and ivory    and stretched on it a thong of oxhide with the purple dye made bright    thus then the sign i have shown thee nor woman know i aright    if my bed yet bideth steadfast or if to another place    some man hath moved it and smitten the olivebole from its base  these last twelve books of the odyssey have not the same marvel of romance adventure and colour that we find in the earlier part of the epic  there is nothing in them that we can compare to the exquisite idyll of nausicaa or to the titanic humour of the episode in the cyclops cave  penelope has not the glamour of circe and the song of the sirens may sound sweeter than the whizz of the arrows of odysseus as he stands on the threshold of his hall  yet for sheer intensity of passionate power for concentration of intellectual interest and for masterly dramatic construction these latter books are quite unequalled  indeed they show very clearly how it was that as greek art developed the epos passed into the drama  the whole scheme of the argument the return of the hero in disguise his disclosure of himself to his son his terrible vengeance on his enemies and his final recognition by his wife reminds us of the plot of more than one greek play and shows us what the great athenian poet meant when he said that his own dramas were merely scraps from homers table  in rendering this splendid poem into english verse mr morris has done our literature a service that can hardly be overestimated and it is pleasant to think that even should the classics be entirely excluded from our educational systems the english boy will still be able to know something of homers delightful tales to catch an echo of his grand music and to wander with the wise odysseus round the shores of old romance  the odyssey of homer  done into english verse by william morris author of the earthly paradise  volume ii  reeves and turner     sir charles bowens virgil   pall mall gazette november 30 1887  sir charles bowens translation of the eclogues and the first six books of the aeneid is hardly the work of a poet but it is a very charming version for all that combining as it does the fine loyalty and learning of a scholar with the graceful style of a man of letters two essential qualifications for any one who would render in english verse the picturesque pastorals of italian provincial life or the stately and polished epic of imperial rome  dryden was a true poet but for some reason or other he failed to catch the real virgilian spirit  his own qualities became defects when he accepted the task of a translator  he is too robust too manly too strong  he misses virgils strange and subtle sweetness and has but little of his exquisite melody  professor conington on the other hand was an admirable and painstaking scholar but he was so entirely devoid of literary tact and artistic insight that he thought that the majesty of virgil could be rendered in the jingling manner of marmion and though there is certainly far more of the mediaeval knight than of the mosstrooper about aeneas even mr morriss version is not by any means perfect  compared with professor coningtons bad ballad it is of course as gold to brass considered simply as a poem it has noble and enduring qualities of beauty music and strength but it hardly conveys to us the sense that the aeneid is the literary epic of a literary age  there is more of homer in it than of virgil and the ordinary reader would hardly realise from the flow and spirit of its swinging lines that virgil was a selfconscious artist the laureate of a cultured court  the aeneid bears almost the same relation to the iliad that the idylls of the king do to the old celtic romances of arthur  like them it is full of felicitous modernisms of exquisite literary echoes and of delicate and delightful pictures as lord tennyson loves england so did virgil love rome the pageants of history and the purple of empire are equally dear to both poets but neither of them has the grand simplicity or the large humanity of the early singers and as a hero aeneas is no less a failure than arthur  sir charles bowens version hardly gives us this peculiar literary quality of virgils verse and now and then it reminds us by some awkward inversion of the fact that it is a translation still on the whole it is extremely pleasant to read and if it does not absolutely mirror virgil it at least brings us many charming memories of him  the metre sir charles bowen has selected is a form of english hexameter with the final dissyllable shortened into a foot of a single syllable only  it is of course accentual not quantitative and though it misses that element of sustained strength which is given by the dissyllabic ending of the latin verse and has consequently a tendency to fall into couplets the increased facility of rhyming gained by the change is of no small value  to any english metre that aims at swiftness of movement rhyme seems to be an absolute essential and there are not enough double rhymes in our language to admit of the retention of this final dissyllabic foot  as an example of sir charles bowens method we would take his rendering of the famous passage in the fifth eclogue on the death of daphnis     all of the nymphs went weeping for daphnis cruelly slain    ye were witnesses hazels and river waves of the pain    when to her sons sad body the mother clave with a cry    calling the great gods cruel and cruel the stars of the sky    none upon those dark days their pastured oxen did lead    daphnis to drink of the cold clear rivulet never a steed    tasted the flowing waters or cropped one blade in the mead    over thy grave how the lions of carthage roared in despair    daphnis the echoes of mountain wild and of forest declare    daphnis was first who taught us to guide with a chariot rein    far armenias tigers the chorus of iacchus to train    led us with foliage waving the pliant spear to entwine    as to the tree her vine is a glory her grapes to the vine    bull to the horned herd and the corn to a fruitful plain    thou to thine own wert beauty and since fate robbed us of thee    pales herself and apollo are gone from meadow and lea  calling the great gods cruel and cruel the stars of the sky is a very felicitous rendering of atque deos atque astra vocat crudelia mater and so is thou to thine own wert beauty for tu decus omne tuis  this passage too from the fourth book of the aeneid is good     now was the night  tired limbs upon earth were folded to sleep    silent the forests and fierce seawaves in the firmament deep    midway rolled heavens stars no sound on the meadow stirred    every beast of the field each brighthued feathery bird    haunting the limpid lakes or the tangled briary glade    under the silent night in sleep were peacefully laid    all but the grieving queen  she yields her never to rest    takes not the quiet night to her eyelids or wearied breast  and this from the sixth book is worth quoting     never again such hopes shall a youth of the lineage of troy    rouse in his great forefathers of latium  never a boy    nobler pride shall inspire in the ancient romulus land    ah for his filial love for his oldworld faith for his hand    matchless in battle  unharmed what foemen had offered to stand    forth in his path when charging on foot for the enemys ranks    or when plunging the spur in his foamflecked coursers flanks    child of a nations sorrow if thou canst baffle the fates    bitter decrees and break for a while their barrier gates    thine to become marcellus  i pray thee bring me anon    handfuls of lilies that i bright flowers may strew on my son    heap on the shade of the boy unborn these gifts at the least    doing the dead though vainly the last sad service       he ceased  thine to become marcellus has hardly the simple pathos of tu marcellus eris but child of a nations sorrow is a graceful rendering of heu miserande puer  indeed there is a great deal of feeling in the whole translation and the tendency of the metre to run into couplets of which we have spoken before is corrected to a certain degree in the passage quoted above from the eclogues by the occasional use of the triplet as elsewhere by the introduction of alternate not successive rhymes  sir charles bowen is to be congratulated on the success of his version it has both style and fidelity to recommend it  the metre he has chosen seems to us more suited to the sustained majesty of the aeneid than it is to the pastoral note of the eclogues  it can bring us something of the strength of the lyre but has hardly caught the sweetness of the pipe still it is in many points a very charming translation and we gladly welcome it as a most valuable addition to the literature of echoes  virgil

lady bellairss gossips with girls and maidens contains some very interesting essays and a quite extraordinary amount of useful information on all matters connected with the mental and physical training of women  it is very difficult to give good advice without being irritating and almost impossible to be at once didactic and delightful but lady bellairs manages very cleverly to steer a middle course between the charybdis of dulness and the scylla of flippancy there is a pleasing intimite about her style and almost everything that she says has both good sense and good humour to recommend it  nor does she confine herself to those broad generalisations on morals which are so easy to make so difficult to apply  indeed she seems to have a wholesome contempt for the cheap severity of abstract ethics enters into the most minute details for the guidance of conduct and draws out elaborate lists of what girls should avoid and what they should cultivate  here are some specimens of what to avoid     a loud weak affected whining harsh or shrill tone of voice    extravagancies in conversationsuch phrases as awfully this    beastly that loads of time dont you know hate for    dislike etc    sudden exclamations of annoyance surprise or joyoften dangerously    approaching to female swearingas bother  gracious  how    jolly    yawning when listening to any one    talking on family matters even to your bosom friends    attempting any vocal or instrumental piece of music that you cannot    execute with ease    crossing your letters    making a short sharp nod with the head intended to do duty for a    bow    all nonsense in the shape of belief in dreams omens presentiments    ghosts spiritualism palmistry etc    entertaining wild flights of the imagination or empty idealistic    aspirations  i am afraid that i have a good deal of sympathy with what are called empty idealistic aspirations and wild flights of the imagination are so extremely rare in the nineteenth century that they seem to me deserving rather of praise than of censure  the exclamation bother also though certainly lacking in beauty might i think be permitted under circumstances of extreme aggravation such as for instance the rejection of a manuscript by the editor of a magazine but in all other respects the list seems to be quite excellent  as for what to cultivate nothing could be better than the following     an unaffected low distinct silvertoned voice    the art of pleasing those around you and seeming pleased with them    and all they may do for you    the charm of making little sacrifices quite naturally as if of no    account to yourself    the habit of making allowances for the opinions feelings or    prejudices of others    an erect carriagethat is a sound body    a good memory for faces and facts connected with themthus avoiding    giving offence through not recognising or bowing to people or saying    to them what had best been left unsaid    the art of listening without impatience to prosy talkers and smiling    at the twicetold tale or joke  i cannot help thinking that the last aphorism aims at too high a standard  there is always a certain amount of danger in any attempt to cultivate impossible virtues  however it is only fair to add that lady bellairs recognises the importance of selfdevelopment quite as much as the importance of selfdenial and there is a great deal of sound sense in everything that she says about the gradual growth and formation of character  indeed those who have not read aristotle upon this point might with advantage read lady bellairs  miss constance nadens little volume a modern apostle and other poems shows both culture and courageculture in its use of language courage in its selection of subjectmatter  the modern apostle of whom miss naden sings is a young clergyman who preaches pantheistic socialism in the free church of some provincial manufacturing town converts everybody except the woman whom he loves and is killed in a street riot  the story is exceedingly powerful but seems more suitable for prose than for verse  it is right that a poet should be full of the spirit of his age but the external forms of modern life are hardly as yet expressive of that spirit  they are truths of fact not truths of the imagination and though they may give the poet an opportunity for realism they often rob the poem of the reality that is so essential to it  art however is a matter of result not of theory and if the fruit is pleasant we should not quarrel about the tree  miss nadens work is distinguished by rich imagery fine colour and sweet music and these are things for which we should be grateful wherever we find them  in point of mere technical skill her longer poems are the best but some of the shorter poems are very fascinating  this for instance is pretty     the copyist group was gathered round    a timeworn fresco worldrenowned    whose central glory once had been    the face of christ the nazarene     and every copyist of the crowd    with his own soul that face endowed    gentle severe majestic mean    but which was christ the nazarene     then one who watched them made complaint    and marvelled saying wherefore paint    till ye be sure your eyes have seen    the face of christ the nazarene  and this sonnet is full of suggestion     the wineflushed monarch slept but in his ear       an angel breathedrepent or choose the flame       quenchless  in dread he woke but not in shame    deep musingsin i love yet hell i fear     wherefore he left his feasts and minions dear       and justly ruled and died a saint in name       but when his hasting spirit heavenward came    a stern voice criedo soul what dost thou here     love i forswore and wine and kept my vow       to live a just and joyless life and now       i crave reward  the voice came like a knell    fool dost thou hope to find again thy mirth    and those foul joys thou didst renounce on earth       yea enter in  my heaven shall be thy hell  miss constance naden deserves a high place among our living poetesses and this as mrs sharp has shown lately in her volume entitled womens voices is no mean distinction  phyllis brownes life of mrs somerville forms part of a very interesting little series called the worlds workersa collection of short biographies catholic enough to include personalities so widely different as turner and richard cobden handel and sir titus salt robert stephenson and florence nightingale and yet possessing a certain definite aim  as a mathematician and a scientist the translator and populariser of la mecanique celeste and the author of an important book on physical geography mrs somerville is of course well known  the scientific bodies of europe covered her with honours her bust stands in the hall of the royal society and one of the womens colleges at oxford bears her name  yet considered simply in the light of a wife and a mother she is no less admirable and those who consider that stupidity is the proper basis for the domestic virtues and that intellectual women must of necessity be helpless with their hands cannot do better than read phyllis brownes pleasant little book in which they will find that the greatest womanmathematician of any age was a clever needlewoman a good housekeeper and a most skilful cook  indeed mrs somerville seems to have been quite renowned for her cookery  the discoverers of the northwest passage christened an island somerville not as a tribute to the distinguished mathematician but as a recognition of the excellence of some orange marmalade which the distinguished mathematician had prepared with her own hands and presented to the ships before they left england and to the fact that she was able to make currant jelly at a very critical moment she owed the affection of some of her husbands relatives who up to that time had been rather prejudiced against her on the ground that she was merely an unpractical bluestocking  nor did her scientific knowledge ever warp or dull the tenderness and humanity of her nature  for birds and animals she had always a great love  we hear of her as a little girl watching with eager eyes the swallows as they built their nests in summer or prepared for their flight in the autumn and when snow was on the ground she used to open the windows to let the robins hop in and pick crumbs on the breakfasttable on one occasion she went with her father on a tour in the highlands and found on her return that a pet goldfinch which had been left in the charge of the servants had been neglected by them and had died of starvation  she was almost heartbroken at the event and in writing her recollections seventy years after she mentioned it and said that as she wrote she felt deep pain  her chief pet in her old age was a mountain sparrow which used to perch on her arm and go to sleep there while she was writing  one day the sparrow fell into the waterjug and was drowned to the great grief of its mistress who could hardly be consoled for its loss though later on we hear of a beautiful paroquet taking the place of le moineau duranie and becoming mrs somervilles constant companion  she was also very energetic phyllis browne tells us in trying to get a law passed in the italian parliament for the protection of animals and said once with reference to this subject we english cannot boast of humanity so long as our sportsmen find pleasure in shooting down tame pigeons as they fly terrified out of a cagea remark with which i entirely agree  mr herberts bill for the protection of land birds gave her immense pleasure though to quote her own words she was grieved to find that the lark which at heavens gate sings is thought unworthy of mans protection and she took a great fancy to a gentleman who on being told of the number of singing birds that is eaten in italynightingales goldfinches and robinsexclaimed in horror what robins our household birds  i would as soon eat a child  indeed she believed to some extent in the immortality of animals on the ground that if animals have no future it would seem as if some were created for uncompensated miseryan idea which does not seem to me to be either extravagant or fantastic though it must be admitted that the optimism on which it is based receives absolutely no support from science  on the whole phyllis brownes book is very pleasant reading  its only fault is that it is far too short and this is a fault so rare in modern literature that it almost amounts to a distinction  however phyllis browne has managed to crowd into the narrow limits at her disposal a great many interesting anecdotes  the picture she gives of mrs somerville working away at her translation of laplace in the same room with her children is very charming and reminds one of what is told of george sand there is an amusing account of mrs somervilles visit to the widow of the young pretender the countess of albany who after talking with her for some time exclaimed so you dont speak italian you must have had a very bad education  and this story about the waverley novels may possibly be new to some of my readers     a very amusing circumstance in connection with mrs somervilles    acquaintance with sir walter arose out of the childish inquisitiveness    of woronzow greig mrs somervilles little boy     during the time mrs somerville was visiting abbotsford the waverley    novels were appearing and were creating a great sensation yet even    scotts intimate friends did not know that he was the author he    enjoyed keeping the affair a mystery  but little woronzow discovered    what he was about  one day when mrs somerville was talking about a    novel that had just been published woronzow said i knew all these    stories long ago for mr scott writes on the dinnertable when he    has finished he puts the green cloth with the papers in a corner of    the diningroom and when he goes out charlie scott and i read the    stories  phyllis browne remarks that this incident shows that persons who want to keep a secret ought to be very careful when children are about but the story seems to me to be far too charming to require any moral of the kind  bound up in the same volume is a life of miss mary carpenter also written by phyllis browne  miss carpenter does not seem to me to have the charm and fascination of mrs somerville  there is always something about her that is formal limited and precise  when she was about two years old she insisted on being called doctor carpenter in the nursery at the age of twelve she is described by a friend as a sedate little girl who always spoke like a book and before she entered on her educational schemes she wrote down a solemn dedication of herself to the service of humanity  however she was one of the practical hardworking saints of the nineteenth century and it is no doubt quite right that the saints should take themselves very seriously  it is only fair also to remember that her work of rescue and reformation was carried on under great difficulties  here for instance is the picture miss cobbe gives us of one of the bristol nightschools     it was a wonderful spectacle to see mary carpenter sitting patiently    before the large school gallery in st jamess back teaching    singing and praying with the wild streetboys in spite of endless    interruptions caused by such proceedings as shooting marbles at any    object behind her whistling stamping fighting shrieking out amen    in the middle of a prayer and sometimes rising en masse and tearing    like a troop of bisons in hobnailed shoes down from the gallery    round the great schoolroom and down the stairs and into the street    these irrepressible outbreaks she bore with infinite good humour  her own account is somewhat pleasanter and shows that the troop of bisons in hobnailed shoes was not always so barbarous     i had taken to my class on the preceding week some specimens of ferns    neatly gummed on white paper     this time i took a piece of coal    shale with impressions of ferns to show them     i told each to    examine the specimen and tell me what he thought it was  w gave so    bright a smile that i saw he knew none of the others could tell he    said they were ferns like what i showed them last week but he    thought they were chiselled on the stone  their surprise and pleasure    were great when i explained the matter to them     the history of joseph they all found a difficulty in realising that    this had actually occurred  one asked if egypt existed now and if    people lived in it  when i told them that buildings now stood which    had been erected about the time of joseph one said that it was    impossible as they must have fallen down ere this  i showed them the    form of a pyramid and they were satisfied  one asked if all books    were true     the story of macbeth impressed them very much  they knew the name of    shakespeare having seen his name over a publichouse  a boy defined conscience as a thing a gentleman hasnt got who when a boy finds his purse and gives it back to him doesnt give the boy sixpence  another boy was asked after a sunday evening lecture on thankfulness what pleasure he enjoyed most in the course of a year  he replied candidly cockfightin maam theres a pit up by the black boy as is worth anythink in brissel  there is something a little pathetic in the attempt to civilise the rough streetboy by means of the refining influence of ferns and fossils and it is difficult to help feeling that miss carpenter rather overestimated the value of elementary education  the poor are not to be fed upon facts  even shakespeare and the pyramids are not sufficient nor is there much use in giving them the results of culture unless we also give them those conditions under which culture can be realised  in these cold crowded cities of the north the proper basis for morals using the word in its wide hellenic signification is to be found in architecture not in books  still it would be ungenerous not to recognise that mary carpenter gave to the children of the poor not merely her learning but her love  in early life her biographer tells us she had longed for the happiness of being a wife and a mother but later she became content that her affection could be freely given to all who needed it and the verse in the prophecies i have given thee children whom thou hast not borne seemed to her to indicate what was to be her true mission  indeed she rather inclined to bacons opinion that unmarried people do the best public work  it is quite striking she says in one of her letters to observe how much the useful power and influence of woman has developed of late years  unattached ladies such as widows and unmarried women have quite ample work to do in the world for the good of others to absorb all their powers  wives and mothers have a very noble work given them by god and want no more  the whole passage is extremely interesting and the phrase unattached ladies is quite delightful and reminds one of charles lamb        ismays children is by the clever authoress of that wonderful little story flitters tatters and the counsellor a story which delighted the realists by its truth fascinated mr ruskin by its beauty and remains to the present day the most perfect picture of streetarab life in all english prose fiction  the scene of the novel is laid in the south of ireland and the plot is extremely dramatic and ingenious  godfrey mauleverer a reckless young irishman runs away with ismay darcy a pretty penniless governess and is privately married to her in scotland some time after the birth of her third child ismay died and her husband who had never made his marriage public nor taken any pains to establish the legitimacy of his children is drowned while yachting off the coast of france  the care of ismays children then devolves on an old aunt miss juliet darcy who brings them back to ireland to claim their inheritance for them  but a sudden stroke of paralysis deprives her of her memory and she forgets the name of the little scotch village in which ismays informal marriage took place  so tighe omalley holds barrettstown and ismays children live in an old mill close to the great park of which they are the rightful heirs  the boy who is called godfrey after his father is a fascinating study with his swarthy foreign beauty his fierce moods of love and hate his passionate pride and his passionate tenderness  the account of his midnight ride to warn his enemy of an impending attack of moonlighters is most powerful and spirited and it is pleasant to meet in modern fiction a character that has all the fine inconsistencies of life and is neither too fantastic an exception to be true nor too ordinary a type to be common  excellent also in its direct simplicity of rendering is the picture of miss juliet darcy and the scene in which at the moment of her death the old womans memory returns to her is quite admirable both in conception and in treatment  to me however the chief interest of the book lies in the little lifelike sketches of irish character with which it abounds modern realistic art has not yet produced a hamlet but at least it may claim to have studied guildenstern and rosencrantz very closely and for pure fidelity and truth to nature nothing could be better than the minor characters in ismays children  here we have the kindly old priest who arranges all the marriages in his parish and has a strong objection to people who insist on making long confessions the important young curate fresh from maynooth who gives himself more airs than a bishop and has to be kept in order the professional beggars with their devout faith their grotesque humour and their incorrigible laziness the shrewd shopkeeper who imports arms in flourbarrels for the use of the moonlighters and as soon as he has got rid of them gives information of their whereabouts to the police the young men who go out at night to be drilled by an irishamerican the farmers with their wild landhunger bidding secretly against each other for every vacant field the dispensary doctor who is always regretting that he has not got a trinity college degree the plain girls who want to go into convents the pretty girls who want to get married and the shopkeepers daughters who want to be thought young ladies  there is a whole pellmell of men and women a complete panorama of provincial life an absolutely faithful picture of the peasant in his own home  this note of realism in dealing with national types of character has always been a distinguishing characteristic of irish fiction from the days of miss edgeworth down to our own days and it is not difficult to see in ismays children some traces of the influence of castle rackrent  i fear however that few people read miss edgeworth nowadays though both scott and tourgenieff acknowledged their indebtedness to her novels and her style is always admirable in its clearness and precision        miss lefflerarnims statement in a lecture delivered recently at st saviours hospital that she had heard of instances where ladies were so determined not to exceed the fashionable measurement that they had actually held on to a crossbar while their maids fastened the fifteen inch corset has excited a good deal of incredulity but there is nothing really improbable in it  from the sixteenth century to our own day there is hardly any form of torture that has not been inflicted on girls and endured by women in obedience to the dictates of an unreasonable and monstrous fashion  in order to obtain a real spanish figure says montaigne what a gehenna of suffering will not women endure drawn in and compressed by great coches entering the flesh nay sometimes they even die thereof  a few days after my arrival at school mrs somerville tells us in her memoirs although perfectly straight and well made i was enclosed in stiff stays with a steel busk in front while above my frock bands drew my shoulders back till the shoulderblades met  then a steel rod with a semicircle which went under my chin was clasped to the steel busk in my stays  in this constrained state i and most of the younger girls had to prepare our lessons and in the life of miss edgeworth we read that being sent to a certain fashionable establishment she underwent all the usual tortures of backboards iron collars and dumbs and also because she was a very tiny person the unusual one of being hung by the neck to draw out the muscles and increase the growth a signal failure in her case  indeed instances of absolute mutilation and misery are so common in the past that it is unnecessary to multiply them but it is really sad to think that in our own day a civilised woman can hang on to a crossbar while her maid laces her waist into a fifteeninch circle  to begin with the waist is not a circle at all but an oval nor can there be any greater error than to imagine that an unnaturally small waist gives an air of grace or even of slightness to the whole figure  its effect as a rule is simply to exaggerate the width of the shoulders and the hips and those whose figures possess that stateliness which is called stoutness by the vulgar convert what is a quality into a defect by yielding to the silly edicts of fashion on the subject of tightlacing the fashionable english waist also is not merely far too small and consequently quite out of proportion to the rest of the figure but it is worn far too low down  i use the expression worn advisedly for a waist nowadays seems to be regarded as an article of apparel to be put on when and where one likes  a long waist always implies shortness of the lower limbs and from the artistic point of view has the effect of diminishing the height and i am glad to see that many of the most charming women in paris are returning to the idea of the directoire style of dress  this style is not by any means perfect but at least it has the merit of indicating the proper position of the waist  i feel quite sure that all english women of culture and position will set their faces against such stupid and dangerous practices as are related by miss lefflerarnim  fashions motto is il faut souffrir pour etre belle but the motto of art and of commonsense is il faut etre bete pour souffrir        talking of fashion a critic in the pall mall gazette expresses his surprise that i should have allowed an illustration of a hat covered with the bodies of dead birds to appear in the first number of the womans world and as i have received many letters on the subject it is only right that i should state my exact position in the matter  fashion is such an essential part of the mundus muliebris of our day that it seems to me absolutely necessary that its growth development and phases should be duly chronicled and the historical and practical value of such a record depends entirely upon its perfect fidelity to fact  besides it is quite easy for the children of light to adapt almost any fashionable form of dress to the requirements of utility and the demands of good taste  the sarah bernhardt teagown for instance figured in the present issue has many good points about it and the gigantic dressimprover does not appear to me to be really essential to the mode and though the postillion costume of the fancy dress ball is absolutely detestable in its silliness and vulgarity the socalled late georgian costume in the same plate is rather pleasing  i must however protest against the idea that to chronicle the development of fashion implies any approval of the particular forms that fashion may adopt        mrs craiks article on the condition of the english stage will i feel sure be read with great interest by all who are watching the development of dramatic art in this country  it was the last thing written by the author of john halifax gentleman and reached me only a few days before her lamented death  that the state of things is such as mrs craik describes few will be inclined to deny though for my own part i must acknowledge that i see more vulgarity than vice in the tendencies of the modern stage nor do i think it possible to elevate dramatic art by limiting its subjectmatter  on tue une litterature quand on lui interdit la verite humaine  as far as the serious presentation of life is concerned what we require is more imaginative treatment greater freedom from theatric language and theatric convention  it may be questioned also whether the consistent reward of virtue and punishment of wickedness be really the healthiest ideal for an art that claims to mirror nature  however it is impossible not to recognise the fine feeling that actuates every line of mrs craiks article and though one may venture to disagree with the proposed method one cannot but sympathise with the purity and delicacy of the thought and the high nobility of the aim        the french minister of education m spuller has paid racine a very graceful and appropriate compliment in naming after him the second college that has been opened in paris for the higher education of girls racine was one of the privileged few who was allowed to read the celebrated traite de leducation des filles before it appeared in print he was charged along with boileau with the task of revising the text of the constitution and rules of madame de maintenons great college it was for the demoiselles de st cyr that he composed athalie and he devoted a great deal of his time to the education of his own children  the lycee racine will no doubt become as important an institution as the lycee fenelon and the speech delivered by m spuller on the occasion of its opening was full of the happiest augury for the future  m spuller dwelt at great length on the value of goethes aphorism that the test of a good wife is her capacity to take her husbands place and to become a father to his children and mentioned that the thing that struck him most in america was the wonderful brooklyn bridge a superb titanic structure which was completed under the direction of the engineers wife the engineer himself having died while the building of the bridge was in progress  il me semble said m spuller que la femme de lingenieur du pont de brooklyn a realise la pensee de goethe et que non seulement elle est devenue un pere pour ses enfants mais un autre pere pour loeuvre admirable vraiment unique qui a immortalise le nom quelle portait avec son mari  m spuller also laid great stress on the necessity of a thoroughly practical education and was extremely severe on the bluestockings of literature  il ne sagit pas de former ici des femmes savantes  les femmes savantes ont ete marquees pour jamais par un des plus grands genies de notre race dune legere teinte de ridicule  non ce nest pas des femmes savantes que nous voulons ce sont tout simplement des femmes des femmes dignes de ce pays de france qui est la patrie du bons sens de la mesure et de la grace des femmes ayant la notion juste et le sens exquis du role qui doit leur appartenir dans la societe moderne  there is no doubt a great deal of truth in m spullers observations but we must not mistake a caricature for the reality  after all les precieuses ridicules contrasted very favourably with the ordinary type of womanhood of their day not merely in france but also in england and an uncritical love of sonnets is preferable on the whole to coarseness vulgarity and ignorance        i am glad to see that miss ramsays brilliant success at cambridge is not destined to remain an isolated instance of what women can do in intellectual competitions with men  at the royal university in ireland the literature scholarship of 100 pounds a year for five years has been won by miss story the daughter of a north of ireland clergyman  it is pleasant to be able to chronicle an item of irish news that has nothing to do with the violence of party politics or party feeling and that shows how worthy women are of that higher culture and education which has been so tardily and in some instances so grudgingly granted to them        the empress of japan has been ordering a whole wardrobe of fashionable dresses in paris for her own use and the use of her ladiesinwaiting the chrysanthemum the imperial flower of japan has suggested the tints of most of the empresss own gowns and in accordance with the colour schemes of other flowers the rest of the costumes have been designed  the same steamer however that carries out the masterpieces of m worth and m felix to the land of the rising sun also brings to the empress a letter of formal and respectful remonstrance from the english rational dress society  i trust that even if the empress rejects the sensible arguments of this important society her own artistic feeling may induce her to reconsider her resolution to abandon eastern for western costume        i hope that some of my readers will interest themselves in the ministering childrens league for which mr walter crane has done the beautiful and suggestive design of the young knight  the best way to make children good is to make them happy and happiness seems to me an essential part of lady meaths admirable scheme  1 gossips with girls and maidens betrothed and free  by lady bellairs blackwood and sons  2 a modern apostle and other poems  by constance naden  kegan paul  3 mrs somerville and mary carpenter  by phyllis browne author of what girls can do etc  cassell and co  4 ismays children  by the author of hogan mp flitters tatters and the counsellor etc  macmillan and co     aristotle at afternoon tea   pall mall gazette december 16 1887  in society says mr mahaffy every civilised man and woman ought to feel it their duty to say something even when there is hardly anything to be said and in order to encourage this delightful art of brilliant chatter he has published a social guide without which no debutante or dandy should ever dream of going out to dine  not that mr mahaffys book can be said to be in any sense of the word popular  in discussing this important subject of conversation he has not merely followed the scientific method of aristotle which is perhaps excusable but he has adopted the literary style of aristotle for which no excuse is possible there is also hardly a single anecdote hardly a single illustration and the reader is left to put the professors abstract rules into practice without either the examples or the warnings of history to encourage or to dissuade him in his reckless career  still the book can be warmly recommended to all who propose to substitute the vice of verbosity for the stupidity of silence  it fascinates in spite of its form and pleases in spite of its pedantry and is the nearest approach that we know of in modern literature to meeting aristotle at an afternoon tea  as regards physical conditions the only one that is considered by mr mahaffy as being absolutely essential to a good conversationalist is the possession of a musical voice  some learned writers have been of opinion that a slight stammer often gives peculiar zest to conversation but mr mahaffy rejects this view and is extremely severe on every eccentricity from a native brogue to an artificial catchword  with his remarks on the latter point the meaningless repetition of phrases we entirely agree nothing can be more irritating than the scientific person who is always saying exactly so or the commonplace person who ends every sentence with dont you know or the pseudoartistic person who murmurs charming charming on the smallest provocation  it is however with the mental and moral qualifications for conversation that mr mahaffy specially deals  knowledge he naturally regards as an absolute essential for as he most justly observes an ignorant man is seldom agreeable except as a butt  upon the other hand strict accuracy should be avoided  even a consummate liar says mr mahaffy is a better ingredient in a company than the scrupulously truthful man who weighs every statement questions every fact and corrects every inaccuracy  the liar at any rate recognises that recreation not instruction is the aim of conversation and is a far more civilised being than the blockhead who loudly expresses his disbelief in a story which is told simply for the amusement of the company  mr mahaffy however makes an exception in favour of the eminent specialist and tells us that intelligent questions addressed to an astronomer or a pure mathematician will elicit many curious facts which will pleasantly beguile the time  here in the interest of society we feel bound to enter a formal protest  nobody even in the provinces should ever be allowed to ask an intelligent question about pure mathematics across a dinnertable  a question of this kind is quite as bad as inquiring suddenly about the state of a mans soul a sort of coup which as mr mahaffy remarks elsewhere many pious people have actually thought a decent introduction to a conversation  as for the moral qualifications of a good talker mr mahaffy following the example of his great master warns us against any disproportionate excess of virtue  modesty for instance may easily become a social vice and to be continually apologising for ones ignorance or stupidity is a grave injury to conversation for what we want to learn from each member is his free opinion on the subject in hand not his own estimate of the value of that opinion  simplicity too is not without its dangers  the enfant terrible with his shameless love of truth the raw countrybred girl who always says what she means and the plain blunt man who makes a point of speaking his mind on every possible occasion without ever considering whether he has a mind at all are the fatal examples of what simplicity leads to  shyness may be a form of vanity and reserve a development of pride and as for sympathy what can be more detestable than the man or woman who insists on agreeing with everybody and so makes a discussion which implies differences in opinion absolutely impossible  even the unselfish listener is apt to become a bore  these silent people says mr mahaffy not only take all they can get in society for nothing but they take it without the smallest gratitude and have the audacity afterwards to censure those who have laboured for their amusement  tact which is an exquisite sense of the symmetry of things is according to mr mahaffy the highest and best of all the moral conditions for conversation  the man of tact he most wisely remarks will instinctively avoid jokes about blue beard in the company of a woman who is a mans third wife he will never be guilty of talking like a book but will rather avoid too careful an attention to grammar and the rounding of periods he will cultivate the art of graceful interruption so as to prevent a subject being worn threadbare by the aged or the inexperienced and should he be desirous of telling a story he will look round and consider each member of the party and if there be a single stranger present will forgo the pleasure of anecdotage rather than make the social mistake of hurting even one of the guests  as for prepared or premeditated art mr mahaffy has a great contempt for it and tells us of a certain college don let us hope not at oxford or cambridge who always carried a jestbook in his pocket and had to refer to it when he wished to make a repartee  great wits too are often very cruel and great humourists often very vulgar so it will be better to try and make good conversation without any large help from these brilliant but dangerous gifts  in a teteatete one should talk about persons and in general society about things  the state of the weather is always an excusable exordium but it is convenient to have a paradox or heresy on the subject always ready so as to direct the conversation into other channels  really domestic people are almost invariably bad talkers as their very virtues in home life have dulled their interest in outer things  the very best mothers will insist on chattering of their babies and prattling about infant education  in fact most women do not take sufficient interest in politics just as most men are deficient in general reading  still anybody can be made to talk except the very obstinate and even a commercial traveller may be drawn out and become quite interesting  as for society small talk it is impossible mr mahaffy tells us for any sound theory of conversation to depreciate gossip which is perhaps the main factor in agreeable talk throughout society  the retailing of small personal points about great people always gives pleasure and if one is not fortunate enough to be an arctic traveller or an escaped nihilist the best thing one can do is to relate some anecdote of prince bismarck or king victor emmanuel or mr gladstone  in the case of meeting a genius and a duke at dinner the good talker will try to raise himself to the level of the former and to bring the latter down to his own level  to succeed among ones social superiors one must have no hesitation in contradicting them  indeed one should make bold criticisms and introduce a bright and free tone into a society whose grandeur and extreme respectability make it mr mahaffy remarks as pathetically as inaccurately perhaps somewhat dull  the best conversationalists are those whose ancestors have been bilingual like the french and irish but the art of conversation is really within the reach of almost every one except those who are morbidly truthful or whose high moral worth requires to be sustained by a permanent gravity of demeanour and a general dulness of mind  these are the broad principles contained in mr mahaffys clever little book and many of them will no doubt commend themselves to our readers the maxim if you find the company dull blame yourself seems to us somewhat optimistic and we have no sympathy at all with the professional storyteller who is really a great bore at a dinnertable but mr mahaffy is quite right in insisting that no bright social intercourse is possible without equality and it is no objection to his book to say that it will not teach people how to talk cleverly  it is not logic that makes men reasonable nor the science of ethics that makes men good but it is always useful to analyse to formularise and to investigate  the only thing to be regretted in the volume is the arid and jejune character of the style  if mr mahaffy would only write as he talks his book would be much pleasanter reading  the principles of the art of conversation a social essay  by j p mahaffy  macmillan and co     early christian art in ireland   pall mall gazette december 17 1887  the want of a good series of popular handbooks on irish art has long been felt the works of sir william wilde petrie and others being somewhat too elaborate for the ordinary student so we are glad to notice the appearance under the auspices of the committee of council on education of miss margaret stokess useful little volume on the early christian art of her country  there is of course nothing particularly original in miss stokess book nor can she be said to be a very attractive or pleasing writer but it is unfair to look for originality in primers and the charm of the illustrations fully atones for the somewhat heavy and pedantic character of the style  this early christian art of ireland is full of interest to the artist the archaeologist and the historian  in its rudest forms such as the little iron handbell the plain stone chalice and the rough wooden staff it brings us back to the simplicity of the primitive christian church while to the period of its highest development we owe the great masterpieces of celtic metalwork  the stone chalice is now replaced by the chalice of silver and gold the iron bell has its jewelstudded shrine and the rough staff its gorgeous casing rich caskets and splendid bindings preserve the holy books of the saints and instead of the rudely carved symbol of the early missionaries we have such beautiful works of art as the processional cross of cong abbey  beautiful this cross certainly is with its delicate intricacy of ornamentation its grace of proportion and its marvel of mere workmanship nor is there any doubt about its history  from the inscriptions on it which are corroborated by the annals of innisfallen and the book of clonmacnoise we learn that it was made for king turlough oconnor by a native artist under the superintendence of bishop oduffy its primary object being to enshrine a portion of the true cross that was sent to the king in 1123 brought to cong some years afterwards probably by the archbishop who died there in 1150 it was concealed at the time of the reformation but at the beginning of the present century was still in the possession of the last abbot and at his death it was purchased by professor maccullagh and presented by him to the museum of the royal irish academy  this wonderful work is alone well worth a visit to dublin but not less lovely is the chalice of ardagh a twohandled silver cup absolutely classical in its perfect purity of form and decorated with gold and amber and crystal and with varieties of cloisonne and champleve enamel  there is no mention of this cup or of the socalled tara brooch in ancient irish history  all that we know of them is that they were found accidentally the former by a boy who was digging potatoes near the old rath of ardagh the latter by a poor child who picked it up near the seashore  they both however belong probably to the tenth century  of all these works as well as of the bell shrines bookcovers sculptured crosses and illuminated designs in manuscripts excellent pictures are given in miss stokess handbook  the extremely interesting fiachal phadrig or shrine of st patricks tooth might have been figured and noted as an interesting example of the survival of ornament and one of the old miniatures of the scribe or evangelist writing would have given an additional interest to the chapter on irish mss  on the whole however the book is wonderfully well illustrated and the ordinary art student will be able to get some useful suggestions from it indeed miss stokes echoing the aspirations of many of the great irish archaeologists looks forward to the revival of a native irish school in architecture sculpture metalwork and painting  such an aspiration is of course very laudable but there is always a danger of these revivals being merely artificial reproductions and it may be questioned whether the peculiar forms of irish ornamentation could be made at all expressive of the modern spirit  a recent writer on house decoration has gravely suggested that the british householder should take his meals in a celtic diningroom adorned with a dado of ogham inscriptions and such wicked proposals may serve as a warning to all who fancy that the reproduction of a form necessarily implies a revival of the spirit that gave the form life and meaning and who fail to recognise the difference between art and anachronisms  miss stokess proposal for an arkshaped church in which the mural painter is to repeat the arcades and follow the architectural compositions of the grand pages of the eusebian canons in the book of kells has of course nothing grotesque about it but it is not probable that the artistic genius of the irish people will even when the land has rest find in such interesting imitations its healthiest or best expression  still there are certain elements of beauty in ancient irish art that the modern artist would do well to study  the value of the intricate illuminations in the book of kells as far as their adaptability to modern designs and modern material goes has been very much overrated but in the ancient irish torques brooches pins clasps and the like the modern goldsmith will find a rich and comparatively speaking an untouched field and now that the celtic spirit has become the leaven of our politics there is no reason why it should not contribute something to our decorative art  this result however will not be obtained by a patriotic misuse of old designs and even the most enthusiastic home ruler must not be allowed to decorate his diningroom with a dado of oghams  early christian art in ireland  by margaret stokes  published for the committee of council on education by chapman and hall     literary and other notesiii   womans world january 1888  madame ristoris etudes et souvenirs is one of the most delightful books on the stage that has appeared since lady martins charming volume on the shakespearian heroines  it is often said that actors leave nothing behind them but a barren name and a withered wreath that they subsist simply upon the applause of the moment that they are ultimately doomed to the oblivion of old playbills and that their art in a word dies with them and shares their own mortality  chippendale the cabinet maker says the clever author of obiter dicta is more potent than garrick the actor  the vivacity of the latter no longer charms save in boswell the chairs of the former still render rest impossible in a hundred homes  this view however seems to me to be exaggerated  it rests on the assumption that acting is simply a mimetic art and takes no account of its imaginative and intellectual basis  it is quite true of course that the personality of the player passes away and with it that pleasuregiving power by virtue of which the arts exist  yet the artistic method of a great actor survives  it lives on in tradition and becomes part of the science of a school  it has all the intellectual life of a principle  in england at the present moment the influence of garrick on our actors is far stronger than that of reynolds on our painters of portraits and if we turn to france it is easy to discern the tradition of talma but where is the tradition of david  madame ristoris memoirs then have not merely the charm that always attaches to the autobiography of a brilliant and beautiful woman but have also a definite and distinct artistic value  her analysis of the character of lady macbeth for instance is full of psychological interest and shows us that the subtleties of shakespearian criticism are not necessarily confined to those who have views on weak endings and rhyming tags but may also be suggested by the art of acting itself  the author of obiter dicta seeks to deny to actors all critical insight and all literary appreciation  the actor he tells us is arts slave not her child and lives entirely outside literature with its words for ever on his lips and none of its truths engraven on his heart  but this seems to me to be a harsh and reckless generalisation  indeed so far from agreeing with it i would be inclined to say that the mere artistic process of acting the translation of literature back again into life and the presentation of thought under the conditions of action is in itself a critical method of a very high order nor do i think that a study of the careers of our great english actors will really sustain the charge of want of literary appreciation  it may be true that actors pass too quickly away from the form in order to get at the feeling that gives the form beauty and colour and that where the literary critic studies the language the actor looks simply for the life and yet how well the great actors have appreciated that marvellous music of words which in shakespeare at any rate is so vital an element of poetic power if indeed it be not equally so in the case of all who have any claim to be regarded as true poets  the sensual life of verse says keats in a dramatic criticism published in the champion springs warm from the lips of kean and to one learned in shakespearian hieroglyphics learned in the spiritual portion of those lines to which kean adds a sensual grandeur his tongue must seem to have robbed the hybla bees and left them honeyless  this particular feeling of which keats speaks is familiar to all who have heard salvini sarah bernhardt ristori or any of the great artists of our day and it is a feeling that one cannot i think gain merely by reading the passage to oneself  for my own part i must confess that it was not until i heard sarah bernhardt in phedre that i absolutely realised the sweetness of the music of racine  as for mr birrells statement that actors have the words of literature for ever on their lips but none of its truths engraved on their hearts all that one can say is that if it be true it is a defect which actors share with the majority of literary critics  the account madame ristori gives of her own struggles voyages and adventures is very pleasant reading indeed  the child of poor actors she made her first appearance when she was three months old being brought on in a hamper as a new years gift to a selfish old gentleman who would not forgive his daughter for having married for love  as however she began to cry long before the hamper was opened the comedy became a farce to the immense amusement of the public  she next appeared in a mediaeval melodrama being then three years of age and was so terrified at the machinations of the villain that she ran away at the most critical moment  however her stagefright seems to have disappeared and we find her playing silvio pellicos francesco da rimini at fifteen and at eighteen making her debut as marie stuart  at this time the naturalism of the french method was gradually displacing the artificial elocution and academic poses of the italian school of acting  madame ristori seems to have tried to combine simplicity with style and the passion of nature with the selfrestraint of the artist jai voulu fondre les deux manieres she tells us car je sentais que toutes choses etant susceptibles de progres lart dramatique aussi etait appele a subir des transformations  the natural development however of the italian drama was almost arrested by the ridiculous censorship of plays then existing in each town under austrian or papal rule  the slightest allusion to the sentiment of nationality or the spirit of freedom was prohibited  even the word patria was regarded as treasonable and madame ristori tells us an amusing story of the indignation of a censor who was asked to license a play in which a dumb man returns home after an absence of many years and on his entrance upon the stage makes gestures expressive of his joy in seeing his native land once more  gestures of this kind said the censor are obviously of a very revolutionary tendency and cannot possibly be allowed  the only gestures that i could think of permitting would be gestures expressive of a dumb mans delight in scenery generally  the stage directions were accordingly altered and the word landscape substituted for native land  another censor was extremely severe on an unfortunate poet who had used the expression the beautiful italian sky and explained to him that the beautiful lombardovenetian sky was the proper official expression to use  poor gregory in romeo and juliet had to be rechristened because gregory is a name dear to the popes and the     here i have a pilots thumb    wrecked as homeward he did come  of the first witch in macbeth was ruthlessly struck out as containing an obvious allusion to the steersman of st peters bark  finally bored and bothered by the political and theological dogberrys of the day with their inane prejudices their solemn stupidity and their entire ignorance of the conditions necessary for the growth of sane and healthy art madame ristori made up her mind to leave the stage  she however was extremely anxious to appear once before a parisian audience paris being at that time the centre of dramatic activity and after some consideration left italy for france in the year 1855  there she seems to have been a great success particularly in the part of myrrha classical without being cold artistic without being academic she brought to the interpretation of the character of alfieris great heroine the colour element of passion the formelement of style  jules janin was loud in his praises the emperor begged ristori to join the troupe of the comedie francaise and rachel with the strange narrow jealousy of her nature trembled for her laurels  myrrha was followed by marie stuart and marie stuart by medea  in the latter part madame ristori excited the greatest enthusiasm  ary scheffer designed her costumes for her and the niobe that stands in the uffizzi gallery at florence suggested to madame ristori her famous pose in the scene with the children  she would not consent however to remain in france and we find her subsequently playing in almost every country in the world from egypt to mexico from denmark to honolulu  her representations of classical plays seem to have been always immensely admired  when she played at athens the king offered to arrange for a performance in the beautiful old theatre of dionysos and during her tour in portugal she produced medea before the university of coimbra  her description of the latter engagement is extremely interesting  on her arrival at the university she was received by the entire body of the undergraduates who still wear a costume almost mediaeval in character  some of them came on the stage in the course of the play as the handmaidens of creusa hiding their black beards beneath heavy veils and as soon as they had finished their parts they took their places gravely among the audience to madame ristoris horror still in their greek dress but with their veils thrown back and smoking long cigars  ce nest pas la premiere fois she says que jai du empecher par un effort de volonte la tragedie de se terminer en farce  very interesting also is her account of the production of montanellis camma and she tells an amusing story of the arrest of the author by the french police on the charge of murder in consequence of a telegram she sent to him in which the words body of the victim occurred  indeed the whole book is full of cleverly written stories and admirable criticisms on dramatic art  i have quoted from the french version which happens to be the one that lies before me but whether in french or italian the book is one of the most fascinating autobiographies that has appeared for some time even in an age like ours when literary egotism has been brought to such an exquisite pitch of perfection        the new purgatory and other poems by miss e r chapman is in some respects a very remarkable little volume  it used to be said that women were too poetical by nature to make great poets too receptive to be really creative too well satisfied with mere feeling to search after the marble splendour of form  but we must not judge of womans poetic power by her achievements in days when education was denied to her for where there is no faculty of expression no art is possible  mrs browning the first great english poetess was also an admirable scholar though she may not have put the accents on her greek and even in those poems that seem most remote from classical life such as aurora leigh for instance it is not difficult to trace the fine literary influence of a classical training  since mrs brownings time education has become not the privilege of a few women but the inalienable inheritance of all and as a natural consequence of the increased faculty of expression thereby gained the women poets of our day hold a very high literary position curiously enough their poetry is as a rule more distinguished for strength than for beauty they seem to love to grapple with the big intellectual problems of modern life science philosophy and metaphysics form a large portion of their ordinary subjectmatter they leave the triviality of triolets to men and try to read the writing on the wall and to solve the last secret of the sphinx  hence robert browning not keats is their idol sordello moves them more than the ode on a grecian urn and all lord tennysons magic and music seems to them as nothing compared with the psychological subtleties of the ring and the book or the pregnant questions stirred in the dialogue between blougram and gigadibs  indeed i remember hearing a charming young girtonian forgetting for a moment the exquisite lyrics in pippa passes and the superb blank verse of men and women state quite seriously that the reason she admired the author of redcotton nightcap country was that he had headed a reaction against beauty in poetry  miss chapman is probably one of mr brownings disciples  she does not imitate him but it is easy to discern his influence on her verse and she has caught something of his fine strange faith  take for instance her poem a strongminded woman     see her  oh yescome this wayhush this way       here she is lying    sweetwith the smile her face wore yesterday       as she lay dying    calm the mindfever gone and praise god gone       all the hearthunger    looking the merest girl at fortyone       you guessed her younger    well shed the flowerbloom that children have       was lithe and pliant    with eyes as innocent blue as they were brave       resolved defiant    yourselfyou worship art  well at that shrine       she too bowed lowly    drank thirstily of beauty as of wine       proclaimed it holy    but could you follow her when in a breath       she knelt to science    vowing to truth true service to the death       and heartreliance    naythen for you she underwent eclipse       appeared as alien    as once before he prayed those ivory lips       seemed to pygmalion              hear from your heaven my dear my lost delight       you who were woman    to your hearts heart and not more pure more white       than warmly human    how shall i answer  how express reveal       your true lifestory    how utter if they cannot guessnot feel       your crowning glory    this way  attend my words  the rich we know       do into heaven    enter but hardly to the poor the low       gods kingdoms given    well theres another heavena heaven on earth       thats loves fruition    whereto a certain lacka certain dearth       gains best admission    here too she was too richah god if less       love had been lent her    into the realm of human happiness       these looknot enter  well here we have if not quite an echo at least a reminiscence of the metre of the grammarians funeral and the peculiar blending together of lyrical and dramatic forms seems essentially characteristic of mr brownings method  yet there is a distinct personal note running all through the poem and true originality is to be found rather in the use made of a model than in the rejection of all models and masters  dans lart comme dans la nature on est toujours fils de quelquun and we should not quarrel with the reed if it whispers to us the music of the lyre  a little child once asked me if it was the nightingale who taught the linnets how to sing  miss chapmans other poems contain a great deal that is interesting  the most ambitious is the new purgatory to which the book owes its title  it is a vision of a strange garden in which cleansed and purified of all stain and shame walk judas of cherioth nero the lord of rome ysabel the wife of ahab and others around whose names cling terrible memories of horror or awful splendours of sin  the conception is fine but the treatment is hardly adequate  there are however some good strong lines in it and indeed almost all of miss chapmans poems are worth reading if not for their absolute beauty at least for their intellectual intention        nothing is more interesting than to watch the change and development of the art of novelwriting in this nineteenth centurythis socalled nineteenth century as an impassioned young orator once termed it after a contemptuous diatribe against the evils of modern civilisation  in france they have had one great genius balzac who invented the modern method of looking at life and one great artist flaubert who is the impeccable master of style and to the influence of these two men we may trace almost all contemporary french fiction  but in england we have had no schools worth speaking of  the fiery torch lit by the brontes has not been passed on to other hands dickens has influenced only journalism thackerays delightful superficial philosophy superb narrative power and clever social satire have found no echoes nor has trollope left any direct successors behind hima fact which is not much to be regretted however as admirable though trollope undoubtedly is for rainy afternoons and tedious railway journeys from the point of view of literature he is merely the perpetual curate of pudlington parva  as for george meredith who could hope to reproduce him  his style is chaos illumined by brilliant flashes of lightning  as a writer he has mastered everything except language as a novelist he can do everything except tell a story as an artist he is everything except articulate  too strange to be popular too individual to have imitators the author of richard feverel stands absolutely alone  it is easy to disarm criticism but he has disarmed the disciple  he gives us his philosophy through the medium of wit and is never so pathetic as when he is humorous  to turn truth into a paradox is not difficult but george meredith makes all his paradoxes truths and no theseus can thread his labyrinth no oedipus solve his secret  however it is only fair to acknowledge that there are some signs of a school springing up amongst us  this school is not native nor does it seek to reproduce any english master  it may be described as the result of the realism of paris filtered through the refining influence of boston  analysis not action is its aim it has more psychology than passion and it plays very cleverly upon one string and this is the commonplace        as a reaction against this school it is pleasant to come across a novel like lady augusta noels hithersea mere  if this story has any definite defect it comes from its delicacy and lightness of treatment  an industrious bostonian would have made half a dozen novels out of it and have had enough left for a serial  lady augusta noel is content to vivify her characters and does not care about vivisection she suggests rather than explains and she does not seek to make life too obviously rational  romance picturesqueness charmthese are the qualities of her book  as for its plot it has so many plots that it is difficult to describe them  we have the story of rhona somerville the daughter of a great popular preacher who tries to write her fathers life and on looking over his papers and early diaries finds struggle where she expected calm and doubt where she looked for faith and is afraid to keep back the truth and yet dares not publish it  rhona is quite charming she is like a little flower that takes itself very seriously and she shows us how thoroughly nice and natural a narrowminded girl may be  then we have the two brothers john and adrian mowbray  john is the hardworking vigorous clergyman who is impatient of all theories brings his faith to the test of action not of intellect lives what he believes and has no sympathy for those who waver or questiona thoroughly admirable practical and extremely irritating man  adrian is the fascinating dilettante the philosophic doubter a sort of romantic rationalist with a taste for art  of course rhona marries the brother who needs conversion and their gradual influence on each other is indicated by a few subtle touches  then we have the curious story of olga adrian mowbrays first love  she is a wonderful and mystical girl like a little maiden out of the sagas with the blue eyes and fair hair of the north  an old norwegian nurse is always at her side a sort of lapland witch who teaches her how to see visions and to interpret dreams adrian mocks at this superstition as he calls it but as a consequence of disregarding it olgas only brother is drowned skating and she never speaks to adrian again  the whole story is told in the most suggestive way the mere delicacy of the touch making what is strange seem real  the most delightful character in the whole book however is a girl called hilary marston and hers also is the most tragic tale of all  hilary is like a little woodland faun half greek and half gipsy she knows the note of every bird and the haunt of every animal she is terribly out of place in a drawingroom but is on intimate terms with every young poacher in the district squirrels come and sit on her shoulder which is pretty and she carries ferrets in her pockets which is dreadful she never reads a book and has not got a single accomplishment but she is fascinating and fearless and wiser in her own way than any pedant or bookworm  this poor little english dryad falls passionately in love with a great blind helpless hero who regards her as a sort of pleasant tom boy and her death is most touching and pathetic  lady augusta noel has a charming and winning style her descriptions of nature are quite admirable and her book is one of the most pleasantlywritten novels that has appeared this winter  miss alice corkrans margery mertons girlhood has the same lightness of touch and grace of treatment  though ostensibly meant for young people it is a story that all can read with pleasure for it is true without being harsh and beautiful without being affected and its rejection of the stronger and more violent passions of life is artistic rather than ascetic  in a word it is a little piece of true literature as dainty as it is delicate and as sweet as it is simple  margery merton is brought up in paris by an old maiden aunt who has an elaborate theory of education and strict ideas about discipline  her system is an excellent one being founded on the science of darwin and the wisdom of solomon but it comes to terrible grief when put into practice and finally she has to procure a governess madame reville the widow of a great and unappreciated french painter  from her margery gets her first feeling for art and the chief interest of the book centres round a competition for an art scholarship into which margery and the other girls of the convent school enter  margery selects joan of arc as her subject and rather to the horror of the good nuns who think that the saint should have her golden aureole and be as gorgeous and as ecclesiastical as bright paints and bad drawing can make her the picture represents a common peasant girl standing in an old orchard and listening in ignorant terror to the strange voices whispering in her ear  the scene in which she shows her sketch for the first time to the art master and the mother superior is very cleverly rendered indeed and shows considerable dramatic power  of course a good deal of opposition takes place but ultimately margery has her own way and in spite of a wicked plot set on foot by a jealous competitor who persuades the mother superior that the picture is not margerys own work she succeeds in winning the prize  the whole account of the gradual development of the conception in the girls mind and the various attempts she makes to give her dream its perfect form is extremely interesting and indeed the book deserves a place among what sir george trevelyan has happily termed the artliterature of our day mr ruskin in prose and mr browning in poetry were the first who drew for us the workings of the artist soul the first who led us from the painting or statue to the hand that fashioned it and the brain that gave it life  they seem to have made art more expressive for us to have shown us a passionate humanity lying behind line and colour  theirs was the seed of this new literature and theirs too is its flower but it is pleasant to note their influence on miss corkrans little story in which the creation of a picture forms the dominant motif        mrs pfeiffers women and work is a collection of most interesting essays on the relation to health and physical development of the higher education of girls and the intellectual or more systematised effort of woman  mrs pfeiffer who writes a most admirable prose style deals in succession with the sentimental difficulty with the economic problem and with the arguments of physiologists  she boldly grapples with professor romanes whose recent article in the nineteenth century on the leading characters which mentally differentiate men and women attracted so much attention and produces some very valuable statistics from america where the influence of education on health has been most carefully studied  her book is a most important contribution to the discussion of one of the great social problems of our day  the extended activity of women is now an accomplished fact its results are on their trial and mrs pfeiffers excellent essays sum up the situation very completely and show the rational and scientific basis of the movement more clearly and more logically than any other treatise i have as yet seen        it is interesting to note that many of the most advanced modern ideas on the subject of the education of women are anticipated by defoe in his wonderful essay upon projects where he proposes that a college for women should be erected in every county in england and ten colleges of the kind in london  i have often thought of it he says as one of the most barbarous customs in the world that we deny the advantages of learning to women  their youth is spent to teach them to stitch and sew or make baubles  they are taught to read indeed and perhaps to write their names or so and that is the height of a womans education  and i would but ask any who slight the sex for their understanding what is a man a gentleman i mean good for that is taught no more  what has the woman done to forfeit the privilege of being taught  shall we upbraid women with folly when it is only the error of this inhuman custom that hindered them being made wiser  defoe then proceeds to elaborate his scheme for the foundation of womens colleges and enters into minute details about the architecture the general curriculum and the discipline  his suggestion that the penalty of death should be inflicted on any man who ventured to make a proposal of marriage to any of the girl students during term time possibly suggested the plot of lord tennysons princess so its harshness may be excused and in all other respects his ideas are admirable  i am glad to see that this curious little volume forms one of the national library series  in its anticipations of many of our most modern inventions it shows how thoroughly practical all dreamers are        i am sorry to see that mrs fawcett deprecates the engagement of ladies of education as dressmakers and milliners and speaks of it as being detrimental to those who have fewer educational advantages  i myself would like to see dressmaking regarded not merely as a learned profession but as a fine art  to construct a costume that will be at once rational and beautiful requires an accurate knowledge of the principles of proportion a thorough acquaintance with the laws of health a subtle sense of colour and a quick appreciation of the proper use of materials and the proper qualities of pattern and design  the health of a nation depends very largely on its mode of dress the artistic feeling of a nation should find expression in its costume quite as much as in its architecture and just as the upholstering tradesman has had to give place to the decorative artist so the ordinary milliner with her lack of taste and lack of knowledge her foolish fashions and her feeble inventions will have to make way for the scientific and artistic dress designer  indeed so far from it being wise to discourage women of education from taking up the profession of dressmakers it is exactly women of education who are needed and i am glad to see in the new technical college for women at bedford millinery and dressmaking are to be taught as part of the ordinary curriculum  there has also been started in london a society of lady dressmakers for the purpose of teaching educated girls and women and the scientific dress association is i hear doing very good work in the same direction        i have received some very beautiful specimens of christmas books from messrs griffith and farran  treasures of art and song edited by robert ellice mack is a real edition de luxe of pretty poems and pretty pictures and through the year is a wonderfully artistic calendar  messrs hildesheimer and faulkner have also sent me rhymes and roses illustrated by ernest wilson and st clair simmons cape town dicky a childs book with some very lovely pictures by miss alice havers a wonderful edition of the deserted village illustrated by mr charles gregory and mr hines and some really charming christmas cards those by miss alice havers miss edwards and miss dealy being especially good        the most perfect and the most poisonous of all modern french poets once remarked that a man can live for three days without bread but that no one can live for three days without poetry  this however can hardly be said to be a popular view or one that commends itself to that curiously uncommon quality which is called commonsense  i fancy that most people if they do not actually prefer a salmis to a sonnet certainly like their culture to repose on a basis of good cookery and as there is something to be said for this attitude i am glad to see that several ladies are interesting themselves in cookery classes  mrs marshalls brilliant lectures are of course well known and besides her there is madame lebourfawssett who holds weekly classes in kensington  madame fawssett is the author of an admirable little book entitled economical french cookery for ladies and i am glad to hear that her lectures are so successful  i was talking the other day to a lady who works a great deal at the east end of london and she told me that no small part of the permanent misery of the poor is due to their entire ignorance of the cleanliness and economy necessary for good cooking        the popular ballad concert society has been reorganised under the name of the popular musical union  its object will be to train the working classes thoroughly in the enjoyment and performance of music and to provide the inhabitants of the crowded districts of the east end with concerts and oratorios to be performed as far as possible by trained members of the working classes and though money is urgently required it is proposed to make the society to a certain degree selfsupporting by giving something in the form of highclass concerts in return for subscriptions and donations  the whole scheme is an excellent one and i hope that the

faulkner     the poets corneriv   pall mall gazette january 20 1888  a cynical critic once remarked that no great poet is intelligible and no little poet worth understanding but that otherwise poetry is an admirable thing  this however seems to us a somewhat harsh view of the subject  little poets are an extremely interesting study  the best of them have often some new beauty to show us and though the worst of them may bore yet they rarely brutalise  poor folks lives for instance by the rev frederick langbridge is a volume that could do no possible harm to any one  these poems display a healthy rollicking g r sims tone of feeling an almost unbounded regard for the converted drunkard and a strong sympathy with the sufferings of the poor  as for their theology it is of that honest downright and popular kind which in these rationalistic days is probably quite as useful as any other form of theological thought  here is the opening of a poem called a street sermon which is an interesting example of what muscular christianity can do in the sphere of versemaking     what god fight shy of the city       hes t other side up i guess    if you ever want to find him       whitechapels the right address  those who prefer pseudopoetical prose to really prosaic poetry will wish that mr dalziel had converted most of his pictures in the fire into leaders for the daily telegraph as from the literary point of view they have all the qualities dear to the asiatic school  what a splendid leader the young lions of fleet street would have made out of the prestige of england for instance a poem suggested by the opening of the zulu war in 1879     now away sail our ships far away oer the sea       far away with our gallant and brave    the loud warcry is sounding like wild revelrie       and our heroes dash on to their grave    for the fierce zulu tribes have arisen in their might       and in thousands swept down on our few    but these braves only yielded when crushed in the fight       man to man to their colours were true  the conception of the warcry sounding like wild revelrie is quite in the true asiatic spirit and indeed the whole poem is full of the daring english of a special correspondent  personally we prefer mr dalziel when he is not quite so military  the fairies for instance is a very pretty poem and reminds us of some of dicky doyles charming drawings and nat bentley is a capital ballad in its way  the irish poems however are rather vulgar and should be expunged  the celtic element in literature is extremely valuable but there is absolutely no excuse for shrieking shillelagh and o gorrah  women must weep by professor harald williams has the most dreadful cover of any book that we have come across for some time past  it is possibly intended to symbolise the sorrow of the world but it merely suggests the decorative tendencies of an undertaker and is as depressing as it is detestable  however as the cowl does not make the monk so the binding in the case of the savile club school does not make the poet and we open the volume without prejudice  the first poem that we come to is a vigorous attack on those wicked and misguided people who believe that beauty is its own reason for existing and that art should have no other aim but her own perfection  here are some of the professors gravest accusations     why do they patch in their fatal choice       when at secrets such the angels quake    but a play of the vision and the voice       oh its all for arts sake     why do they gather what should be left       and leave behind what they ought to take    and exult in the basest blank or theft       oh its all for arts sake  it certainly must be admitted that to patch or to exult in the basest blank is a form of conduct quite unbefitting an artist the very obscurity and incomprehensible character of such a crime adding something to its horror  however while fully recognising the wickedness of patching we cannot but think that professor harald williams is happier in his criticism of life than he is in his art criticism  his poem between the banks for instance has a touch of sincerity and fine feeling that almost atones for its overemphasis  mr buchans blank verse drama joseph and his brethren bears no resemblance to that strange play on the same subject which mr swinburne so much admires  indeed it may be said to possess all the fatal originality of inexperience  however mr buchan does not leave us in any doubt about his particular method of writing  as to the dialogue he says i have put the language of real life into the mouths of the speakers except when they may be supposed to be under strong emotion then their utterances become more rapidbrokenfigurativein short more poetical  well here is the speech of potiphars wife under strong emotion     zuleekha seizing him  love me or death    ha dost thou think thou wilt not and yet live    by isis no  and thou wilt turn away    iron marble mockman  ah  i hold thy life    love feeds on death  it swallows up all life    hugging or killing  i to woo and thou    unhappy me  oh  the language here is certainly rapid and broken and the expression marble mockman is we suppose figurative but the passage can scarcely be described as poetical though it fulfils all mr buchans conditions still tedious as zuleekha and joseph are the chorus of ancients is much worse  these ideal spectators seem to spend their lives in uttering those solemn platitudes that with the aged pass for wisdom  the chief offenders are the members of what mr buchan calls the 2ndsemichorus who have absolutely no hesitation in interrupting the progress of the play with observations of this kind     2ndsemichorus     ah but favour extreme shown to one       among equals who yet stand apart          awakeneth say ye if naturally             the demonsjealousy envy hate          in the breast of those passed by  it is a curious thing that when minor poets write choruses to a play they should always consider it necessary to adopt the style and language of a bad translator  we fear that mr bohn has much to answer for  gods garden is a wellmeaning attempt to use nature for theological and educational purposes  it belongs to that antiquated school of thought that in spite of the discoveries of modern science invites the sluggard to look at the ant and the idle to imitate the bee  it is full of false analogies and dull eighteenthcentury didactics  it tells us that the flowering cactus should remind us that a dwarf may possess mental and moral qualities that the mountain ash should teach us the precious fruits of affliction and that a fond father should learn from the example of the chestnut that the most beautiful children often turn out badly  we must admit that we have no sympathy with this point of view and we strongly protest against the idea that     the flaming poppy with its black core tells    of angers flushing face and heart of sin  the worst use that man can make of nature is to turn her into a mirror for his own vices nor are natures secrets ever disclosed to those who approach her in this spirit  however the author of this irritating little volume is not always botanising and moralising in this reckless and improper fashion  he has better moments and those who sympathise with the duke of westminsters efforts to provide open spaces for the people will no doubt join in the aspiration     god bless wise grosvenors whose hearts incline    workmen to fete and grateful souls refine  though they may regret that so noble a sentiment is expressed in so inadequate a form  it is difficult to understand why mr cyrus thornton should have called his volume voices of the street  however poets have a perfect right to christen their own children and if the wine is good no one should quarrel with the bush  mr thorntons verse is often graceful and melodious and some of his lines such as     and the wise old roman bondsman saw no terror in the dead    children when the play was over going softly home to bed  have a pleasant tennysonian ring  the ballad of the old year is rather depressing  bury the old year solemnly has been said far too often and the sentiment is suitable only for christmas crackers  the best thing in the book is the poets vision of death which is quite above the average  mrs dobell informs us that she has already published sixteen volumes of poetry and that she intends to publish two more  the volume that now lies before us is entitled in the watches of the night most of the poems that it contains having been composed in the neighbourhood of the sea between the hours of ten and two oclock  judging from the following extract we cannot say that we consider this a very favourable time for inspiration at any rate in the case of mrs dobell     were anthony trollope and george eliot    alivewhich unfortunately they are not    as regards the subject of quacksnubbing you know    to support me i am sure they hadnt

respects a really remarkable work of art  its tragic element is to be found in life not in death in the heros psychological development not in his moral declension or in any physical calamity and the author has borrowed from modern science the idea that in the evolutionary struggle for existence the true tragedy may be that of the survivor  canute the rough generous viking finds himself alienated from his gods his forefathers his very dreams  with centuries of pagan blood in his veins he sets himself to the task of becoming a great christian governor and lawgiver to men and yet he is fully conscious that while he has abandoned the noble impulses of his race he still retains that which in his nature is most fierce or fearful  it is not by faith that he reaches the new creed nor through gentleness that he seeks after the new culture  the beautiful christian woman whom he has made queen of his life and lands teaches him no mercy and knows nothing of forgiveness  it is sin and not suffering that purifies himmere sin itself  be not afraid he says in the last great scene of the play        be not afraid    i have learnt this sin is a mighty bond    twixt god and man  love that has neer forgiven    is virgin and untender spousal passion    becomes acquainted with lifes vilest things    transmutes them and exalts  oh wonderful    this touch of pardonall the shame cast out    the heart aripple with the gaiety    the leaping consciousness that heaven knows all    and yet esteems us royal  think of it    the joy the hope  this strange and powerful conception is worked out in a manner as strong as it is subtle and indeed almost every character in the play seems to suggest some new psychological problem  the mere handling of the verse is essentially characteristic of our modern introspective method as it presents to us not thought in its perfected form but the involutions of thought seeking for expression  we seem to witness the very workings of the mind and to watch the passion struggling for utterance  in plays of this kind plays that are meant to be read not to be acted it must be admitted that we often miss that narrative and descriptive element which in the epic is so great a charm and indeed may be said to be almost essential to the perfect literary presentation of any story  this element the greek managed to retain by the introduction of chorus and messenger but we seem to have been unable to invent any substitute for it  that there is here a distinct loss cannot i think be denied  there is something harsh abrupt and inartistic in such a stagedirection as canute strangles edric flings his body into the stream and gazes out it strikes no dramatic note it conveys no picture it is meagre and inadequate  if acted it might be fine but as read it is unimpressive however there is no form of art that has not got its limitations and though it is sad to see the action of a play relegated to a formal footnote still there is undoubtedly a certain gain in psychological analysis and psychological concentration  it is a far cry from the knutlinga saga to rossettis notebook but michael field passes from one to the other without any loss of power indeed most readers will probably prefer the cup of water which is the second play in this volume to the earlier historical drama  it is more purely poetical and if it has less power it has certainly more beauty rossetti conceived the idea of a story in which a young king falls passionately in love with a little peasant girl who gives him a cup of water and is by her beloved in turn but being betrothed to a noble lady he yields her in marriage to his friend on condition that once a yearon the anniversary of their meetingshe brings him a cup of water the girl dies in childbirth leaving a daughter who grows into her mothers perfect likeness and comes to meet the king when he is hunting just however as he is about to take the cup from her hand a second figure in her exact likeness but dressed in peasants clothes steps to her side looks in the kings face and kisses him on the mouth  he falls forward on his horses neck and is lifted up dead  michael field has struck out the supernatural element so characteristic of rossettis genius and in some other respects modified for dramatic purposes material rossetti left unused  the result is a poem of exquisite and pathetic grace  cara the peasant girl is a creation as delicate as it is delightful and it deserves to rank beside the faun of callirhoe  as for the young king who loses all the happiness of his life through one noble moment of unselfishness and who recognised as he stands over caras dead body that        women are not chattels    to deal with as ones generosity    may prompt or straiten     and that        we must learn    to drink lifes pleasures if we would be pure  he is one of the most romantic figures in all modern dramatic work looked at from a purely technical point of view michael fields verse is sometimes lacking in music and has no sustained grandeur of movement but it is extremely dramatic and its method is admirably suited to express those swift touches of nature and sudden flashes of thought which are michael fields distinguishing qualities  as for the moral contained in these plays work that has the rich vitality of life has always something of lifes mystery also it cannot be narrowed down to a formal creed nor summed up in a platitude it has many answers and more than one secret        miss frances martins life of elizabeth gilbert is an extremely interesting book  elizabeth gilbert was born at a time when as her biographer reminds us kindly and intelligent men and women could gravely implore the almighty to take away a child merely because it was blind when they could argue that to teach the blind to read or to attempt to teach them to work was to fly in the face of providence and her whole life was given to the endeavour to overcome this prejudice and superstition to show that blindness though a great privation is not necessarily a disqualification and that blind men and women can learn labour and fulfil all the duties of life  before her day all that the blind were taught was to commit texts from the bible to memory  she saw that they could learn handicrafts and be made industrious and selfsupporting  she began with a small cellar in holborn at the rent of eighteenpence a week but before her death she could point to large and wellappointed workshops in almost every city of england where blind men and women are employed where tools have been invented by or modified for them and where agencies have been established for the sale of their work  the whole story of her life is full of pathos and of beauty  she was not born blind but lost her sight through an attack of scarlet fever when she was three years old  for a long time she could not realise her position and we hear of the little child making earnest appeals to be taken out of the dark room or to have a candle lighted and once she whispered to her father if i am a very good little girl may i see my doll tomorrow  however all memory of vision seems to have faded from her before she left the sickroom though taught by those around her she soon began to take an imaginary interest in colour and a very real one in form and texture  an old nurse is still alive who remembers making a pink frock for her when she was a child her delight at its being pink and her pleasure in stroking down the folds and when in 1835 the young princess victoria visited oxford with her mother bessie as she was always called came running home exclaiming oh mamma i have seen the duchess of kent and she had on a brown silk dress  her youthful admiration of wordsworth was based chiefly upon his love of flowers but also on personal knowledge  when she was about ten years old wordsworth went to oxford to receive the honorary degree of dcl from the university  he stayed with dr gilbert then principal of brasenose and won bessies heart the first day by telling at the dinner table how he had almost leapt off the coach in bagley wood to gather the blue veronica  but she had a better reason for remembering that visit one day she was in the drawingroom alone and wordsworth entered  for a moment he stood silent before the blind child the little sensitive face with its wondering inquiring look turned towards him  then he gravely said madam i hope i do not disturb you  she never forgot that madamgrave solemn almost reverential  as for the great practical work of her life the amelioration of the condition of the blind miss martin gives a wonderful account of her noble efforts and her noble success and the volume contains a great many interesting letters from eminent people of which the following characteristic note from mr ruskin is not the least interesting     denmark hill 2nd september 1871     madami am obliged by your letter and i deeply sympathise with the    objects of the institution over which you preside  but one of my main    principles of work is that every one must do their best and spend    their all in their own work and mine is with a much lower race of    sufferers than you plead forwith those who have eyes and see    noti am madam your faithful servant j ruskin  miss martin is a most sympathetic biographer and her book should be read by all who care to know the history of one of the remarkable women of our century        ourselves and our neighbours is a pleasant volume of social essays from the pen of one of the most graceful and attractive of all american poetesses mrs louise chandler moulton  mrs moulton who has a very light literary touch discusses every important modern problemfrom society rosebuds and old bachelors down to the latest fashions in bonnets and in sonnets  the best chapter in the book is that entitled the gospel of good gowns which contains some very excellent remarks on the ethics of dress  mrs moulton sums up her position in the following passage     the desire to please is a natural characteristic of unspoiled    womanhood  if i lived in the woods i should dress for the trees    said a woman widely known for taste and for culture  every womans    dress should be and if she has any ideality will be an expression of    herself     the true gospel of dress is that of fitness and taste    pictures are painted and music is written and flowers are fostered    that life may be made beautiful  let women delight our eyes like    pictures be harmonious as music and fragrant as flowers that they    also may fulfil their mission of grace and of beauty  by    companionship with beautiful thoughts shall their tastes be so formed    that their toilets will never be out of harmony with their means or    their position  they will be clothed almost as unconsciously as the    lilies of the field but each one will be herself and there will be    no more uniformity in their attire than in their faces  the modern dryad who is ready to dress for the trees seems to me a charming type but i hardly think that mrs moulton is right when she says that the woman of the future will be clothed almost as unconsciously as the lilies of the field  possibly however she means merely to emphasise the distinction between dressing and dressingup a distinction which is often forgotten        warring angels is a very sad and suggestive story  it contains no impossible heroine and no improbable hero but is simply a faithful transcript from life a truthful picture of men and women as they are darwin could not have enjoyed it as it does not end happily  there is at least no distribution of cakes and ale in the last chapter  but then scientific people are not always the best judges of literature they seem to think that the sole aim of art should be to amuse and had they been consulted on the subject would have banished melpomene from parnassus  it may be admitted however that not a little of our modern art is somewhat harsh and painful  our castaly is very salt with tears and we have bound the brows of the muses with cypress and with yew  we are often told that we are a shallow age yet we have certainly the saddest literature of all the ages for we have made truth and not beauty the aim of art and seem to value imitation more than imagination  this tendency is of course more marked in fiction than it is in poetry beauty of form is always in itself a source of joy the mere technique of verse has an imaginative and spiritual element and life must to a certain degree be transfigured before it can find its expression in music  but ordinary fiction rejecting the beauty of form in order to realise the facts of life seems often to lack the vital element of delight to miss that pleasuregiving power in virtue of which the arts exist  it would not however be fair to regard warring angels simply as a specimen of literary photography  it has a marked distinction of style a definite grace and simplicity of manner  there is nothing crude in it though it is to a certain degree inexperienced nothing violent though it is often strong  the story it has to tell has frequently been told before but the treatment makes it new and lady flower for whose white soul the angels of good and evil are at war is admirably conceived and admirably drawn        a song of jubilee and other poems contains some pretty picturesque verses  its author is mrs de courcy laffan who under the name of mrs leith adams is well known as a novelist and story writer  the jubilee ode is quite as good as most of the jubilee odes have been and some of the short poems are graceful  this from the first butterfly is pretty     o little bird without a song  i love    thy silent presence floating in the light    a living perfect thing when scarcely yet    the snowwhite blossom crawls along the wall    and not a daisy shows its starlike head    amid the grass  miss bella duffys life of madame de stael forms part of that admirable eminent women series which is so well edited by mr john h ingram there is nothing absolutely new in miss duffys book but this was not to be expected  unpublished correspondence that delight of the eager biographer is not to be had in the case of madame de stael the de broglie family having either destroyed or successfully concealed all the papers which might have revealed any facts not already in the possession of the world  upon the other hand the book has the excellent quality of condensation and gives us in less than two hundred pages a very good picture of madame de stael and her day  miss duffys criticism of corinne is worth quoting     corinne is a classic of which everybody is bound to speak with    respect  the enormous admiration which it exacted at the time of its    appearance may seem somewhat strange in this year of grace but then    it must be remembered that italy was not the overwritten country it    has since become  besides this madame de stael was the most    conspicuous personage of her day  except chateaubriand she had    nobody to dispute with her the palm of literary glory in france  her    exile her literary circle her courageous opinions had kept the eyes    of europe fixed on her for years so that any work from her pen was    sure to excite the liveliest curiosity     corinne is a kind of glorified guidebook with some of the qualities    of a good novel  it is very long winded but the appetite of the age    was robust in that respect and the highlystrung emotions of the hero    and heroine could not shock a taste which had been formed by the    sorrows of werther  it is extremely moral deeply sentimental and of    a deadly earnestnessthree characteristics which could not fail to    recommend it to a dreary and ponderous generation the most deficient    in taste that ever trod the earth     but it is artistic in the sense that the interest is concentrated from    first to last on the central figure and the drama such as it is    unfolds itself naturally from its starting point which is the    contrast between the characters of oswald and corinne  the dreary and ponderous generation the most deficient in taste that ever trod the earth seems to me a somewhat exaggerated mode of expression but glorified guidebook is a not unfelicitous description of the novel that once thrilled europe  miss duffy sums up her opinion of madame de stael as a writer in the following passage     her mind was strong of grasp and wide in range but continuous effort    fatigued it  she could strike out isolated sentences alternately    brilliant exhaustive and profound but she could not link them to    other sentences so as to form an organic whole  her thought was    definite singly but vague as a whole  she always saw things    separately and tried to combine them arbitrarily and it is generally    difficult to follow out any idea of hers from its origin to its end    her thoughts are like pearls of price profusely scattered or    carelessly strung together but not set in any design  on closing one    of her books the reader is left with no continuous impression  he    has been dazzled and delighted enlightened also by flashes but the    horizons disclosed have vanished again and the outlook is enriched by    no new vistas     then she was deficient in the higher qualities of the imagination  she    could analyse but not characterise construct but not create  she    could take one defect like selfishness or one passion like love and    display its workings or she could describe a whole character like    napoleons with marvellous penetration but she could not make her    personages talk or act like human beings  she lacked pathos and had    no sense of humour  in short hers was a mind endowed with enormous    powers of comprehension and an amazing richness of ideas but    deficient in perception of beauty in poetry and in true originality    she was a great social personage but her influence on literature was    not destined to be lasting because in spite of foreseeing too much    she had not the true prophetic sense of proportion and confused the    things of the present with those of the futurethe accidental with    the enduring  i cannot but think that in this passage miss duffy rather underrates madame de staels influence on the literature of the nineteenth century it is true that she gave our literature no new form but she was one of those who gave it a new spirit and the romantic movement owes her no small debt  however a biography should be read for its pictures more than for its criticisms and miss duffy shows a remarkable narrative power and tells with a good deal of esprit the wonderful adventures of the brilliant woman whom heine termed a whirlwind in petticoats        mr harcourts reprint of john evelyns life of mrs godolphin is a welcome addition to the list of charming library books  mr harcourts grandfather the archbishop of york himself john evelyns greatgreat grandson inherited the manuscript from his distinguished ancestor and in 1847 entrusted it for publication to samuel wilberforce then bishop of oxford  as the book has been for a long time out of print this new edition is sure to awake fresh interest in the life of the noble and virtuous lady whom john evelyn so much admired  margaret godolphin was one of the queens maids of honour at the court of charles ii and was distinguished for the delicate purity of her nature as well as for her high intellectual attainments  some of the extracts evelyn gives from her diary seem to show an austere formal almost ascetic spirit but it was inevitable that a nature so refined as hers should have turned in horror from such ideals of life as were presented by men like buckingham and rochester like etheridge killigrew and sedley like the king himself to whom she could scarcely bring herself to speak  after her marriage she seems to have become happier and brighter and her early death makes her a pathetic and interesting figure in the history of the time  evelyn can see no fault in her and his life of her is the most wonderful of all panegyrics        amongst the maidsofhonour mentioned by john evelyn is frances jennings the elder sister of the great duchess of marlborough  miss jennings who was one of the most beautiful women of her day married first sir george hamilton brother of the author of the memoires de grammont and afterwards richard talbot who was made duke of tyrconnel by james ii williams successful occupation of ireland where her husband was lord deputy reduced her to poverty and obscurity and she was probably the first peeress who ever took to millinery as a livelihood  she had a dressmakers shop in the strand and not wishing to be detected sat in a white mask and a white dress and was known by the name of the white widow  i was reminded of the duchess when i read miss emily faithfulls admirable article in gralignani on ladies as shopkeepers  the most daring innovation in england at this moment says miss faithfull is the lady shopkeeper  at present but few people have had the courage to brave the current social prejudice  we draw such fine distinctions between the wholesale and retail traders that our cottonspinners calico makers and general merchants seem to think that they belong to a totally different sphere from which they look down on the lady who has had sufficient brains capital and courage to open a shop  but the old world moves faster than it did in former days and before the end of the nineteenth century it is probable that a gentlewoman will be recognised in spite of her having entered on commercial pursuits especially as we are growing accustomed to see scions of our noblest families on our stock exchange and in teamerchants houses one peer of the realm is now doing an extensive business in coals and another is a cab proprietor  miss faithfull then proceeds to give a most interesting account of the london dairy opened by the hon mrs maberley of madame isabels millinery establishment and of the wonderful work done by miss charlotte robinson who has recently been appointed decorator to the queen  about three years ago miss faithfull tells us miss robinson came to manchester and opened a shop in king street and regardless of that bugbear which terrifies most womenthe loss of social statusshe put up her own name over the door and without the least selfassertion quietly entered into competition with the sterner sex  the result has been eminently satisfactory  this year miss robinson has exhibited at saltaire and at manchester and next year she proposes to exhibit at glasgow and possibly at brussels  at first she had some difficulty in making people understand that her work is really commercial not charitable she feels that until a healthy public opinion is created women will pose as destitute ladies and never take a dignified position in any calling they adopt  gentlemen who earn their own living are not spoken of as destitute and we must banish this idea in connection with ladies who are engaged in an equally honourable manner  miss faithfull concludes her most valuable article as follows the more highly educated our women of business are the better for themselves their work and the whole community  many of the professions to which ladies have hitherto turned are overcrowded and when once the fear of losing social position is boldy disregarded it will be found that commercial life offers a variety of more or less lucrative employments to ladies of birth and capital who find it more congenial to their tastes and requirements to invest their money and spend their energies in a business which yields a fair return rather than sit at home content with a scanty pittance  i myself entirely agree with miss faithfull though i feel that there is something to be said in favour of the view put forward by lady shrewsbury in the womans world 289 and a great deal to be said in favour of mrs joyces scheme for emigration  mr walter besant if we are to judge from his last novel is of lady shrewsburys way of thinking        i hope that some of my readers will be interested in miss beatrice cranes little poem blushroses for which her father mr walter crane has done so lovely and graceful a design  mrs simon of birkdale park southport tells me that she offered a prize last term at her school for the best sonnet on any work of art  the poems were sent to professor dowden who awarded the prize to the youthful authoress of the following sonnet on mr wattss picture of hope     she sits with drooping form and fair bent head    lowbent to hear the faintlysounding strain    that thrills her with the sweet uncertain pain    of timid trust and restful tears unshed    around she feels vast spaces  awe and dread     encompass her    and the dark doubt she fain    would banish sees the shuddering fear remain    and ever presses near with stealthy tread     but not for ever will the misty space    close down upon her meeklypatient eyes    the steady light within them soon will ope    their heavy lids and then the

collection of press notices prefixed to the volume we learn that putnams magazine has found in it the simplicity and grace of naked grecian statues and that dr jos g cogswell lld has declared that it will live to be appreciated as long as the english language endures  remembering that prophecy is the most gratuitous form of error we will not attempt to argue with dr jos g cogswell lld but will content ourselves with protesting against such a detestable expression as naked grecian statues  if this be the literary style of the future the english language will not endure very long  as for the poem itself the best that one can say of it is that it is a triumph of conscientious industry  from an artistic point of view it is a very commonplace production indeed and we must protest against such blank verse as the following     from the hour i saw her first i was entranced    or embosomed in a charmed world circumscribed    by its proper circumambient atmosphere    herself its centre and wide pervading spirit    the air all beauty of colour held dissolved    and tints distilled as dew are shed by heaven  mr griffiths sonnets and other poems are very simple which is a good thing and very sentimental which is a thing not quite so good  as a general rule his verse is full of pretty echoes of other writers but in one sonnet he makes a distinct attempt to be original and the result is extremely depressing     earth wears her grandest robe by autumn spun    like some stout matron who of youth has run    the course     is the most dreadful simile we have ever come across even in poetry  mr griffiths should beware of originality  like beauty it is a fatal gift  imitators of mr browning are unfortunately common enough but imitators of mr and mrs browning combined are so very rare that we have read mr francis prevosts fires of green wood with great interest  here is a curious reproduction of the manner of aurora leigh     but spring that part at least our unchaste eyes    infer from some windblown philactery    it wears its breast bare alsochestnut buds    packd in white wool as though sent here from heaven    stretching wild stems to reach each climbing lark    that shouts against the fading stars  and here is a copy of mr brownings mannerisms  we do not like it quite so well        if another       save all bother    hold that perhaps loaves grow like parsnips       call the baker       heavens caretaker    live die death may show him where the farce nips       not i truly       he may duly    into church or churchday shunt god       chink his pocket       win your locket    down we go together to confront god  yet in spite of these ingenious caricatures there are some good poems or perhaps we should say some good passages in mr prevosts volume  the whitening of the thorntree for instance opens admirably and is in some respects a rather remarkable story  we have no doubt that some day mr prevost will be able to study the great masters without stealing from them  mr john cameron grant has christened himself englands empire poet and lest we should have any doubts upon the subject tells us that he dare not lie a statement which in a poet seems to show a great want of courage  protection and paperunionism are the gods of mr grants idolatry and his verse is full of such fine fallacies and masterly misrepresentations that he should be made laureate to the primrose league at once  such a stanza as     ask the ruined sugarworker if he loves the foreign beet    rather one can hear him answer would i see my children eat  would thrill any tory teaparty in the provinces and it would be difficult for the advocates of coercion to find a more appropriate or a more characteristic peroration for a stump speech than     we have not to do with justice right depends on point of view    the one question for our thought is whats our neighbour going to do  the hymn to the union jack also would make a capital leaflet for distribution in boroughs where the science of heraldry is absolutely unknown and the sonnet on mr gladstone is sure to be popular with all who admire violence and vulgarity in literature  it is quite worthy of thersites at his best  mr evanss caesar borgia is a very tedious tragedy  some of the passages are in the true ercles vein like the following     caesar starting up    help michelotto help  begone  begone    fiends torments devils  gandia  what gandia    o turn those staring eyes away  see  see    he bleeds to death  o fly  who are those fiends    that tug me by the throat  o  o  o  o  pauses  but as a rule the style is of a more commonplace character  the other poems in the volume are comparatively harmless though it is sad to find shakespeares bacchus with pink eyne reappearing as pinkyeyed silenus  the cross and the grail is a collection of poems on the subject of temperance  compared to real poetry these verses are as water unto wine but no doubt this was the effect intended  the illustrations are quite dreadful especially one of an angel appearing to a young man from chicago who seems to be drinking brown sherry  juvenal in piccadilly and the excellent mystery are two fierce social satires and like most satires they are the product of the corruption they pillory  the first is written on a very convenient principle  blank spaces are left for the names of the victims and these the reader can fill up as he wishes     mustblustergive the lie    wear the night outsneer  is an example of this anonymous method  it does not seem to us very effective  the excellent mystery is much better  it is full of clever epigrammatic lines and its wit fully atones for its bitterness  it is hardly a poem to quote but it is certainly a poem to read  the chronicle of mites is a mockheroic poem about the inhabitants of a decaying cheese who speculate about the origin of their species and hold learned discussions upon the meaning of evolution and the gospel according to darwin  this cheeseepic is a rather unsavoury production and the style is at times so monstrous and so realistic that the author should be called the gorgonzola of literature  1 salome  by j c heywood

problems in archaeology that seem to possess a real romantic interest and foremost among these is the question of the so called venus of melos  who is she this marble mutilated goddess whom gautier loved to whom heine bent his knee  what sculptor wrought her and for what shrine  whose hands walled her up in that rude niche where the melian peasant found her  what symbol of her divinity did she carry was it apple of gold or shield of bronze  where is her city and what was her name among gods and men  the last writer on this fascinating subject is mr stillman who in a most interesting book recently published in america claims that the work of art in question is no seaborn and foam born aphrodite but the very victory without wings that once stood in the little chapel outside the gates of the acropolis at athens  so long ago as 1826 that is to say six years after the discovery of the statue the venus hypothesis was violently attacked by millingen and from that time to this the battle of the archaeologists has never ceased  mr stillman who fights of course under millingens banner points out that the statue is not of the venus type at all being far too heroic in character to correspond to the greek conception of aphrodite at any period of their artistic development but that it agrees distinctly with certain well known statues of victory such as the celebrated victory of brescia the latter is in bronze is later and has the wings but the type is unmistakable and though not a reproduction it is certainly a recollection of the melian statue  the representation of victory on the coin of agathocles is also obviously of the melian type and in the museum of naples is a terracotta victory in almost the identical action and drapery  as for dumont durvilles statement that when the statue was discovered one hand held an apple and the other a fold of the drapery the latter is obviously a mistake and the whole evidence on the subject is so contradictory that no reliance can be placed on the statement made by the french consul and the french naval officers none of whom seems to have taken the trouble to ascertain whether the arm and hand now in the louvre were really found in the same niche as the statue at all  at any rate these fragments seem to be of extremely inferior workmanship and they are so imperfect that they are quite worthless as data for measure or opinion  so far mr stillman is on old ground  his real artistic discovery is this  in working about the acropolis of athens some years ago he photographed among other sculptures the mutilated victories in the temple of nike apteros the wingless victory the little ionic temple in which stood that statue of victory of which it was said that the athenians made her without wings that she might never leave athens  looking over the photographs afterwards when the impression of the comparatively diminutive size had passed he was struck with the close resemblance of the type to that of the melian statue  now this resemblance is so striking that it cannot be questioned by any one who has an eye for form  there are the same large heroic proportions the same ampleness of physical development and the same treatment of drapery and there is also that perfect spiritual kinship which to any true antiquarian is one of the most valuable modes of evidence  now it is generally admitted on both sides that the melian statue is probably attic in its origin and belongs certainly to the period between phidias and praxiteles that is to say to the age of scopas if it be not actually the work of scopas himself and as it is to scopas that these basreliefs have been always attributed the similarity of style can on mr stillmans hypothesis be easily accounted for  as regards the appearance of the statue in melos mr stillman points out that melos belonged to athens as late as she had any greek allegiance and that it is probable that the statue was sent there for concealment on the occasion of some siege or invasion  when this took place mr stillman does not pretend to decide with any degree of certainty but it is evident that it must have been subsequent to the establishment of the roman hegemony as the brickwork of the niche in which the statue was found is clearly roman in character and before the time of pausanias and pliny as neither of these antiquaries mentions the statue  accepting then the statue as that of the victory without wings mr stillman agrees with millingen in supposing that in her left hand she held a bronze shield the lower rim of which rested on the left knee where some marks of the kind are easily recognisable while with her right hand she traced or had just finished tracing the names of the great heroes of athens  valentins objection that if this were so the left thigh would incline outwards so as to secure a balance mr stillman meets partly by the analogy of the victory of brescia and partly by the evidence of nature herself for he has had a model photographed in the same position as the statue and holding a shield in the manner he proposes in his restoration  the result is precisely the contrary to that which valentin assumes  of course mr stillmans solution of the whole matter must not be regarded as an absolutely scientific demonstration  it is simply an induction in which a kind of artistic instinct not communicable or equally valuable to all people has had the greatest part but to this mode of interpretation archaeologists as a class have been far too indifferent and it is certain that in the present case it has given us a theory which is most fruitful and suggestive  the little temple of nike apteros has had as mr stillman reminds us a destiny unique of its kind  like the parthenon it was standing little more than two hundred years ago but during the turkish occupation it was razed and its stones all built into the great bastion which covered the front of the acropolis and blocked up the staircase to the propylaea  it was dug out and restored nearly every stone in its place by two german architects during the reign of otho and it stands again just as pausanias described it on the spot where old aegeus watched for the return of theseus from crete  in the distance are salamis and aegina and beyond the purple hills lies marathon  if the melian statue be indeed the victory without wings she had no unworthy shrine  there are some other interesting essays in mr stillmans book on the wonderful topographical knowledge of ithaca displayed in the odyssey and discussions of this kind are always interesting as long as there is no attempt to represent homer as the ordinary literary man but the article on the melian statue is by far the most important and the most delightful  some people will no doubt regret the possibility of the disappearance of the old name and as venus not as victory will still worship the stately goddess but there are others who will be glad to see in her the image and ideal of that spiritual enthusiasm to which athens owed her liberty and by which alone can liberty be won  on the track of ulysses together with an excursion in quest of the so called venus of melos  by w j stillman  houghton mifflin and co boston     literary and other notesv   womans world march 1888  the princess emily ruete of oman and zanzibar whose efforts to introduce women doctors into the east are so well known has just published a most interesting account of her life under the title of memoirs of an arabian princess  the princess is the daughter of the celebrated sejid said imam of mesket and sultan of zanzibar and her long residence in germany has given her the opportunity of comparing eastern with western civilisation  she writes in a very simple and unaffected manner and though she has many grievances against her brother the present sultan who seems never to have forgiven her for her conversion to christianity and her marriage with a german subject she has too much tact esprit and good humour to trouble her readers with any dreary record of family quarrels and domestic differences  her book throws a great deal of light on the question of the position of women in the east and shows that much of what has been written on this subject is quite inaccurate  one of the most curious passages is that in which the princess gives an account of her mother     my mother was a circassian by birth who in early youth had been torn    away from her home  her father had been a farmer and she had always    lived peacefully with her parents and her little brother and sister    war broke out suddenly and the country was overrun by marauding    bands  on their approach the family fled into an underground place    as my mother called itshe probably meant a cellar which is not    known in zanzibar  their place of refuge was however invaded by a    merciless horde the parents were slain and the children carried off    by three mounted arnauts     she came into my fathers possession when quite a child probably at    the tender age of seven or eight years as she cast her first tooth in    our house  she was at once adopted as playmate by two of my sisters    her own age with whom she was educated and brought up  together with    them she learnt to read which raised her a good deal above her    equals who as a rule became members of our family at the age of    sixteen or eighteen years or older still when they had outgrown    whatever taste they might once have had for schooling  she could    scarcely be called pretty but she was tall and shapely had black    eyes and hair down to her knees  of a very gentle disposition her    greatest pleasure consisted in assisting other people in looking    after and nursing any sick person in the house and i well remember    her going about with her books from one patient to another reading    prayers to them     she was in great favour with my father who never refused her    anything though she interceded mostly for others and when she came    to see him he always rose to meet her halfwaya distinction he    conferred but very rarely  she was as kind and pious as she was    modest and in all her dealings frank and open  she had another    daughter besides myself who had died quite young  her mental powers    were not great but she was very clever at needlework  she had always    been a tender and loving mother to me but this did not hinder her    from punishing me severely when she deemed it necessary     she had many friends at betilmtoni which is rarely to be met with    in an arab harem  she had the most unshaken and firmest trust in god    when i was about five years old i remember a fire breaking out in the    stables close by one night while my father was at his city residence    a false alarm spread over the house that we too were in imminent    danger upon which the good woman hastened to take me on her arm and    her big kuran we pronounce the word thus on the other and hurried    into the open air  on the rest of her possessions she set no value in    this hour of danger  here is a description of schesade the sultans second legitimate wife     she was a persian princess of entrancing beauty and of inordinate    extravagance  her little retinue was composed of one hundred and    fifty cavaliers all persians who lived on the ground floor with    them she hunted and rode in the broad dayrather contrary to arab    notions  the persian women are subjected to quite a spartan training    in bodily exercise they enjoy great liberty much more so than arab    women but they are also more rude in mind and action     schesade is said to have carried on her extravagant style of life    beyond bounds her dresses cut always after the persian fashion were    literally covered with embroideries of pearls  a great many of these    were picked up nearly every morning by the servants in her rooms    where she had dropped them from her garments but the princess would    never take any of these precious jewels back again  she did not only    drain my fathers exchequer most wantonly but violated many of our    sacred laws in fact she had only married him for his high station    and wealth and had loved some one else all the time  such a state of    things could of course only end in a divorce fortunately schesade    had no children of her own  there is a rumour still current among us    that beautiful schesade was observed some years after this event    when my father carried on war in persia and had the good fortune of    taking the fortress of bender abbas on the persian gulf heading her    troops and taking aim at the members of our family herself  another of the remarkable women mentioned by the princess was her stepmother azzebintzef who seems to have completely ruled the sultan and to have settled all questions of home and foreign policy while her greataunt the princess asche was regent of the empire during the sultans minority and was the heroine of the siege of mesket  of her the princess gives the following account     dressed in mans clothes she inspected the outposts herself at night    she watched and encouraged the soldiers in all exposed places and was    saved several times only by the speed of her horse in unforeseen    attacks  one night she rode out oppressed with care having just    received information that the enemy was about to attempt an entrance    into the city by means of bribery that night and with intent to    massacre all and now she went to convince herself of the loyalty of    her troops  very cautiously she rode up to a guard requesting to    speak to the akid the officer in charge and did all in her power    to seduce him from his duty by great offers of reward on the part of    the besiegers  the indignation of the brave man however completely    allayed her fears as to the fidelity of the troops but the experiment    nearly cost her her own life  the soldiers were about to massacre the    supposed spy on the spot and it required all her presence of mind to    make good her escape     the situation grew however to be very critical at mesket  famine at    last broke out and the people were wellnigh distracted as no    assistance or relief could be expected from without  it was therefore    decided to attempt a last sortie in order to die at least with glory    there was just sufficient powder left for one more attack but there    was no more lead for either guns or muskets  in this emergency the    regent ordered iron nails and pebbles to be used in place of balls    the guns were loaded with all the old iron and brass that could be    collected and she opened her treasury to have bullets made out of her    own silver dollars  every nerve was strained and the sally succeeded    beyond all hope  the enemy was completely taken by surprise and fled    in all directions leaving more than half their men dead and wounded    on the field  mesket was saved and delivered out of her deep    distress the brave woman knelt down on the battlefield and thanked    god in fervent prayer     from that time her government was a peaceful one and she ruled so    wisely that she was able to transfer to her nephew my father an    empire so unimpaired as to place him in a position to extend the    empire by the conquest of zanzibar  it is to my greataunt    therefore that we owe and not to an inconsiderable degree the    acquisition of this second empire  she too was an eastern woman  all through her book the princess protests against the idea that oriental women are degraded or oppressed and in the following passage she points out how difficult it is for foreigners to get any real information on the subject     the education of the children is left entirely to the mother whether    she be legitimate wife or purchased slave and it constitutes her    chief happiness  some fashionable mothers in europe shift this duty    on to the nurse and byandby on the governess and are quite    satisfied with looking up their children or receiving their visits    once a day  in france the child is sent to be nursed in the country    and left to the care of strangers  an arab mother on the other hand    looks continually after her children  she watches and nurses them    with the greatest affection and never leaves them as long as they may    stand in need of her motherly care for which she is rewarded by the    fondest filial love     if foreigners had more frequent opportunities to observe the    cheerfulness the exuberance of spirits even of eastern women they    would soon and more easily be convinced of the untruth of all those    stories afloat about the degraded oppressed and listless state of    their life  it is impossible to gain a true insight into the actual    domesticity in a few moments visit and the conversation carried on    on those formal occasions hardly deserves that name there is barely    more than the exchange of a few commonplace remarksand it is    questionable if even these have been correctly interpreted     notwithstanding his innate hospitality the arab has the greatest    possible objection to having his home pried into by those of another    land and creed  whenever therefore a european lady called on us    the enormous circumference of her hoops which were the fashion then    and took up the entire width of the stairs was the first thing to    strike us dumb with wonder after which the very meagre conversation    generally confined itself on both sides to the mysteries of different    costumes and the lady retired as wise as she was when she came after    having been sprinkled over with attar of roses and being the richer    for some parting presents  it is true she had entered a harem she    had seen the muchpitied oriental ladies though only through their    veils she had with her own eyes seen our dresses our jewellery the    nimbleness with which we sat down on the floorand that was all  she    could not boast of having seen more than any other foreign lady who    had called before her  she is conducted upstairs and downstairs and    is watched all the time  rarely she sees more than the    receptionroom and more rarely still can she guess or find out who    the veiled lady is with whom she conversed  in short she has had no    opportunity whatsoever of learning anything of domestic life or the    position of eastern women  no one who is interested in the social position of women in the east should fail to read these pleasantlywritten memoirs  the princess is herself a woman of high culture and the story of her life is as instructive as history and as fascinating as fiction        mrs oliphants makers of venice is an admirable literary pendant to the same writers charming book on florence though there is a wide difference between the beautiful tuscan city and the seacity of the adriatic  florence as mrs oliphant points out is a city full of memories of the great figures of the past  the traveller cannot pass along her streets without treading in the very traces of dante without stepping on soil made memorable by footprints never to be effaced  the greatness of the surroundings the palaces churches and frowning mediaeval castles in the midst of the city are all thrown into the background by the greatness the individuality the living power and vigour of the men who are their originators and at the same time their inspiring soul  but when we turn to venice the effect is very different we do not think of the makers of that marvellous city but rather of what they made  the idealised image of venice herself meets us everywhere the mother is not overshadowed by the too great glory of any of her sons in her records the city is everythingthe republic the worshipped ideal of a community in which every man for the common glory seems to have been willing to sink his own  we know that dante stood within the red walls of the arsenal and saw the galleys making and mending and the pitch flaming up to heaven petrarch came to visit the great mistress of the sea taking refuge there in this city true home of the human race from trouble war and pestilence outside and byron with his facile enthusiasms and fervent eloquence made his home for a time in one of the stately decaying palaces but with these exceptions no great poet has ever associated himself with the life of venice  she had architects sculptors and painters but no singer of her own  the arts through which she gave her message to the world were visible and imitative  mrs oliphant in her bright picturesque style tells the story of venice pleasantly and well  her account of the two bellinis is especially charming and the chapters on titian and tintoret are admirably written she concludes her interesting and useful history with the following words which are well worthy of quotation though i must confess that the alien modernisms trouble me not a little     the critics of recent days have had much to say as to the    deterioration of venice in her new activity and the introduction of    alien modernisms in the shape of steamboats and other new industrial    agents into her canals and lagoons  but in this adoption of every    new development of power venice is only proving herself the most    faithful representative of the vigorous republic of old  whatever    prejudice or angry love may say we cannot doubt that the michiels    the dandolos the foscari the great rulers who formed venice had    steamboats existed in their day serving their purpose better than    their barges and peati would have adopted them without hesitation    without a thought of what any critics might say  the wonderful new    impulse which has made italy a great power has justly put strength and    life before those old traditions of beauty which made her not only    the woman country of europe but a sort of odalisque trading upon    her charms rather than the nursing mother of a noble and independent    nation  that in her recoil from that somewhat degrading position she    may here and there have proved too regardless of the claims of    antiquity we need not attempt to deny the new spring of life in her    is too genuine and great to keep her entirely free from this evident    danger  but it is strange that any one who loves italy and sincerely    rejoices in her amazing resurrection should fail to recognise how    venial is this fault  miss mabel robinsons last novel the plan of campaign is a very powerful study of modern political life  as a concession to humanity each of the politicians is made to fall in love and the charm of their various romances fully atones for the soundness of the authors theory of rent  miss robinson dissects describes and discourses with keen scientific insight and minute observation  her style though somewhat lacking in grace is at its best simple and strong  richard talbot and elinor fetherston are admirably conceived and admirably drawn and the whole account of the murder of lord roeglass is most dramatic  a year in eden by harriet waters preston is a chronicle of new england life and is full of the elaborate subtlety of the american school of fiction  the eden in question is the little village of pierpont and the eve of this provincial paradise is a beautiful girl called monza middleton a fascinating fearless creature who brings ruin and misery on all who love her  miss preston writes an admirable prose style and the minor characters in the book are wonderfully lifelike and true  the englishwomans yearbook contains a really extraordinary amount of useful information on every subject connected with womans work  in the census taken in 1831 six years before the queen ascended the throne no occupation whatever was specified as appertaining to women except that of domestic service but in the census of 1881 the number of occupations mentioned as followed by women is upwards of three hundred and thirty the most popular occupations seem to be those of domestic service school teaching and dressmaking the lowest numbers on the list are those of bankers gardeners and persons engaged in scientific pursuits  besides these the yearbook makes mention of stockbroking and conveyancing as professions that women are beginning to adopt  the historical account of the literary work done by englishwomen in this century as given in the yearbook is curiously inadequate and the list of womens magazines is not complete but in all other respects the publication seems a most useful and excellent one        wordsworth in one of his interesting letters to lady beaumont says that it is an awful truth that there neither is nor can be any genuine enjoyment of poetry among nineteen out of twenty of those persons who live or wish to live in the broad light of the worldamong those who either are or are striving to make themselves people of consideration in society adding that the mission of poetry is to console the afflicted to add sunshine to daylight by making the happy happier to teach the young and the gracious of every age to see to think and feel and therefore to become more actively and securely virtuous  i am however rather disposed to think that the age in which we live is one that has a very genuine enjoyment of poetry though we may no longer agree with wordsworths ideas on the subject of the poets proper mission and it is interesting to note that this enjoyment manifests itself by creation even more than by criticism  to realise the popularity of the great poets one should turn to the minor poets and see whom they follow what master they select whose music they echo  at present there seems to be a reaction in favour of lord tennyson if we are to judge by rachel and other poems which is a rather remarkable little volume in its way  the poem that gives its title to the book is full of strong lines and good images and in spite of its tennysonian echoes there is something attractive in such verses as the following     day by day along the orient faintly glows the tender dawn    day by day the pearly dewdrops tremble on the upland lawn     day by day the star of morning pales before the coming ray    and the first faint streak of radiance brightens to the perfect day     day by day the rosebud gathers to itself from earth and sky    fragrant stores and ampler beauty lovelier form and deeper dye     day by day a richer crimson mantles in its glowing breast    every golden hour conferring some sweet grace that crowns the rest     and thou canst not tell the moment when the day ascends her throne    when the morning star hath vanished and the rose is fully blown     so each day fulfils its purpose calm unresting strong and sure    moving onward to completion doth the work of god endure     how unlike mans toil and hurry how unlike the noise the strife    all the pain of incompleteness all the weariness of life     ye look upward and take courage  he who leads the golden hours    feeds the birds and clothes the lily made these human hearts of    ours     knows their need and will supply it manna falling day by day    bread from heaven and food of angels all along the desert way  the secretary of the international technical college at bedford has issued a most interesting prospectus of the aims and objects of the institution  the college seems to be intended chiefly for ladies who have completed their ordinary course of english studies and it will be divided into two departments educational and industrial  in the latter classes will be held for various decorative and technical arts and for woodcarving etching and photography as well as sicknursing dressmaking cookery physiology poultryrearing and the cultivation of flowers  the curriculum certainly embraces a wonderful amount of subjects and i have no doubt that the college will supply a real want        the ladies employment society has been so successful that it has moved to new premises in park street grosvenor square where there are some very pretty and useful things for sale  the childrens smocks are quite charming and seem very inexpensive  the subscription to the society is one guinea a year and a commission of five per cent is charged on each thing sold        miss may morris whose exquisite needlework is well known has just completed a pair of curtains for a house in boston  they are amongst the most perfect specimens of modern embroidery that i have seen and are from miss morriss own design  i am glad to hear that miss morris has determined to give lessons in embroidery  she has a thorough knowledge of the art her sense of beauty is as rare as it is refined and her power of design is quite remarkable  mrs joplings lifeclasses for ladies have been such a success that a similar class has been started in chelsea by mr clegg wilkinson at the carlyle studios kings road  mr wilkinson who is a very brilliant young painter is strongly of opinion that life should be studied from life itself and not from that abstract presentation of life which we find in greek marblesa position which

brothers     the poets cornervi   pall mall gazette april 6 1888  david westren by mr alfred hayes is a long narrative poem in tennysonian blank verse a sort of serious novel set to music  it is somewhat lacking in actuality and the picturesque style in which it is written rather contributes to this effect lending the story beauty but robbing it of truth  still it is not without power and cultured verse is certainly a pleasanter medium for storytelling than coarse and common prose  the hero of the poem is a young clergyman of the muscular christian school     a lover of good cheer a bubbling source    of jest and tale a monarch of the gun    a dreader tyrant of the darting trout    than that bright bird whose azure lightning threads    the brooklets bowery windings the red fox    did well to seek the boulderstrewn hillside    when westren cheered her dappled foes the otter    had cause to rue the dawn when westrens form    loomed through the streaming bracken to waylay    her late return from plunder the rough pack    barking a jealous welcome round their friend  one day he meets on the river a lovely girl who is angling and helps her to land     a gallant fish all flashing in the sun    in silver mail inlaid with scarlet gems    his back thicksprinkled as a leopards hide    with rich brown spots and belly of bright gold  they naturally fall in love with each other and marry and for many years david westren leads a perfectly happy life  suddenly calamity comes upon him his wife and children die and he finds himself alone and desolate then begins his struggle  like job he cries out against the injustice of things and his own personal sorrow makes him realise the sorrow and misery of the world  but the answer that satisfied job does not satisfy him  he finds no comfort in contemplating leviathan     as if we lacked reminding of brute force    as if we never felt the clumsy hoof    as if the bulk of twenty million whales    were worth one pleading soul or all the laws    that rule the lifeless suns could soothe the sense    of outrage in a loving human heart    sublime majestic  ay but when our trust    totters and faith is shattered to the base    grand words will not uprear it  mr hayes states the problem of life extremely well but his solution is sadly inadequate both from a psychological and from a dramatic point of view  david westren ultimately becomes a mild unitarian a sort of pastoral stopford brooke with leanings towards positivism and we leave him preaching platitudes to a village congregation  however in spite of this commonplace conclusion there is a great deal in mr hayess poem that is strong and fine and he undoubtedly possesses a fair ear for music and a remarkable faculty of poetical expression  some of his descriptive touches of nature such as     in meeting woods whereon a film of mist    slept like the bloom upon the purple grape  are very graceful and suggestive and he will probably make his mark in literature  there is much that is fascinating in mr rennell rodds last volume the unknown madonna and other poems  mr rodd looks at life with all the charming optimism of a young man though he is quite conscious of the fact that a stray note of melancholy here and there has an artistic as well as a popular value he has a keen sense of the pleasurableness of colour and his verse is distinguished by a certain refinement and purity of outline though not passionate he can play very prettily with the words of passion and his emotions are quite healthy and quite harmless in excelsis the most ambitious poem in the book is somewhat too abstract and metaphysical and such lines as     lift thee oer thy here and now    look beyond thine i and thou  are excessively tedious  but when mr rodd leaves the problem of the unconditioned to take care of itself and makes no attempt to solve the mysteries of the ego and the nonego he is very pleasant reading indeed a mazurka of chopin is charming in spite of the awkwardness of the fifth line and so are the verses on assisi and those on san servolo at venice  these last have all the brilliancy of a clever pastel  the prettiest thing in the whole volume is this little lyric on spring     such blue of sky so palely fair    such glow of earth such lucid air    such purple on the mountain lines    such deep new verdure in the pines    the live light strikes the broken towers    the crocus bulbs burst into flowers    the sap strikes up the black vine stock    and the lizard wakes in the splintered rock    and the wheats young green peeps through the sod    and the heart is touched with a thought of god    the very silence seems to sing    it must be spring it must be spring  we do not care for palely fair in the first line and the repetition of the word strikes is not very felicitous but the grace of movement and delicacy of touch are pleasing  the wind by mr james ross is a rather gusty ode written apparently without any definite scheme of metre and not very impressive as it lacks both the strength of the blizzard and the sweetness of zephyr  here is the opening        the roaming tentless wind       no rest can ever find    from east and west and south and north    he is for ever driven forth       from the chill east    where fierce hyaenas seek their awful feast       from the warm west    by beams of glittring summer blest  nothing could be much worse than this and if the line where fierce hyaenas seek their awful feast is intended to frighten us it entirely misses its effect  the ode is followed by some sonnets which are destined we fear to be ludibria ventis  immortality even in the nineteenth century is not granted to those who rhyme awe and war together  mr isaac sharps saul of tarsus is an interesting and in some respects a fine poem     saul of tarsus silently    with a silent company    to damascus gates drew nigh              and his eyes too and his mien    were as are the eagles keen    all the man was aquiline  are two strong simple verses and indeed the spirit of the whole poem is dignified and stately  the rest of the volume however is disappointing  ordinary theology has long since converted its gold into lead and words and phrases that once touched the heart of the world have become wearisome and meaningless through repetition  if theology desires to move us she must rewrite her formulas  there is something very pleasant in coming across a poet who can apostrophise byron as        transcendent star    that gems the firmament of poesy  and can speak of longfellow as a mighty titan  reckless panegyrics of this kind show a kindly nature and a good heart and mr mackenzies highland daydreams could not possibly offend any one  it must be admitted that they are rather oldfashioned but this is usually the case with natural spontaneous verse  it takes a great artist to be thoroughly modern  nature is always a little behind the age  the story of the cross an attempt to versify the gospel narratives is a strange survival of the tate and brady school of poetry  mr nash who styles himself a humble soldier in the army of faith expresses a hope that his book may invigorate devotional feeling especially among the young to whom verse is perhaps more attractive than to their elders but we should be sorry to think that people of any age could admire such a paraphrase as the following     foxes have holes in which to slink for rest    the birds of air find shelter in the nest    but he the son of man and lord of all    has no abiding place his own to call  it is a curious fact that the worst work is always done with the best intentions and that people are never so trivial as when they take themselves very seriously  1 david westren  by alfred

sand   pall mall gazette april 14 1888  the biography of a very great man from the pen of a very ladylike writerthis is the best description we can give of m caros life of george sand  the late professor of the sorbonne could chatter charmingly about culture and had all the fascinating insincerity of an accomplished phrasemaker being an extremely superior person he had a great contempt for democracy and its doings but he was always popular with the duchesses of the faubourg as there was nothing in history or in literature that he could not explain away for their edification having never done anything remarkable he was naturally elected a member of the academy and he always remained loyal to the traditions of that thoroughly respectable and thoroughly pretentious institution  in fact he was just the sort of man who should never have attempted to write a life of george sand or to interpret george sands genius  he was too feminine to appreciate the grandeur of that large womanly nature too much of a dilettante to realise the masculine force of that strong and ardent mind  he never gets at the secret of george sand and never brings us near to her wonderful personality  he looks on her simply as a litterateur as a writer of pretty stories of country life and of charming if somewhat exaggerated romances  but george sand was much more than this  beautiful as are such books as consuelo and mauprat francois le champi and la mare au diable yet in none of them is she adequately expressed by none of them is she adequately revealed  as mr matthew arnold said many years ago we do not know george sand unless we feel the spirit which goes through her work as a whole  with this spirit however m caro has no sympathy  madame sands doctrines are antediluvian he tells us her philosophy is quite dead and her ideas of social regeneration are utopian incoherent and absurd  the best thing for us to do is to forget these silly dreams and to read teverino and le secretaire intime  poor m caro  this spirit which he treats with such airy flippancy is the very leaven of modern life  it is remoulding the world for us and fashioning our age anew  if it is antediluvian it is so because the deluge is yet to come if it is utopian then utopia must be added to our geographies  to what curious straits m caro is driven by his violent prejudices may be estimated by the fact that he tries to class george sands novels with the old chansons de geste the stories of adventure characteristic of primitive literatures whereas in using fiction as a vehicle of thought and romance as a means of influencing the social ideals of her age george sand was merely carrying out the traditions of voltaire and rousseau of diderot and of chateaubriand  the novel says m caro must be allied either to poetry or to science  that it has found in philosophy one of its strongest allies seems not to have occurred to him  in an english critic such a view might possibly be excusable  our greatest novelists such as fielding scott and thackeray cared little for the philosophy of their age  but coming as it does from a french critic the statement seems to show a strange want of recognition of one of the most important elements of french fiction  nor even in the narrow limits that he has imposed upon himself can m caro be said to be a very fortunate or felicitous critic  to take merely one instance out of many he says nothing of george sands delightful treatment of art and the artists life  and yet how exquisitely does she analyse each separate art and present it to us in its relation to life in consuelo she tells us of music in horace of authorship in le chateau des desertes of acting in les maitres mosaistes of mosaic work in le chateau de pictordu of portrait painting and in la daniella of the painting of landscape  what mr ruskin and mr browning have done for england she did for france  she invented an art literature  it is unnecessary however to discuss any of m caros minor failings for the whole effect of the book so far as it attempts to portray for us the scope and character of george sands genius is entirely spoiled by the false attitude assumed from the beginning and though the dictum may seem to many harsh and exclusive we cannot help feeling that an absolute incapacity for appreciating the spirit of a great writer is no qualification for writing a treatise on the subject  as for madame sands private life which is so intimately connected with her art for like goethe she had to live her romances before she could write them m caro says hardly anything about it  he passes it over with a modesty that almost makes one blush and for fear of wounding the susceptibilities of those grandes dames whose passions m paul bourget analyses with such subtlety he transforms her mother who was a typical french grisette into a very amiable and spirituelle milliner  it must be admitted that joseph surface himself could hardly show greater tact and delicacy though we ourselves must plead guilty to preferring madame sands own description of her as an enfant du vieux pave de paris  as regards the english version which is by m gustave masson it may be up to the intellectual requirements of the harrow schoolboys but it will hardly satisfy those who consider that accuracy lucidity and ease are essential to a good translation  its carelessness is absolutely astounding and it is difficult to understand how a publisher like mr routledge could have allowed such a piece of work to issue from his press  il descend avec le sourire dun machiavel appears as he descends into the smile of a machiavelli george sands remark to flaubert about literary style tu la consideres comme un but elle nest quun effet is translated you consider it an end it is merely an effort and such a simple phrase as ainsi le veut festhetique du roman is converted into so the aesthetes of the world would have it il faudra relacher mes economies is i will have to draw upon my savings not my economies will assuredly be relaxed cassures resineuses is not cleavages full of rosin and mme sand ne reussit que deux fois is hardly madame sand was not twice successful querelles decole does not mean school disputations ceux qui se font une sorte desthetique de lindifference absolue is not those of which the aesthetics seem to be an absolute indifference chimere should not be translated chimera nor lettres ineditees inedited letters ridicules means absurdities not ridicules and qui pourra definir sa pensee is not who can clearly despise her thought  m masson comes to grief over even such a simple sentence as elle setonna des fureurs qui accueillirent ce livre ne comprenant pas que lon haisse un auteur a travers son oeuvre which he translates she was surprised at the storm which greeted this book not understanding that the author is hated through his work  then passing over such phrases as substituted by religion instead of replaced by religion and vulgarisation where popularisation is meant we come to that most irritating form of translation the literal wordforword style  the stream excites itself by the declivity which it obeys is one of m massons finest achievements in this genre and it is an admirable instance of the influence of schoolboys on their masters  however it would be tedious to make a complete catalogue of slips so we will content ourselves by saying that m massons translation is not merely quite unworthy of himself but is also quite undeserved by the public nowadays the public has its feelings  george sand  by the late elme marie caro  translated by gustave masson ba assistant master harrow school  great french writers series routledge and sons     the poets cornervii   pall mall gazette october 24 1888  mr ian hamiltons ballad of hadji is undeniably clever  hadji is a wonderful arab horse that a reckless hunter rides to death in the pursuit of a wild boar and the moral of the poemfor there is a moralseems to be that an absorbing passion is a very dangerous thing and blunts the human sympathies  in the course of the chase a little child is drowned a brahmin maiden murdered and an aged peasant severely wounded but the hunter cares for none of these things and will not hear of stopping to render any assistance  some of the stanzas are very graceful notably one beginning     yeslike a bubble filled with smoke    the curdwhite moon upswimming broke    the vacancy of space  but such lines as the following which occur in the description of the fight with the boar     i hung as close as keepsake locket    on maiden breastbut from its socket    he wrenched my bridle arm  are dreadful and his brains festooned the thorn is not a very happy way of telling the reader how the boar died  all through the volume we find the same curious mixture of good and bad  to say that the sun kisses the earth with flamemoustachoed lip is awkward and uncouth and yet the poem in which the expression occurs has some pretty lines  mr ian hamilton should prune  pruning whether in the garden or in the study is a most healthy and useful employment  the volume is nicely printed but mr strangs frontispiece is not a great success and most of the tailpieces seem to have been designed without any reference to the size of the page  mr catty dedicates his book to the memory of wordsworth shelley coleridge and keatsa somewhat pompous signboard for such very ordinary wineand an inscription in golden letters on the cover informs us that his poems are addressed to the rising generation whom he tells us elsewhere he is anxious to initiate into the great comprehensive truth that virtue is no other than selfinterest deeply understood  in order to further this laudable aim he has written a very tedious blank verse poem which he calls the secret of content but it certainly does not convey that secret to the reader  it is heavy abstract and prosaic and shows how intolerably dull a man can be who has the best intentions and the most earnest beliefs  in the rest of the volume where mr catty does not take himself quite so seriously there are some rather pleasing things  the sonnet on shelleys room at university college would be admirable but for the unmusical character of the last line     green in the wizard arms    of the foambearded atlantic    an isle of old enchantment    a melancholy isle    enchanted and dreaming lies    and there by shannons flowing    in the moonlight spectrethin    the spectre erin sits     wail no more lonely one mother of exile wail no more    banshee of the worldno more    thy sorrows are the worlds thou art no more alone    thy wrongs the worlds  are the first and last stanzas of mr todhunters poem the banshee  to throw away the natural grace of rhyme from a modern song is as mr swinburne once remarked a wilful abdication of half the power and half the charm of verse and we cannot say that mr todhunter has given us much that consoles us for its loss  part of his poem reads like a translation of an old bardic song part of it like rough material for poetry and part of it like misshapen prose  it is an interesting specimen of poetic writing but it is not a perfect work of art  it is amorphous and inchoate and the same must be said of the two other poems the doom of the children of lir and the lamentation for the sons of turann  rhyme gives architecture as well as melody to song and though the lovely lutebuilded walls of thebes may have risen up to unrhymed choral metres we have had no modern amphion to work such wonders for us such a verse as     five were the chiefs who challenged    by their deeds the overkingship    bov derg the daghdas son ilbrac of assaroe    and lir of the white field in the plain of emain macha    and after them stood up midhir the proud who reigned    upon the hills of bri    of bri the loved of liath bri of the broken heart    and last was angus og all these had many voices    but for bov derg were most  has of course an archaeological interest but has no artistic value at all  indeed from the point of view of art the few little poems at the end of the volume are worth all the ambitious pseudoepics that mr todhunter has tried to construct out of celtic lore  a bacchic day is charming and the sonnet on the openair performance of the faithfull shepherdesse is most gracefully phrased and most happy in conception  mr peacock is an american poet and professor thomas danleigh supplee am phd frs who has written a preface to his poems of the plains and songs of the solitudes tells us that he is entitled to be called the laureate of the west  though a staunch republican mr peacock according to the enthusiastic professor is not ashamed of his ancestor king william of holland nor of his relatives lord and lady peacock who it seems are natives of scotland  he was brought up at zanesville muskingum co ohio where his father edited the zanesville aurora and he had an uncle who was a superior man and edited the wheeling intelligencer  his poems seem to be extremely popular and have been highly praised the professor informs us by victor hugo the saturday review and the commercial advertiser  the preface is the most amusing part of the book but the poems also are worth studying  the maniac the bandit chief and the outlaw can hardly be called light reading but we strongly recommend the poem on chicago     chicago great city of the west    all that wealth all that power invest    thou sprang like magic from the sand    as touched by the magicians wand  thou sprang is slightly depressing and the second line is rather obscure but we should not measure by too high a standard the untutored utterances of artless nature  the opening lines of the vendetta also deserve mention     when stars are glowing through days gloaming glow    reflecting from oceans deep mighty flow    at twilight when no grim shadows of night    like ghouls have stalked in wake of the light  the first line is certainly a masterpiece and indeed the whole volume is full of gems of this kind  the professor remarks in his elaborate preface that mr peacock frequently rises to the sublime and the two passages quoted above show how keenly critical is his taste in these matters and how well the poet deserves his panegyric  mr alexander skene smiths holiday recreations and other poems is heralded by a preface for which principal cairns is responsible principal cairns claims that the lifestory enshrined in mr smiths poems shows the wide diffusion of native fire and literary culture in all parts of scotland happily under higher auspices than those of mere poetic impulse  this is hardly a very felicitous way of introducing a poet nor can we say that mr smiths poems are distinguished by either fire or culture  he has a placid pleasant way of writing and indeed his verses cannot do any harm though he really should not publish such attempts at metrical versions of the psalms as the following     a septuagenarian       we frequently may see    an octogenarian       if one should live to be    he is a burden to himself       with weariness and woe    and soon he dies and off he flies       and leaveth all below  the literary culture that produced these lines is we fear not of a very high order  i study poetry simply as a fine art by which i may exercise my intellect and elevate my taste wrote the late mr george morine many years ago to a friend and the little posthumous volume that now lies before us contains the record of his quiet literary life  one of the sonnets that entitled sunset appeared in mr waddingtons anthology about ten years after mr morines death but this is the first time that his collected poems have been published  they are often distinguished by a grave and chastened beauty of style and their solemn cadences have something of the grand manner about them  the editor mr wilton to whom mr morine bequeathed his manuscripts seems to have performed his task with great tact and judgment and we hope that this little book will meet with the recognition that it deserves  1 the ballad of hadji and other poems  by ian hamilton  kegan paul  2

november 1888  mr alan coles carefullyedited translation of m lefebures history of embroidery and lace is one of the most fascinating books that has appeared on this delightful subject  m lefebure is one of the administrators of the musee des arts decoratifs at paris besides being a lace manufacturer and his work has not merely an important historical value but as a handbook of technical instruction it will be found of the greatest service by all needlewomen  indeed as the translator himself points out m lefebures book suggests the question whether it is not rather by the needle and the bobbin than by the brush the graver or the chisel that the influence of woman should assert itself in the arts  in europe at any rate woman is sovereign in the domain of artneedlework and few men would care to dispute with her the right of using those delicate implements so intimately associated with the dexterity of her nimble and slender fingers nor is there any reason why the productions of embroidery should not as mr alan cole suggests be placed on the same level with those of painting engraving and sculpture though there must always be a great difference between those purely decorative arts that glorify their own material and the more imaginative arts in which the material is as it were annihilated and absorbed into the creation of a new form  in the beautifying of modern houses it certainly must be admittedindeed it should be more generally recognised than it isthat rich embroidery on hangings and curtains portieres couches and the like produces a far more decorative and far more artistic effect than can be gained from our somewhat wearisome english practice of covering the walls with pictures and engravings and the almost complete disappearance of embroidery from dress has robbed modern costume of one of the chief elements of grace and fancy  that however a great improvement has taken place in english embroidery during the last ten or fifteen years cannot i think be denied  it is shown not merely in the work of individual artists such as mrs holiday miss may morris and others but also in the admirable productions of the south kensington school of embroidery the bestindeed the only really goodschool that south kensington has produced  it is pleasant to note on turning over the leaves of m lefebures book that in this we are merely carrying out certain old traditions of early english art  in the seventh century st ethelreda first abbess of the monastery of ely made an offering to st cuthbert of a sacred ornament she had worked with gold and precious stones and the cope and maniple of st cuthbert which are preserved at durham are considered to be specimens of opus anglicanum  in the year 800 the bishop of durham allotted the income of a farm of two hundred acres for life to an embroideress named eanswitha in consideration of her keeping in repair the vestments of the clergy in his diocese  the battle standard of king alfred was embroidered by danish princesses and the anglosaxon gudric gave alcuid a piece of land on condition that she instructed his daughter in needlework  queen mathilda bequeathed to the abbey of the holy trinity at caen a tunic embroidered at winchester by the wife of one alderet and when william presented himself to the english nobles after the battle of hastings he wore a mantle covered with anglosaxon embroideries which is probably m lefebure suggests the same as that mentioned in the inventory of the bayeux cathedral where after the entry relating to the broderie a telle representing the conquest of england two mantles are describedone of king william all of gold powdered with crosses and blossoms of gold and edged along the lower border with an orphrey of figures  the most splendid example of the opus anglicanum now in existence is of course the syon cope at the south kensington museum but english work seems to have been celebrated all over the continent  pope innocent iv so admired the splendid vestments worn by the english clergy in 1246 that he ordered similar articles from cistercian monasteries in england  st dunstan the artistic english monk was known as a designer for embroideries and the stole of st thomas a becket is still preserved in the cathedral at sens and shows us the interlaced scrollforms used by anglosaxon ms illuminators  how far this modern artistic revival of rich and delicate embroidery will bear fruit depends of course almost entirely on the energy and study that women are ready to devote to it but i think that it must be admitted that all our decorative arts in europe at present have at least this element of strengththat they are in immediate relationship with the decorative arts of asia  wherever we find in european history a revival of decorative art it has i fancy nearly always been due to oriental influence and contact with oriental nations  our own keenly intellectual art has more than once been ready to sacrifice real decorative beauty either to imitative presentation or to ideal motive  it has taken upon itself the burden of expression and has sought to interpret the secrets of thought and passion  in its marvellous truth of presentation it has found its strength and yet its weakness is there also  it is never with impunity that an art seeks to mirror life  if truth has her revenge upon those who do not follow her she is often pitiless to her worshippers  in byzantium the two arts metgreek art with its intellectual sense of form and its quick sympathy with humanity oriental art with its gorgeous materialism its frank rejection of imitation its wonderful secrets of craft and colour its splendid textures its rare metals and jewels its marvellous and priceless traditions  they had indeed met before but in byzantium they were married and the sacred tree of the persians the palm of zoroaster was embroidered on the hem of the garments of the western world  even the iconoclasts the philistines of theological history who in one of those strange outbursts of rage against beauty that seem to occur only amongst european nations rose up against the wonder and magnificence of the new art served merely to distribute its secrets more widely and in the liber pontificalis written in 687 by athanasius the librarian we read of an influx into rome of gorgeous embroideries the work of men who had arrived from constantinople and from greece  the triumph of the mussulman gave the decorative art of europe a new departurethat very principle of their religion that forbade the actual representation of any object in nature being of the greatest artistic service to them though it was not of course strictly carried out  the saracens introduced into sicily the art of weaving silken and golden fabrics and from sicily the manufacture of fine stuffs spread to the north of italy and became localised in genoa florence venice and other towns  a still greater artmovement took place in spain under the moors and saracens who brought over workmen from persia to make beautiful things for them  m lefebure tells us of persian embroidery penetrating as far as andalusia and almeria like palermo had its hotel des tiraz which rivalled the hotel des tiraz at bagdad tiraz being the generic name for ornamental tissues and costumes made with them  spangles those pretty little discs of gold silver or polished steel used in certain embroidery for dainty glinting effects were a saracenic invention and arabic letters often took the place of letters in the roman characters for use in inscriptions upon embroidered robes and middle age tapestries their decorative value being so much greater  the book of crafts by etienne boileau provost of the merchants in 12581268 contains a curious enumeration of the different craftguilds of paris among which we find the tapiciers or makers of the tapis sarrasinois or saracen cloths who say that their craft is for the service only of churches or great men like kings and counts and indeed even in our own day nearly all our words descriptive of decorative textures and decorative methods point to an oriental origin  what the inroads of the mohammedans did for sicily and spain the return of the crusaders did for the other countries of europe  the nobles who left for palestine clad in armour came back in the rich stuffs of the east and their costumes pouches aumonieres sarrasinoises and caparisons excited the admiration of the needleworkers of the west  matthew paris says that at the sacking of antioch in 1098 gold silver and priceless costumes were so equally distributed among the crusaders that many who the night before were famishing and imploring relief suddenly found themselves overwhelmed with wealth and robert de clair tells us of the wonderful fetes that followed the capture of constantinople  the thirteenth century as m lefebure points out was conspicuous for an increased demand in the west for embroidery  many crusaders made offerings to churches of plunder from palestine and st louis on his return from the first crusade offered thanks at st denis to god for mercies bestowed on him during his six years absence and travel and presented some richly embroidered stuffs to be used on great occasions as coverings to the reliquaries containing the relics of holy martyrs  european embroidery having thus become possessed of new materials and wonderful methods developed on its own intellectual and imitative lines inclining as it went on to the purely pictorial and seeking to rival painting and to produce landscapes and figuresubjects with elaborate perspective and subtle aerial effects  a fresh oriental influence however came through the dutch and the portuguese and the famous compagnie des grandes indes and m lefebure gives an illustration of a doorhanging now in the cluny museum where we find the french fleursdelys intermixed with indian ornament  the hangings of madame de maintenons room at fontainebleau which were embroidered at st cyr represent chinese scenery upon a jonquilyellow ground  clothes were sent out ready cut to the east to be embroidered and many of the delightful coats of the period of louis xv and louis xvi owe their dainty decoration to the needles of chinese artists  in our own day the influence of the east is strongly marked  persia has sent us her carpets for patterns and cashmere her lovely shawls and india her dainty muslins finely worked with gold thread palmates and stitched over with iridescent beetles wings  we are beginning now to dye by oriental methods and the silk robes of china and japan have taught us new wonders of colourcombination and new subtleties of delicate design  whether we have yet learned to make a wise use of what we have acquired is less certain  if books produce an effect this book of m lefebure should certainly make us study with still deeper interest the whole question of embroidery and by those who already work with their needles it will be found full of most fertile suggestion and most admirable advice  even to read of the marvellous works of embroidery that were fashioned in bygone ages is pleasant  time has kept a few fragments of greek embroidery of the fourth century bc for us  one is figured in m lefebures booka chainstitch embroidery of yellow flax upon a mulberry coloured worsted material with graceful spirals and palmettopatterns and another a tapestried cloth powdered with ducks was reproduced in the womans world some months ago for an article by mr alan cole 334a now and then we find in the tomb of some dead egyptian a piece of delicate work  in the treasury at ratisbon is preserved a specimen of byzantine embroidery on which the emperor constantine is depicted riding on a white palfrey and receiving homage from the east and west  metz has a red silk cope wrought with great eagles the gift of charlemagne and bayeux the needlewrought epic of queen matilda  but where is the great crocuscoloured robe wrought for athena on which the gods fought against the giants  where is the huge velarium that nero stretched across the colosseum at rome on which was represented the starry sky and apollo driving a chariot drawn by steeds  how one would like to see the curious tablenapkins wrought for heliogabalus on which were displayed all the dainties and viands that could be wanted for a feast or the mortuarycloth of king chilperic with its three hundred golden bees or the fantastic robes that excited the indignation of the bishop of pontus and were embroidered with lions panthers bears dogs forests rocks huntersall in fact that painters can copy from nature  charles of orleans had a coat on the sleeves of which were embroidered the verses of a song beginning madame je suis tout joyeux the musical accompaniment of the words being wrought in gold thread and each note of square shape in those days formed with four pearls 334b the room prepared in the palace at rheims for the use of queen joan of burgundy was decorated with thirteen hundred and twentyone papegauts parrots made in broidery and blazoned with the kings arms and five hundred and sixtyone butterflies whose wings were similarly ornamented with the queens armsthe whole worked in fine gold  catherine de medicis had a mourningbed made for her of black velvet embroidered with pearls and powdered with crescents and suns  its curtains were of damask with leafy wreaths and garlands figured upon a gold and silver ground and fringed along the edges with broideries of pearls and it stood in a room hung with rows of the queens devices in cut black velvet on cloth of silver  louis xiv had goldembroidered caryatides fifteen feet high in his apartment  the statebed of sobieski king of poland was made of smyrna gold brocade embroidered in turquoises and pearls with verses from the koran its supports were of silvergilt beautifully chased and profusely set with enamelled and jewelled medallions  he had taken it from the turkish camp before vienna and the standard of mahomet had stood under it  the duchess de la ferte wore a dress of reddishbrown velvet the skirt of which adjusted in graceful folds was held up by big butterflies made of dresden china the front was a tablier of cloth of silver upon which was embroidered an orchestra of musicians arranged in a pyramidal group consisting of a series of six ranks of performers with beautiful instruments wrought in raised needlework into the night go one and all as mr henley sings in his charming ballade of dead actors  many of the facts related by m lefebure about the embroiderers guilds are also extremely interesting  etienne boileau in his book of crafts to which i have already alluded tells us that a member of the guild was prohibited from using gold of less value than eight sous about 6s the skein he was bound to use the best silk and never to mix thread with silk because that made the work false and bad  the test or trial piece prescribed for a worker who was the son of a masterembroiderer was a single figure a sixth of the natural size to be shaded in gold whilst one not the son of a master was required to produce a complete incident with many figures  the book of crafts also mentions cuttersout and stencillers and illuminators amongst those employed in the industry of embroidery  in 1551 the parisian corporation of embroiderers issued a notice that for the future the colouring in representations of nude figures and faces should be done in three or four gradations of carnation dyed silk and not as formerly in white silks  during the fifteenth century every household of any position retained the services of an embroiderer by the year  the preparation of colours also whether for painting or for dyeing threads and textile fabrics was a matter which m lefebure points out received close attention from the artists of the middle ages  many undertook long journeys to obtain the more famous recipes which they filed subsequently adding to and correcting them as experience dictated  nor were great artists above making and supplying designs for embroidery  raphael made designs for francis i and boucher for louis xv and in the ambras collection at vienna is a superb set of sacerdotal robes from designs by the brothers van eyck and their pupils early in the sixteenth century books of embroidery designs were produced and their success was so great that in a few years french german italian flemish and english publishers spread broadcast books of design made by their best engravers  in the same century in order to give the designers opportunity of studying directly from nature jean robin opened a garden with conservatories in which he cultivated strange varieties of plants then but little known in our latitudes  the rich brocades and brocadelles of the time are characterised by the introduction of large flowery patterns with pomegranates and other fruits with fine foliage  the second part of m lefebures book is devoted to the history of lace and though some may not find it quite as interesting as the earlier portion it will more than repay perusal and those who still work in this delicate and fanciful art will find many valuable suggestions in it as well as a large number of exceedingly beautiful designs  compared to embroidery lace seems comparatively modern  m lefebure and mr alan cole tell us that there is no reliable or documentary evidence to prove the existence of lace before the fifteenth century  of course in the east light tissues such as gauzes muslins and nets were made at very early times and were used as veils and scarfs after the manner of subsequent laces and women enriched them with some sort of embroidery or varied the openness of them by here and there drawing out threads  the threads of fringes seem also to have been plaited and knotted together and the borders of one of the many fashions of roman toga were of open reticulated weaving  the egyptian museum at the louvre has a curious network embellished with glass beads and the monk reginald who took part in opening the tomb of st cuthbert at durham in the twelfth century writes that the saints shroud had a fringe of linen threads an inch long surmounted by a border worked upon the threads with representations of birds and pairs of beasts there being between each such pair a branching tree a survival of the palm of zoroaster to which i have before alluded  our authors however do not in these examples recognise lace the production of which involves more refined and artistic methods and postulates a combination of skill and varied execution carried to a higher degree of perfection  lace as we know it seems to have had its origin in the habit of embroidering linen  white embroidery on linen has m lefebure remarks a cold and monotonous aspect that with coloured threads is brighter and gayer in effect but is apt to fade in frequent washing but white embroidery relieved by open spaces in or shapes cut from the linen ground is possessed of an entirely new charm and from a sense of this the birth may be traced of an art in the result of which happy contrasts are effected between ornamental details of close texture and others of openwork  soon also was suggested the idea that instead of laboriously withdrawing threads from stout linen it would be more convenient to introduce a needlemade pattern into an open network ground which was called a lacis  of this kind of embroidery many specimens are extant the cluny museum possesses a linen cap said to have belonged to charles v and an alb of linen drawnthread work supposed to have been made by anne of bohemia 1527 is preserved in the cathedral at prague catherine de medicis had a bed draped with squares of reseuil or lacis and it is recorded that the girls and servants of her household consumed much time in making squares of reseuil  the interesting patternbooks for openground embroidery of which the first was published in 1527 by pierre quinty of cologne supply us with the means of tracing the stages in the transition from white thread embroidery to needlepoint lace  we meet in them with a style of needlework which differs from embroidery in not being wrought upon a stuff foundation  it is in fact true lace done as it were in the air both ground and pattern being entirely produced by the lacemaker  the elaborate use of lace in costume was of course largely stimulated by the fashion of wearing ruffs and their companion cuffs or sleeves catherine de medicis induced one frederic vinciolo to come from italy and make ruffs and gadrooned collars the fashion of which she started in france and henry iii was so punctilious over his ruffs that he would iron and goffer his cuffs and collars himself rather than see their pleats limp and out of shape  the patternbooks also gave a great impulse to the art  m lefebure mentions german books with patterns of eagles heraldic emblems hunting scenes and plants and leaves belonging to northern vegetation and italian books in which the motifs consist of oleander blossoms and elegant wreaths and scrolls landscapes with mythological scenes and hunting episodes less realistic than the northern ones in which appear fauns and nymphs or amorini shooting arrows  with regard to these patterns m lefebure notices a curious fact  the oldest painting in which lace is depicted is that of a lady by carpaccio who died about 1523  the cuffs of the lady are edged with a narrow lace the pattern of which reappears in vecellios corona a book not published until 1591  this particular pattern was therefore in use at least eighty years before it got into circulation with other published patterns  it was not however till the seventeenth century that lace acquired a really independent character and individuality and m duplessis states that the production of the more noteworthy of early laces owes more to the influence of men than to that of women  the reign of louis xiv witnessed the production of the most stately needlepoint laces the transformation of venetian point and the growth of points dalencon dargentan de bruxelles and dangleterre  the king aided by colbert determined to make france the centre if possible for lace manufacture sending for this purpose both to venice and to flanders for workers  the studio of the gobelins supplied designs  the dandies had their huge rabatos or bands falling from beneath the chin over the breast and great prelates like bossuet and fenelon wore their wonderful albs and rochets  it is related of a collar made at venice for louis xiv that the laceworkers being unable to find sufficiently fine horsehair employed some of their own hairs instead in order to secure that marvellous delicacy of work which they aimed at producing  in the eighteenth century venice finding that laces of lighter texture were sought after set herself to make rosepoint and at the court of louis xv the choice of lace was regulated by still more elaborate etiquette  the revolution however ruined many of the manufactures alencon survived and napoleon encouraged it and endeavoured to renew the old rules about the necessity of wearing pointlace at court receptions  a wonderful piece of lace powdered over with devices of bees and costing 40000 francs was ordered  it was begun for the empress josephine but in the course of its making her escutcheons were replaced by those of marie louise  m lefebure concludes his interesting history by stating very clearly his attitude towards machinemade lace  it would be an obvious loss to art he says should the making of lace by hand become extinct for machinery as skilfully devised as possible cannot do what the hand does  it can give us the results of processes not the creations of artistic handicraft  art is absent where formal calculation pretends to supersede emotion it is absent where no trace can be detected of intelligence guiding handicraft whose hesitancies even possess peculiar charm    cheapness is never commendable in respect of things which are not absolute necessities it lowers artistic standard  these are admirable remarks and with them we take leave of this fascinating book with its delightful illustrations its charming anecdotes its excellent advice  mr alan cole deserves the thanks of all who are interested in art for bringing this book before the public in so attractive and so inexpensive a form  embroidery and lace their manufacture and history from the remotest antiquity to the present day  translated and enlarged by alan s cole from the french of ernest lefebure  grevel and co     the poets cornerviii   pall mall gazette november 16 1888  a few years ago some of our minor poets tried to set science to music to write sonnets on the survival of the fittest and odes to natural selection  socialism and the sympathy with those who are unfit seem if we may judge from miss nesbits remarkable volume to be the new theme of song the fresh subjectmatter for poetry  the change has some advantages  scientific laws are at once too abstract and too clearly defined and even the visible arts have not yet been able to translate into any symbols of beauty the discoveries of modern science  at the arts and crafts exhibition we find the cosmogony of moses not the cosmogony of darwin  to mr burnejones man is still a fallen angel not a greater ape  poverty and misery upon the other hand are terribly concrete things  we find their incarnation everywhere and as we are discussing a matter of art we have no hesitation in saying that they are not devoid of picturesqueness  the etcher or the painter finds in them a subject made to his hand and the poet has admirable opportunities of drawing weird and dramatic contrasts between the purple of the rich and the rags of the poor  from miss nesbits book comes not merely the voice of sympathy but also the cry of revolution     this is our vengeance day  our masters made fat with our fasting    shall fall before us like corn when the sickle for harvest is strong    old wrongs shall give might to our arm remembrance of wrongs shall    make lasting    the graves we will dig for our tyrants we bore with too much and too    long  the poem from which we take this stanza is remarkably vigorous and the only consolation that we can offer to the timid and the tories is that as long as so much strength is employed in blowing the trumpet the sword so far as miss nesbit is concerned will probably remain sheathed personally and looking at the matter from a purely artistic point of view we prefer miss nesbits gentler moments  her eye for nature is peculiarly keen  she has always an exquisite sense of colour and sometimes a most delicate ear for music  many of her poems such as the moat house absolution and the singing of the magnificat are true works of art and vies manquees is a little gem of song with its dainty dancing measure its delicate and wilful fancy and the sharp poignant note of passion that suddenly strikes across it marring its light laughter and lending its beauty a terrible and tragic meaning  from the sonnets we take this at random     not springtoo lavish of her bud and leaf       but autumn with sad eyes and brows austere       when fields are bare and woods are brown and sere    and leaden skies weep their enchantless grief    spring is so much too bright since spring is brief       and in our hearts is autumn all the year       least sad when the wide pastures are most drear    and fields grieve mostrobbed of the last gold sheaf  these too the opening stanzas of the last envoy are charming     the wind that through the silent woodland blows    oer rippling corn and dreaming pastures goes       straight to the garden where the heart of spring    faints in the heart of summers earliest rose     dimpling the meadows grassy green and grey    by furze that yellows all the common way       gathering the gladness of the common broom    and too persistent fragrance of the may     gathering whatever is of sweet and dear    the wandering wind has passed away from here       has passed to where within your garden waits    the concentrated sweetness of the year  but miss nesbit is not to be judged by mere extracts  her work is too rich and too full for that  mr foster is an american poet who has read hawthorne which is wise of him and imitated longfellow which is not quite so commendable  his rebecca the witch is a story of old salem written in the metre of hiawatha with a few rhymes thrown in and conceived in the spirit of the author of the scarlet letter  the combination is not very satisfactory but the poem as a piece of fiction has many elements of interest  mr foster seems to be quite popular in america  the chicago times finds his fancies very playful and sunny and the indianapolis journal speaks of his tender and appreciative style  he is certainly a clever storyteller and the noahs ark which somehow had escaped the sheriffs hand is bright and amusing and its pathos like the pathos of a melodrama is a purely picturesque element not intended to be taken too seriously  we cannot however recommend the definitely comic poems they are very depressing  mr john renton denning dedicates his book to the duke of connaught who is colonelinchief of the rifle brigade in which regiment mr denning was once himself a private soldier  his poems show an ardent love of keats and a profligate luxuriance of adjectives     and i will build a bower for thee sweet    a verdurous shelter from the noonday heat    thick rustling ivy broad and green and shining    with honeysuckle creeping up and twining    its nectared sweetness round thee violets    and daisies with their fringed coronets    and the white bells of tiny valley lilies    and goldenleaved narcissidaffodillies    shall grow around thy dwellingluscious fare    of fruit on which the sun has laughed  this is the immature manner of endymion with a vengeance and is not to be encouraged  still mr denning is not always so anxious to reproduce the faults of his master  sometimes he writes with wonderful grace and charm  sylvia for instance is an exceedingly pretty poem and the exile has many powerful and picturesque lines  mr denning should make a selection of his poems and publish them in better type and on better paper  the getup of his volume to use the slang phrase of our young poets is very bad indeed and reflects no credit on the press of the education society of bombay  the best poem in mr joseph mckims little book is undoubtedly william the silent  it is written in the spirited macaulay style     awake awake ye burghers brave shout shout for joy and sing    with thirty thousand at his back comes forth your hero king    now shake for ever from your necks the servile yoke of spain    and raise your arms and end for aye false alvas cruel reign    ho  maestricht liege brussels fair pour forth your warriors brave    and join your hands with him who comes your hearths and homes to save  some people like this style  mrs horace dobell who has arrived at her seventeenth volume of poetry seems very angry with everybody and writes poems to a human toad with lurid and mysterious footnotes such asyet some one not a friend of  did on a certain occasion of a glib utterance of calumnies by  at hampstead  here indeed is a souls tragedy  in many cases i have deliberately employed alliteration believing that the music of a line is intensified thereby says mr kelly in the preface to his poems and there is certainly no reason why mr kelly should not employ this artful aid  alliteration is one of the many secrets of english poetry and as long as it is kept a secret it is admirable  mr kelly it must be admitted uses it with becoming modesty and reserve and never suffers it to trammel the white feet of his bright and buoyant muse  his volume is in many ways extremely interesting most minor poets are at their best in sonnets but with him it is not so his sonnets are too narrative too diffuse and too lyrical  they lack concentration and concentration is the very essence of a sonnet  his longer poems on the other hand have many good qualities  we do not care for psychossolles which is elaborately commonplace but the flight of calliope has many charming passages  it is a pity that mr kelly has included the poems written before the age of nineteen  youth is rarely original  andiatorocte is the title of a volume of poems by the rev clarence walworth of albany ny  it is a word borrowed from the indians and should we think be returned to them as soon as possible  the most curious poem of the book is called scenes at the holy home     jesus and joseph at work  hurra    sight never to see again    a prentice deity plies the saw    while the master ploughs with the plane  poems of this kind were popular in the middle ages when the cathedrals of every christian country served as its theatres  they are anachronisms now and it is odd that they should come to us from the united states  in matters of this kind we should have some protection  1 lays and

andiatorocte  by the rev clarence a walworth  g p putnams sons     a note on some modern poets   womans world december 1888  if i were king says mr henley in one of his most modest rondeaus     art should aspire yet ugliness be dear    beauty the shaft should speed with wit for feather    and love sweet love should never fall to sere          if i were king  and these lines contain if not the best criticism of his own work certainly a very complete statement of his aim and motive as a poet  his little book of verses reveals to us an artist who is seeking to find new methods of expression and has not merely a delicate sense of beauty and a brilliant fantastic wit but a real passion also for what is horrible ugly or grotesque  no doubt everything that is worthy of existence is worthy also of artat least one would like to think sobut while echo or mirror can repeat for us a beautiful thing to render artistically a thing that is ugly requires the most exquisite alchemy of form the most subtle magic of transformation  to me there is more of the cry of marsyas than of the singing of apollo in the earlier poems of mr henleys volume in hospital rhymes and rhythms as he calls them  but it is impossible to deny their power  some of them are like bright vivid pastels others like charcoal drawings with dull blacks and murky whites others like etchings with deeplybitten lines and abrupt contrasts and clever coloursuggestions  in fact they are like anything and everything except perfected poemsthat they certainly are not  they are still in the twilight  they are preludes experiments inspired jottings in a notebook and should be heralded by a design of genius making sketches  rhyme gives architecture as well as melody to verse it gives that delightful sense of limitation which in all the arts is so pleasurable and is indeed one of the secrets of perfection it will whisper as a french critic has said things unexpected and charming things with strange and remote relations to each other and bind them together in indissoluble bonds of beauty and in his constant rejection of rhyme mr henley seems to me to have abdicated half his power  he is a roi en exil who has thrown away some of the strings of his lute a poet who has forgotten the fairest part of his kingdom  however all work criticises itself  here is one of mr henleys inspired jottings  according to the temperament of the reader it will serve either as a model or as the reverse     as with varnish red and glistening       dripped his hair his feet were rigid       raised he settled stiffly sideways       you could see the hurts were spinal     he had fallen from an engine       and been dragged along the metals       it was hopeless and they knew it       so they covered him and left him     as he lay by fits half sentient       inarticulately moaning       with his stockinged feet protruded       sharp and awkward from the blankets     to his bed there came a woman       stood and looked and sighed a little       and departed without speaking       as himself a few hours after     i was told she was his sweetheart       they were on the eve of marriage       she was quiet as a statue       but her lip was gray and writhen  in this poem the rhythm and the music such as it is are obviousperhaps a little too obvious  in the following i see nothing but ingeniously printed prose  it is a descriptionand a very accurate oneof a scene in a hospital ward  the medical students are supposed to be crowding round the doctor  what i quote is only a fragment but the poem itself is a fragment     so shows the ring    seen from behind round a conjuror    doing his pitch in the street    high shoulders low shoulders broad shoulders narrow ones    round square and angular serry and shove    while from within a voice    gravely and weightily fluent    sounds and then ceases and suddenly    look at the stress of the shoulders    out of a quiver of silence    over the hiss of the spray    comes a low cry and the sound    of breath quick intaken through teeth    clenched in resolve  and the master    breaks from the crowd and goes    wiping his hands    to the next bed with his pupils    flocking and whispering behind him     now one can see    case number one    sits rather pale with his bedclothes    stripped up and showing his foot    alas for gods image    swaddled in wet white lint    brilliantly hideous with red  theophile gautier once said that flauberts style was meant to be read and his own style to be looked at  mr henleys unrhymed rhythms form very dainty designs from a typographical point of view  from the point of view of literature they are a series of vivid concentrated impressions with a keen grip of fact a terrible actuality and an almost masterly power of picturesque presentation  but the poetic formwhat of that  well let us pass to the later poems to the rondels and rondeaus the sonnets and quatorzains the echoes and the ballades  how brilliant and fanciful this is  the toyokuni colourprint that suggested it could not be more delightful  it seems to have kept all the wilful fantastic charm of the original     was i a samurai

circling sleepy and slow    a blue canal the lakes blue bound    breaks at the bamboo bridge and lo    touched with the sundowns spirit and glow    i see you turn with flirted fan    against the

blackbirds mad refrain    it waits for her the vast inane    then girls to help her on the way    well to the woods and gather may  there are fine verses also scattered through this little book some of them very strong as     out of the night that covers me       black as the pit from pole to pole    i thank whatever gods may be       for my unconquerable soul     it matters not how strait the gate       how charged with punishments the scroll    i am the master of my fate       i am the captain of my soul  others with a true touch of romance as     or ever the knightly years were gone       with the old world to the grave    i was a king in babylon       and you were a christian slave  and here and there we come across such felicitous phrases as           in the sand    the gold prowgriffin claws a hold  or           the spires    shine and are changed  and many other graceful or fanciful lines even the green skys minor thirds being perfectly right in its place and a very refreshing bit of affectation in a volume where there is so much that is natural  however mr henley is not to be judged by samples  indeed the most attractive thing in the book is no single poem that is in it but the strong humane personality that stands behind both flawless and faulty work alike and looks out through many masks some of them beautiful and some grotesque and not a few misshapen  in the case with most of our modern poets when we have analysed them down to an adjective we can go no further or we care to go no further but with this book it is different  through these reeds and pipes blows the very breath of life it seems as if one could put ones hand upon the singers heart and count its pulsations  there is something wholesome virile and sane about the mans soul  anybody can be reasonable but to be sane is not common and sane poets are as rare as blue lilies though they may not be quite so delightful     let the great winds their worst and wildest blow    or the gold weather round us mellow slow    we have fulfilled ourselves and we can dare    and we can conquer though we may not share    in the rich quiet of the afterglow          what is to come  is the concluding stanza of the last rondeauindeed of the last poem in the collection and the high serene temper displayed in these lines serves at once as keynote and keystone to the book  the very lightness and slightness of so much of the work its careless moods and casual fancies seem to suggest a nature that is not primarily interested in arta nature like sordellos passionately enamoured of life one to which lyre and lute are things of less importance  from this mere joy of living this frank delight in experience for its own sake this lofty indifference and momentary unregretted ardours come all the faults and all the beauties of the volume  but there is this difference between themthe faults are deliberate and the result of much study the beauties have the air of fascinating impromptus  mr henleys healthy if sometimes misapplied confidence in the myriad suggestions of life gives him his charm  he is made to sing along the highways not to sit down and write  if he took himself more seriously his work would become trivial        mr william sharp takes himself very seriously and has written a preface to his romantic ballads and poems of phantasy which is on the whole the most interesting part of his volume  we are all it seems far too cultured and lack robustness  there are those amongst us says mr sharp who would prefer a dexterouslyturned triolet to such apparently uncouth measures as thomas the rhymer or the ballad of clerk saunders who would rather listen to the drawingroom music of the villanelle than to the wild harpplaying by the milldams o binnorie or the sough of the nightwind oer drumly annan water  such an expression as the drawingroom music of the villanelle is not very happy and i cannot imagine any one with the smallest pretensions to culture preferring a dexterously turned triolet to a fine imaginative ballad as it is only the philistine who ever dreams of comparing works of art that are absolutely different in motive in treatment and in form  if english poetry is in dangerand according to mr sharp the poor nymph is in a very critical statewhat she has to fear is not the fascination of dainty metre or delicate form but the predominance of the intellectual spirit over the spirit of beauty  lord tennyson dethroned wordsworth as a literary influence and later on mr swinburne filled all the mountain valleys with echoes of his own song  the influence today is that of mr browning  and as for the triolets and the rondels and the careful study of metrical subtleties these things are merely the signs of a desire for perfection in small things and of the recognition of poetry as an art  they have had certainly one good resultthey have made our minor poets readable and have not left us entirely at the mercy of geniuses  but says mr sharp every one is far too literary even rossetti is too literary  what we want is simplicity and directness of utterance these should be the dominant characteristics of poetry  well is that quite so certain  are simplicity and directness of utterance absolute essentials for poetry  i think not  they may be admirable for the drama admirable for all those imitative forms of literature that claim to mirror life in its externals and its accidents admirable for quiet narrative admirable in their place but their place is not everywhere  poetry has many modes of music she does not blow through one pipe alone  directness of utterance is good but so is the subtle recasting of thought into a new and delightful form  simplicity is good but complexity mystery strangeness symbolism obscurity even these have their value  indeed properly speaking there is no such thing as style there are merely styles that is all  one cannot help feeling also that everything that mr sharp says in his preface was said at the beginning of the century by wordsworth only where wordsworth called us back to nature mr sharp invites us to woo romance  romance he tells us is in the air  a new romantic movement is imminent i anticipate he says that many of our poets especially those of the youngest generation will shortly turn towards the ballad as a poetic vehicle and that the next year or two will see much romantic poetry  the ballad  well mr andrew lang some months ago signed the death warrant of the ballade andthough i hope that in this respect mr lang resembles the queen in alice in wonderland whose bloodthirsty orders were by general consent never carried into executionit must be admitted that the number of ballades given to us by some of our poets was perhaps a little excessive  but the ballad  sir patrick spens clerk saunders thomas the rhymerare these to be our archetypes our models the sources of our inspiration  they are certainly great imaginative poems  in chattertons ballad of charity coleridges rhyme of the ancient mariner the la belle dame sans merci of keats the sister helen of rossetti we can see what marvellous works of art the spirit of old romance may fashion  but to preach a spirit is one thing to propose a form is another  it is true that mr sharp warns the rising generation against imitation  a ballad he reminds them does not necessarily denote a poem in quatrains and in antique language  but his own poems as i think will be seen later are in their way warnings and show the danger of suggesting any definite poetic vehicle  and further are simplicity and directness of utterance really the dominant characteristics of these old imaginative ballads that mr sharp so enthusiastically and in some particulars so wisely praises  it does not seem to me to be so  we are always apt to think that the voices which sang at the dawn of poetry were simpler fresher and more natural than ours and that the world which the early poets looked at and through which they walked had a kind of poetical quality of its own and could pass almost without changing into song  the snow lies thick now upon olympus and its scarped sides are bleak and barren but once we fancy the white feet of the muses brushed the dew from the anemones in the morning and at evening came apollo to sing to the shepherds in the vale  but in this we are merely lending to other ages what we desire or think we desire for our own  our historical sense is at fault  every century that produces poetry is so far an artificial century and the work that seems to us the most natural and simple product of its time is probably the result of the most deliberate and selfconscious effort  for nature is always behind the age  it takes a great artist to be thoroughly modern  let us turn to the poems which have really only the preface to blame for their somewhat late appearance  the best is undoubtedly the weird of michael scott and these stanzas are a fair example of its power     then michael scott laughed long and loud    whan shone the mune ahint yon cloud       i speered the towers that saw my birth    lang lang sall wait my cauld grey shroud       lang cauld and weet my bed o earth     but as by stair he rode full speed    his horse began to pant and bleed       win hame win hame my bonnie mare    win hame if thou wouldst rest and feed       win hame were nigh the house of stair     but with a shrill heartbursten yell    the white horse stumbled plunged and fell       and loud a summoning voice arose    ist whitehorse death that rides frae hell       or michael scott that hereby goes     ah laird of stair i ken ye weel    avaunt or i your saul sall steal       an send ye howling through the wood    a wild manwolfaye ye maun reel       an cry upon your holy rood  there is a good deal of vigour no doubt in these lines but one cannot help asking whether this is to be the common tongue of the future renaissance of romance  are we all to talk scotch and to speak of the moon as the mune and the soul as the saul  i hope not  and yet if this renaissance is to be a vital living thing it must have its linguistic side  just as the spiritual development of music and the artistic development of painting have always been accompanied if not occasioned by the discovery of some new instrument or some fresh medium so in the case of any important literary movement half of its strength resides in its language  if it does not bring with it a rich and novel mode of expression it is doomed either to sterility or to imitation dialect archaisms and the like will not do  take for instance another poem of mr sharps a poem which he calls the deithtide     the weet saut wind is blawing       upon the misty shore    as like a stormy snawing       the deid go streaming oer          the wan drownd deid sail wildly             frae out each drumly wave          its o and o for the weary sea             and o for a quiet grave  this is simply a very clever pastiche nothing more and our language is not likely to be permanently enriched by such words as weet saut blawing and snawing  even drumly an adjective of which mr sharp is so fond that he uses it both in prose and verse seems to me to be hardly an adequate basis for a new romantic movement  however mr sharp does not always write in dialect  the son of allan can be read without any difficulty and phantasy can be read with pleasure  they are both very charming poems in their way and none the less charming because the cadences of the one recall sister helen and the motive of the other reminds us of la belle dame sans merci  but those who wish thoroughly to enjoy mr sharps poems should not read his preface just as those who approve of the preface should avoid reading the poems  i cannot help saying that i think the preface a great mistake  the work that follows it is quite inadequate and there seems little use in heralding a dawn that rose long ago and proclaiming a renaissance whose firstfruits if we are to judge them by any high standard of perfection are of so ordinary a character        miss mary robinson has also written a preface to her little volume poems ballads and a garden play but the preface is not very serious and does not propose any drastic change or any immediate revolution in english literature  miss robinsons poems have always the charm of delicate music and graceful expression but they are perhaps weakest where they try to be strong and certainly least satisfying where they seek to satisfy  her fanciful flowercrowned muse with her tripping steps and pretty wilful ways should not write antiphons to the unknowable or try to grapple with abstract intellectual problems  hers is not the hand to unveil mysteries nor hers the strength for the solving of secrets  she should never leave her garden and as for her wandering out into the desert to ask the sphinx questions that should be sternly forbidden to her  durers melancolia that serves as the frontispiece to this dainty book looks sadly out of place  her seat is with the sibyls not with the nymphs  what has she to do with shepherdesses piping about darwinism and the eternal mind  however if the songs of the inner life are not very successful the spring songs are delightful  they follow each other like windblown petals and make one feel how much more charming flower is than fruit appleblossom than apple  there are some artistic temperaments that should never come to maturity that should always remain in the region of promise and should dread autumn with its harvesting more than winter with its frosts  such seems to me the temperament that this volume reveals the first poem of the second series la belle au bois dormant is worth all the more serious and thoughtful work and has far more chance of being remembered  it is not always to high aim and lofty ambition that the prize is given  if daphne had gone to meet apollo she would never have known what laurels are  from these fascinating spring lyrics and idylls we pass to the romantic ballads  one artistic faculty miss robinson certainly possessesthe faculty of imitation  there is an element of imitation in all the arts it is to be found in literature as much as in painting and the danger of valuing it too little is almost as great as the danger of setting too high a value upon it  to catch by dainty mimicry the very mood and manner of antique work and yet to retain that touch of modern passion without which the old form would be dull and empty to win from longsilent lips some faint echo of their music and to add to it a music of ones own to take the mode and fashion of a bygone age and to experiment with it and search curiously for its possibilities there is a pleasure in all this  it is a kind of literary acting and has something of the charm of the art of the stageplayer  and how well on the whole miss robinson does it  here is the opening of the ballad of rudel     there was in all the world of france       no singer half so sweet    the first note of his viol brought       a crowd into the street     he stepped as young and bright and glad       as angel gabriel    and only when we heard him sing       our eyes forgot rudel     and as he sat in avignon       with princes at their wine    in all that lusty company       was none so fresh and fine     his kirtles of the arrasblue       his cap of pearls and green    his golden curls fall tumbling round       the fairest face ive seen  how gautier would have liked this from the same poem     hew the timbers of sandalwood       and planks of ivory    rear up the shining masts of gold       and let us put to sea     sew the sails with a silken thread       that all are silken too    sew them with scarlet pomegranates       upon a sheet of blue     rig the ship with a rope of gold       and let us put to sea    and now goodbye to good marseilles       and hey for tripoli  the ballad of the duke of gueldress wedding is very clever     o welcome mary harcourt       thrice welcome lady mine    theres not a knight in all the world       shall be as true as thine     theres venison in the aumbry mary       theres claret in the vat    come in and breakfast in the hall       where once my mother sat     o red red is the wine that flows       and sweet the minstrels play    but white is mary harcourt       upon her weddingday     o many are the wedding guests       that sit on either side    but pale below her crimson flowers       and homesick is the bride  miss robinsons critical sense is at once too sound and too subtle to allow her to think that any great renaissance of romance will necessarily follow from the adoption of the balladform in poetry but her work in this style is very pretty and charming and the tower of st maur which tells of the father who built up his little son in the wall of his castle in order that the foundations should stand sure is admirable in its way the few touches of archaism in language that she introduces are quite sufficient for their purpose and though she fully appreciates the importance of the celtic spirit in literature she does not consider it necessary to talk of blawing and snawing  as for the garden play our lady of the broken heart as it is called the bright birdlike snatches of song that break in here and thereas the singing does in pippa passesform a very welcome relief to the somewhat ordinary movement of the blank verse and suggest to us again where miss robinsons real power lies  not a poet in the true creative sense she is still a very perfect artist in poetry using language as one might use a very precious material and producing her best work by the rejection of the great themes and large intellectual motives that belong to fuller and richer song  when she essays such themes she certainly fails  her instrument is the reed not the lyre  only those should sing of death whose song is stronger than death is        the collected poems of the author of john halifax gentleman have a pathetic interest as the artistic record of a very gracious and comely life  they bring us back to the days when philip bourke marston was youngphilip my king as she called him in the pretty poem of that name to the days of the great exhibition with the universal piping about peace to those later terrible crimean days when alma and balaclava were words on the lips of our poets and to days when leonora was considered a very romantic name     leonora leonora    how the word rollsleonora    lionlike in fullmouthed sound    marching oer the metric ground    with a tawny tread sublime    so your name moves leonora    down my desert rhyme  mrs craiks best poems are on the whole those that are written in blank verse and these though not prosaic remind one that prose was her true medium of expression  but some of the rhymed poems have considerable merit  these may serve as examples of mrs craiks style     a sketch     dost thou thus love me o thou all beloved    in whose large store the very meanest coin    would outbuy my whole wealth  yet here thou comest    like a kind heiress from her purple and down    uprising who for pity cannot sleep    but goes forth to the stranger at her gate    the beggared stranger at her beauteous gate    and clothes and feeds scarce blest till she has blest     but dost thou love me o thou pure of heart    whose very looks are prayers  what couldst thou see    in this forsaken pool by the yewwoods side    to sit down at its bank and dip thy hand    saying it is so clearand lo ere long    its blackness caught the shimmer of thy wings    its slimes slid downward from thy stainless palm    its depths grew still that there thy form might rise     the novice     it is near morning  ere the next night fall       i shall be made the bride of heaven  then home       to my still marriagechamber i shall come    and spouseless childless watch the slow years crawl     these lips will never meet a softer touch       than the stone crucifix i kiss no child       will clasp this neck  ah virginmother mild    thy painted bliss will mock me overmuch     this is the last time i shall twist the hair       my mothers hand wreathed till in dust she lay       the name her name given on my baptism day    this is the last time i shall ever bear     o weary world o heavy life farewell       like a tired child that creeps into the dark       to sob itself asleep where none will mark    so creep i to my silent convent cell     friends lovers whom i loved not kindly hearts       who grieve that i should enter this still door       grieve not  closing behind me evermore    me from all anguish as all joy it parts  the volume

unwin  4 poems  by the author of john halifax gentleman  macmillan and co     sir edwin arnolds last volume   pall mall gazette december 11 1888  writers of poetical prose are rarely good poets  they may crowd their page with gorgeous epithet and resplendent phrase may pile pelions of adjectives upon ossas of descriptions may abandon themselves to highly coloured diction and rich luxuriance of imagery but if their verse lacks the true rhythmical life of verse if their method is devoid of the self restraint of the real artist all their efforts are of very little avail asiatic prose is possibly useful for journalistic purposes but asiatic poetry is not to be encouraged  indeed poetry may be said to need far more selfrestraint than prose  its conditions are more exquisite  it produces its effects by more subtle means  it must not be allowed to degenerate into mere rhetoric or mere eloquence  it is in one sense the most selfconscious of all the arts as it is never a means to an end but always an end in itself  sir edwin arnold has a very picturesque or perhaps we should say a very pictorial style  he knows india better than any living englishman knows it and hindoostanee better than any english writer should know it  if his descriptions lack distinction they have at least the merit of being true and when he does not interlard his pages with an interminable and intolerable series of foreign words he is pleasant enough  but he is not a poet  he is simply a poetical writerthat is all  however poetical writers have their uses and there is a good deal in sir edwin arnolds last volume that will repay perusal  the scene of the story is placed in a mosque attached to the monument of the tajmahal and a group composed of a learned mirza two singing girls with their attendant and an englishman is supposed to pass the night there reading the chapter of sadi upon love and conversing upon that theme with accompaniments of music and dancing  the englishman is of course sir edwin arnold himself           lover of india    too much her lover for his heart lived there    how far soever wandered thence his feet  lady dufferin appears as     lady duffreen the mighty queens vicequeen  which is really one of the most dreadful blankverse lines that we have come across for some time past  m renan is a priest of frangestan who writes in glittering french lord tennyson is           one we honour for his songs    greater than sadis self  and the darwinians appear as the mollahs of the west who           hold adams sons    sprung of the seaslug  all this is excellent fooling in its way a kind of playacting in literature but the best parts of the book are the descriptions of the taj itself which are extremely elaborate and the various translations from sadi with which the volume is interspersed  the great monument shah jahan built for arjamand is     instinct with lovelinessnot masonry    not architecture as all others are    but the proud passion of an emperors love    wrought into living stone which gleams and soars    with body of beauty shrining soul and thought    insomuch that it haps as when some face    divinely fair unveils before our eyes    some woman beautiful unspeakably    and the blood quickens and the spirit leaps    and will to worship bends the halfyielded knees    which breath forgets to breathe so is the taj    you see it with the heart before the eyes    have scope to gaze  all white snow white cloud white  we cannot say much in praise of the sixth line     insomuch that it haps as when some face  it is curiously awkward and unmusical  but this passage from sadi is remarkable     when earth bewildered shook in earthquakethroes    with mountainroots he bound her borders close       turkis and ruby in her rocks he stored    and on her green branch hung his crimson rose     he shapes dull seed to fair imaginings    who paints with moisture as he painteth things       look from the cloud he sheds one drop on ocean    as from the fathers loins one drop he brings     and out of that he forms a peerless pearl    and out of this a cypress boy or girl       utterly wotting all their innermosts    for all to him is visible  uncurl     your cold coils snakes  creep forth ye thrifty ants    handless and strengthless he provides your wants       who from the is not planned the is to be    and life in nonexistent void implants  sir edwin arnold suffers of course from the inevitable comparison that one cannot help making between his work and the work of edward fitzgerald and certainly fitzgerald could never have written such a line as utterly wotting all their innermosts but it is interesting to read almost any translation of those wonderful oriental poets with their strange blending of philosophy and sensuousness of simple parable or fable and obscure mystic utterance  what we regret most in sir edwin arnolds book is his habit of writing in what really amounts to a sort of pigeon english  when we are told that lady duffreen the mighty queens vicequeen paces among the charpoys of the ward no whit afraid of sitla or of tap when the mirza explains           ag lejao    to light the kallians for the saheb and me  and the attendant obeys with achcha  achcha when we are invited to listen to the vina and the drum and told about ekkas byragis hamals and tamboora all that we can say is that to such ghazals we are not prepared to say either shamash or afrin  in english poetry we do not want        chatkis for the toes    jasams for elbowbands and gote and har    bala and mala  this is not local colour it is a sort of local discoloration  it does not add anything to the vividness of the scene  it does not bring the orient more clearly before us  it is simply an inconvenience to the reader and a mistake on the part of the writer  it may be difficult for a poet to find english synonyms for asiatic expressions but even if it were impossible it is none the less a poets duty to find them  we are sorry that a scholar and a man of culture like sir edwin arnold should have been guilty of what is really an act of treason against our literature  but for this error his book though not in any sense a work of genius or even of high artistic merit would still have been of some enduring value  as it is sir edwin arnold has translated sadi and some one must translate sir edwin arnold  with sadi in the garden or the book of love  by sir edwin arnold ma kcie author of the light of asia etc  trubner and co     australian poets   pall mall gazette december 14 1888  mr sladen dedicates his anthology or perhaps we should say his herbarium of australian song to mr edmund gosse whose exquisite critical faculty is he tells us as conspicuous in his poems as in his lectures on poetry  after so graceful a compliment mr gosse must certainly deliver a series of discourses upon antipodean art before the cambridge undergraduates who will no doubt be very much interested on hearing about gordon kendall and domett to say nothing of the extraordinary collection of mediocrities whom mr sladen has somewhat ruthlessly dragged from their modest and wellmerited obscurity  gordon however is very badly represented in mr sladens book the only three specimens of his work that are included being an unrevised fragment his valedictory poem and an exiles farewell  the latter is of course touching but then the commonplace always touches and it is a great pity that mr sladen was unable to come to any financial arrangement with the holders of gordons copyright  the loss to the volume that now lies before us is quite irreparable  through gordon australia found her first fine utterance in song  still there are some other singers here well worth studying and it is interesting to read about poets who lie under the shadow of the gumtree gather wattle blossoms and buddawong and sarsaparilla for their loves and wander through the glades of mount bawbaw listening to the careless raptures of the mopoke  to them november is        the wonder with the golden wings    who lays one hand in summers one in springs  january is full of breaths of myrrh and subtle hints of roselands     she is the warm live month of lustreshe    makes glad the land and lulls the strong sad sea  while february is the true demeter and     with rich warm vineblood splashed from heel to knee    comes radiant through the yellow woodlands  each month as it passes calls for new praise and for music different from our own  july is a lady born in wind and rain in august     across the range by every scarred black fell    strong winter blows his horn of wild farewell  while october is the queen of all the year the lady of the yellow hair who strays with blossomtrammelled feet across the haughtyfeatured hills and brings the spring with her  we must certainly try to accustom ourselves to the mopoke and the sarsaparilla plant and to make the gumtree and the buddawong as dear to us as the olives and the narcissi of white colonus  after all the muses are great travellers and the same foot that stirred the cumnor cowslips may some day brush the fallen gold of the wattle blossoms and tread delicately over the tawny bushgrass  mr sladen has of course a great belief in the possibilities of australian poetry  there are in australia he tells us far more writers capable of producing good work than has been assumed  it is only natural he adds that this should be so for australia has one of those delightful climates conducive to rest in the open air  the middle of the day is so hot that it is really more healthful to lounge about than to take stronger exercise  well lounging in the open air is not a bad school for poets but it largely depends on the lounger  what strikes one on reading over mr sladens collection is the depressing provinciality of mood and manner in almost every writer  page follows page and we find nothing but echoes without music reflections without beauty secondrate magazine verses and thirdrate verses for colonial newspapers  poe seems to have had some influenceat least there are several parodies of his methodand one or two writers have read mr swinburne but on the whole we have artless nature in her most irritating form  of course australia is young younger even than america whose youth is now one of her oldest and most hallowed traditions but the entire want of originality of treatment is curious  and yet not so curious perhaps after all  youth is rarely original  there are however some exceptions  henry clarence kendall had a true poetic gift  the series of poems on the austral months from which we have already quoted is full of beautiful things landors rose aylmer is a classic in its way but kendalls rose lorraine is in parts not unworthy to be mentioned after it and the poem entitled beyond kerguelen has a marvellous music about it a wonderful rhythm of words and a real richness of utterance  some of the lines are strangely powerful and indeed in spite of its exaggerated alliteration or perhaps in consequence of it the whole poem is a most remarkable work of art     down in the south by the waste without sail on it       far from the zone of the blossom and tree    lieth with winter and whirlwind and wail on it       ghost of a land by the ghost of a sea    weird is the mist from the summit to base of it       sun of its heaven is wizened and grey    phantom of light is the light on the face of it       never is night on it never is day    here is the shore without flower or bird on it       here is no litany sweet of the springs    only the haughty harsh thunder is heard on it       only the storm with a roar in its wings     back in the dawn of this beautiful sphere on it       land of the dolorous desolate face    beamed the blue day and the beautiful year on it       fostered the leaf and the blossom of grace    grand were the lights of its midsummer noon on it       mornings of majesty shone on its seas    glitter of star and the glory of moon on it       fell in the march of the musical breeze    valleys and hills with the whisper of wing in them       dells of the daffodilspaces impearled    flowered and flashed with the splendour of spring in them       back in the morn of this wonderful world  mr sladen speaks of alfred domett as the author of one of the great poems of a century in which shelley and keats byron and scott wordsworth and tennyson have all flourished but the extracts he gives from ranolf and amohia hardly substantiate this claim although the song of the treegod in the fourth book is clever but exasperating  a midsummers noon by charles harpur the grey forefather of australian poetry is pretty and graceful and thomas henrys woodnotes and miss veels saturday night are worth reading but on the whole the australian poets are extremely dull and prosaic  there seem to be no sirens in the new world  as for mr sladen himself he has done his work very conscientiously  indeed in one instance he almost rewrites an entire poem in consequence of the manuscript having reached him in a mutilated condition     a pleasant land is the land of dreams       at the back of the shining air    it hath sunnier skies and sheenier streams       and gardens than earths more fair  is the first verse of this lucubration and mr sladen informs us with justifiable pride that the parts printed in italics are from his own pen this is certainly editing with a vengeance and we cannot help saying that it reflects more credit on mr sladens good nature than on his critical or his poetical powers  the appearance also in a volume of poems produced in australia of selections from hornes orion cannot be defended especially as we are given no specimen of the poetry horne wrote during the time that he actually was in australia where he held the office of warden of the blue mountainsa position which as far as the title goes is the loveliest ever given to any poet and would have suited wordsworth admirably wordsworth that is to say at his best for he not infrequently wrote like the distributor of stamps  however mr sladen has shown great energy in the compilation of this bulky volume which though it does not contain much that is of any artistic value has a certain historical interest especially for those who care to study the conditions of intellectual life in the colonies of a great empire  the biographical notices of the enormous crowd of versemakers which is included in this volume are chiefly from the pen of mr patchett martin some of them are not very satisfactory  formerly of west australia now residing at boston us  has published several volumes of poetry is a ludicrously inadequate account of such a man as john boyle oreilly while in poet essayist critic and journalist one of the most prominent figures in literary london few will recognise the industrious mr william sharp  still on the whole we should be grateful for a volume that has given us specimens of kendalls work and perhaps mr sladen will some day produce an anthology of australian poetry not a herbarium of australian verse his present book has many good qualities but it is almost unreadable  australian poets 17881888  edited by douglas b w sladen ba  oxon griffith farran and co     some literary notesi   womans world january 1889  in a recent article on english poetesses 374 i ventured to suggest that our women of letters should turn their attention somewhat more to prose and somewhat less to poetry  women seem to me to possess just what our literature wantsa light touch a delicate hand a graceful mode of treatment and an unstudied felicity of phrase  we want some one who will do for our prose what madame de sevigne did for the prose of france george eliots style was far too cumbrous and charlotte brontes too exaggerated  however one must not forget that amongst the women of england there have been some charming letterwriters and certainly no book can be more delightful reading than mrs rosss three generations of english women which has recently appeared  the three englishwomen whose memoirs and correspondence mrs ross has so admirably edited are mrs john taylor mrs sarah austin and lady duff gordon all of them remarkable personalities and two of them women of brilliant wit and european reputation  mrs taylor belonged to that great norwich family about whom the duke of sussex remarked that they reversed the ordinary saying that it takes nine tailors to make a man and was for many years one of the most distinguished figures in the famous society of her native town  her only daughter married john austin the great authority on jurisprudence and her salon in paris was the centre of the intellect and culture of her day  lucie duff gordon the only child of john and sarah austin inherited the talents of her parents  a beauty a femme desprit a traveller and clever writer she charmed and fascinated her age and her premature death in egypt was really a loss to our literature  it is to her daughter that we owe this delightful volume of memoirs  first we are introduced to mrs rosss greatgrandmother mrs taylor who was called by her intimate friends madame roland of norwich from her likeness to the portraits of the handsome and unfortunate frenchwoman  we hear of her darning her boys grey worsted stockings while holding her own with southey and brougham and dancing round the tree of liberty with dr parr when the news of the fall of the bastille was first known  amongst her friends were sir james mackintosh the most popular man of the day to whom madame de stael wrote il ny a pas de societe sans vous  cest tres ennuyeux de diner sans vous la societe ne va pas quand vous netes pas la sir james smith the botanist crabb robinson the gurneys mrs barbauld dr alderson and his charming daughter amelia opie and many other wellknown people  her letters are extremely sensible and thoughtful  nothing at present she says in one of them suits my taste so well as susans latin lessons and her philosophical old master    when we get to ciceros discussions on the nature of the soul or virgils fine descriptions my mind is filled up life is either a dull round of eating drinking and sleeping or a spark of ethereal fire just kindled     the character of girls must depend upon their reading as much as upon the company they keep  besides the intrinsic pleasure to be derived from solid knowledge a woman ought to consider it as her best resource against poverty  this is a somewhat caustic aphorism a romantic woman is a troublesome friend as she expects you to be as imprudent as herself and is mortified at what she calls coldness and insensibility  and this is admirable the art of life is not to estrange oneself from society and yet not to pay too dear for it  this too is good vanity like curiosity is wanted as a stimulus to exertion indolence would certainly get the better of us if it were not for these two powerful principles and there is a keen touch of humour in the following nothing is so gratifying as the idea that virtue and philanthropy are becoming fashionable  dr james martineau in a letter to mrs ross gives us a pleasant picture of the old lady returning from market weighted by her huge basket with the shank of a leg of mutton thrust out to betray its contents and talking divinely about philosophy poets politics and every intellectual topic of the day  she was a woman of admirable good sense a type of roman matron and quite as careful as were the roman matrons to keep up the purity of her native tongue  mrs taylor however was more or less limited to norwich  mrs austin was for the world  in london paris and germany she ruled and dominated society loved by every one who knew her  she is my best and brightest to lord jeffrey dear fair and wise to sydney smith my great ally to sir james stephen sunlight through waste weltering chaos to thomas carlyle while he needed her aid la petite mere du genre humain to michael chevalier liebes mutterlein to john stuart mill and my own professorin to charles buller to whom she taught german as well as to the sons of mr james mill  jeremy bentham when on his deathbed gave her a ring with his portrait and some of his hair let in behind  there my dear he said it is the only ring i ever gave a woman  she corresponded with guizot barthelemy de st hilaire the grotes dr whewell the master of trinity nassau senior the duchesse dorleans victor cousin and many other distinguished people her translation of rankes history of the popes is admirable indeed all her literary work was thoroughly well done and her edition of her husbands province of jurisprudence deserves the very highest praise  two people more unlike than herself and her husband it would have been difficult to find  he was habitually grave and despondent she was brilliantly handsome fond of society in which she shone and with an almost superabundance of energy and animal spirits mrs ross tells us she married him because she thought him perfect but he never produced the work of which he was worthy and of which she knew him to be worthy her estimate of him in the preface to the jurisprudence is wonderfully striking and simple  he was never sanguine  he was intolerant of any imperfection  he was always under the control of severe love of truth he lived and died a poor man  she was terribly disappointed in him but she loved him  some years after his death she wrote to m guizot     in the intervals of my study of his works i read his letters to    mefortyfive years of loveletters the last as tender and    passionate as the first  and how full of noble sentiments  the    midday of our lives was clouded and stormy full of cares and    disappointments but the sunset was bright and sereneas bright as    the morning and more serene  now it is night with me and must    remain so till the dawn of another day  i am always alonethat is    i live with him  the most interesting letters in the book are certainly those to m guizot with whom she maintained the closest intellectual friendship but there is hardly one of them that does not contain something clever or thoughtful or witty while those addressed to her in turn are very interesting  carlyle writes her letters full of lamentations the wail of a titan in pain superbly exaggerated for literary effect     literature ones sole craft and staff of life lies broken in    abeyance what room for music amid the braying of innumerable    jackasses the howling of innumerable hyaenas whetting the tooth to    eat them up  alas for it it is a sick disjointed time neither shall    we ever mend it at best let us hope to mend ourselves  i declare i    sometimes think of throwing down the pen altogether as a worthless    weapon and leading out a colony of these poor starving drudges to the    waste places of their old mother earth when for sweat of their brow    bread will rise for them it were perhaps the worthiest service that    at this moment could be rendered our old world to throw open for it    the doors of the new  thither must they come at last bursts of    eloquence will do nothing men are starving and will try many things    before they die  but poor i ach gott  i am no hengist or alaric    only a writer of articles in bad prose stick to thy last o tutor    the pen is not worthless it is omnipotent to those who have faith  henri beyle stendhal the great i am often tempted to think the greatest of french novelists writes her a charming letter about nuances it seems to me he says that except when they read shakespeare byron or sterne no englishman understands nuances we adore them  a fool says to a woman i love you the words mean nothing he might as well say olli batachor it is the nuance which gives force to the meaning  in 1839 mrs austin writes to victor cousin i have seen young gladstone a distinguished tory who wants to reestablish education based on the church in quite a catholic form and we find her corresponding with mr gladstone on the subject of education  if you are strong enough to provide motives and checks she says to him you may do two blessed actsreform your clergy and teach your people  as it is how few of them conceive what it is to teach a people  mr gladstone replies at great length and in many letters from which we may quote this passage     you are for pressing and urging the people to their profit against    their inclination so am i  you set little value upon all merely    technical instruction upon all that fails to touch the inner nature    of man so do i  and here i find ground of union broad and deeplaid           i more than doubt whether your idea namely that of raising man to    social sufficiency and morality can be accomplished except through    the ancient religion of christ    or whether the principles of    eclecticism are legitimately applicable to the gospel or whether if    we find ourselves in a state of incapacity to work through the church    we can remedy the defect by the adoption of principles contrary to    hers        but indeed i am most unfit to pursue the subject private    circumstances of no common interest are upon me as i have become very    recently engaged to miss glynne and i hope your recollections will    enable you in some degree to excuse me  lord jeffrey has a very curious and suggestive letter on popular education in which he denies or at least doubts the effect of this education on morals  he however supports it on the ground that it will increase the enjoyment of individuals which is certainly a very sensible claim  humboldt writes to her about an old indian language which was preserved by a parrot the tribe who spoke it having been exterminated and about young darwin who had just published his first book  here are some extracts from her own letters     i heard from lord lansdowne two or three days ago     i think he    is ce que nous avons de mieux  he wants only the energy that great    ambition gives  he says we shall have a parliament of railway    kings    what can be worse than thatthe deification of money by    a whole people  as lord brougham says we have no right to give    ourselves pharisaical airs  i must give you a story sent to me  mrs    hudson the railway queen was shown a bust of marcus aurelius at lord    westminsters on which she said i suppose that is not the present    marquis  to gouter this you must know that the extreme vulgar    hackney coachmen etc in england pronounce marquis very like    marcus     dec 11thwent to savignys  nobody was there but w grimm and his    wife and a few men  grimm told me he had received two volumes of    norwegian fairytales and that they were delightful  talking of    them i said your children appear to be the happiest in the world    they live in the midst of fairytales  ah said he i must tell    you about that  when we were at gottingen somebody spoke to my    little son about his fathers mahrchen  he had read them but never    thought of their being mine  he came running to me and said with an    offended air father they say you wrote those fairytales surely    you never invented such silly rubbish  he thought it below my    dignity     savigny told a volksmahrchen too     st anselm was grown old and infirm and lay on the ground among    thorns and thistles  der liebe gott said to him you are very badly    lodged there why dont you build yourself a house  before i take    the trouble said anselm i should like to know how long i have to    live  about thirty years said der liebe gott  oh for so short    a time replied he its not worth while and turned himself round    among the thistles     dr franck told me a story of which i had never heard before  voltaire    had for some reason or other taken a grudge against the prophet    habakkuk and affected to find in him things he never wrote  somebody    took the bible and began to demonstrate to him that he was mistaken    cest egal he said impatiently habakkuk etait capable de tout     oct 30 1853     i am not in love with the richtung tendency of our modern novelists    there is abundance of talent but writing a pretty graceful    touching yet pleasing story is the last thing our writers nowadays    think of  their novels are party pamphlets on political or social    questions like sybil or alton locke or mary barton or uncle tom    or they are the most minute and painful dissections of the least    agreeable and beautiful parts of our nature like those of miss    brontejane eyre and villette or they are a kind of martyrology    like mrs marshs emilia wyndham which makes you almost doubt whether    any torments the heroine would have earned by being naughty could    exceed those she incurred by her virtue     where oh where is the charming humane gentle spirit that dictated    the vicar of wakefieldthe spirit which goethe so justly calls    versohnend reconciling with all the weaknesses and woes of    humanity     have you read thackerays esmond  it is a curious    and very successful attempt to imitate the style of our old novelists        which of mrs gores novels are translated  they are very    clever lively worldly bitter disagreeable and entertaining       miss austensare they translated  they are not new and are dutch    paintings of everyday peoplevery clever very true very    unaesthetic but amusing  i have not seen ruth by mrs gaskell  i    hear it much admiredand blamed  it is one of the many proofs of the    desire women now have to friser questionable topics and to poser    insoluble moral problems  george sand has turned their heads in that    direction  i think a few broad scenes or hearty jokes a la fielding    were very harmless in comparison  they confounded nothing        the heir of redcliffe i have not read     i am not worthy of    superhuman flights of virtuein a novel  i want to see how people    act and suffer who are as goodfornothing as i am myself  then i    have the sinful pretension to be amused whereas all our novelists    want to reform us and to show us what a hideous place this world is    ma foi je ne le sais que trap without their help     the head of the family has some merits    but there is too much    affliction and misery and frenzy  the heroine is one of those    creatures now so common in novels who remind me of a poor bird tied    to a stake as was once the cruel sport of boys to be shyed at    ie pelted till it died only our gentle ladywriters at the end of    all untie the poor battered bird and assure us that it is never the    worse for all the blows it has hadnay the betterand that now    with its broken wings and torn feathers and bruised body it is going    to be quite happy  no fair ladies you know that it is not    soresigned if you please but make me no shams of happiness out    of such wrecks  in politics mrs austin was a philosophical tory  radicalism she detested and she and most of her friends seem to have regarded it as moribund  the radical party is evidently effete she writes to m victor cousin the probable leader of the tory party is mr gladstone the people must be instructed must be guided must be in short governed she writes elsewhere and in a letter to dr whewell she says that the state of things in france fills me with the deepest anxiety on one pointthe point on which the permanency of our institutions and our salvation as a nation turn  are our higher classes able to keep the lead of the rest  if they are we are safe if not i agree with my poor dear charles bullerour turn must come  now cambridge and oxford must really look to this  the belief in the power of the universities to stem the current of democracy is charming  she grew to regard carlyle as one of the dissolvents of the ageas mischievous as his extravagances will let him be speaks of kingsley and maurice as pernicious and talks of john stuart mill as a demagogue  she was no doctrinaire  one ounce of education demanded is worth a pound imposed  it is no use to give the meat before you give the hunger  she was delighted at a letter of st hilaires in which he said we have a system and no results you have results and no system  yet she had a deep sympathy with the wants of the people  she was horrified at something babbage told her of the population of some of the manufacturing towns who are worked out before they attain to thirty years of age  but i am persuaded that the remedy will not cannot come from the people she adds  many of her letters are concerned with the question of the higher education of women  she discusses buckles lecture on the influence of women upon the progress of knowledge admits to m guizot that womens intellectual life is largely coloured by the emotions but adds one is not precisely a fool because ones opinions are greatly influenced by ones affections  the opinions of men are often influenced by worse things  dr whewell consults her about lecturing women on plato being slightly afraid lest people should think it ridiculous comte writes her elaborate letters on the relation of women to progress and mr gladstone promises that mrs gladstone will carry out at hawarden the suggestions contained in one of her pamphlets  she was always very practical and never lost her admiration for plain sewing  all through the book we come across interesting and amusing things  she gets st hilaire to order a large sensible bonnet for her in paris which was at once christened the aristotelian and was supposed to be the only useful bonnet in england  grote has to leave paris after the coup detat he tells her because he cannot bear to see the establishment of a greek tyrant  alfred de vigny macaulay john stirling southey alexis de tocqueville hallam and jean jacques ampere all contribute to these pleasant pages  she seems to have inspired the warmest feelings of friendship in those who knew her  guizot writes to her madame de stael used to say that the best thing in the world was a serious frenchman  i turn the compliment and say that the best thing in the world is an affectionate englishman  how much more an englishwoman given equal qualities a woman is always more charming than a man  lucie austin afterwards lady duff gordon was born in 1821  her chief playfellow was john stuart mill and jeremy benthams garden was her playground  she was a lovely romantic child who was always wanting the flowers to talk to her and used to invent the most wonderful stories about animals of whom she was passionately fond  in 1834 mrs austin decided on leaving england and sydney smith wrote his immortal letter to the little girl     lucie lucie my dear child dont tear your frock tearing frocks is    not of itself a proof of genius  but write as your mother writes act    as your mother acts be frank loyal affectionate simple honest    and then integrity or laceration of frock is of little import  and    lucie dear child mind your arithmetic  you know in the first sum of    yours i ever saw there was a mistake  you had carried two as a cab    is licensed to do and you ought dear lucie to have carried but    one  is this a trifle  what would life be without arithmetic but a    scene of horrors  you are going to boulogne the city of debts    peopled by men who have never understood arithmetic  by the time you    return i shall probably have received my first paralytic stroke and    shall have lost all recollection of you  therefore i now give you my    parting advicedont marry anybody who has not a tolerable    understanding and a thousand a year  and god bless you dear child  at boulogne she sat next heine at table dhote  he heard me speak german to my mother and soon began to talk to me and then said when you go back to england you can tell your friends that you have seen heinrich heine  i replied and who is heinrich heine  he laughed heartily and took no offence at my ignorance and we used to lounge on the end of the pier together where he told me stories in which fish mermaids watersprites and a very funny old french fiddler with a poodle were mixed up in the most fanciful manner sometimes humorous and very often pathetic especially when the watersprites brought him greetings from the nord see  he was    so kind to me and so sarcastic to every one else  twenty years afterwards the little girl whose braune augen heine had celebrated in his charming poem wenn ich an deinem hause used to go and see the dying poet in paris  it does one good he said to her to see a woman who does not carry about a broken heart to be mended by all sorts of men like the women here who do not see that a total want of heart is their real failing  on another occasion he said to her i have now made peace with the whole world and at last also with god who sends thee to me as a beautiful angel of death i shall certainly soon die  lady duff gordon said to him poor poet do you still retain such splendid illusions that you transform a travelling englishwoman into azrael  that used not to be the case for you always disliked us  he answered yes i do not know what possessed me to dislike the english    it really was only petulance i never hated them indeed i never knew them  i was only once in england but knew no one and found london very dreary and the people and the streets odious but england has revenged herself well she has sent me most excellent friendsthyself and milnes that good milnes  there are delightful letters from dicky doyle here with the most amusing drawings one of the present sir robert peel as he made his maiden speech in the house being excellent and the various descriptions of hassans performances are extremely amusing  hassan was a black boy who had been turned away by his master because he was going blind and was found by lady duff gordon one night sitting on her doorstep  she took care of him and had him cured and he seems to have been a constant source of delight to every one  on one occasion when prince louis napoleon the late emperor of the french came in unexpectedly he gravely said please my lady i ran out and bought twopenny worth of sprats for the prince and for the honour of the house  here is an amusing letter from mrs norton     my dear luciewe have never thanked you for the red pots which no    early christian should be without and which add that finishing stroke    to the splendour of our demesne which was supposed to depend on a    rocs egg in less intelligent times  we have now a warm pompeian    appearance and the constant contemplation of these classical objects    favours the beauty of the facial line for what can be deduced from    the great fact apparent in all the states of antiquity that    straight noses were the ancient custom but the logical assumption    that the constant habit of turning up the nose at unsightly    objectssuch as the national gallery and other offensive and    obtrusive thingshas produced the modern divergence from the true and    proper line of profile  i rejoice to think that we ourselves are    exempt  i attribute this to our love of pompeian pots on account of    the beauty and distinction of this pots shape i spell it with a big    p which has kept us straight in a world of crookedness  the pursuit    of profiles under difficultieshow much more rare than a pursuit of    knowledge  talk of setting good examples before our children  bah    let us set good pompeian pots before our children and when they grow    up they will not depart from them  lady duff gordons letters from the cape and her brilliant translation of the amber witch are of course well known  the latter book was with lady wildes translation of sidonia the sorceress my favourite romantic reading when a boy  her letters from egypt are wonderfully vivid and picturesque  here is an interesting bit of art criticism     sheykh yoosuf laughed so heartily over a print in an illustrated paper    from a picture of hiltons of rebekah at the well with the old    wekeel of sidi ibraheem abrahams chief servant kneeling    before the girl he was sent to fetch like an old fool without his    turban and rebekah and the other girls in queer fancy dresses and    the camels with snouts like pigs  if the painter could not go into    es sham to see how the arab really look said sheykh yoosuf why    did he not paint a well in england with girls like english    peasantsat least it would have looked natural to english people and    the wekeel would not seem so like a madman if he had taken off a hat    i cordially agree with yoosufs art criticism  fancy pictures of    eastern things are hopelessly absurd  mrs ross has certainly produced a most fascinating volume and her book is one of the books of the season  it is edited with tact and judgment        caroline by lady lindsay is certainly lady lindsays best work  it is written in a very clever modern style and is as full of esprit and wit as it is of subtle psychological insight  caroline is an heiress who coming downstairs at a continental hotel falls into the arms of a charming penniless young man  the hero of the novel is the young mans friend lord lexamont who makes the great renunciation and succeeds in being fine without being priggish and quixotic without being ridiculous  miss ffoulkes the elderly spinster is a capital character and indeed the whole book is cleverly written  it has also the advantage of being in only one volume  the influence of mudie on literature the baneful influence of the circulating library is clearly on the wane  the gain to literature is incalculable  english novels were becoming very tedious with their three volumes of paddingat least the second volume was always paddingand extremely indigestible  a reckless punster once remarked to me apropos of english novels that the proof of the padding is in the eating and certainly english fiction has been very heavyheavy with the best intentions  lady lindsays book is a sign that better things are in store for us  she is brief and bright        what are the best books to give as christmas presents to good girls who are always pretty or to pretty girls who are occasionally good  people are so fond of giving away what they do not want themselves that charity is largely on the increase  but with this kind of charity i have not much sympathy  if one gives away a book it should be a charming bookso charming that one regrets having given it and would not take it back looking over the christmas books sent to me by various publishers i find that these are the best and the most pleasing gleanings from the graphic by randolph caldecott a most fascinating volume full of sketches that have real wit and humour of line and are not simply dependent on what the french call the legende the literary explanation megs friend by alice corkran one of our most delicate and graceful prosewriters in the sphere of fiction and one whose work has the rare artistic qualities of refinement and simplicity under false colours by sarah doudney an excellent story the fishermans daughter by florence montgomery the author of misunderstood a tale with real charm of idea and treatment under a cloud by the author of the atelier du lys and quite worthy of its author the third miss st quentin by mrs molesworth and a christmas posy from the same fascinating pen and with delightful illustrations by walter crane  miss rosa mulhollands giannetta and miss agnes gibernes ralph hardcastles will are also admirable books for presents and the bound volume of atalanta has much that is delightful both in art and in literature  the prettiest indeed the most beautiful book from an artistic point of view is undoubtedly mr walter cranes floras feast  it is an imaginative masque of flowers and as lovely in colour as it is exquisite in design  it shows us the whole pomp and pageant of the year the snowdrops like whitecrested knights the little naked crocus kneeling to catch the sunlight in his golden chalice the daffodils blowing their trumpets like young hunters the anemones with their windblown raiment the greenkirtled marshmarigolds and the ladysmocks all silverwhite tripping over the meadows like arcadian milkmaids buttercups are here and the whiteplumed thorn in spiky armour and the crownimperial borne in stately procession and redbannered tulips and hyacinths with their spring bells and chaucers daisy        small and sweet    si douce est la marguerite  gorgeous peonies and columbines that drew the car of venus and the rose with her lover and the stately whitevestured lilies and wide staring oxeyes and scarlet poppies pass before us  there are primroses and corncockles chrysanthemums in robes of rich brocade sunflowers and tall hollyhocks and pale christmas roses  the designs for the daffodils the wild roses the convolvulus and the hollyhock are admirable and would be beautiful in embroidery or in any precious material  indeed any one who wishes to find beautiful designs cannot do better than get the book  it is in its way a little masterpiece and its grace and fancy and beauty of line and colour cannot be overestimated  the greeks gave human form to wood and stream and saw nature best in naiad or in dryad  mr crane with something of gothic fantasy has caught the greek feeling the love of personification the passion for representing things under the conditions of the human form the flowers are to him so many knights and ladies pageboys or shepherd boys divine nymphs or simple girls and in their fair bodies or fanciful raiment one can see the flowers very form and absolute essence so that one loves their artistic truth no less than their artistic beauty  this book contains some of the best work mr crane has ever done  his art is never so successful as when it is entirely remote from life  the slightest touch of actuality seems to kill it  it lives or should live in a world of its own fashioning  it is decorative in its complete subordination of fact to beauty of effect in the grandeur of its curves and lines in its entirely imaginative treatment  almost every page of this book gives a suggestion for some rich tapestry some fine screen some painted cassone some carving in wood or ivory        from messrs hildesheimer and faulkner i have received a large collection of christmas cards and illustrated books  one of the latter an edition de luxe of sheridans heres to the maiden of bashful fifteen is very cleverly illustrated by miss alice havers and mr ernest wilson  it seems to me however that there is a danger of modern illustration becoming too pictorial  what we need is good bookornament decorative ornament that will go with type and printing and give to each page a harmony and unity of effect  merely dotting a page with reproductions of watercolour drawings will not do  it is true that japanese art which is essentially decorative is pictorial also  but the japanese have the most wonderful delicacy of touch and with a science so subtle that it gives the effect of exquisite accident they can by mere placing make an undecorated space decorative  there is also an intimate connection between their art and their handwriting or printed characters  they both go together and show the same feeling for form and line  our aim should be to discover some mode of illustration that will harmonise with the shapes of our letters  at present there is a discord between our pictorial illustrations and our unpictorial type  the former are too essentially imitative in character and often disturb a page instead of decorating it  however i suppose we must regard most of these christmas books merely as books of pictures with a running accompaniment of explanatory text  as the text as a rule consists of poetry this is putting the poet in a very subordinate position but the poetry in the books of this kind is not as a rule of a very high order of excellence  1 three generations of english women  memoirs and correspondence of susannah taylor sarah austin and lady duff

january 3 1889  prison has had an admirable effect on mr wilfrid blunt as a poet  the love sonnets of proteus in spite of their clever mussetlike modernities and their swift brilliant wit were but affected or fantastic at best they were simply the records of passing moods and moments of which some were sad and others sweet and not a few shameful  their subject was not of high or serious import  they contained much that was wilful and weak in vinculis upon the other hand is a book that stirs one by its fine sincerity of purpose its lofty and impassioned thought its depth and ardour of intense feeling  imprisonment says mr blunt in his preface is a reality of discipline most useful to the modern soul lapped as it is in physical sloth and selfindulgence  like a sickness or a spiritual retreat it purifies and ennobles and the soul emerges from it stronger and more selfcontained  to him certainly it has been a mode of purification  the opening sonnets composed in the bleak cell of galway gaol and written down on the flyleaves of the prisoners prayerbook are full of things nobly conceived and nobly uttered and show that though mr balfour may enforce plain living by his prison regulations he cannot prevent high thinking or in any way limit or constrain the freedom of a mans soul  they are of course intensely personal in expression  they could not fail to be so  but the personality that they reveal has nothing petty or ignoble about it  the petulant cry of the shallow egoist which was the chief characteristic of the love sonnets of proteus is not to be found here  in its place we have wild grief and terrible scorn fierce rage and flamelike passion such a sonnet as the following comes out of the very fire of heart and brain     god knows twas not with a forereasoned plan       i left the easeful dwellings of my peace    and sought this combat with ungodly man       and ceaseless still through years that do not cease       have warred with powers and principalities    my natural soul ere yet these strifes began       was as a sister diligent to please    and loving all and most the human clan     god knows it  and he knows how the worlds tears       touched me  and he is witness of my wrath    how it was kindled against murderers       who slew for gold and how upon their path    i met them  since which day the world in arms    strikes at my life with angers and alarms  and this sonnet has all the strange strength of that despair which is but the prelude to a larger hope     i thought to do a deed of chivalry       an act of worth which haply in her sight    who was my mistress should recorded be       and of the nations  and when thus the fight       faltered and men once bold with faces white    turned this and that way in excuse to flee       i only stood and by the foemans might    was overborne and mangled cruelly     then crawled i to her feet in whose dear cause       i made this venture and behold i said    how i am wounded for thee in these wars       but she poor cripple wouldst thou i should wed    a limbless trunk and laughing turned from me    yet she was fair and her name liberty  the sonnet beginning     a prison is a convent without god       poverty chastity obedience    its precepts are  is very fine and this written just after entering the gaol is powerful     naked i came into the world of pleasure       and naked come i to this house of pain    here at the gate i lay down my lifes treasure       my pride my garments and my name with men       the world and i henceforth shall be as twain    no sound of me shall pierce for good or ill       these walls of grief  nor shall i hear the vain    laughter and tears of those who love me still     within what new life waits me  little ease       cold lying hunger nights of wakefulness    harsh orders given no voice to soothe or please       poor thieves for friends for books rules meaningless    this is the gravenay hell  yet lord of might    still in thy light my spirit shall see light  but indeed all the sonnets are worth reading and the canon of aughrim the longest poem in the book is a most masterly and dramatic description of the tragic life of the irish peasant  literature is not much indebted to mr balfour for his sophistical defence of philosophic doubt which is one of the dullest books we know but it must be admitted that by sending mr blunt to gaol he has converted a clever rhymer into an earnest and deepthinking poet  the narrow confines of the prison cell seem to suit the sonnets scanty plot of ground and an unjust imprisonment for a noble cause strengthens as well as deepens the nature  in vinculis  by wilfrid scawen blunt author of the wind and the whirlwind the love sonnets of proteus etc etc  kegan paul

the nineteenth century in america freely fully and truly on record  i could not find any similar personal record in current literature that satisfied me  in these words walt whitman gives us the true attitude we should adopt towards his work having indeed a much saner view of the value and meaning of that work than either his eloquent admirers or noisy detractors can boast of possessing  his last book november boughs as he calls it published in the winter of the old mans life reveals to us not indeed a souls tragedy for its last note is one of joy and hope and noble and unshaken faith in all that is fine and worthy of such faith but certainly the drama of a human soul and puts on record with a simplicity that has in it both sweetness and strength the record of his spiritual development and of the aim and motive both of the manner and the matter of his work  his strange mode of expression is shown in these pages to have been the result of deliberate and selfconscious choice the barbaric yawp which he sent over the roofs of the world so many years ago and which wrung from mr swinburnes lip such lofty panegyric in song and such loud clamorous censure in prose appears here in what will be to many an entirely new light  for in his very rejection of art walt whitman is an artist  he tried to produce a certain effect by certain means and he succeeded  there is much method in what many have termed his madness too much method indeed some may be tempted to fancy  in the story of his life as he tells it to us we find him at the age of sixteen beginning a definite and philosophical study of literature     summers and falls i used to go off sometimes for a week at a    stretch down in the country or to long islands seashoresthere in    the presence of outdoor influences i went over thoroughly the old and    new testaments and absorbd probably to better advantage for me than    in any library or indoor roomit makes such difference where you    read shakspere ossian the best translated versions i could get of    homer eschylus sophocles the old german nibelungen the ancient    hindoo poems and one or two other masterpieces dantes among them    as it happened i read the latter mostly in an old wood  the iliad       i read first thoroughly on the peninsula of orient northeast end    of long island in a sheltered hollow of rock and sand with the sea    on each side  i have wonderd since why i was not overwhelmed by    those mighty masters  likely because i read them as described in    the full presence of nature under the sun with the farspreading    landscape and vistas or the sea rolling in  edgar allan poes amusing bit of dogmatism that for our occasions and our day there can be no such thing as a long poem fascinated him the same thought had been haunting my mind before he said but poes argument    workd the sum out and proved it to me and the english translation of the bible seems to have suggested to him the possibility of a poetic form which while retaining the spirit of poetry would still be free from the trammels of rhyme and of a definite metrical system having thus to a certain degree settled upon what one might call the technique of whitmanism he began to brood upon the nature of that spirit which was to give life to the strange form  the central point of the poetry of the future seemed to him to be necessarily an identical body and soul a personality in fact which personality he tells us frankly after many considerations and ponderings i deliberately settled should be myself  however for the true creation and revealing of this personality at first only dimly felt a new stimulus was needed  this came from the civil war  after describing the many dreams and passions of his boyhood and early manhood he goes on to say     these however and much more might have gone on and come to naught    almost positively would have come to naught if a sudden vast    terrible direct and indirect stimulus for new and national    declamatory expression had not been given to me  it is certain i    say that although i had made a start before only from the occurrence    of the secession war and what it showd me as by flashes of    lightning with the emotional depths it sounded and arousd of    course i dont mean in my own heart only i saw it just as plainly in    others in millionsthat only from the strong flare and provocation    of that wars sights and scenes the final reasonsforbeing of an    autochthonic and passionate song definitely came forth     i went down to the war fields of virginia    lived thenceforward in    campsaw great battles and the days and nights afterwardpartook of    all the fluctuations gloom despair hopes again arousd courage    evokeddeath readily riskdthe cause tooalong and filling    those agonistic and lurid following years    the real parturition    years    of this henceforth homogeneous union  without those three    or four years and the experiences they gave leaves of grass would not    now be existing  having thus obtained the necessary stimulus for the quickening and awakening of the personal self some day to be endowed with universality he sought to find new notes of song and passing beyond the mere passion for expression he aimed at suggestiveness first     i round and finish little if anything and could not consistently    with my scheme  the reader will have his or her part to do just as    much as i have had mine  i seek less to state or display any theme or    thought and more to bring you reader into the atmosphere of the    theme or thoughtthere to pursue your own flight  another impetusword is comradeship and other wordsigns are good cheer content and hope  individuality especially he sought for     i have allowed the stress of my poems from beginning to end to bear    upon american individuality and assist itnot only because that is a    great lesson in nature amid all her generalising laws but as    counterpoise to the leveling tendencies of democracyand for other    reasons  defiant of ostensible literary and other conventions i    avowedly chant the great pride of man in himself and permit it to    be more or less a motif of nearly all my verse  i think this pride    indispensable to an american  i think it not inconsistent with    obedience humility deference and selfquestioning  a new theme also was to be found in the relation of the sexes conceived in a natural simple and healthy form and he protests against poor mr william rossettis attempt to bowdlerise and expurgate his song     from another point of view leaves of grass is avowedly the song of sex    and amativeness and even animalitythough meanings that do not    usually go along with these words are behind all and will duly    emerge and all are sought to be lifted into a different light and    atmosphere  of this feature intentionally palpable in a few lines i    shall only say the espousing principle of those lines so gives breath    to my whole scheme that the bulk of the pieces might as well have been    left unwritten were those lines omitted        universal as are certain facts and symptoms of communities    there    is nothing so rare in modern conventions and poetry as their normal    recognizance  literature is always calling in the doctor for    consultation and confession and always giving evasions and swathing    suppressions in place of that heroic nudity on which only a genuine    diagnosis    can be built  and in respect to editions of leaves of    grass in time to come if there should be such i take occasion now to    confirm those lines with the settled convictions and deliberate    renewals of thirty years and to hereby prohibit as far as word of    mine can do so any elision of them  but beyond all these notes and moods and motives is the lofty spirit of a grand and free acceptance of all things that are worthy of existence  he desired he says to formulate a poem whose every thought or fact should directly or indirectly be or connive at an implicit belief in the wisdom health mystery beauty of every process every concrete object every human or other existence not only considerd from the point of view of all but of each  his two final utterances are that really great poetry is always    the result of a national spirit and not the privilege of a polishd and select few and that the strongest and sweetest songs yet remain to be sung  such are the views contained in the opening essay a backward glance oer traveld roads as he calls it but there are many other essays in this fascinating volume some on poets such as burns and lord tennyson for whom walt whitman has a profound admiration some on old actors and singers the elder booth forrest alboni and mario being his special favourites others on the native indians on the spanish element in american nationality on western slang on the poetry of the bible and on abraham lincoln  but walt whitman is at his best when he is analysing his own work and making schemes for the poetry of the future  literature to him has a distinctly social aim  he seeks to build up the masses by building up grand individuals  and yet literature itself must be preceded by noble forms of life  the best literature is always the result of something far greater than itselfnot the hero but the portrait of the hero  before there can be recorded history or poem there must be the transaction  certainly in walt whitmans views there is a largeness of vision a healthy sanity and a fine ethical purpose  he is not to be placed with the professional litterateurs of his country boston novelists new york poets and the like  he stands apart and the chief value of his work is in its prophecy not in its performance  he has begun a prelude to larger themes  he is the herald to a new era  as a man he is the precursor of a fresh type  he is a factor in the heroic and spiritual evolution of the human being  if poetry has passed him by philosophy will take note of him  november boughs  by walt whitman  alexander gardner     the new president   pall mall gazette january 26 1889  in a little book that he calls the enchanted island mr wyke bayliss the new president of the royal society of british artists has given his gospel of art to the world  his predecessor in office had also a gospel of art but it usually took the form of an autobiography  mr whistler always spelt art and we believe still spells it with a capital i however he was never dull  his brilliant wit his caustic satire and his amusing epigrams or perhaps we should say epitaphs on his contemporaries made his views on art as delightful as they were misleading and as fascinating as they were unsound  besides he introduced american humour into art criticism and for this if for no other reason he deserves to be affectionately remembered  mr wyke bayliss upon the other hand is rather tedious  the last president never said much that was true but the present president never says anything that is new and if art be a fairyhaunted wood or an enchanted island we must say that we prefer the old puck to the fresh prospero water is an admirable thingat least the greeks said it wasand mr ruskin is an admirable writer but a combination of both is a little depressing  still it is only right to add that mr wyke bayliss at his best writes very good english  mr whistler for some reason or other always adopted the phraseology of the minor prophets  possibly it was in order to emphasise his wellknown claims to verbal inspiration or perhaps he thought with voltaire that habakkuk etait capable de tout and wished to shelter himself under the shield of a definitely irresponsible writer none of whose prophecies according to the french philosopher has ever been fulfilled  the idea was clever enough at the beginning but ultimately the manner became monotonous  the spirit of the hebrews is excellent but their mode of writing is not to be imitated and no amount of american jokes will give it that modernity which is essential to a good literary style  admirable as are mr whistlers fireworks on canvas his fireworks in prose are abrupt violent and exaggerated however oracles since the days of the pythia have never been remarkable for style and the modest mr wyke bayliss is as much mr whistlers superior as a writer as he is his inferior as a painter and an artist  indeed some of the passages in this book are so charmingly written and with such felicity of phrase that we cannot help feeling that the president of the british artists like a still more famous president of our day can express himself far better through the medium of literature than he can through the medium of line and colour  this however applies only to mr wyke baylisss prose  his poetry is very bad and the sonnets at the end of the book are almost as mediocre as the drawings that accompany them  as we read them we cannot but regret that in this point at any rate mr bayliss has not imitated the wise example of his predecessor who with all his faults was never guilty of writing a line of poetry and is indeed quite incapable of doing anything of the kind  as for the matter of mr baylisss discourses his views on art must be admitted to be very commonplace and oldfashioned  what is the use of telling artists that they should try and paint nature as she really is what nature really is is a question for metaphysics not for art  art deals with appearances and the eye of the man who looks at nature the vision in fact of the artist is far more important to us than what he looks at  there is more truth in corots aphorism that a landscape is simply the mood of a mans mind than there is in all mr baylisss laborious disquisitions on naturalism  again why does mr bayliss waste a whole chapter in pointing out real or supposed resemblances between a book of his published twelve years ago and an article by mr palgrave which appeared recently in the nineteenth century  neither the book nor the article contains anything of real interest and as for the hundred or more parallel passages which mr wyke bayliss solemnly prints side by side most of them are like parallel lines and never meet  the only original proposal that mr bayliss has to offer us is that the house of commons should every year select some important event from national and contemporary history and hand it over to the artists who are to choose from among themselves a man to make a picture of it  in this way mr bayliss believes that we could have the historic art and suggests as examples of what he means a picture of florence nightingale in the hospital at scutari a picture of the opening of the first london board school and a picture of the senate house at cambridge with the girl graduate receiving a degree that shall acknowledge her to be as wise as merlin himself and leave her still as beautiful as vivien  this proposal is of course very well meant but to say nothing of the danger of leaving historic art at the mercy of a majority in the house of commons who would naturally vote for its own view of things mr bayliss does not seem to realise that a great event is not necessarily a pictorial event  the decisive events of the world as has been well said take place in the intellect and as for boardschools academic ceremonies hospital wards and the like they may well be left to the artists of the illustrated papers who do them admirably and quite as well as they need be done  indeed the pictures of contemporary events royal marriages naval reviews and things of this kind that appear in the academy every year are always extremely bad while the very same subjects treated in black and white in the graphic or the london news are excellent  besides if we want to understand the history of a nation through the medium of art it is to the imaginative and ideal arts that we have to go and not to the arts that are definitely imitative  the visible aspect of life no longer contains for us the secret of lifes spirit  probably it never did contain it  and if mr barkers waterloo banquet and mr friths marriage of the prince of wales are examples of healthy historic art the less we have of such art the better  however mr bayliss is full of the most ardent faith and speaks quite gravely of genuine portraits of st john st peter and st paul dating from the first century and of the establishment by the israelites of a school of art in the wilderness under the now little appreciated bezaleel  he is a pleasant picturesque writer but he should not speak about art  art is a sealed book to him  the enchanted island  by wyke bayliss fsa president of the royal society of british artists  allen and co     some literary notesii   womans world february 1889  the various collectors of irish folklore says mr w b yeats in his charming little book fairy and folk tales of the irish peasantry have from our point of view one great merit and from the point of view of others one great fault     they have made their work literature rather than science and told us    of the irish peasantry rather than of the primitive religion of    mankind or whatever else the folklorists are on the gad after  to    be considered scientists they should have tabulated all their tales in    forms like grocers billsitem the fairy king item the queen    instead of this they have caught the very voice of the people the    very pulse of life each giving what was most noticed in his day    croker and lover full of the ideas of harumscarum irish gentility    saw everything humorised  the impulse of the irish literature of    their time came from a class that did notmainly for political    reasonstake the populace seriously and imagined the country as a    humorists arcadia its passion its gloom its tragedy they knew    nothing of  what they did was not wholly false they merely magnified    an irresponsible type found oftenest among boatmen carmen and    gentlemens servants into the type of a whole nation and created the    stage irishman  the writers of fortyeight and the famine combined    burst their bubble  their work had the dash as well as the    shallowness of an ascendant and idle class and in croker is touched    everywhere with beautya gentle arcadian beauty  carleton a peasant    born has in many of his stories    more especially in his ghost    stories a much more serious way with him for all his humour    kennedy an old bookseller in dublin who seems to have had a    something of genuine belief in the fairies comes next in time  he    has far less literary faculty but is wonderfully accurate giving    often the very words the stories were told in  but the best book    since croker is lady wildes ancient legends  the humour has all    given way to pathos and tenderness  we have here the innermost heart    of the celt in the moments he has grown to love through years of    persecution when cushioning himself about with dreams and hearing    fairysongs in the twilight he ponders on the soul and on the dead    here is the celt only it is the celt dreaming  into a volume of very moderate dimensions and of extremely moderate price mr yeats has collected together the most characteristic of our irish folklore stories grouping them together according to subject first come the trooping fairies  the peasants say that these are fallen angels who were not good enough to be saved nor bad enough to be lost but the irish antiquarians see in them the gods of pagan ireland who when no longer worshipped and fed with offerings dwindled away in the popular imagination and now are only a few spans high  their chief occupations are feasting fighting making love and playing the most beautiful music  they have only one industrious person amongst them the lepracaunthe shoemaker  it is his duty to repair their shoes when they wear them out with dancing  mr yeats tells us that near the village of ballisodare is a little woman who lived amongst them seven years  when she came home she had no toesshe had danced them off  on may eve every seventh year they fight for the harvest for the best ears of grain belong to them  an old man informed mr yeats that he saw them fight once and that they tore the thatch off a house  had any one else been near they would merely have seen a great wind whirling everything into the air as it passed  when the wind drives the leaves and straws before it that is the fairies and the peasants take off their hats and say god bless them  when they are gay they sing  many of the most beautiful tunes of ireland are only their music caught up by eavesdroppers  no prudent peasant would hum the pretty girl milking the cow near a fairy rath for they are jealous and do not like to hear their songs on clumsy mortal lips  blake once saw a fairys funeral but this as mr yeats points out must have been an english fairy for the irish fairies never die they are immortal  then come the solitary fairies amongst whom we find the little lepracaun mentioned above  he has grown very rich as he possesses all the treasurecrocks buried in wartime  in the early part of this century according to croker they used to show in tipperary a little shoe forgotten by the fairy shoemaker  then there are two rather disreputable little fairiesthe cluricaun who gets intoxicated in gentlemens cellars and the red man who plays unkind practical jokes  the fear gorta man of hunger is an emaciated phantom that goes through the land in famine time begging an alms and bringing good luck to the giver  the watersheerie is own brother to the english jackolantern  the leanhaun shee fairy mistress seeks the love of mortals  if they refuse she must be their slave if they consent they are hers and can only escape by finding another to take their place  the fairy lives on their life and they waste away  death is no escape from her  she is the gaelic muse for she gives inspiration to those she persecutes  the gaelic poets die young for she is restless and will not let them remain long on earth  the pooka is essentially an animal spirit and some have considered him the forefather of shakespeares puck  he lives on solitary mountains and among old ruins grown monstrous with much solitude and is of the race of the nightmare  he has many shapesis now a horse    now a goat now an eagle  like all spirits he is only half in the world of form  the banshee does not care much for our democratic levelling tendencies she loves only old families and despises the parvenu or the nouveau riche  when more than one banshee is present and they wail and sing in chorus it is for the death of some holy or great one  an omen that sometimes accompanies the banshee is    an immense black coach mounted by a coffin and drawn by headless horses driven by a dullahan  a dullahan is the most terrible thing in the world  in 1807 two of the sentries stationed outside st jamess park saw one climbing the railings and died of fright  mr yeats suggests that they are possibly descended from that irish giant who swam across the channel with his head in his teeth  then come the stories of ghosts of saints and priests and of giants the ghosts live in a state intermediary between this world and the next they are held there by some earthly longing or affection or some duty unfulfilled or anger against the living they are those who are too good for hell and too bad for heaven  sometimes they take the forms of insects especially of butterflies  the author of the parochial survey of ireland heard a woman say to a child who was chasing a butterfly how do you know it is not the soul of your grandfather  on november eve they are abroad and dance with the fairies  as for the saints and priests there are no martyrs in the stories  that ancient chronicler giraldus cambrensis taunted the archbishop of cashel because no one in ireland had received the crown of martyrdom  our people may be barbarous the prelate answered but they have never lifted their hands against gods saints but now that a people have come amongst us who know how to make them it was just after the english invasion we shall have martyrs plentifully  the giants were the old pagan heroes of ireland who grew bigger and bigger just as the gods grew smaller and smaller the fact is they did not wait for offerings they took them vi et armis  some of the prettiest stories are those that cluster round tirnanog this is the country of the young for age and death have not found it neither tears nor loud laughter have gone near it  one man has gone there and returned  the bard oisen who wandered away on a white horse moving on the surface of the foam with his fairy niamh lived there three hundred years and then returned looking for his comrades  the moment his foot touched the earth his three hundred years fell on him and he was bowed double and his beard swept the ground  he described his sojourn in the land of youth to patrick before he died  since then according to mr yeats many have seen it in many places some in the depths of lakes and have heard rising therefrom a vague sound of bells more have seen it far off on the horizon as they peered out from the western cliffs  not three years ago a fisherman imagined that he saw it  mr yeats has certainly done his work very well  he has shown great critical capacity in his selection of the stories and his little introductions are charmingly written  it is delightful to come across a collection of purely imaginative work and mr yeats has a very quick instinct in finding out the best and the most beautiful things in irish folklore  i am also glad to see that he has not confined himself entirely to prose but has included allinghams lovely poem on the fairies     up the airy mountain       down the rushy glen    we darent go ahunting       for fear of little men    wee folk good folk       trooping all together    green jacket red cap       and white owls feather     down along the rocky shore       some make their home    they live on crispy pancakes       of yellow tidefoam    some in the reeds       of the black mountain lake    with frogs for their watchdogs       all night awake     high on the hilltop       the old king sits    he is now so old and gray       hes nigh lost his wits    with a bridge of white mist       columbkill he crosses    on his stately journeys       from slieveleague to rosses    or going up with music       on cold starry nights    to sup with the queen       of the gay northern lights  all lovers of fairy tales and folklore should get this little book  the horned women the priests soul 411 and teig okane are really marvellous in their way and indeed there is hardly a single story that is not worth reading and thinking over  the wittiest writer in france at present is a woman  that clever that spirituelle grande dame who has adopted the pseudonym of gyp has in her own country no rival  her wit her delicate and delightful esprit her fascinating modernity and her light happy touch give her a unique position in that literary movement which has taken for its object the reproduction of contemporary life  such books as autour du mariage autour du divorce and le petit bob are in their way little playful masterpieces and the only work in england that we could compare with them is violet fanes edwin and angelina papers  to the same brilliant pen which gave us these wise and witty studies of modern life we owe now a more serious more elaborate production  helen davenant is as earnestly wrought out as it is cleverly conceived  if it has a fault it is that it is too full of matter  out of the same material a more economical writer would have made two novels and half a dozen psychological studies for publication in american magazines  thackeray once met bishop wilberforce at dinner at dean stanleys and after listening to the eloquent prelates extraordinary flow and fund of stories remarked to his neighbour i could not afford to spend at that rate  violet fane is certainly lavishly extravagant of incident plot and character  but we must not quarrel with richness of subjectmatter at a time when tenuity of purpose and meagreness of motive seem to be becoming the dominant notes of contemporary fiction  the sideissues of the story are so complex that it is difficult almost impossible to describe the plot in any adequate manner  the interest centres round a young girl helen davenant by name who contracts a private and clandestine marriage with one of those mysterious and fascinating foreign noblemen who are becoming so invaluable to writers of fiction either in narrative or dramatic form  shortly after the marriage her husband is arrested for a terrible murder committed some years before in russia under the evil influence of occult magic and mesmerism  the crime was done in a hypnotic state and as described by violet fane seems much more probable than the actual hypnotic experiments recorded in scientific publications  this is the supreme advantage that fiction possesses over fact  it can make things artistically probable can call for imaginative and realistic credence can by force of mere style compel us to believe  the ordinary novelists by keeping close to the ordinary incidents of commonplace life seem to me to abdicate half their power romance at any rate welcomes what is wonderful the temper of wonder is part of her own secret she loves what is strange and curious  but besides the marvels of occultism and hypnotism there are many other things in helen davenant that are worthy of study  violet fane writes an admirable style  the opening chapter of the book with its terrible poignant tragedy is most powerfully written and i cannot help wondering that the clever authoress cared to abandon even for a moment the superb psychological opportunity that this chapter affords  the touches of nature the vivid sketches of high life the subtle renderings of the phases and fancies of society are also admirably done  helen davenant is certainly clever and shows that violet fane can write prose that is as good as her verse and can look at life not merely from the point of view of the poet but also from the standpoint of the philosopher the keen observer the fine social critic  to be a fine social critic is no small thing and to be able to incorporate in a work of fiction the results of such careful observation is to achieve what is out of the reach of many  the difficulty under which the novelists of our day labour seems to me to be this if they do not go into society their books are unreadable and if they do go into society they have no time left for writing  however violet fane has solved the problem     the chronicles which i am about to present to the reader are not the    result of any conscious effort of the imagination  they are as the    titlepage indicates records of dreams occurring at intervals during    the last ten years and transcribed pretty nearly in the order of    their occurrence from my diary  written down as soon as possible    after awaking from the slumber during which they presented themselves    these narratives necessarily unstudied in style and wanting in    elegance of diction have at least the merit of fresh and vivid    colour for they were committed to paper at a moment when the effect    and impress of each successive vision were strong and forceful on the    mind        the most remarkable features of the experiences i am about to record    are the methodical consecutiveness of their sequences and the    intelligent purpose disclosed alike in the events witnessed and in the    words heard or read     i know of no parallel to this phenomenon    unless in the pages of bulwer lyttons romance entitled the pilgrims    of the rhine in which is related the story of a german student    endowed with so marvellous a faculty of dreaming that for him the    normal conditions of sleeping and waking became reversed his true    life was that which he lived in his slumbers and his hours of    wakefulness appeared to him as so many uneventful and inactive    intervals of arrest occurring in an existence of intense and vivid    interest which was wholly passed in the hypnotic state        during the whole period covered by these dreams i have been busily and    almost continuously engrossed with scientific and literary pursuits    demanding accurate judgment and complete selfpossession and rectitude    of mind  at the time when many of the most vivid and remarkable    visions occurred i was following my course as a student at the paris    faculty of medicine preparing for examinations daily visiting    hospital wards as dresser and attending lectures  later when i had    taken my degree i was engaged in the duties of my profession and in    writing for the press on scientific subjects  neither had i ever    taken opium haschish or other dreamproducing agent  a cup of tea    or coffee represents the extent of my indulgences in this direction  i    mention these details in order to guard against inferences which might    otherwise be drawn as to the genesis of my faculty     it may perhaps be worthy of notice that by far the larger number of    the dreams set down in this volume occurred towards dawn sometimes    even after sunrise during a second sleep  a condition of fasting    united possibly with some subtle magnetic or other atmospheric state    seems therefore to be that most open to impressions of the kind  this is the account given by the late dr anna kingsford of the genesis of her remarkable volume dreams and dreamstories and certainly some of the stories especially those entitled steepside beyond the sunset and the village of seers are well worth reading though not intrinsically finer either in motive or idea than the general run of magazine stories  no one who had the privilege of knowing mrs kingsford who was one of the brilliant women of our day can doubt for a single moment that these tales came to her in the way she describes but to me the result is just a little disappointing  perhaps however i expect too much  there is no reason whatsoever why the imagination should be finer in hours of dreaming than in its hours of waking  mrs kingsford quotes a letter written by jamblichus to agathocles in which he says the soul has a twofold life a lower and a higher  in sleep the soul is liberated from the constraint of the body and enters as an emancipated being on its divine life of intelligence  the nobler part of the mind is thus united by abstraction to higher natures and becomes a participant in the wisdom and foreknowledge of the gods     the nighttime of the body is the daytime of the soul  but the great masterpieces of literature and the great secrets of wisdom have not been communicated in this way and even in coleridges case though kubla khan is wonderful it is not more wonderful while it is certainly less complete than the ancient mariner  as for the dreams themselves which occupy the first portion of the book their value of course depends chiefly on the value of the truths or predictions which they are supposed to impart  i must confess that most modern mysticism seems to me to be simply a method of imparting useless knowledge in a form that no one can understand  allegory parable and vision have their high artistic uses but their philosophical and scientific uses are very small  however here is one of mrs kingsfords dreams  it has a pleasant quaintness about it     the wonderful spectacles     i was walking alone on the seashore  the day was singularly clear    and sunny  inland lay the most beautiful landscape ever seen and far    off were ranges of tall hills the highest peaks of which were white    with glittering snows  along the sands by the sea came towards me a    man accoutred as a postman  he gave me a letter  it was from you  it    ran thus     i have got hold of the earliest and most precious book extant  it    was written before the world began  the text is easy enough to read    but the notes which are very copious and numerous are in such minute    and obscure characters that i cannot make them out  i want you to get    for me the spectacles which swedenborg used to wear not the smaller    pairthose he gave to hans christian andersenbut the large pair    and these seem to have got mislaid  i think they are spinozas make    you know he was an opticalglass maker by profession and the best we    ever had  see if you can get them for me     when i looked up after reading this letter i saw the postman hastening    away across the sands and i cried out to him stop how am i to send    the answer  will you not wait for it     he looked round stopped and came back to me     i have the answer here he said tapping his letterbag and i    shall deliver it immediately     how can you have the answer before i have written it i asked  you    are making a mistake     no he said  in the city from which i come the replies are all    written at the office and sent out with the letters themselves  your    reply is in my bag     let me see it i said  he took another letter from his wallet and    gave it to me  i opened it and read in my own handwriting this    answer addressed to you     the spectacles you want can be bought in london but you will not be    able to use them at once for they have not been worn for many years    and they sadly want cleaning  this you will not be able to do    yourself in london because it is too dark there to see well and    because your fingers are not small enough to clean them properly    bring them here to me and i will do it for you     i gave this letter back to the postman  he smiled and nodded at me    and then i perceived to my astonishment that he wore a camelshair    tunic round his waist  i had been on the point of addressing himi    know not whyas hermes  but i now saw that he must be john the    baptist and in my fright at having spoken to so great a saint i    awoke  mr maitland who edits the present volume and who was jointauthor with mrs kingsford of that curious book the perfect way states in a footnote that in the present instance the dreamer knew nothing of spinoza at the time and was quite unaware that he was an optician and the interpretation of the dream as given by him is that the spectacles in question were intended to represent mrs kingsfords remarkable faculty of intuitional and interpretative perception  for a spiritual message fraught with such meaning the mere form of this dream seems to me somewhat ignoble and i cannot say that i like the blending of the postman with st john the baptist  however from a psychological point of view these dreams are interesting and mrs kingsfords book is undoubtedly a valuable addition to the literature of the mysticism of the nineteenth century        the romance of a shop by miss amy levy is a more mundane book and deals with the adventures of some young ladies who open a photographic studio in baker street to the horror of some of their fashionable relatives  it is so brightly and pleasantly written that the sudden introduction of a tragedy into it seems violent and unnecessary  it lacks the true tragic temper and without this temper in literature all misfortunes and miseries seem somewhat mean and ordinary  with this exception the book is admirably done and the style is clever and full of quick observation  observation is perhaps the most valuable faculty for a writer of fiction  when novelists reflect and moralise they are as a rule dull  but to observe life with keen vision and quick intellect to catch its many modes of expression to seize upon the subtlety or satire or dramatic quality of its situations and to render life for us with some spirit of distinction and fine selectionthis i fancy should be the aim of the modern realistic novelist  it would be perhaps too much to say that miss levy has distinction this is the rarest quality in modern literature though not a few of its masters are modern but she has many other qualities which are admirable        faithful and unfaithful is a powerful but not very pleasing novel however the object of most modern fiction is not to give pleasure to the artistic instinct but rather to portray life vividly for us to draw attention to social anomalies and social forms of injustice  many of our novelists are really pamphleteers reformers masquerading as story tellers earnest sociologists seeking to mend as well as to mirror life the heroine or rather martyr of miss margaret lees story is a very noble and graciously puritanic american girl who is married at the age of eighteen to a man whom she insists on regarding as a hero  her husband cannot live in the high rarefied atmosphere of idealism with which she surrounds him her firm and fearless faith in him becomes a factor in his degradation  you are too good for me he says to her in a finely conceived scene at the end of the book we have not an idea an inclination or a passion in common  im sick and tired of seeming to live up to a standard that is entirely beyond my reach and my desire  we make each other miserable  i cant pull you down and for ten years you have been exhausting yourself in vain efforts to raise me to your level the thing must end  he asks her to divorce him but she refuses  he then abandons her and availing himself of those curious facilities for breaking the marriagetie that prevail in the united states succeeds in divorcing her without her consent and without her knowledge  the book is certainly characteristic of an age so practical and so literary as ours an age in which all social reforms have been preceded and have been largely influenced by fiction  faithful and unfaithful seems to point to some coming change in the marriagelaws of

1889  the kalevala is one of those poems that mr william morris once described as the bibles of the world  it takes its place as a national epic beside the homeric poems the niebelunge the shahnameth and the mahabharata and the admirable translation just published by mr john martin crawford is sure to be welcomed by all scholars and lovers of primitive poetry  in his very interesting preface mr crawford claims for the finns that they began earlier than any other european nation to collect and preserve their ancient folklore  in the seventeenth century we meet men of literary tastes like palmskold who tried to collect and interpret the various national songs of the fendwellers of the north but the kalevala proper was collected by two great finnish scholars of our own century zacharias topelius and elias lonnrot  both were practising physicians and in this capacity came into frequent contact with the people of finland  topelius who collected eighty epical fragments of the kalevala spent the last eleven years of his life in bed afflicted with a fatal disease  this misfortune however did not damp his enthusiasm  mr crawford tells us that he used to invite the wandering finnish merchants to his bedside and induce them to sing their heroic poems which he copied down as soon as they were uttered and that whenever he heard of a renowned finnish minstrel he did all in his power to bring the songman to his house in order that he might gather new fragments of the national epic  lonnrot travelled over the whole country on horseback in reindeer sledges and in canoes collecting the old poems and songs from the hunters the fishermen and the shepherds the people gave him every assistance and he had the good fortune to come across an old peasant one of the oldest of the runolainen in the russian province of wuokinlem who was by far the most renowned songman of the country and from him he got many of the most splendid runes of the poem and certainly the kalevala as it stands is one of the worlds great poems  it is perhaps hardly accurate to describe it as an epic  it lacks the central unity of a true epic in our sense of the word  it has many heroes beside wainomoinen and is properly speaking a collection of folksongs and ballads  of its antiquity there is no doubt  it is thoroughly pagan from beginning to end and even the legend of the virgin mariatta to whom the sun tells where her golden babe lies hidden     yonder is thy golden infant    there thy holy babe lies sleeping    hidden to his belt in water    hidden in the reeds and rushes  is according to all scholars essentially prechristian in origin  the gods are chiefly gods of air and water and forest  the highest is the skygod ukks who is the father of the breezes the shepherd of the lambclouds the lightning is his sword the rainbow is his bow his skirt sparkles with fire his stockings are blue and his shoes crimson coloured  the daughters of the sun and moon sit on the scarlet

the primitive oak trees shut out the light of the sun from the northland pikkumies the pygmy emerged from the sea in a suit of copper with a copper hatchet in his belt and having grown to a giants

god of the woodlands  otso the bear is the honeypaw of the mountains the furrobed forest friend in everything visible and invisible there is god a divine presence there are three worlds and they are all peopled with divinities  as regards the poem itself it is written in trochaic eightsyllabled lines with alliteration and the partline echo the metre which longfellow adopted for hiawatha  one of its distinguishing characteristics is its wonderful passion for nature and for the beauty of natural objects  lemenkainen says to tapio     sablebearded god of forests    in thy hat and coat of ermine    robe thy trees in finest fibres    deck thy groves in richest fabrics    give the firtrees shining silver    deck with gold the slender balsams    give the spruces copperbelting    and the pinetrees silver girdles    give the birches golden flowers    deck their stems with silver fretwork    this their garb in former ages    when the days and nights were brighter    when the firtrees

the sails of linen    sails of blue and white and scarlet    woven into finest fabric  all the characteristics of a splendid antique civilisation are mirrored in this marvellous poem and mr crawfords admirable translation should make the wonderful heroes of suomi song as familiar if not as dear to our people as the heroes of the great ionian epic  the kalevala the epic poem of finland  translated into english by john martin crawford  g p putnams sons     poetical socialists   pall mall gazette february 15 1889  mr stopford brooke said some time ago that socialism and the socialistic spirit would give our poets nobler and loftier themes for song would widen their sympathies and enlarge the horizon of their vision and would touch with the fire and fervour of a new faith lips that had else been silent hearts that but for this fresh gospel had been cold  what art gains from contemporary events is always a fascinating problem and a problem that is not easy to solve  it is however certain that socialism starts well equipped  she has her poets and her painters her art lecturers and her cunning designers her powerful orators and her clever writers  if she fails it will not be for lack of expression  if she succeeds her triumph will not be a triumph of mere brute force  the first thing that strikes one as one looks over the list of contributors to mr edward carpenters chants of labour is the curious variety of their several occupations the wide differences of social position that exist between them and the strange medley of men whom a common passion has for the moment united  the editor is a science lecturer he is followed by a draper and a porter then we have two late eton masters and then two bootmakers and these are in their turn succeeded by an ex lord mayor of dublin a bookbinder a photographer a steelworker and an authoress  on one page we have a journalist a draughtsman and a music teacher and on another a civil servant a machine fitter a medical student a cabinetmaker and a minister of the church of scotland certainly it is no ordinary movement that can bind together in close brotherhood men of such dissimilar pursuits and when we mention that mr william morris is one of the singers and that mr walter crane has designed the cover and frontispiece of the book we cannot but feel that as we pointed out before socialism starts well equipped  as for the songs themselves some of them to quote from the editors preface are purely revolutionary others are christian in tone there are some that might be called merely material in their tendency while many are of a highly ideal and visionary character  this is on the whole very promising  it shows that socialism is not going to allow herself to be trammelled by any hard and fast creed or to be stereotyped into an iron formula  she welcomes many and multiform natures  she rejects none and has room for all  she has the attraction of a wonderful personality and touches the heart of one and the brain of another and draws this man by his hatred of injustice and his neighbour by his faith in the future and a third it may be by his love of art or by his wild worship of a lost and buried past  and all of this is well  for to make men socialists is nothing but to make socialism human is a great thing  they are not of any very high literary value these poems that have been so dexterously set to music  they are meant to be sung not to be read they are rough direct and vigorous and the tunes are stirring and familiar  indeed almost any mob could warble them with ease  the transpositions that have been made are rather amusing  twas in trafalgar square is set to the tune of twas in trafalgars bay up ye people a very revolutionary song by mr john gregory bootmaker with a refrain of     up ye people or down into your graves       cowards ever will be slaves  is to be sung to the tune of rule britannia the old melody of the vicar of bray is to accompany the new ballade of law and orderwhich however is not a ballade at alland to the air of heres to the maiden of bashful fifteen the democracy of the future is to thunder forth one of mr t d sullivans most powerful and pathetic lyrics  it is clear that the socialists intend to carry on the musical education of the people simultaneously with their education in political science and here as elsewhere they seem to be entirely free from any narrow bias or formal prejudice  mendelssohn is followed by moody and sankey the wacht am rhein stands side by side with the marseillaise lillibulero a chorus from norma john brown and an air from beethovens ninth symphony are all equally delightful to them  they sing the national anthem in shelleys version and chant william morriss voice of toil to the flowing numbers of ye banks and braes of bonny doon  victor hugo talks somewhere of the terrible cry of le tigre populaire but it is evident from mr carpenters book that should the revolution ever break out in england we shall have no inarticulate roar but rather pleasant glees and graceful partsongs  the change is certainly for the better  nero fiddled while rome was burningat least inaccurate historians say he did but it is for the building up of an eternal city that the socialists of our day are making music and they have complete confidence in the art instincts of the people     they say that the people are brutal       that their instincts of beauty are dead    were it so shame on those who condemn them       to the desperate struggle for bread    but they lie in their throats when they say it       for the people are tender at heart    and a wellspring of beauty lies hidden       beneath their lifes fever and smart  is a stanza from one of the poems in this volume and the feeling expressed in these words is paramount everywhere  the reformation gained much from the use of popular hymntunes and the socialists seem determined to gain by similar means a similar hold upon the people however they must not be too sanguine about the result  the walls of thebes rose up to the sound of music and thebes was a very dull city indeed  chants of labour a songbook of the people  with music  edited by edward carpenter  with designs by walter crane  swan sonnenschein and co     mr brander matthews essays   pall mall gazette february 27 1889  if you to have your book criticized favorably give yourself a good notice in the preface is the golden rule laid down for the guidance of authors by mr brander matthews in an amusing essay on the art of preface writing and true to his own theory he announces his volume as the most interesting the most entertaining and the most instructive book of the decade  entertaining it certainly is in parts  the essay on poker for instance is very brightly and pleasantly written  mr proctor objected to poker on the somewhat trivial ground that it was a form of lying and on the more serious ground that it afforded special opportunities for cheating and indeed he regarded the mere existence of the game outside gambling dens as one of the most portentous phenomena of american civilisation  mr brander matthews points out in answer to these grave charges that bluffing is merely a suppressio veri and that it requires a great deal of physical courage on the part of the player  as for the cheating he claims that poker affords no more opportunities for the exercise of this art than either whist or ecarte though he admits that the proper attitude towards an opponent whose good luck is unduly persistent is that of the germanamerican who finding four aces in his hand was naturally about to bet heavily when a sudden thought struck him and he inquired who dole dem carts  jakey einstein was the answer  jakey einstein he repeated laying down his hand den i pass out  the history of the game will be found very interesting by all cardlovers  like most of the distinctly national products of america it seems to have been imported from abroad and can be traced back to an italian game in the fifteenth century  euchre was probably acclimatised on the mississippi by the canadian voyageurs being a form of the french game of triomphe  it was a kentucky citizen who desiring to give his sons a few words of solemn advice for their future guidance in life had them summoned to his deathbed and said to them boys when you go down the river to orleens jest you beware of a game called yucker where the jack takes the aceits unchristianafter which warning he lay back and died in peace  and it was euchre which the two gentlemen were playing in a boat on the missouri river when a bystander shocked by the frequency with which one of the players turned up the jack took the liberty of warning the other player that the winner was dealing from the bottom to which the loser secure in his power of selfprotection answered gruffly well suppose he isits his deal isnt it  the chapter on the antiquity of jests with its suggestion of an international exhibition of jokes is capital  such an exhibition mr matthews remarks would at least dispel any lingering belief in the old saying that there are only thirtyeight good stories in existence and that thirtyseven of these cannot be told before ladies and the retrospective section would certainly be the constant resort of any true folklorist  for most of the good stories of our time are really folklore myth survivals echoes of the past  the two wellknown american proverbs we have had a hell of a time and let the other man walk are both traced back by mr matthews the first to walpoles letters and the other to a story poggio tells of an inhabitant of perugia who walked in melancholy because he could not pay his debts vah stulte was the advice given to him leave anxiety to your creditors and even mr william m evarts brilliant repartee when he was told that washington once threw a dollar across the natural bridge in virginia in those days a dollar went so much farther than it does now seems to be the direct descendant of a witty remark of footes though we must say that in this case we prefer the child to the father  the essay on the french spoken by those who do not speak french is also cleverly written and indeed on every subject except literature mr matthews is well worth reading  on literature and literary subjects he is certainly sadly to seek  the essay on the ethics of plagiarism with its laborious attempt to rehabilitate mr rider haggard and its foolish remarks on poes admirable paper mr longfellow and other plagiarists is extremely dull and commonplace and in the elaborate comparison that he draws between mr frederick locker and mr austin dobson the author of pen and ink shows that he is quite devoid of any real critical faculty or of any fine sense of the difference between ordinary society verse and the exquisite work of a very perfect artist in poetry  we have no objection to mr matthews likening mr locker to mr du maurier and mr dobson to randolph caldecott and mr edwin abbey  comparisons of this kind though extremely silly do not do much harm  in fact they mean nothing and are probably not intended to mean anything  upon the other hand we really must protest against mr matthews efforts to confuse the poetry of piccadilly with the poetry of parnassus  to tell us for instance that mr austin dobsons verse has not the condensed clearness nor the incisive vigor of mr lockers is really too bad even for transatlantic criticism  nobody who lays claim to the slightest knowledge of literature and the forms of literature should ever bring the two names into conjunction  mr locker has written some pleasant vers de societe some tuneful trifles in rhyme admirably suited for ladies albums and for magazines  but to mention herrick and suckling and mr austin dobson in connection with him is absurd  he is not a poet  mr dobson upon the other hand has produced work that is absolutely classical in its exquisite beauty of form  nothing more artistically perfect in its way than the lines to a greek girl has been written in our time  this little poem will be remembered in literature as long as thyrsis is remembered and thyrsis will never be forgotten  both have that note of distinction that is so rare in these days of violence exaggeration and rhetoric  of course to suggest as mr matthews does that mr dobsons poems belong to the literature of power is ridiculous  power is not their aim nor is it their effect  they have other qualities and in their own delicately limited sphere they have no contemporary rivals they have none even second to them  however mr matthews is quite undaunted and tries to drag poor mr locker out of piccadilly where he was really quite in his element and to set him on parnassus where he has no right to be and where he would not claim to be  he praises his work with the recklessness of an eloquent auctioneer  these very commonplace and slightly vulgar lines on a human skull     it may have held to shoot some random shots       thy brains eliza fry or baron byrons    the wits of nelly gwynne or doctor watts       two quoted bards  two philanthropic sirens     but this i trust is clearly understood       if man or woman if adored or hated    whoever ownd this skull was not so good       nor quite so bad as many may have stated  are considered by him to be sportive and brightsome and full of playful humor and two things especially are to be noted in themindividuality and directness of expression  individuality and directness of expression  we wonder what mr matthews thinks these words mean  unfortunate mr locker with his uncouth american admirer  how he must blush to read these heavy panegyrics  indeed mr matthews himself has at least one fit of remorse for his attempt to class mr lockers work with the work of mr austin dobson but like most fits of remorse it leads to nothing  on the very next page we have the complaint that mr dobsons verse has not the condensed clearness and the incisive vigor of mr lockers  mr matthews should confine himself to his clever journalistic articles on euchre poker bad french and old jokes  on these subjects he can to use an expression of his own write funny  he writes funny too upon literature but the fun is not quite so amusing  pen and ink papers on subjects of more or less importance  by brander matthews  longmans green and co     some literary notesiii   womans world march 1889  miss nesbit has already made herself a name as a writer of graceful and charming verse and though her last volume leaves of life does not show any distinct advance on her former work it still fully maintains the high standard already achieved and justifies the reputation of the author  there are some wonderfully pretty poems in it poems full of quick touches of fancy and of pleasant ripples of rhyme and here and there a poignant note of passion flashes across the song as a scarlet thread flashes through the shuttlerace of a loom giving a new value to the delicate tints and bringing the scheme of colour to a higher and more perfect key  in miss nesbits earlier volume the lays and legends as it was called there was an attempt to give poetic form to humanitarian dreams and socialistic aspirations but the poems that dealt with these subjects were on the whole the least successful of the collection and with the quick critical instinct of an artist miss nesbit seems to have recognised this  in the present volume at any rate such poems are rare and these few felicitous verses give us the poets defence     a singer sings of rights and wrongs       of worlds ideals vast and bright    and feels the impotence of songs       to scourge the wrong or help the right    and only writhes to feel how vain       are songs as weapons for his fight    and so he turns to love again       and sings of love for hearts delight     for hearts delight the singers bind       the wreath of roses round the head    and will not loose it lest they find       time victor and the roses dead    man can but sing of what he knows       i saw the roses fresh and red    and so they sing the deathless rose       with withered roses garlanded     and some within their bosom hide       their rose of love still fresh and fair    and walk in silence satisfied       to keep its folded fragrance rare    and somewho bear a flag unfurled       wreathe with their rose the flag they bear    and sing their banner for the world       and for their heart the roses there     yet thus much choice in singing is       we sing the good the true the just    passionate duty turned to bliss       and honour growing out of trust    freedom we sing and would not lose       her lightest footprint in lifes dust    we sing of her because we choose       we sing of love because we must  certainly miss nesbit is at her best when she sings of love and nature here she is close to her subject and her temperament gives colour and form to the various dramatic moods that are either suggested by nature herself or brought to nature for interpretation  this for instance is very sweet and graceful     when all the skies with snow were grey       and all the earth with snow was white    i wandered down a still wood way       and there i met my hearts delight    slow moving through the silent wood    the spirit of its solitude       the brown birds and the lichened tree       seemed less a part of it than she     where pheasants feet and rabbits feet       had marked the snow with traces small    i saw the footprints of my sweet       the sweetest woodland thing of all    with christmas roses in her hand    one heartbeats space i saw her stand       and then i let her pass and stood       lone in an empty world of wood     and though by that same path ive passed       down that same woodland every day    that meeting was the first and last       and she is hopelessly away    i wonder was she really there    her hands and eyes and lips and hair       or was it but my dreaming sent       her image down the way i went     empty the woods are where we met       they will be empty in the spring    the cowslip and the violet       will die without her gathering    but dare i dream one radiant day    red rosewreathed she will pass this way       across the glad and honoured grass       and theni will not let her pass  and this dedication with its tender silvergrey notes of colour is charming     in any meadow where your feet may tread       in any garland that your love may wear    may be the flower whose hidden fragrance shed       wakes some old hope or numbs some old despair       and makes lifes grief not quite so hard to bear    and makes lifes joy more poignant and more dear    because of some delight dead many a year     or in some cottage garden there may be       the flower whose scent is memory for you    the sturdy southernwood the frail sweetpea       bring back the swallows cheep the pigeons coo       and youth and hope and all the dreams they knew    the evening star the hedges grey with mist    the silent porch where loves first kiss was kissed     so in my garden may you chance to find       or royal rose or quiet meadow flower    whose scent may be with some dear dream entwined       and give you back the ghost of some sweet hour       as lilies fragrant from an august shower    or airs of june that over beanfields blow    bring back the sweetness of my long ago  all through the volume we find the same dexterous refining of old themes which is indeed the best thing that our lesser singers can give us and a thing always delightful  there is no garden so well tilled but it can bear another blossom and though the subjectmatter of miss nesbits book is as the subjectmatter of almost all books of poetry she can certainly lend a new grace and a subtle sweetness to almost everything on which she writes  the wanderings of oisin and other poems is from the clever pen of mr w b yeats whose charming anthology of irish fairytales i had occasion to notice in a recent number of the womans world 437  it is i believe the first volume of poems that mr yeats has published and it is certainly full of promise  it must be admitted that many of the poems are too fragmentary too incomplete  they read like stray scenes out of unfinished plays like things only half remembered or at best but dimly seen  but the architectonic power of construction the power to build up and make perfect a harmonious whole is nearly always the latest as it certainly is the highest development of the artistic temperament  it is somewhat unfair to expect it in early work  one quality mr yeats has in a marked degree a quality that is not common in the work of our minor poets and is therefore all the more welcome to usi mean the romantic temper  he is essentially celtic and his verse at its best is celtic also  strongly influenced by keats he seems to study how to load every rift with ore yet is more fascinated by the beauty of words than by the beauty of metrical music  the spirit that dominates the whole book is perhaps more valuable than any individual poem or particular passage but this from the wanderings of oisin is worth quoting  it describes the ride to the island of forgetfulness     and the ears of the horse went sinking away in the hollow light       for as drift from a sailor slow drowning the gleams of the world    and the sun    ceased on our hands and faces on hazel and oak leaf the light       and the stars were blotted above us and the whole of the world was    one     till the horse gave a whinny for cumbrous with stems of the hazel and    oak       of hollies and hazels and oaktrees a valley was sloping away    from his hoofs in the heavy grasses with monstrous slumbering folk       their mighty and naked and gleaming bodies heaped loose where they    lay     more comely than man may make them inlaid with silver and gold       were arrow and shield and waraxe arrow and spear and blade    and dewblanched horns in whose hollows a child of three years old       could sleep on a couch of rushes round and about them laid  and this which deals with the old legend of the city lying under the waters of a lake is strange and interesting     the maker of the stars and worlds       sat underneath the market cross    and the old men were walking walking       and little boys played pitchandtoss     the props said he of stars and worlds       are prayers of patient men and good    the boys the women and old men       listening upon their shadows stood     a grey professor passing cried       how few the minds intemperance rule    what shallow thoughts about deep things       the world grows old and plays the fool     the mayor came leaning his left ear       there were some talking of the poor    and to himself cried communist       and hurried to the guardhouse door     the bishop came with open book       whispering along the sunny path    there was some talking of mans god       his god of stupor and of wrath     the bishop murmured atheist       how sinfully the wicked scoff    and sent the old men on their way       and drove the boys and women off     the place was empty now of people       a cock came by upon his toes    an old horse looked across the fence       and rubbed along the rail his nose     the maker of the stars and worlds       to his own house did him betake    and on that city dropped a tear       and now that city is a lake  mr yeats has a great deal of invention and some of the poems in his book such as mosada jealousy and the island of statues are very finely conceived  it is impossible to doubt after reading his present volume that he will some day give us work of high import  up to this he has been merely trying the strings of his instrument running over the keys        lady munsters dorinda is an exceedingly clever novel  the heroine is a sort of wellborn becky sharp only much more beautiful than becky or at least than thackerays portraits of her which however have always seemed to me rather illnatured  i feel sure that mrs rawdon crawley was extremely pretty and i have never understood how it was that thackeray could caricature with his pencil so fascinating a creation of his pen  in the first chapter of lady munsters novel we find dorinda at a fashionable school and the sketches of the three old ladies who preside over the select seminary are very amusing  dorinda is not very popular and grave suspicions rest upon her of having stolen a cheque this is a startling debut for a heroine and i was a little afraid at first that dorinda after undergoing endless humiliations would be proved innocent in the last chapter  it was quite a relief to find that dorinda was guilty  in fact dorinda is a kleptomaniac that is to say she is a member of the upper classes who spends her time in collecting works of art that do not belong to her  this however is only one of her accomplishments and it does not occupy any important place in the story till the last volume is reached  here we find dorinda married to a styrian prince and living in the luxury for which she had always longed unfortunately while staying in the house of a friend she is detected stealing some rare enamels  her punishment as described by lady munster is extremely severe and when she finally commits suicide maddened by the imprisonment to which her husband had subjected her it is difficult not to feel a good deal of pity for her  lady munster writes a very clever bright style and has a wonderful faculty of drawing in a few sentences the most lifelike portraits of social types and social exceptions  sir jasper broke and his sister the duke and duchess of cheviotdale lord and lady glenalmond and lord baltimore are all admirably drawn  the novel of high life as it used to be called has of late years fallen into disrepute  instead of duchesses in mayfair we have philanthropic young ladies in whitechapel and the fashionable and brilliant young dandies in whom disraeli and bulwer lytton took such delight have been entirely wiped out as heroes of fiction by hardworking curates in the east end  the aim of most of our modern novelists seems to be not to write good novels but to write novels that will do good and i am afraid that they are under the impression that fashionable life is not an edifying subject  they wish to reform the morals rather than to portray the manners of their age they have made the novel the mode of propaganda  it is possible however that dorinda points to some coming change and certainly it would be a pity if the muse of fiction confined her attention entirely to the east end        the four remarkable women whom mrs walford has chosen as the subjects of her four biographies from blackwood are jane taylor elizabeth fry hannah more and mary somerville  perhaps it is too much to say that jane taylor is remarkable  in her day she was said to have been known to four continents and sir walter scott described her as among the first women of her time but no one now cares to read essays in rhyme or display though the latter is really a very clever novel and full of capital things  elizabeth fry is of course one of the great personalities of this century at any rate in the particular sphere to which she devoted herself and ranks with the many uncanonised saints whom the world has loved and whose memory is sweet  mrs walford gives a most interesting account of her  we see her first a gay laughing flaxenhaired girl mightily addicted to fun pleased to be finely dressed and sent to the opera to see the prince and be seen by him pleased to exhibit her pretty figure in a becoming scarlet ridinghabit and to be looked at with obvious homage by the young officers quartered hard by as she rode along the norfolk lanes dissipated by simply hearing their band play in the square and made giddy by the veriest trifle an idle flirting worldly girl to use her own words  then came the eventful day when in purple boots laced with scarlet she went to hear william savery preach at the meeting house  this was the turning point of her life her psychological moment as the phrase goes  after it came the era of thees and thous of the drab gown and the beaver hat of the visits to newgate and the convict ships of the work of rescuing the outcast and seeking the lost  mrs walford quotes the following interesting account of the famous interview with queen charlotte at the mansionhouse     inside the egyptian hall there was a subject for hayterthe    diminutive stature of the queen covered with diamonds and her    countenance lighted up with the kindest benevolence mrs fry her    simple quakers dress adding to the height of her figurethough a    little flushedpreserving her wonted calmness of look and manner    several of the bishops standing near the platform crowded with waving    feathers jewels and orders the hall lined with spectators gaily    and nobly clad and the centre filled with hundreds of children    brought there from their different schools to be examined  a murmur    of applause ran through the assemblage as the queen took mrs fry by    the hand  the murmur was followed by a clap and a shout which was    taken up by the multitudes without till it died away in the distance  those who regard hannah more as a prim maiden lady of the conventional type with a pious and literary turn of mind will be obliged to change their views should they read mrs walfords admirable sketch of the authoress of percy  hannah more was a brilliant wit a femme desprit passionately fond of society and loved by society in return  when the seriousminded little country girl who at the age of eight had covered a whole quire of paper with letters seeking to reform imaginary depraved characters and with return epistles full of contrition and promises of amendment paid her first visit to london she became at once the intimate friend of johnson burke sir joshua reynolds garrick and most of the distinguished people of the day delighting them by her charm and grace and wit  i dined at the adelphi yesterday she writes in one of her letters  garrick was the very soul of the company and i never saw johnson in more perfect goodhumour  after all had risen to go we stood round them for above an hour laughing in defiance of every rule of decorum and chesterfield  i believe we should never have thought of sitting down nor of parting had not an impertinent watchman been saucily vociferating  johnson outstaid them all and sat with me for half an hour  the following is from her sisters pen     on tuesday evening we drank tea at sir joshuas with dr johnson    hannah is certainly a great favourite  she was placed next him and    they had the entire conversation to themselves  they were both in    remarkably high spirits and it was certainly her lucky night i never    heard her say so many good things  the old genius was as jocular as    the young one was pleasant  you would have imagined we were at some    comedy had you heard our peals of laughter  they certainly tried    which could pepper the highest and it is not clear to me that the    lexicographer was really the highest seasoner  hannah more was certainly as mrs walford says the feted and caressed idol of society  the theatre at bristol vaunted boast we not a more and the learned cits at oxford inscribed their acknowledgment of her authority  horace walpole sat on the doorstepor threatened to do sotill she promised to go down to strawberry hill foster quoted her mrs thrale twined her arms about her wilberforce consulted her and employed her  when the estimate of the religion of the fashionable world was published anonymously aut morus aut angelus exclaimed the bishop of london before he had read six pages  of her village stories and ballads two million copies were sold during the first year  caelebs in search of a wife ran into thirty editions  mrs barbauld writes to tell her about a good and sensible woman of her acquaintance who on being asked how she contrived to divert herself in the country replied i have my spinningwheel and my hannah more  when i have spun one pound of flax i put on another and when i have finished my book i begin it again i want no other amusement  how incredible it all sounds  no wonder that mrs walford exclaims no other amusement  good heavens  breathes there a man woman or child with soul so quiescent nowadays as to be satisfied with reels of flax and yards of hannah more  give us hannahs company but notnot her writings  it is only fair to say that mrs walford has thoroughly carried out the views she expresses in this passage for she gives us nothing of hannah mores grandiloquent literary productions and yet succeeds in making us know her thoroughly  the whole book is well written but the biography of hannah more is a wonderfully brilliant sketch and deserves great praise        miss mabel wotton has invented a new form of picturegallery  feeling that the visible aspect of men and women can be expressed in literature no less than through the medium of line and colour she has collected together a series of word portraits of famous writers extending from geoffrey chaucer to mrs henry wood  it is a far cry from the author of the canterbury tales to the authoress of east lynne but as a beauty at any rate mrs wood deserved to be described and we hear of the pure oval of her face of her perfect mouth her dazzling complexion and the extraordinary youth by which she kept to the last the    freshness of a young girl  many of the famous writers seem to have been very ugly  thomson the poet was of a dull countenance and a gross unanimated uninviting appearance richardson looked like a plump white mouse in a wig  pope is described in the guardian in 1713 as a lively little creature with long arms and legs a spider is no ill emblem of him  he has been taken at a distance for a small windmill charles kingsley appears as rather tall very angular surprisingly awkward with thin staggering legs a hatchet face adorned with scraggy gray whiskers a faculty for falling into the most ungainly attitudes and making the most hideous contortions of visage and frame with a rough provincial accent and an uncouth way of speaking which would be set down for absurd caricature on the boards of a comic theatre  lamb is described by carlyle as the leanest of mankind tiny black breeches buttoned to the kneecap and no further surmounting spindle legs also in black face and head fineish black bony lean and of a jew type rather and talfourd says that the best portrait of him is his own description of brahama compound of the jew the gentleman and the angel  william godwin was short and stout his clothes loosely and carelessly put on and usually old and worn his hands were generally in his pockets he had a remarkably large bald head and a weak voice seeming generally half asleep when he walked and even when he talked lord charlemont spoke of david hume as more like a turtleeating alderman than a refined philosopher  mary russell mitford was ill naturedly described by lel as sancho panza in petticoats and as for poor rogers who was somewhat cadaverous the descriptions given of him are quite dreadful  lord dudley once asked him why now that he could afford it he did not set up his hearse and it is said that sydney smith gave him mortal offence by recommending him when he sat for his portrait to be drawn saying his prayers with his face hidden in his hands christened him the death dandy and wrote underneath a picture of him painted in his lifetime  we must console ourselvesif not with mr hardys statement that ideal physical beauty is incompatible with mental development and a full recognition of the evil of thingsat least with the pictures of those who had some comeliness and grace and charm  dr grosart says of a miniature of edmund spenser it is an exquisitely beautiful face  the brow is ample the lips thin but mobile the eyes a grayishblue the hair and beard a golden red as of red monie of the ballads or goldenly chestnut the nose with semitransparent nostril and keen the chin firmpoised the expression refined and delicate  altogether just such presentment of the poet of beauty par excellence as one would have imagined  antony wood describes sir richard lovelace as being at the age of sixteen the most amiable and beautiful person that ever eye beheld  nor need we wonder at this when we remember the portrait of lovelace that hangs at dulwich college  barry cornwall described himself by s c hall as a decidedly rather pretty little fellow said of keats his countenance lives in my mind as one of singular beauty and brightnessit had an expression as if he had been looking on some glorious sight  chatterton and byron were splendidly handsome and beauty of a high spiritual order may be claimed both for milton and shelley though an industrious gentleman lately wrote a book in two volumes apparently for the purpose of proving that the latter of these two poets had a snub nose  hazlitt once said that a mans life may be a lie to himself and others and yet a picture painted of him by a great artist would probably stamp his character  few of the wordportraits in miss wottons book can be said to have been drawn by a great artist but they are all interesting and miss wotton has certainly shown a wonderful amount of industry in collecting her references and in grouping them  it is not a book to be read through from beginning to end but it is a delightful book to glance at and by its means one can raise the ghosts of the dead at least as well as the psychical society can  1 leaves of life  by e nesbit  longmans green and co  2 the wanderings of oisin and other poems  by w b yeats  kegan paul  3 dorinda  by lady munster  hurst and blackett  4 four biographies from blackwood  by mrs walford  blackwood and sons  5 word portraits of famous writers  edited by mabel wotton  bentley and son     mr william morriss last book   pall mall gazette march 2 1889  mr morriss last book is a piece of pure art workmanship from beginning to end and the very remoteness of its style from the common language and ordinary interests of our day gives to the whole story a strange beauty and an unfamiliar charm  it is written in blended prose and verse like the mediaeval cantefable and tells the tale of the house of the wolfings in its struggles against the legionaries of rome then advancing into northern germany  it is a kind of saga and the language in which the folkepic as we may call it is set forth recalls the antique dignity and directness of our english tongue four centuries ago  from an artistic point of view it may be described as an attempt to return by a selfconscious effort to the conditions of an earlier and a fresher age attempts of this kind are not uncommon in the history of art  from some such feeling came the preraphaelite movement of our own day and the archaistic movement of later greek sculpture  when the result is beautiful the method is justified and no shrill insistence upon a supposed necessity for absolute modernity of form can prevail against the value of work that has the incomparable excellence of style  certainly mr morriss work possesses this excellence  his fine harmonies and rich cadences create in the reader that spirit by which alone can its own spirit be interpreted awake in him something of the temper of romance and by taking him out of his own age place him in a truer and more vital relation to the great masterpieces of all time  it is a bad thing for an age to be always looking in art for its own reflection  it is well that now and then we are given work that is nobly imaginative in its method and purely artistic in its aim  as we read mr morriss story with its fine alternations of verse and prose its decorative and descriptive beauties its wonderful handling of romantic and adventurous themes we cannot but feel that we are as far removed from the ignoble fiction as we are from the ignoble facts of our own day  we breathe a purer air and have dreams of a time when life had a kind of poetical quality of its own and was simple and stately and complete  the tragic interest of the house of the wolfings centres round the figure of thiodolf the great hero of the tribe  the goddess who loves him gives him as he goes to battle against the romans a magical hauberk on which rests this strange fate that he who wears it shall save his own life and destroy the life of his land  thiodolf finding out this secret brings the hauberk back to the woodsun as she is called and chooses death for himself rather than the ruin of his cause and so the story ends  but mr morris has always preferred romance to tragedy and set the development of action above the concentration of passion  his story is like some splendid old tapestry crowded with stately images and enriched with delicate and delightful detail  the impression it leaves on us is not of a single central figure dominating the whole but rather of a magnificent design to which everything is subordinated and by which everything becomes of enduring import  it is the whole presentation of the primitive life that really fascinates  what in other hands would have been mere archaeology is here transformed by quick artistic instinct and made wonderful for us and human and full of high interest  the ancient world seems to have come to life again for our pleasure  of a work so large and so coherent completed with no less perfection than it is conceived it is difficult by mere quotation to give any adequate idea  this however may serve as an example of its narrative power  the passage describes the visit of thiodolf to the woodsun     the moonlight lay in a great flood on the grass without and the dew    was falling in the coldest hour of the night and the earth smelled    sweetly the whole habitation was asleep now and there was no sound    to be known as the sound of any creature save that from the distant    meadow came the lowing of a cow that had lost her calf and that a    white owl was flitting about near the eaves of the roof with her wild    cry that sounded like the mocking of merriment now silent  thiodolf    turned toward the wood and walked steadily through the scattered    hazeltrees and thereby into the thick of the beechtrees whose    boles grew smooth and silvergrey high and closeset and so on and    on he went as one going by a wellknown path though there was no    path till all the moonlight was quenched under the close roof of the    beechleaves though yet for all the darkness no man could go there    and not feel that the roof was green above him  still he went on in    despite of the darkness till at last there was a glimmer before him    that grew greater till he came unto a small woodlawn whereon the turf    grew again though the grass was but thin because little sunlight got    to it so close and thick were the tall trees round about it       nought looked thiodolf either at the heavens above or the trees as    he strode from off the huskstrewn floor of the beech wood on to the    scanty grass of the lawn but his eyes looked straight before him at    that which was amidmost of the lawn and little wonder was that for    there on a stone chair sat a woman exceeding fair clad in glittering    raiment her hair lying as pale in the moonlight on the grey stone as    the barley acres in the august night before the reapinghook goes in    amongst them  she sat there as though she were awaiting some one and    he made no stop nor stay but went straight up to her and took her in    his arms and kissed her mouth and her eyes and she him again and    then he sat himself down beside her  as an example of the beauty of the verse we would take this from the song of the woodsun  it at least shows how perfectly the poetry harmonises with the prose and how natural the transition is from the one to the other     in many a stead doom dwelleth nor sleepeth day nor night    the rim of the bowl she kisseth and beareth the chambering light    when the kings of men wend happy to the bridebed from the board    it is little to say that she wendeth the edge of the grinded sword    when about the house half builded she hangeth many a day    the ship from the strand she shoveth and on his wonted way    by the mountain hunter fareth where his foot neer failed before    she is where the high bank crumbles at last on the rivers shore    the mowers scythe she whetteth and lulleth the shepherd to sleep    where the deadly lingworm wakeneth in the desert of the sheep    now we that come of the godkin of her redes for ourselves we wot    but her will with the lives of menfolk and their ending know we not    so therefore i bid thee not fear for thyself of doom and her deed    but for me and i bid thee hearken to the helping of my need    or elseart thou happy in life or lusteth thou to die    in the flower of thy days when thy glory and thy longing bloom on    high  the last chapter of the book in which we are told of the great feast made for the dead is so finely written that we cannot refrain from quoting this passage     now was the glooming falling upon the earth but the hall was bright    within even as the hallsun had promised  therein was set forth the    treasure of the wolfings fair cloths were hung on the walls goodly    broidered garments on the pillars goodly brazen cauldrons and fair    carven chests were set down in nooks where men could see them well    and vessels of gold and silver were set all up and down the tables of    the feast  the pillars also were wreathed with flowers and flowers    hung garlanded from the walls over the precious hangings sweet gums    and spices were burning in fairwrought censers of brass and so many    candles were alight under the roof that scarce had it looked more    ablaze when the romans had litten the faggots therein for its burning    amidst the hurry of the morning battle     there then they fell to feasting hallowing in the hightide of their    return with victory in their hands and the dead corpses of thiodolf    and otter clad in precious glittering raiment looked down on them    from the highseat and the kindreds worshipped them and were glad    and they drank the cup to them before any others were they gods or    men  in days of uncouth realism and unimaginative imitation it is a high pleasure to welcome work of this kind  it is a work in which all lovers of literature cannot fail to delight  a tale of the house of the wolfings and all the kindreds of the mark written in prose and in verse by william morris  reeves and turner     adam lindsay gordon   pall mall gazette march 25 1889  a critic recently remarked of adam lindsay gordon that through him australia had found her first fine utterance in song 452  this however is an amiable error  there is very little of australia in gordons poetry  his heart and mind and fancy were always preoccupied with memories and dreams of england and such culture as england gave him he owed nothing to the land of his adoption  had he stayed at home he would have done much better work  in a few poems such as the sick stockrider from the wreck and wolf and hound there are notes of australian influences and these swinburnian stanzas from the dedication to the bush ballads deserve to be quoted though the promise they hold out was never fulfilled     they are rhymes rudely strung with intent less       of sound than of words    in lands where bright blossoms are scentless       and songless bright birds    where with fire and fierce drought on her tresses    insatiable summer oppresses    sere woodlands and sad wildernesses       and faint flocks and herds     whence gatherdthe locusts grand chirrup       may furnish a stave    the ring of a rowel and stirrup       the wash of a wave    the chaunt of the marsh frog in rushes    that chimes

burnishd resistance       makes deeper the dreamiest distance    some song in all hearts hath existence       such songs have been mine  as a rule however gordon is distinctly english and the landscapes he describes are always the landscapes of our own country  he writes about mediaeval lords and ladies in his rhyme of joyous garde about cavaliers and roundheads in the romance of britomarte and ashtaroth his longest and most ambitious poem deals with the adventures of the norman barons and danish knights of ancient days  steeped in swinburne and bewildered with browning he set himself to reproduce the marvellous melody of the one and the dramatic vigour and harsh strength of the other  from the wreck is a sort of australian edition of the ride to ghent  these are the first

students consuming night oil    o earth we have toild we have travailed       how long shall we travail and toil  by the classics gordon was always very much fascinated  he loved what he calls the scroll that is godlike and greek though he is rather uncertain about his quantities rhyming polyxena to athena and aphrodite to light and occasionally makes very rash statements as when he represents leonidas exclaiming to the three hundred at thermopylae     ho comrades let us gaily dine       this night with plato we shall sup  if this be not as we hope it is a printers error  what the australians liked best were his spirited if somewhat rough horseracing and hunting poems  indeed it was not till he found that how we beat the favourite was on everybodys lips that he consented to forego his anonymity and appear in the unsuspected character of a versewriter having up to that time produced his poems shyly scribbled them on scraps of paper and sent them unsigned to the local magazines  the fact is that the social atmosphere of melbourne was not favourable to poets and the worthy colonials seem to have shared audreys doubts as to whether poetry was a true and honest thing  it was not till gordon won the cup steeplechase for major baker in 1868 that he became really popular and probably there were many who felt that to steer babbler to the winning post was a finer achievement than to babble oer green fields  on the whole it is impossible not to regret that gordon ever emigrated his literary power cannot be denied but it was stunted in uncongenial surroundings and marred by the rude life he was forced to lead  australia has converted many of our failures into prosperous and admirable mediocrities but she certainly spoiled one of our poets for us  ovid at tomi is not more tragic than gordon driving cattle or farming an unprofitable sheepranch  that australia however will some day make amends by producing a poet of her own we cannot doubt and for him there will be new notes to sound and new wonders to tell of  the description given by mr marcus clarke in the preface to this volume of the aspect and spirit of nature in australia is most curious and suggestive  the australian forests he tells us are funereal and stern and seem to stifle in their black gorges a story of sullen despair  no leaves fall from the trees but from the melancholy gum strips of white bark hang and rustle  great grey kangaroos hop noiselessly over the coarse grass  flights of cockatoos stream out shrieking like evil souls  the sun suddenly sinks and the mopokes burst out into horrible peals of semihuman laughter the aborigines aver that when night comes from the bottomless depth of some lagoon a misshapen monster rises dragging his loathsome length along the ooze  from a corner of the silent forest rises a dismal chant and around a fire dance natives painted like skeletons  all is fearinspiring and gloomy  no bright fancies are linked with the memories of the mountains  hopeless explorers have named them out of their sufferingsmount misery mount dreadful mount despair     in australia alone says mr clarke is to be found the grotesque the    weird the strange scribblings of nature learning how to write  but    the dweller in the wilderness acknowledges the subtle charm of the    fantastic land of monstrosities  he becomes familiar with the beauty    of loneliness  whispered to by the myriad tongues of the wilderness    he learns the language of the barren and the uncouth and can read the    hieroglyphs of haggard gumtrees blown into odd shapes distorted    with fierce hot winds or cramped with cold nights when the southern    cross freezes in a cloudless sky of icy blue  the phantasmagoria of    that wild dreamland termed the bush interprets itself and the poet    of our desolation begins to comprehend why free esau loved his    heritage of desert sand better than all the bountiful richness of    egypt  here certainly is new material for the poet here is a land that is waiting for its singer  such a singer gordon was not  he remained thoroughly english and the best that we can say of him is that he wrote imperfectly in australia those poems that in england he might have made perfect  poems  by adam lindsay gordon  samuel mullen     the poets cornerix   pall mall gazette march 30 1889  judges like the criminal classes have their lighter moments and it was probably in one of his happiest and certainly in one of his most careless moods that mr justice denman conceived the idea of putting the early history of rome into doggerel verse for the benefit of a little boy of the name of jack  poor jack  he is still we learn from the preface under six years of age and it is sad to think of the future career of a boy who is being brought up on bad history and worse poetry  here is a passage from the learned judges account of romulus     poor tatius by some unknown hand       was soon assassinated    some said

terrible example from the bench it is pleasant to turn to the seats reserved for queens counsel  mr cooper williss tales and legends if somewhat boisterous in manner is still very spirited and clever  the prison of the danes is not at all a bad poem and there is a great deal of eloquent strong writing in the passage beginning     the dying starsong of the night sinks in the dawning day    and the darkblue sheen is changed to green and the green fades into    grey    and the sleepers are roused from their slumbers and at last the    danesmen know    how few of all their numbers are left them by the foe  not much can be said of a poet who exclaims     oh for the power of byron or of moore    to glow with one and with the latter soar  and yet mr moodie is one of the best of those south african poets whose works have been collected and arranged by mr wilmot  pringle the father of south african verse comes first of course and his best poem is undoubtedly afar in the desert     afar in the desert i love to ride    with the silent bushboy alone by my side    away away from the dwelling of men    by the wilddeers haunt by the buffalos glen    by valleys remote where the oribi plays    where the gnu the gazelle and the hartebeest graze    and the kudu and eland unhunted recline    by the skirts of grey forests oerhung with wild vine    where the elephant browses at peace in his wood    and the riverhorse gambols unscared in the flood    and the mighty rhinoceros wallows at will    in the fen where the wild ass is drinking his fill  it is not however a very remarkable production

aurora is a very novel and delightful epithet for the dawn  on the whole they depress us  chess by mr louis tylor is a sort of christmas masque in which the dramatis personae consist of some unmusical carollers a priggish young man called eric and the chessmen off the board  the white queens knight begins a ballad and the black kings bishop completes it  the pawns sing in chorus and the castles converse with each other  the silliness of the form makes it an absolutely unreadable book  mr williamsons poems of nature and life are as orthodox in spirit as they are commonplace in form  a few harmless heresies of art and thought would do this poet no harm  nearly everything that he says has been said before and said better  the only original thing in the volume is the description of mr robert buchanans grandeur of mind  this is decidedly new  dr cockle tells us that mullners guilt and the ancestress of grillparzer are the masterpieces of german fatetragedy  his translation of the first of these two masterpieces does not make us long for any further acquaintance with the school  here is a specimen from the fourth act of the fatetragedy     scene viii     elvira  hugo     elvira

circle of seasons a series of hymns and verses for the seasons of the church the rev t b dover expresses a hope that this wellmeaning if somewhat tedious book may be of value to those many earnest people to whom the subjective aspect of truth is helpful  the poem beginning     lord in the inn of my poor worthless heart       guests come and go but there is room for thee  has some merit and might be converted into a good sonnet  the majority of the poems however are quite worthless  there seems to be some curious connection between piety and poor rhymes  lord henry somersets verse is not so good as his music  most of the songs of adieu are marred by their excessive sentimentality of feeling and by the commonplace character of their weak and lax form  there is nothing that is new and little that is true in verse of this kind     the golden leaves are falling       falling one by one    their tender adieux calling       to the cold autumnal sun    the trees in the keen and frosty

art to make a good poet and such art as he does possess is devoid of almost every intellectual quality and entirely lacking in any intellectual strength  he has nothing to say and says it  mrs cora m davis is eloquent about the splendours of what the authoress of the circle of seasons calls this earthly ball     lets sing the beauties of this grand old earth  she cries and proceeds to tell how     imagination paints old egypts former glory    of mighty temples reaching heavenward    of grim colossal statues whose barbaric story    the caustic pens of erudition still record    whose ancient cities of glittering minarets    reflect the gold of africs gorgeous sunsets  the caustic pens of erudition is quite delightful and will be appreciated by all egyptologists  there is also a charming passage in the same poem on the pictures of the old masters        the mellow richness of whose tints impart    by contrast greater delicacy still to modern art  this seems to us the highest form of

notesiv   womans world april 1889  in modern life said matthew arnold once you i cannot well enter a monastery but you can enter the wordsworth society  i fear that this will sound to many a somewhat uninviting description of this admirable and useful body whose papers and productions have been recently published by professor knight under the title of wordsworthiana  plain living and high thinking are not popular ideals  most people prefer to live in luxury and to think with the majority  however there is really nothing in the essays and addresses of the wordsworth society that need cause the public any unnecessary alarm and it is gratifying to note that although the society is still in the first blush of enthusiasm it has not yet insisted upon our admiring wordsworths inferior work  it praises what is worthy of praise reverences what should be reverenced and explains what does not require explanation  one paper is quite delightful it is from the pen of mr rawnsley and deals with such reminiscences of wordsworth as still linger among the peasantry of westmoreland  mr rawnsley grew up he tells us in the immediate vicinity of the present poetlaureates old home in lincolnshire and had been struck with the swiftness with which     as year by year the labourer tills    his wonted glebe or lops the glades  the memories of the poet of the somersby wold had faded from off the circle of the hillshad indeed been astonished to note how little real interest was taken in him or his fame and how seldom his works were met with in the houses of the rich or poor in the very neighbourhood accordingly when he came to reside in the lake country he endeavoured to find out what of wordsworths memory among the men of the dales still lingered onhow far he was still a moving presence among themhow far his works had made their way into the cottages and farmhouses of the valleys  he also tried to discover how far the race of westmoreland and cumberland farmfolkthe matthews and the michaels of the poet as described by himwere real or fancy pictures or how far the characters of the dalesmen had been altered in any remarkable manner by tourist influences during the thirtytwo years that have passed since the lake poet was laid to rest  with regard to the latter point it will be remembered that mr ruskin writing in 1876 said that the border peasantry painted with absolute fidelity by scott and wordsworth are as hitherto a scarcely injured race that in his fields at coniston he had men who might have fought with henry v at agincourt without being distinguished from any of his knights that he could take his tradesmens word for a thousand pounds and need never latch his garden gate and that he did not fear molestation in wood or on moor for his girl guests  mr rawnsley however found that a certain beauty had vanished which the simple retirement of old valley days fifty years ago gave to the men among whom wordsworth lived  the strangers he says with their gifts of gold their vulgarity and their requirements have much to answer for  as for their impressions of wordsworth to understand them one must understand the vernacular of the lake district  what was mr wordsworth like in personal appearance said mr rawnsley once to an old retainer who still lives not far from rydal mount  he was a uglyfaaced man and a mean liver was the answer but all that was really meant was that he was a man of marked features and led a very simple life in matters of food and raiment  another old man who believed that wordsworth got most of his poetry out of hartley spoke of the poets wife as a very onpleasant woman very onpleasant indeed  a closefisted woman thats what she was  this however seems to have been merely a tribute to mrs wordsworths admirable housekeeping qualities  the first person interviewed by mr rawnsley was an old lady who had been once in service at rydal mount and was in 1870 a lodginghouse keeper at grasmere  she was not a very imaginative person as may be gathered from the following anecdotemr rawnsleys sister came in from a late evening walk and said o mrs d have you seen the wonderful sunset  the good lady turned sharply round and drawing herself to her full height as if mortally offended answered no miss im a tidy cook i know and they say a decentish body for a landlady but i dont knaw nothing about sunsets or them sort of things theyve never been in my line  her reminiscence of wordsworth was as worthy of tradition as it was explanatory from her point of view of the method in which wordsworth composed and was helped in his labours by his enthusiastic sister  well you know she said mr wordsworth went humming and booing about and she miss dorothy kept close behint him and she picked up the bits as he let em fall and tak em down and put em together on paper for him  and you may be very well sure as how she didnt understand nor make sense out of em and i doubt that he didnt know much about them either himself but howivver theres a great many folk as do i dare say  of wordsworths habit of talking to himself and composing aloud we hear a great deal  was mr wordsworth a sociable man asked mr rawnsley of a rydal farmer  wudsworth for a he had noa pride nor nowt was the answer was a man who was quite one to hissel ye kna  he was not a man as folks could crack wi nor not a man as could crack wi folks  but there was another thing as kep folk off he had a terble girt deep voice and ye might see his faace agaan for long enuff  ive knoan folks village lads and lasses coming over by old road above which runs from grasmere to rydal flayt amost to death there by wishing gaate to hear the girt voice a groanin and mutterin and thunderin of a still evening  and he had a way of standin quite still by the rock there in t path under rydal and folks could hear sounds like a wild beast coming from the rocks and childer were scared fit to be dead amost  wordsworths description of himself constantly recurs to one     and who is he with modest looks       and clad in sober russet gown    he murmurs by the running brooks       a music sweeter than their own    he is retired as noontide dew    or fountain in a noonday grove  but the corroboration comes in strange guise  mr rawnsley asked one of the dalesmen about wordsworths dress and habits  this was the reply wudsworth wore a jem crow never seed him in a boxer in my lifea jem crow and an old blue cloak was his rig and as for his habits he had noan niver knew him with a pot i his hand or a pipe i his mouth  but he was a great skater for a thatnoan better in these partswhy he could cut his own naame upo the ice could mr wudsworth  skating seems to have been wordsworths one form of amusement  he was over feckless i his handscould not drive or ridenot a bit of fish in him and nowt of a mountaineer  but he could skate  the rapture of the time when as a boy on esthwaites frozen lake he had        wheeled about    proud and exulting like an untired horse    that cares not for his home and shod with steel    had hissed along the polished ice  was continued mr rawnsley tells us into manhoods later day and mr rawnsley found many proofs that the skill the poet had gained when     not seldom from the uproar he retired    into a silent bay or sportively    glanced sideway leaving the tumultuous throng    to cut across the reflex of a star  was of such a kind as to astonish the natives among whom he dwelt  the recollection of a fall he once had when his skate caught on a stone still lingers in the district  a boy had been sent to sweep the snow from the white moss tarn for him  did mr wudsworth gie ye owt he was asked when he returned from his labour  na but i seed him tumlle though was the answer  he was a terble girt skater was wudsworth now says one of mr rawnsleys informants he would put one hand i his breast he wore a frill shirt i them days and tother hand i his waistband same as shepherds does to keep their hands warm and he would stand up straight and sway and swing away grandly  of his poetry they did not think much and whatever was good in it they ascribed to his wife his sister and hartley coleridge  he wrote poetry they said because he couldnt help itbecause it was his hobbyfor sheer love and not for money  they could not understand his doing work for nowt and held his occupation in somewhat light esteem because it did not bring in a deal o brass to the pocket  did you ever read his poetry or see any books about in the farmhouses asked mr rawnsley  the answer was curious ay ay time or two  but yare weel aware theres potry and potry  theres potry wi a lile bit pleasant in it and potry sic as a man can laugh at or the childer understand and some as takes a deal of mastery to make out whats said and a deal of wudsworths was this sort ye kna  you could tell fra the mans faace his potry would niver have no laugh in it  his potry was quite different work from lile hartley  hartley ud goa running along beside o the brooks and mak his and goa in the first oppen door and write what he had got upo paper  but wudsworths potry was real hard stuff and bided a deal of makking and hed keep it in his head for long enough  eh but its queer mon different ways folks hes of making potry now    not but what mr wudsworth didnt stand very high and was a wellspoken man enough  the best criticism on wordsworth that mr rawnsley heard was this he was an openair man and a great critic of trees  there are many useful and wellwritten essays in professor knights volume but mr rawnsleys is far the most interesting of all  it gives us a graphic picture of the poet as he appeared in outward semblance and manner to those about whom he wrote        mary myles is mrs edmondss first attempt at writing fiction  mrs edmonds is well known as an authority on modern greek literature and her style has often a very pleasant literary flavour though in her dialogues she has not as yet quite grasped the difference between la langue parlee and la langue ecrite  her heroine is a sort of nausicaa from girton who develops into the pallas athena of a provincial school  she has her love romance like her homeric prototype and her odysseus returns to her at the close of the book  it is a nice story        lady dilkes art in the modern state is a book that cannot fail to interest deeply every one who cares either for art or for history  the modern state which gives its title to the book is that political and social organisation of our day that comes to us from the france of richelieu and colbert and is the direct outcome of the grand siecle the true greatness of which century as lady dilke points out consists not in its vain wars and formal stage and stilted eloquence and pompous palaces but in the formation and working out of the political and social system of which these things were the firstfruits  to the question that naturally rises on ones lips how can one dwell on the art of the seventeenth centuryit has no charm lady dilke answers that this art presents in its organisation from the point of view of social polity problems of the highest intellectual interest  throughout all its phasesto quote her own wordsthe life of france wears during the seventeenth century a political aspect  the explanation of all changes in the social system in letters in the arts in fashions even has to be sought in the necessities of the political position and the seeming caprices of taste take their rise from the same causes which went to determine the making of a treaty or the promulgation of an edict  this seems all the stranger because in times preceding letters and the arts at least appeared to flourish in conditions as far removed from the action of statecraft as if they had been a growth of fairyland  in the middle ages they were devoted to a virgin image of virtue they framed in the shade of the sanctuary an ideal shining with the beauty born of selfrenunciation of resignation to selfenforced conditions of moral and physical suffering  by the queenly venus of the renaissance they were consecrated to the joys of life and the world saw that through their perfect use men might renew their strength and behold virtue and beauty with clear eyes  it was however reserved for the rulers of france in the seventeenth century fully to realise the political function of letters and the arts in the modern state and their immense importance in connection with the prosperity of a commercial nation  the whole subject is certainly extremely fascinating  the renaissance had for its object the development of great personalities  the perfect freedom of the temperament in matters of art the perfect freedom of the intellect in intellectual matters the full development of the individual were the things it aimed at  as we study its history we find it full of great anarchies  it solved no political or social problems it did not seek to solve them  the ideal of the grand siecle and of richelieu in whom the forces of that great age were incarnate was different  the ideas of citizenship of the building up of a great nation of the centralisation of forces of collective action of ethnic unity of purpose came before the world  it was inevitable that they should have done so and lady dilke with her keen historic sense and her wonderful power of grouping facts has told us the story of their struggle and their victory  her book is from every point of view a most remarkable work  her style is almost french in its clearness its sobriety its fine and at times ascetic simplicity  the whole ground plan and intellectualconception is admirable  it is of course easy to see how much art lost by having a new mission forced upon her  the creation of a formal tradition upon classical lines is never without its danger and it is sad to find the provincial towns of france once so varied and individual in artistic expression writing to paris for designs and advice  and yet through colberts great centralising scheme of state supervision and state aid france was the one country in europe and has remained the one country in europe where the arts are not divorced from industry  the academy of painting and sculpture and the school of architecture were not to quote lady dilkes words called into being in order that royal palaces should be raised surpassing all others in magnificence     bievrebache and the savonnerie were not established only that such    palaces should be furnished more sumptuously than those of an eastern    fairytale  colbert did not care chiefly to inquire when organising    art administration what were the institutions best fitted to foster    the proper interests of art he asked in the first place what would    most contribute to swell the national importance  even so in    surrounding the king with the treasures of luxury his object was    twofoldtheir possession should indeed illustrate the crown but    should also be a unique source of advantage to the people    glassworkers were brought from venice and lacemakers from flanders    that they might yield to france the secrets of their skill  palaces    and public buildings were to afford commissions for french artists    and a means of technical and artistic education for all those employed    upon them  the royal collections were but a further instrument in    educating the taste and increasing the knowledge of the working    classes  the costly factories of the savonnerie and the gobelins were    practical schools in which every detail of every branch of all those    industries which contribute to the furnishing and decoration of houses    were brought to perfection whilst a band of chosen apprentices were    trained in the adjoining schools  to colbert is due the honour of    having foreseen not only that the interests of the modern state were    inseparably bound up with those of industry but also that the    interests of industry could not without prejudice be divorced from    art  mr bret harte has never written anything finer than cressy  it is one of his most brilliant and masterly productions and will take rank with the best of his californian stories  hawthorne recreated for us the america of the past with the incomparable grace of a very perfect artist but mr bret hartes emphasised modernity has in its own sphere won equal or almost equal triumphs  wit pathos humour realism exaggeration and romance are in this marvellous story all blended together and out of the very clash and chaos of these things comes life itself  and what a curious life it is half civilised and half barbarous naive and corrupt chivalrous and commonplace real and improbable  cressy herself is the most tantalising of heroines  she is always eluding ones grasp  it is difficult to say whether she sacrifices herself on the altar of romance or is merely a girl with an extraordinary sense of humour  she is intangible and the more we know of her the more incomprehensible she becomes  it is pleasant to come across a heroine who is not identified with any great cause and represents no important principle but is simply a wonderful nymph from american backwoods who has in her something of artemis and not a little of aphrodite        it is always a pleasure to come across an american poet who is not national and who tries to give expression to the literature that he loves rather than to the land in which he lives  the muses care so little for geography  mr richard days poems have nothing distinctively american about them  here and there in his verse one comes across a flower that does not bloom in our meadows a bird to which our woodlands have never listened  but the spirit that animates the verse is simple and human and there is hardly a poem in the volume that english lips might not have uttered  sounds of the temple has much in it that is interesting in metre as well as in matter     then sighed a poet from his soul       the clouds are blown across the stars       and chill have grown my lattice bars    i cannot keep my vigil whole    by the lone candle of my soul     this reed had once devoutest tongue       and sang as if to its small throat       god listened for a perfect note    as charily this lyre was strung    gods praise is slow and has no tongue  but the best poem is undoubtedly the hymn to the mountain     within the hollow of thy hand       this wooded dell half up the height       where streams take breath midway in flight    here let me stand     here warbles not a lowland bird       here are no babbling tongues of men       thy rivers rustling through the glen    alone are heard     above no pinion cleaves its way       save when the eagles wing as now       with sweep imperial shades thy brow    beetling and grey     what thoughts are thine majestic peak       and moods that were not born to chime       with poets ineffectual rhyme    and numbers weak     the green earth spreads thy gaze before       and the unfailing skies are brought       within the level of thy thought    there is no more     the stars salute thy rugged crown       with syllables of twinkling fire       like choral burst from distant choir    their psalm rolls down     and i within this temple niche       like statue set where prophets talk       catch strains they murmur as they walk    and i am rich  miss ella curtiss a game of chance is certainly the best novel that this clever young writer has as yet produced  if it has a fault it is that it is crowded with too much incident and often surrenders the study of character to the development of plot  indeed it has many plots each of which in more economical hands would have served as the basis of a complete story  we have as the central incident the career of a clever ladysmaid who personifies her mistress and is welcomed by sir john erskine an english country gentleman as the widow of his dead son  the real husband of the adventuress tracks his wife to england and claims her  she pretends that he is insane and has him removed  then he tries to murder her and when she recovers she finds her beauty gone and her secret discovered  there is quite enough sensation here to interest even the jaded city man who is said to have grown quite critical of late on the subject of what is really a thrilling plot  but miss curtis is not satisfied  the ladysmaid has an extremely handsome brother who is a wonderful musician and has a divine tenor voice  with him the stately lady judith falls wildly in love and this part of the story is treated with a great deal of subtlety and clever analysis  however lady judith does not marry her rustic orpheus so the social convenances are undisturbed  the romance of the rector of the parish who falls in love with a charming schoolteacher is a good deal overshadowed by lady judiths story but it is pleasantly told  a more important episode is the marriage between the daughter of the tory squire and the radical candidate for the borough  they separate on their weddingday and are not reconciled till the third volume  no one could say that miss curtiss book is dull  in fact her style is very bright and amusing  it is impossible perhaps not to be a little bewildered by the amount of characters and by the crowded incidents but on the whole the scheme of the construction is clear and certainly the decoration is admirable  1 wordsworthiana a selection from papers read to the wordsworth society  edited by william knight  macmillan and co  2 mary myles  by e m edmonds  remington and co  3 art in the modern state  by lady dilke  chapman and hall  4 cressy  by bret harte  macmillan and co  5 poems  by richard day  new york cassell and co  6 a game of chance  by ella curtis  hurst and blackett     mr froudes bluebook   pall mall gazette april 13 1889  bluebooks are generally dull reading but bluebooks on ireland have always been interesting  they form the record of one of the great tragedies of modern europe  in them england has written down her indictment against herself and has given to the world the history of her shame  if in the last century she tried to govern ireland with an insolence that was intensified by race hatred and religious prejudice she has sought to rule her in this century with a stupidity that is aggravated by good intentions  the last of these bluebooks mr froudes heavy novel has appeared however somewhat too late  the society that he describes has long since passed away  an entirely new factor has appeared in the social development of the country and this factor is the irishamerican and his influence  to mature its powers to concentrate its actions to learn the secret of its own strength and of englands weakness the celtic intellect has had to cross the atlantic at home it had but learned the pathetic weakness of nationality in a strange land it realised what indomitable forces nationality possesses what captivity was to the jews exile has been to the irish  america and american influence has educated them  their first practical leader is an irishamerican  but while mr froudes book has no practical relation to modern irish politics and does not offer any solution of the present question it has a certain historical value  it is a vivid picture of ireland in the latter half of the eighteenth century a picture often false in its lights and exaggerated in its shadows but a picture none the less  mr froude admits the martyrdom of ireland but regrets that the martyrdom was not more completely carried out  his ground of complaint against the executioner is not his trade but his bungling  it is the bluntness not the cruelty of the sword that he objects to  resolute government that shallow shibboleth of those who do not understand how complex a thing the art of government is is his posthumous panacea for past evils  his hero colonel goring has the words law and order ever on his lips meaning by the one the enforcement of unjust legislation and implying by the other the suppression of every fine national aspiration  that the government should enforce iniquity and the governed submit to it seems to mr froude as it certainly is to many others the true ideal of political science  like most penmen he overrates the power of the sword where england has had to struggle she has been wise  where physical strength has been on her side as in ireland she has been made unwieldy by that strength  her own strong hands have blinded her  she has had force but no direction  there is of course a story in mr froudes novel  it is not simply a political disquisition  the interest of the tale such as it is centres round two men colonel goring and morty sullivan the cromwellian and the celt  these men are enemies by race and creed and feeling  the first represents mr froudes cure for ireland  he is a resolute englishman with strong nonconformist tendencies who plants an industrial colony on the coast of kerry and has deeprooted objections to that illicit trade with france which in the last century was the sole method by which the irish people were enabled to pay their rents to their absentee landlords colonel goring bitterly regrets that the penal laws against the catholics are not rigorously carried out  he is a police at any price man     and this said goring scornfully is what you call governing    ireland hanging up your law like a scarecrow in the garden till every    sparrow has learnt to make a jest of it  your popery acts  well you    borrowed them from france  the french catholics did not choose to    keep the hugonots among them and recalled the edict of nantes  as    they treated the hugonots so you said to all the world that you would    treat the papists  you borrowed from the french the very language of    your statute but they are not afraid to stand by their law and you    are afraid to stand by yours  you let the people laugh at it and in    teaching them to despise one law you teach them to despise all    lawsgods and mans alike  i cannot say how it will end but i can    tell you this that you are training up a race with the education    which you are giving them that will astonish mankind by and bye  mr froudes resume of the history of ireland is not without power though it is far from being really accurate  the irish he tells us had disowned the facts of life and the facts of life had proved the strongest  the english unable to tolerate anarchy so near their shores consulted the pope  the pope gave them leave to interfere and the pope had the best of the bargain  for the english brought him in and the irish    kept him there  englands first settlers were norman nobles  they became more irish than the irish and england found herself in this difficulty to abandon ireland would be discreditable to rule it as a province would be contrary to english traditions  she then tried to rule by dividing and failed  the pope was too strong for her  at last she made her great political discovery  what ireland wanted was evidently an entirely new population of the same race and the same religion as her own  the new policy was partly carried out     elizabeth first and then james and then cromwell replanted the island    introducing english scots hugonots flemings dutch tens of    thousands of families of vigorous and earnest protestants who brought    their industries along with them  twice the irish    tried       to drive out this new element     they failed    but england       had no sooner accomplished her long task than she set herself to    work to spoil it again  she destroyed the industries of her colonists    by her trade laws  she set the bishops to rob them of their religion       as for the gentry the purpose for which they had been    introduced into ireland was unfulfilled  they were but alien    intruders who did nothing who were allowed to do nothing  the time    would come when an exasperated population would demand that the land    should be given back to them and england would then perhaps throw    the gentry to the wolves in the hope of a momentary peace  but her    own turn would follow  she would be face to face with the old    problem either to make a new conquest or to retire with disgrace  political disquisitions of this kind and prophecies after the event are found all through mr froudes book and on almost every second page we come across aphorisms on the irish character on the teachings of irish history and on the nature of englands mode of government  some of them represent mr froudes own views others are entirely dramatic and introduced for the purpose of characterisation  we append some specimens  as epigrams they are not very felicitous but they are interesting from some points of view     irish society grew up in happy recklessness  insecurity added zest to    enjoyment     we irish must either laugh or cry and if we went in for crying we    should all hang ourselves     too close a union with the irish had produced degeneracy both of    character and creed in all the settlements of english     we age quickly in ireland with the whiskey and the broken heads     the irish leaders cannot fight  they can make the country    ungovernable and keep an english army occupied in watching them     no nation can ever achieve a liberty that will not be a curse to them    except by arms in the field     the irish are taught from their cradles that english rule is the    cause of all their miseries  they were as ill off under their own    chiefs but they would bear from their natural leaders what they will    not bear from us and if we have not made their lot more wretched we    have not made it any better     patriotism  yes  patriotism of the hibernian order  the country    has been badly treated and is poor and miserable  this is the    patriots stock in trade  does he want it mended  not he  his own    occupation would be gone     irish corruption is the twinbrother of irish eloquence     england will not let us break the heads of our scoundrels she will    not break them herself we are a free country and must take the    consequences     the functions of the angloirish government were to do what ought not    to be done and to leave undone what ought to be done     the irish race have always been noisy useless and ineffectual  they    have produced nothing they have done nothing which it is possible to    admire  what they are that they have always been and the only hope    for them is that their ridiculous irish nationality should be buried    and forgotten     the irish are the best actors in the world     order is an exotic in ireland  it has been imported from england but    it will not grow  it suits neither soil nor climate  if the english    wanted order in ireland they should have left none of us alive     when ruling powers are unjust nature reasserts her rights     even anarchy has its advantages     nature keeps an accurate account     the longer a bill is left    unpaid the heavier the accumulation of interest     you cannot live in ireland without breaking laws on one side or    another  pecca fortiter therefore as     luther said     the animal spirits of the irish remained when all else was gone and    if there was no purpose in their lives they could at least enjoy    themselves     the irish peasants can make the country hot for the protestant    gentleman but that is all they are fit for  as we said before if mr froude intended his book to help the tory government to solve the irish question he has entirely missed his aim the ireland of which he writes has disappeared  as a record however of the incapacity of a teutonic to rule a celtic people against their own wish his book is not without value  it is dull but dull books are very popular at present and as people have grown a little tired of talking about robert elsmere they will probably take to discussing the two chiefs of dunboy  there are some who will welcome with delight the idea of solving the irish question by doing away with the irish people  there are others who will remember that ireland has extended her boundaries and that we have now to reckon with her not merely in the old world but in the new  the two chiefs of dunboy or an irish romance of the last century  by j a froude  longmans green and co     some literary notesv   womans world may 1889  miss caroline fitz geralds volume of poems venetia victrix is dedicated to mr robert browning and in the poem that gives its title to the book it is not difficult to see traces of mr brownings influence venetia victrix is a powerful psychological study of a mans soul a vivid presentation of a terrible fierycoloured moment in a marred and incomplete life  it is sometimes complex and intricate in expression but then the subject itself is intricate and complex  plastic simplicity of outline may render for us the visible aspect of life it is different when we come to deal with those secrets which selfconsciousness alone contains and which selfconsciousness itself can but half reveal  action takes place in the sunlight but the soul works in the dark  there is something curiously interesting in the marked tendency of modern poetry to become obscure  many critics writing with their eyes fixed on the masterpieces of past literature have ascribed this tendency to wilfulness and to affectation  its origin is rather to be found in the complexity of the new problems and in the fact that selfconsciousness is not yet adequate to explain the contents of the ego  in mr brownings poems as in life itself which has suggested or rather necessitated the new method thought seems to proceed not on logical lines but on lines of passion  the unity of the individual is being expressed through its inconsistencies and its contradictions  in a strange twilight man is seeking for himself and when he has found his own image he cannot understand it  objective forms of art such as sculpture and the drama sufficed one for the perfect presentation of life they can no longer so suffice  the central motive of miss caroline fitz geralds psychological poem is the study of a man who to do a noble action wrecks his own soul sells it to evil and to the spirit of evil  many martyrs have for a great cause sacrificed their physical life the sacrifice of the spiritual life has a more poignant and a more tragic note  the story is supposed to be told by a french doctor sitting at his window in paris one evening     how far off venice seems tonight  how dim    the stillremembered sunsets with the rim    of gold round the stone haloes where they stand    those carven saints and look towards the land    right westward perched on high with palm in hand    completing the peaked churchfront  oh how clear    and dark against the evening splendour  steer    between the graveyard island and the quay    where northwinds dash the spray on venicesee    the rosy light behind dark dome and tower    or gaunt smokeladen chimneymark the power    of natures gentleness in rise or fall    of

shroud    over murano in the dying day    i see it now as thenso far away  the face of a boy in the street catches his eye  he seems to see in it some likeness to a dead friend  he begins to think and at last remembers a hospital ward in venice        twas an april day    the year napoleons troops took venicesay    the twentyfifth of april  all alone    walking the ward i heard a sick man moan    in tones so piteous as his heart would break    lost lost and lost againfor venice sake    i turned  there lay a man no longer young    wasted with fever  i had marked none hung    about his bed as friends with tenderness    and when the priest went by he spared to bless    glancing perplexedperhaps mere sullenness    i stopped and questioned what is lost my friend    my soul is lost and now draws near the end    my soul is surely lost  send me no priest    they sing and solemnise the marriage feast    of mans salvation in the house of love    and i in hell and god in heaven above    and venice safe and fair on earth between    no love of minemere servicefor my queen  he was a seaman and the tale he tells the doctor before he dies is strange and not a little terrible  wild rage against a fosterbrother who had bitterly wronged him and who was one of the ten rulers over venice drives him to make a mad oath that on the day when he does anything for his countrys good he will give his soul to satan  that night he sails for dalmatia and as he is keeping the watch he sees a phantom boat with seven fiends sailing to venice     i heard the fiends shrill cry for venice good

not weak with tears    pealing like ruinous thunder in mine ears    i fell and heard no more  the pale day broke    through lazarwindows when once more i woke    remembering i might no more dare to pray  the idea of the story is extremely powerful and venetia victrix is certainly the best poem in the volumebetter than ophelion which is vague and than a friars story which is pretty but ordinary  it shows that we have in miss fitz gerald a new singer of considerable ability and vigour of mind and it serves to remind us of the splendid dramatic possibilities extant in life which are ready for poetry and unsuitable for the stage  what is really dramatic is not necessarily that which is fitting for presentation in a theatre  the theatre is an accident of the dramatic form  it is not essential to it  we have been deluded by the name of action  to think is to act  of the shorter poems collected here this hymn to persephone is perhaps the best     oh fill my cup persephone       with dim red wine of spring          and drop therein a faded leaf          plucked from the autumns bearded sheaf    whence dread one i may quaff to thee       while all the woodlands ring     oh fill my heart persephone       with thine immortal pain          that lingers round the willow bowers          in memories of old happy hours    when thou didst wander fair and free       oer ennas blooming plain     oh fill my soul persephone       with music all thine own          teach me some song thy childhood knew          lisped in the meadows morning dew    or chant on this high windy lea       thy godheads ceaseless moan  but this venetian song also has a good deal of charm     leaning between carved stone and stone       as glossy birds peer from a nest       scooped in the crumbling trunk where rest    their freckled eggs i pause alone          and linger in the light awhile             waiting for joy to come to me          only the dawn beyond yon isle             only the sunlight on the sea     i gazethen turn and ply my loom       or broider blossoms close beside       the morning world lies warm and wide    but here is dim cool silent gloom          gold crust and crimson velvet pile             and not one face to smile on me          only the dawn beyond yon isle             only the sunlight on the sea     over the world the splendours break       of morning light and noontide glow       and when the broad red sun sinks low    and in the wave long shadows shake          youths maidens glad with song and wile             glide and are gone and leave with me          only the dawn beyond yon isle             only the sunlight on the sea  darwinism and politics by mr david ritchie of jesus college oxford contains some very interesting speculations on the position and the future of women in the modern state  the one objection to the equality of the sexes that he considers deserves serious attention is that made by sir james stephen in his clever attack on john stuart mill  sir james stephen points out in liberty equality fraternity that women may suffer more than they have done if plunged into a nominally equal but really unequal contest in the already overcrowded labour market  mr ritchie answers that while the conclusion usually drawn from this argument is a sentimental reaction in favour of the old family ideal as for instance in mr besants books there is another alternative and that is the resettling of the labour question  the elevation of the status of women and the regulation of the conditions of labour are ultimately he says inseparable questions  on the basis of individualism i cannot see how it is possible to answer the objections of sir james stephen  mr herbert spencer in his sociology expresses his fear that women if admitted now to political life might do mischief by introducing the ethics of the family into the state  under the ethics of the family the greatest benefits must be given where the merits are smallest under the ethics of the state the benefits must be proportioned to the merits  in answer to this mr ritchie asks whether in any society we have ever seen people so get benefits in proportion to their merits and protests against mr spencers separation of the ethics of the family from those of the state  if something is right in a family it is difficult to see why it is therefore without any further reason wrong in the state  if the participation of women in politics means that as a good family educates all its members so must a good state what better issue could there be  the family ideal of the state may be difficult of attainment but as an ideal it is better than the policeman theory  it would mean the moralisation of politics  the cultivation of separate sorts of virtues and separate ideals of duty in men and women has led to the whole social fabric being weaker and unhealthier than it need be  as for the objection that in countries where it is considered necessary to have compulsory military service for all men it would be unjust and inexpedient that women should have a voice in political matters mr ritchie meets it or tries to meet it by proposing that all women physically fitted for such purpose should be compelled to undergo training as nurses and should be liable to be called upon to serve as nurses in time of war  this training he remarks would be more useful to them and to the community in time of peace than his military training is to the peasant or artisan  mr ritchies little book is extremely suggestive and full of valuable ideas for the philosophic student of sociology        mr alan coles lecture on irish lace delivered recently before the society of arts contains some extremely useful suggestions as to the best method of securing an immediate connection between the art schools of a country and the countrys ordinary manufactures  in 1883 mr cole was deputed by the department of science and art to lecture at cork and at limerick on the subject of lacemaking and to give a history of its rise and development in other countries as well as a review of the many kinds of ornamental patterns used from the sixteenth century to modern times  in order to make these lectures of practical value mr cole placed typical specimens of irish laces beside italian flemish and french laces which seem to be the prototypes of the lace of ireland  the public interest was immediately aroused  some of the newspapers stoutly maintained that the ornament and patterns of irish lace were of such a national character that it was wrong to asperse them on that score others took a different view and came to the conclusion that irish lace could be vastly improved in all respects if some systematic action could be taken to induce the lacemakers to work from more intelligently composed patterns than those in general use  there was a consensus of opinion that the workmanship of irish laces was good and that it could be applied to better materials than those ordinarily used and that its methods were suited to render a greater variety of patterns than those usually attempted  these and other circumstances seem to have prompted the promoters of the cork exhibition to further efforts in the cause of lacemaking  towards the close of the year 1883 they made fresh representations to government and inquired what forms of state assistance could be given  a number of convents in the neighbourhood of cork was engaged in giving instruction to children under their care in lace and crochet making  at some rooms were allotted for the use of grownup workers who made laces under the supervision of the nuns  these convents obviously were centres where experiments in reform could be tried  the convents however lacked instruction in the designing of patterns for laces  an excellent school of art was at work at cork but the students there had not been instructed in specially designing for lace  if the convents with their workrooms could be brought into relation with this school of art it seemed possible that something of a serious character might be done to benefit lacemakers and also to open up a new field in ornamental design for the students at the school of art  the rules of the department of science and art were found to be adapted to aid in meeting such wants as those sketched out by the promoters at cork  as the nuns in the different lacemaking convents had not been able to attend in cork to hear mr coles lectures they asked that he should visit them and repeat them at the convents  this mr cole did early in 1884 the masters of the local schools of art accompanying him on his visits  negotiations were forthwith opened for connecting the convents with the art schools by the end of 1885 some six or seven different lacemaking convents had placed themselves in connection with schools of art at cork and waterford  these convents were attended not only by the nuns but by outside pupils also and at the request of the convents mr cole has visited them twice a year lecturing and giving advice upon designs for lace  the composition of new patterns for lace was attempted and old patterns which had degenerated were revised and redrawn for the use of the workers connected with the convents  there are now twelve convents mr cole tells us where instruction in drawing and in the composition of patterns is given and some of the students have won some of the higher prizes offered by the department of science and art for designing lace patterns  the cork school of art then acquired a collection of finelypatterned old laces selections from which are freely circulated through the different convents connected with that school  they have also the privilege of borrowing similar specimens of old lace from the south kensington museum so successful has been the system of education pursued by mr brennan the headmaster of the cork school of art that two female students of his school last year gained the gold and silver medals for their designs for laces and crochets at the national competition which annually takes place in london between all the schools of art in the united kingdom  as for the many lacemakers who were not connected either with the convents or with the art schools in order to assist them a committee of ladies and gentlemen interested in irish lacemaking raised subscriptions and offered prizes to be competed for by designers generally  the best designs were then placed out with lacemakers and carried into execution  it is of course often said that the proper person to make the design is the lacemaker  mr cole however points out that from the sixteenth century forward the patterns for ornamental laces have always been designed by decorative artists having knowledge of the composition of ornament and of the materials for which they were called upon to design  lace pattern books were published in considerable quantity in italy france and germany during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries and from these the lacemakers worked  many lace makers would no doubt derive benefit from practice in drawing in discriminating between well and badly shaped forms  but the skill they are primarily required to show and to develop is one of fine fingers in reproducing beautiful forms in threads  the conception arrangement and drawing of beautiful forms for a design have to be undertaken by decorative artists acquainted with the limitations of those materials and methods which the ultimate expression of the design involves  this lovely irish art of lacemaking is very much indebted to mr cole who has really recreated it given it new life and shown it the true artistic lines on which to progress  hardly 20000 pounds a year is spent by england upon irish laces and almost all of this goes upon the cheaper and commoner kinds  and yet as mr cole points out it is possible to produce irish laces of as high artistic quality as almost any foreign laces  the queen lady londonderry lady dorothy nevill mrs alfred morrison and others have done much to encourage the irish workers and it rests largely with the ladies of england whether this beautiful art lives or dies  the real good of a piece of lace says mr ruskin is that it should show first that the designer of it had a pretty fancy next that the maker of it had fine fingers lastly that the wearer of it has worthiness or dignity enough to obtain what is difficult to obtain and commonsense enough not to wear it on all occasions        the highcaste hindu woman is an interesting book  it is from the pen of the pundita ramabai sarasvati and the introduction is written by miss rachel bodley md the dean of the womans medical college of pennsylvania  the story of the parentage of this learned lady is very curious  a certain hindu being on a religious pilgrimage with his family which consisted of his wife and two daughters one nine and the other seven years of age stopped in a town to rest for a day or two  one morning the hindu was bathing in the sacred river godavari near the town when he saw a finelooking man coming there to bathe also  after the ablution and the morning prayers were over the father inquired of the stranger who he was and whence he came  on learning his caste and clan and dwellingplace and also that he was a widower he offered him his little daughter of nine in marriage  all things were settled in an hour or so next day the marriage was concluded and the little girl placed in the possession of the stranger who took her nearly nine hundred miles away from her home and gave her into the charge of his mother  the stranger was the learned ananta shastri a brahman pundit who had very advanced views on the subject of womans education and he determined that he would teach his girlwife sanskrit and give her the intellectual culture that had been always denied to women in india  their daughter was the pundita ramabai who after the death of her parents travelled all over india advocating the cause of female education and to whom seems to be due the first suggestion for the establishment of the profession of women doctors  in 1866 miss mary carpenter made a short tour in india for the purpose of finding out some way by which womens condition in that country might be improved  she at once discovered that the chief means by which the desired end could be accomplished was by furnishing women teachers for the hindu zenanas  she suggested that the british government should establish normal schools for training women teachers and that scholarships should be awarded to girls in order to prolong their schoolgoing period and to assist indigent women who would otherwise be unable to pursue their studies  in response to miss carpenters appeal upon her return to england the english government founded several schools for women in india and a few mary carpenter scholarships were endowed by benevolent persons  these schools were open to women of every caste but while they have undoubtedly been of use they have not realised the hopes of their founders chiefly through the impossibility of keeping caste rules in them  ramabai in a very eloquent chapter proposes to solve the problem in a different way  her suggestion is that houses should be opened for the young and highcaste childwidows where they can take shelter without the fear of losing their caste or of being disturbed in their religious belief and where they may have entire freedom of action as regards caste rules  the whole account given by the pundita of the life of the highcaste hindu lady is full of suggestion for the social reformer and the student of progress and her book which is wonderfully well written is likely to produce a radical change in the educational schemes that at present prevail in india  1 venetia victrix  by caroline fitz gerald  macmillan and co  2 darwinism and politics  by david ritchie jesus

romantics  she belongs to the school of bulwer lytton and george sand though she may lack the learning of the one and the sincerity of the other  she tries to make passion imagination and poetry part of fiction  she still believes in heroes and in heroines she is florid and fervent and fanciful  yet even she the high priestess of the impossible is affected by her age  her last book guilderoy as she calls it is an elaborate psychological study of modern temperaments for her it is realistic and she has certainly caught much of the tone and temper of the society of our day  her people move with ease and grace and indolence  the book may be described as a study of the peerage from a poetical point of view  those who are tired of mediocre young curates who have doubts of serious young ladies who have missions and of the ordinary figureheads of most of the english fiction of our time might turn with pleasure if not with profit to this amazing romance  it is a resplendent picture of our aristocracy  no expense has been spared in gilding  for the comparatively small sum of 1 pound 11s 6d one is introduced to the best society  the central figures are exaggerated but the background is admirable  in spite of everything it gives one a sense of something like life  what is the story  well we must admit that we have a faint suspicion that ouida has told it to us before  lord guilderoy whose name was as old as the days of knut falls madly in love or fancies that he falls madly in love with a rustic perdita a provincial artemis who has a gainsborough face with wideopened questioning eyes and tumbled auburn hair  she is poor but wellborn being the only child of mr vernon of llanarth a curious recluse who is half a pedant and half don quixote guilderoy marries her and tiring of her shyness her lack of power to express herself her want of knowledge of fashionable life returns to an old passion for a wonderful creature called the duchess of soria  lady guilderoy becomes ice the duchess becomes fire at the end of the book guilderoy is a pitiable object  he has to submit to be forgiven by one woman and to endure to be forgotten by the other  he is thoroughly weak thoroughly worthless and the most fascinating person in the whole story  then there is his sister lady sunbury who is very anxious for guilderoy to marry and is quite determined to hate his wife  she is really a capital sketch  ouida describes her as one of those admirably virtuous women who are more likely to turn men away from the paths of virtue than the wickedest of sirens  she irritates herself alienates her children and infuriates her husband     you are perfectly right i know you are always right i admit you    are but it is just that which makes you so damnably odious said    lord sunbury once in a burst of rage in his town house speaking in    such stentorian tones that the people passing up grosvenor street    looked up at his open windows and a crossingsweeper said to a match    seller my eye aint he giving it to the old gal like blazes  the noblest character in the book is lord aubrey  as he is not a genius he naturally behaves admirably on every occasion  he begins by pitying the neglected lady guilderoy and ends by loving her but he makes the great renunciation with considerable effect and having induced lady guilderoy to receive back her husband he accepts a distant and arduous viceroyalty  he is ouidas ideal of the true politician for ouida has apparently taken to the study of english politics  a great deal of her book is devoted to political disquisitions  she believes that the proper rulers of a country like ours are the aristocrats  oligarchy has great fascinations for her  she thinks meanly of the people and adores the house of lords and lord salisbury  here are some of her views  we will not call them ideas     the house of lords wants nothing of the nation and therefore it is    the only candid and disinterested guardian of the peoples needs and    resources  it has never withstood the real desire of the country it    has only stood between the country and its impetuous and evanescent    follies     a democracy cannot understand honour how should it  the caucus is    chiefly made up of men who sand their sugar put alum in their bread    forge bayonets and girders which bend like willowwands send bad    calico to india and insure vessels at lloyds which they know will go    to the bottom before they have been ten days at sea     lord salisbury has often been accused of arrogance people have never    seen that what they mistook for arrogance was the natural candid    consciousness of a great noble that he is more capable of leading the    country than most men composing it would be     democracy after having made everything supremely hideous and    uncomfortable for everybody always ends by clinging to the coat tails    of some successful general     the prosperous politician may be honest but his honesty is at best a    questionable quality  the moment that a thing is a metier it is    wholly absurd to talk about any disinterestedness in the pursuit of    it  to the professional politician national affairs are a manufacture    into which he puts his audacity and his time and out of which he    expects to make so much percentage for his lifetime     there is too great a tendency to govern the world by noise  ouidas aphorisms on women love and modern society are somewhat more characteristic     women speak as though the heart were to be treated at will like a    stone or a bath    half the passions of men die early because they are expected to be    eternal    it is the folly of life that lends charm to it    what is the cause of half the misery of women  that their love is so    much more tenacious than the mans it grows stronger as his grows    weaker    to endure the country in england for long one must have the rusticity    of wordsworths mind and boots and stockings as homely    it is because men feel the necessity to explain that they drop into    the habit of saying what is not true  wise is the woman who never    insists on an explanation    love can make its own world in a solitude a deux but marriage cannot    nominally monogamous all cultured society is polygamous often even    polyandrous    moralists say that a soul should resist passion  they might as well    say that a house should resist an earthquake    the whole world is just now on its knees before the poorer classes    all the cardinal virtues are taken for granted in them and it is only    property of any kind which is the sinner    men are not merciful to womens tears as a rule and when it is a    woman belonging to them who weeps they only go out and slam the door    behind them    men always consider women unjust to them when they fail to deify    their weaknesses    no passion once broken will ever bear renewal    feeling loses its force and its delicacy if we put it under the    microscope too often    anything which is not flattery seems injustice to a woman    when society is aware that you think it a flock of geese it revenges    itself by hissing loudly behind your back  of descriptions of scenery and art we have of course a large number and it is impossible not to recognise the touch of the real ouida manner in the following     it was an old palace lofty spacious magnificent and dull  busts    of dusky yellow marble weird bronzes stretching out gaunt arms into    the darkness ivories brown with age worn brocades with gold threads    gleaming in them and tapestries with strange and pallid figures of    dead gods were all half revealed and half obscured in the twilight    as he moved through them a figure which looked almost as pale as the    adonis of the tapestry and was erect and motionless like the statue of    the wounded love came before his sight out of the darkness  it was    that of gladys  it is a manner full of exaggeration and overemphasis but with some remarkable rhetorical qualities and a good deal of colour  ouida is fond of airing a smattering of culture but she has a certain intrinsic insight into things and though she is rarely true she is never dull guilderoy with all its faults which are great and its absurdities which are greater is a book to be read  guilderoy  by ouida  chatto and windus     some literary notesvi   womans world june 1889  a writer in the quarterly review for january 1874 says     no literary event since the war has excited anything like such a    sensation in paris as the publication of the lettres a une inconnue    even politics became a secondary consideration for the hour and    academicians or deputies of opposite parties might be seen eagerly    accosting each other in the chamber or the street to inquire who this    fascinating and perplexing unknown could be  the statement in the    revue des deux mondes that she was an englishwoman moving in    brilliant society was not supported by evidence and m blanchard    the painter from whom the publisher received the manuscripts died    most provokingly at the very commencement of the inquiry and made no    sign  some intimate friends of merimee rendered incredulous by    wounded selflove at not having been admitted to his confidence    insisted that there was no secret to tell their hypothesis being that    the inconnue was a myth and the letters a romance with which some    petty details of actual life had been interwoven to keep up the    mystification  but an artist like merimee would not have left his work in so unformed a state so defaced by repetitions or with such a want of proportion between the parts  the inconnue was undoubtedly a real person and her letters in answer to those of merimee have just been published by messrs macmillan under the title of an authors love  her letters  well they are such letters as she might have written  by the tideless sea at cannes on a summer day says their anonymous author i had fallen asleep and the plashing of the waves upon the shore had doubtless made me dream  when i awoke the yellow papercovered volumes of prosper merimees lettres a une inconnue lay beside me i had been reading the book before i fell asleep but the answershad they ever been written or had i only dreamed  the invention of the loveletters of a curious and unknown personality the heroine of one of the great literary flirtations of our age was a clever idea and certainly the author has carried out his scheme with wonderful success with such success indeed that it is said that one of our statesmen whose name occurs more than once in the volume was for a moment completely taken in by what is really a jeudesprit the first serious joke perpetrated by messrs macmillan in their publishing capacity  perhaps it is too much to call it a joke  it is a fine delicate piece of fiction an imaginative attempt to complete a real romance  as we had the letters of the academic romeo it was obviously right that we should pretend we had the answers of the clever and somewhat mondaine juliet  or is it juliet herself in her little paris boudoir looking over these two volumes with a sad cynical smile  well to be put into fiction is always a tribute to ones reality  as for extracts from these fascinating forgeries the letters should be read in conjunction with those of merimee himself  it is difficult to judge of them by samples  we find the inconnue first in london probably in 1840     little she writes can you imagine the storm of indignation you    aroused in me by your remark that your feelings for me were those    suitable for a fourteenyearold niece  merci  anything less like a    respectable uncle than yourself i cannot well imagine  the role would    never suit you believe me so do not try it     now in return for your story of the phlegmatic musical animal who    called forth such stormy devotion in a female breast and who himself    cold and indifferent was loved to the extent of a watery grave being    sought by his inamorata as solace for his indifference let me ask    the question why the women who torment men with their uncertain    tempers drive them wild with jealousy laugh contemptuously at their    humble entreaties and fling their money to the winds have twice the    hold upon their affections that the patient longsuffering domestic    frugal griseldas have whose existences are one long penance of    unsuccessful efforts to please  answer this comprehensively and you    will have solved a riddle which has puzzled women since eve asked    questions in paradise  later on she writes     why should all natures be alike  it would make the old saws useless    if they were and deprive us of one of the truest of them all    variety is the spice of life  how terribly monotonous it would be    if all the flowers were roses every woman a queen and each man a    philosopher  my private opinion is that it takes at least six men    such as one meets every day to make one really valuable one  i like    so many men for one particular quality which they possess and so few    men for all  comprenezvous  in another place     is it not a trifle dangerous this experiment we are trying of a    friendship in pen and ink and paper  a letter  what thing on earth    more dangerous to confide in  written at blood heat it may reach its    destination when the recipients mental thermometer counts zero and    the burning words and thrilling sentences may turn to ice and be    congealed as they are read     a letter the most uncertain thing    in a world of uncertainties the best or the worst thing devised by    mortals  again     surely it was for you mon cher that the description given of a    friend of mine was originally intended  he is a trifle cynical this    friend and decidedly pessimistic and of him it was reported that he    never believed in anything until he saw it and then he was convinced    that it was an optical illusion  the accuracy of the description    struck me  they seem to have loved each other best when they were parted     i think i cannot bear it much longer this incessant quarrelling when    we meet and your unkindness during the short time that you are with    me  why not let it all end it would be better for both of us  i do    not love you less when i write these words if you could know the    sadness which they echo in my heart you would believe this  no i    think i love you more but i cannot understand you  as you have often    said our natures must be very different entirely different if so    what is this curious bond between them  to me you seem possessed with    some strange restlessness and morbid melancholy which utterly spoils    your life and in return you never see me without overwhelming me with    reproaches if not for one thing for another  i tell you i cannot    will not bear it longer  if you love me then in gods name cease    tormenting me as well as yourself with these wretched doubts and    questionings and complaints  i have been ill seriously ill and    there is nothing to account for my illness save the misery of this    apparently hopeless state of things existing between us  you have    made me weep bitter tears of alternate selfreproach and indignation    and finally of complete miserable bewilderment as to this unhappy    condition of affairs  believe me tears like these are not good to    mingle with love they are too bitter too scorching they blister    loves wings and fall too heavily on loves heart  i feel worn out    with a dreary sort of hopelessness if you know a cure for pain like    this send it to me quickly  yet in the very next letter she says to him     although i said goodbye to you less than an hour ago i cannot    refrain from writing to tell you that a happy calm which seems to    penetrate my whole being seems also to have wiped out all remembrance    of the misery and unhappiness which has overwhelmed me lately  why    cannot it always be so or would life perhaps be then too blessed too    wholly happy for it to be life  i know that you are free tonight    will you not write to me that the first words my eyes fall upon to    morrow shall prove that today has not been a dream  yes write to    me  the letter that immediately follows is one of six words only     let me dreamlet me dream  in the following there are interesting touches of actuality     did you ever try a cup of tea the national beverage by the way at    an english railway station  if you have not i would advise you as a    friend to continue to abstain  the names of the american drinks are    rather against them the straws are i think about the best part of    them  you do not tell me what you think of mr disraeli  i once met    him at a ball at the duke of sutherlands in the long picture gallery    of stafford house  i was walking with lord shrewsbury and without a    word of warning he stopped and introduced him mentioning with    reckless mendacity that i had read every book he had written and    admired them all then he coolly walked off and left me standing face    to face with the great statesman  he talked to me for some time and    i studied him carefully  i should say he was a man with one steady    aim endless patience untiring perseverance iron concentration    marking out one straight line before him so unbending that despite    themselves men stand aside as it is drawn straightly and steadily on    a man who believes that determination brings strength strength brings    endurance and endurance brings success  you know how often in his    novels he speaks of the influence of women socially morally and    politically yet his manner was the least interested or deferential in    talking that i have ever met with in a man of his class  he certainly    thought this particular woman of singularly small account or else the    brusque and tactless allusion to his books may perhaps have annoyed    him as it did me but whatever the cause when he promptly left me at    the first approach of a mutual acquaintance i felt distinctly    snubbed  of the two men mr gladstone was infinitely more agreeable    in his manner he left one with the pleasant feeling of measuring a    little higher in cubic inches than one did before than which i know    no more delightful sensation  a paris bientot  elsewhere we find cleverlywritten descriptions of life in italy in algiers at hombourg at french boardinghouses stories about napoleon iii guizot prince gortschakoff montalembert and others political speculations literary criticisms and witty social scandal and everywhere a keen sense of humour a wonderful power of observation  as reconstructed in these letters the inconnue seems to have been not unlike merimee himself  she had the same restless unyielding independent character  each desired to analyse the other  each being a critic was better fitted for friendship than for love  we are so different said merimee once to her that we can hardly understand each other  but it was because they were so alike that each remained a mystery to the other  yet they ultimately attained to a high altitude of loyal and faithful friendship and from a purely literary point of view these fictitious letters give the finishing touch to the strange romance that so stirred paris fifteen years ago  perhaps the real letters will be published some day  when they are how interesting to compare them  the birdbride by graham r tomson is a collection of romantic ballads delicate sonnets and metrical studies in foreign fanciful forms  the poem that gives its title to the book is the lament of an eskimo hunter over the loss of his wife and children     years agone on the flat white strand       i won my sweet seagirl    wrapped in my coat of the snowwhite fur    i watched the wild birds settle and stir       the grey gulls gather and whirl     one the greatest of all the flock       perched on an icefloe bare    called and cried as her heart were broke    and straight they were changed that fleet birdfolk       to women young and fair     swift i sprang from my hidingplace       and held the fairest fast    i held her fast the sweet strange thing    her comrades skirled but they all took wing       and smote me as they passed     i bore her safe to my warm snow house       full sweetly there she smiled    and yet whenever the shrill winds blew    she would beat her long white arms anew       and her eyes glanced quick and wild     but i took her to wife and clothed her warm       with skins of the gleaming seal    her wandering glances sank to rest    when she held a babe to her fair warm breast       and she loved me dear and leal     together we tracked the fox and the seal       and at her behest i swore    that bird and beast my bow might slay    for meat and for raiment day by day       but never a grey gull more  famine comes upon the land and the hunter forgetting his oath slays four seagulls for food  the birdwife shrilled out in a woful cry and taking the plumage of the dead birds she makes wings for her children and for herself and flies away with them     babes of mine of the wild winds kin       feather ye quick nor stay    oh oho but the wild winds blow    babes of mine it is time to go       up dear hearts and away     and lo the grey plumes covered them all       shoulder and breast and brow    i felt the wind of their whirling flight    was it sea or sky was it day or night       it is always nighttime now     dear will you never relent come back       i loved you long and true    o winged white wife and our children three    of the wild winds kin though you surely be       are ye not of my kin too     ay ye once were mine and till i forget       ye are mine forever and aye    mine wherever your wild wings go    while shrill winds whistle across the snow       and the skies are blear and grey  some powerful and strong ballads follow many of which such as the cruel priest deid folks ferry and marchen are in that curious combination of scotch and border dialect so much affected now by our modern poets certainly dialect is dramatic  it is a vivid method of recreating a past that never existed  it is something between a return to nature and a return to the glossary  it is so artificial that it is really naive  from the point of view of mere music much may be said for it wonderful diminutives lend new notes of tenderness to the song  there are possibilities of fresh rhymes and in search for a fresh rhyme poets may be excused if they wander from the broad highroad of classical utterance into devious byways and lesstrodden paths  sometimes one is tempted to look on dialect as expressing simply the pathos of provincialisms but there is more in it than mere mispronunciations  with the revival of an antique form often comes the revival of an antique spirit  through limitations that are sometimes uncouth and always narrow comes tragedy herself and though she may stammer in her utterance and deck herself in castoff weeds and trammelling raiment still we must hold ourselves in readiness to accept her so rare are her visits to us now so rare her presence in an age that demands a happy ending from every play and that sees in the theatre merely a source of amusement  the form too of the balladhow perfect it is in its dramatic unity  it is so perfect that we must forgive it its dialect if it happens to speak in that strange tongue     then by cam the

tellest all the stories left unsaid    of secret rites and runes forgotten long       of that dark folk who ate the lotusbread    and sang the melancholy linussong  mrs tomson has certainly a very refined sense of form  her verse especially in the series entitled new words to old tunes has grace and distinction  some of the shorter poems are to use a phrase made classical by mr pater little carved ivories of speech  she is one of our most artistic workers in poetry and treats language as a fine material  1 an authors love being the unpublished letters of prosper merimees inconnue  macmillan and co  2 the birdbride a volume of ballads and sonnets  by graham r tomson  longmans green and co     a thoughtreaders novel   pall mall gazette june 5 1889  there is a great deal to be said in favour of reading a novel backwards the last page is as a rule the most interesting and when one begins with the catastrophe or the denoument one feels on pleasant terms of equality with the author  it is like going behind the scenes of a theatre  one is no longer taken in and the hairbreadth escapes of the hero and the wild agonies of the heroine leave one absolutely unmoved one knows the jealouslyguarded secret and one can afford to smile at the quite unnecessary anxiety that the puppets of fiction always consider it their duty to display  in the case of mr stuart cumberlands novel the vasty deep as he calls it the last page is certainly thrilling and makes us curious to know more about brown the medium  scene a padded room in a madhouse in the united states  a gibbering lunatic discovered dashing wildly about the chamber as if in the act of chasing invisible forms  this is our worst case says a doctor opening the cell to one of the visitors in lunacy  he was a spirit medium and he is hourly haunted by the creations of his fancy  we have to carefully watch him for he has developed suicidal tendencies  the lunatic makes a dash at the retreating form of his visitors and as the door closes upon him sinks with a yell upon the floor  a week later the lifeless body of brown the medium is found suspended from the gas bracket in his cell  how clearly one sees it all  how forcible and direct the style is  and what a thrilling touch of actuality the simple mention of the gas bracket gives us  certainly the vasty deep is a book to be read  and we have read it read it with great care  though it is largely autobiographical it is none the less a work of fiction and though some of us may think that there is very little use in exposing what is already exposed and revealing the secrets of polichinelle no doubt there are many who will be interested to hear of the tricks and deceptions of crafty mediums of their gauze masks telescopic rods and invisible silk threads and of the marvellous raps they can produce simply by displacing the peroneus longus muscle  the book opens with a description of the scene by the deathbed of alderman parkinson  dr josiah brown the eminent medium is in attendance and tries to comfort the honest merchant by producing noises on the bedpost  mr parkinson however being extremely anxious to revisit mrs parkinson in a materialised form after death will not be satisfied till he has received from his wife a solemn promise that she will not marry again such a marriage being in his eyes nothing more nor less than bigamy  having received an assurance to this effect from her mr parkinson dies his soul according to the medium being escorted to the spheres by a band of whiterobed spirits this is the prologue  the next chapter is entitled five years after violet parkinson the aldermans only child is in love with jack alston who is poor but clever  mrs parkinson however will not hear of any marriage till the deceased alderman has materialised himself and given his formal consent  a seance is held at which jack alston unmasks the medium and shows dr josiah brown to be an impostora foolish act on his part as he is at once ordered to leave the house by the infuriated mrs parkinson whose faith in the doctor is not in the least shaken by the unfortunate exposure  the lovers are consequently parted  jack sails for newfoundland is shipwrecked and carefully somewhat too carefully tended by lakiwa or the star that shines a lovely indian maiden who belongs to the tribe of the micmacs  she is a fascinating creature who wears a necklace composed of thirteen nuggets of pure gold a blanket of english manufacture and trousers of tanned leather  in fact as mr stuart cumberland observes she looks the embodiment of fresh dewy morn  when jack on recovering his senses sees her he naturally inquires who she is  she answers in the simple utterance endeared to us by fenimore cooper i am lakiwa  i am the only child of my father tall pine chief of the dildoos  she talks mr cumberland informs us very good english  jack at once entrusts her with the following telegram which he writes on the back of a fivepound note     miss violet parkinson hotel kronprinz franzensbad austriasafe    jack  but lakiwa we regret to say says to herself he belongs to tall pine to the dildoos and to me and never sends the telegram subsequently lakiwa proposes to jack who promptly rejects her and with the usual callousness of men offers her a brothers love  lakiwa naturally regrets the premature disclosure of her passion and weeps  my brother she remarks will think that i have the timid heart of a deer with the crying voice of a papoose  i the daughter of tall pinei a micmac to show the grief that is in my heart  o my brother i am ashamed  jack comforts her with the hollow sophistries of a civilised being and gives her his photograph  as he is on his way to the steamer he receives from big deer a soiled piece of a biscuit bag  on it is written lakiwas confession of her disgraceful behaviour about the telegram  his thoughts mr cumberland tells us were bitter towards lakiwa but they gradually softened when he remembered what he owed her  everything ends happily  jack arrives in england just in time to prevent dr josiah brown from mesmerising violet whom the cunning doctor is anxious to marry and he hurls his rival out of the window  the victim is discovered bruised and bleeding among the broken flowerpots by a comic policeman  mrs parkinson still believes in spiritualism but refuses to have anything to do with brown as she discovers that the deceased aldermans materialised beard was made only of horrid coarse horsehair  jack and violet are married at last and jack is horrid enough to send to lakiwa another photograph  the end of dr brown is chronicled above  had we not known what was in store for him we should hardly have got through the book  there is a great deal too much padding in it about dr slade and dr bartram and other mediums and the disquisitions on the commercial future of newfoundland seem endless and are intolerable  however there are many publics and mr stuart cumberland is always sure of an audience  his chief fault is a tendency to low comedy but some people like low comedy in fiction  the vasty deep a strange story of today  by stuart cumberland sampson low and co     the poets cornerx   pall mall gazette june 24 1889  is mr alfred austin among the socialists  has somebody converted the respectable editor of the respectable national review  has even dulness become revolutionary  from a poem in mr austins last volume this would seem to be the case  it is perhaps unfair to take our rhymers too seriously  between the casual fancies of a poet and the callous facts of prose there is or at least there should be a wide difference  but since the poem in question two visions as mr austin calls it was begun in 1863 and revised in 1889 we may regard it as fully representative of mr austins mature views  he gives us at any rate in its somewhat lumbering and pedestrian verses his conception of the perfect state     fearless unveiled and unattended       strolled maidens to and fro    youths looked respect but never bended       obsequiously low     and each with other sans condition       held parley brief or long    without provoking coarse suspicion       of marriage or of wrong     all were well clad and none were better       and gems beheld i none    save where there hung a jewelled fetter       symbolic in the sun     i saw a noblelooking maiden       close dantes solemn book    and go with crate of linen laden       and wash it in the brook     anon a broadbrowed poet dragging       a load of logs along    to warm his hearth withal not flagging       in current of his song     each one some handicraft attempted       or helped to till the soil    none but the aged were exempted       from communistic toil  such an expression as coarse suspicion of marriage is not very fortunate the logrolling poet of the fifth stanza is an ideal that we have already realised and one in which we had but little comfort and the fourth stanza leaves us in doubt whether mr austin means that washerwomen are to take to reading dante or that students of italian literature are to wash their own clothes  but on the whole though mr austins vision of the citta divina of the future is not very inspiriting it is certainly extremely interesting as a sign of the times and it is evident from the two concluding lines of the following stanzas that there will be no danger of the intellect being overworked     age lorded not nor rose the hectic       up to the cheek of youth    but reigned throughout their dialectic       sobriety of truth     and if a longheld contest tended       to illdefined result    it was by calm consent suspended       as overdifficult  mr austin however has other moods and perhaps he is at his best when he is writing about flowers  occasionally he wearies the reader by tedious enumerations of plants lacking indeed reticence and tact and selection in many of his descriptions but as a rule he is very pleasant when he is babbling of green fields  how pretty these stanzas from the dedication are     when vines just newly burgeoned link       their hands to join the dance of spring    green lizards glisten from cleft and chink    and almond blossoms rosy pink       cluster and perch ere taking wing     where over strips of emerald wheat       glimmer red peach and snowy pear    and nightingales all day long repeat    their lovesong not less glad than sweet       they chant in sorrow and gloom elsewhere     where purple irisbanners scale       defending walls and crumbling ledge    and virgin windflowers lithe and frail    now mantling red now trembling pale       peep out from furrow and hide in hedge  some of the sonnets also notably one entitled when acorns fall are very charming and though as a whole loves widowhood is tedious and prolix still it contains some very felicitous touches  we wish however that mr austin would not write such lines as     pippins of every sort and codlins manifold  codlins manifold is a monstrous expression  mr w j lintons fame as a woodengraver has somewhat obscured the merits of his poetry  his claribel and other poems published in 1865 is now a scarce book and far more scarce is the collection of lyrics which he printed in 1887 at his own press and brought out under the title of lovelore  the large and handsome volume that now lies before us contains nearly all these later poems as well as a selection from claribel and many renderings in the original metre of french poems ranging from the thirteenth century to our own day  a portrait of mr linton is prefixed and the book is dedicated to william bell scott my friend for nearly fifty years  as a poet mr linton is always fanciful with a studied fancifulness and often felicitous with a chance felicity he is fascinated by our seventeenthcentury singers and has here and there succeeded in catching something of their quaintness and not a little of their charm  there is a pleasant flavour about his verse  it is entirely free from violence and from vagueness those two besetting sins of so much modern poetry  it is clear in outline and restrained in form and at its best has much that is light and lovely about it  how graceful for instance this is     bare feet     o fair white feet  o dawnwhite feet       of her my hope may claim    barefooted through the dew she came       her love to meet     starglancing feet the windflowers sweet       might envy without shame    as through the grass they lightly came       her love to meet     o maiden sweet with

write a play about dante  longfellow it may be remarked was always on the side of domesticity  it was the secret of his popularity  we cannot say however that miss durant has made us like gemma better

gemma is dreadful  the play is well meant but it is lumbering and heavy and the blank verse has absolutely no merit  father oflynn and other irish lyrics by mr a p graves is a collection of poems in

author of the judgment of the city is a sort of bad blake so at least his prelude seems to suggest        time the old violplayer       for ever thrills his ancient strings    with the flying bow of fate and thence    much discord but some music brings        his ancient strings are truth       love hate hope fear       and his choicest melody       is the song of the faithful seer  as he progresses however he develops into a kind of inferior clough and writes heavy hexameters upon modern subjects     here for a moment stands in the light at the door of a playhouse    one who is

very poisonous poetry  then he became revolutionary and pantheistic and cried out against those that sit in high places both in heaven and on earth  then he invented marie stuart and laid upon us the heavy burden of bothwell  then he retired to the nursery and wrote poems about children of a somewhat oversubtle character  he is now extremely patriotic and manages to combine with his patriotism a strong affection for the tory party  he has always been a great poet  but he has his limitations the chief of which is curiously enough the entire lack of any sense of limit  his song is nearly always too loud for his subject his magnificent rhetoric nowhere more magnificent than in the volume that now lies before us conceals rather than reveals  it has been said of him and with truth that he is a master of language but with still greater truth it may be said that language is his master  words seem to dominate him  alliteration tyrannises over him  mere sound often becomes his lord  he is so eloquent that whatever he touches becomes unreal  let us turn to the poem on the armada     the wings of the southwest wind are widened the breath of his    fervent lips    more keen than a swords edge fiercer than fire falls full on the    plunging ships    the pilot is he of the northward flight their stay and their    steersman he    a helmsman clothed with the tempest and girdled with strength to    constrain the sea    and the host of them trembles and quails caught fast in his hand as a    bird in the toils    for the wrath and the joy that fulfil him are mightier than mans    whom he slays and spoils    and vainly with heart divided in sunder and labour of wavering will    the lord of their host takes counsel with hope if haply their star    shine still  somehow we seem to have heard all this before  does it come from the fact that of all the poets who ever lived mr swinburne is the one who is the most limited in imagery  it must be admitted that he is so  he has wearied us with his monotony  fire and the sea are the two words ever on his lips  we must confess also that this shrill singingmarvellous as it isleaves us out of breath  here is a passage from a poem called a word with the wind     be the sunshine bared or veiled the sky superb or shrouded       still the waters lax and languid chafed and foiled    keen and thwarted pale and patient clothed with fire or clouded       vex their heart in vain or sleep like serpents coiled    thee they look for blind and baffled wan with wrath and weary       blown for ever back by winds that rock the bird    winds that seamews breast subdue the sea and bid the dreary       waves be weak as hearts made sick with hope deferred    let the clarion sound from westward let the south bear token       how the glories of thy godhead sound and shine    bid the land rejoice to see the landwinds broad wings broken       bid the sea take comfort bid the world be thine  verse of this kind may be justly praised for the sustained strength and vigour of its metrical scheme  its purely technical excellence is extraordinary  but is it more than an oratorical tour de force  does it really convey much  does it charm  could we return to it again and again with renewed pleasure  we think not  it seems to us empty  of course we must not look to these poems for any revelation of human life  to be at one with the elements seems to be mr swinburnes aim  he seeks to speak with the breath of wind and wave  the roar of the fire is ever in his ears  he puts his clarion to the lips of spring and bids her blow and the earth wakes from her dreams and tells him her secret  he is the first lyric poet who has tried to make an absolute surrender of his own personality and he has succeeded  we hear the song but we never know the singer  we never even get near to him  out of the thunder and splendour of words he himself says nothing  we have often had mans interpretation of nature now we have natures interpretation of man and she has curiously little to say  force and freedom form her vague message  she deafens us with her clangours  but mr swinburne is not always riding the whirlwind and calling out of the depths of the sea  romantic ballads in border dialect have not lost their fascination for him and this last volume contains some very splendid examples of this curious artificial kind of poetry  the amount of pleasure one gets out of dialect is a matter entirely of temperament to say mither instead of mother seems to many the acme of romance there are others who are not quite so ready to believe in the pathos of provincialisms  there is however no doubt of mr swinburnes mastery over the form whether the form be quite legitimate or not  the weary wedding has the concentration and colour of a great drama and the quaintness of its style lends it something of the power of a grotesque the ballad of the witchmother a mediaeval medea who slays her children because her lord is faithless is worth reading on account of its horrible simplicity  the brides tragedy with its strange refrain of     in in out and in    blaws the wind and whirls the whin  the jacobites exile     o lordly flow the loire and seine       and loud the dark durance    but bonnier shine the braes of tyne       than a the fields of france    and the waves of till that speak sae still    gleam goodlier where they glance  the tyneside widow and a reivers neckverse are all poems of fine imaginative power and some of them are terrible in their fierce intensity of passion  there is no danger of english poetry narrowing itself to a form so limited as the romantic ballad in dialect  it is of too vital a growth for that  so we may welcome mr swinburnes masterly experiments with the hope that things which are inimitable will not be imitated  the collection is completed by a few poems on children some sonnets a threnody on john william inchbold and a lovely lyric entitled the interpreters     in human thought have all things habitation       our days    laugh lower and lighten past and find no station       that stays    but thought and faith are mightier things than time       can wrong    made splendid once by speech or made sublime       by song    remembrance though the tide of change that rolls       wax hoary    gives earth and heaven for songs sake and the souls       their glory  certainly for songs sake we should love mr swinburnes work cannot indeed help loving it so marvellous a musicmaker is he  but what of the soul  for the soul we must go elsewhere  poems and ballads  third series  by algernon charles swinburne  chatto and windus     three new poets   pall mall gazette july 12 1889  books of poetry by young writers are usually promissory notes that are never met  now and then however one comes across a volume that is so far above the average that one can hardly resist the fascinating temptation of recklessly prophesying a fine future for its author  such a book mr yeatss wanderings of oisin certainly is  here we find nobility of treatment and nobility of subjectmatter delicacy of poetic instinct and richness of imaginative resource  unequal and uneven much of the work must be admitted to be  mr yeats does not try to outbaby wordsworth we are glad to say but he occasionally succeeds in outglittering keats and here and there in his book we come across strange crudities and irritating conceits  but when he is at his best he is very good  if he has not the grand simplicity of epic treatment he has at least something of the largeness of vision that belongs to the epical temper  he does not rob of their stature the great heroes of celtic mythology  he is very naive and very primitive and speaks of his giants with the air of a child  here is a characteristic passage from the account of oisins return from the island of forgetfulness     and i rode by the plains of the seas edge where all is barren and    grey    grey sands on the green of the grasses and over the dripping trees    dripping and doubling landward as though they would hasten away    like an army of old men longing for rest from the moan of the seas     long fled the foamflakes around me the winds fled out of the vast    snatching the bird in secret nor knew i embosomed apart    when they froze the cloth on my body like armour riveted fast    for remembrance lifting her leanness keened in the gates of my    heart     till fattening the winds of the morning an odour of newmown hay    came and my forehead fell low and my tears like berries fell down    later a sound came half lost in the sound of a shore far away    from the great grassbarnacle calling and later the shorewinds    brown     if i were as i once was the gold hooves crushing the sand and the    shells    coming forth from the sea like the morning with red lips murmuring a    song    not coughing my head on my knees and praying and wroth with the    bells    i would leave no saints head on his body though spacious his lands    were and strong     making way from the kindling surges i rode on a bridlepath    much wondering to see upon all hands of wattle and woodwork made    thy bellmounted churches and guardless the sacred cairn and the    earth    and a small and feeble populace stooping with mattock and spade  in one or two places the music is faulty the construction is sometimes too involved and the word populace in the last line is rather infelicitous but when all is said it is impossible not to feel in these stanzas the presence of the true poetic spirit  a young lady who seeks for a song surpassing sense and tries to reproduce mr brownings mode of verse for our edification may seem to be in a somewhat parlous state  but miss caroline fitz geralds work is better than her aim  venetia victrix is in many respects a fine poem  it shows vigour intellectual strength and courage  the story is a strange one  a certain venetian hating one of the ten who had wronged him and identifying his enemy with venice herself abandons his native city and makes a vow that rather than lift a hand for her good he will give his soul to hell  as he is sailing down the adriatic at night his ship is suddenly becalmed and he sees a huge galley        where sate    like counsellors on high exempt elate    the fiends triumphant in their fiery state  on their way to venice  he has to choose between his own ruin and the ruin of his city  after a struggle he determines to sacrifice himself to his rash oath     i climbed aloft  my brain had grown one thought    one hope one purpose  and i heard the hiss    of raging disappointment loth to miss    its preyi heard the lapping of the flame    that through the blenched figures went and came    darting in frenzy to the devils yell    i set that cross on high and cried to hell    my soul for ever and my deed to god    once venice guarded safe let this vile clod    drift where fate will          and then the hideous laugh    of fiends in full possession keen to quaff    the wine of one new soul not weak with tears    pealing like ruinous thunder in mine ears    i fell and heard no more  the pale day broke    through lazarwindows when once more i woke    remembering i might no more dare to pray  venetia victrix is followed by ophelion a curious lyrical play whose dramatis personae consist of night death dawn and a scholar  it is intricate rather than musical but some of the songs are gracefulnotably one beginning     lady of heaven most pure and holy       artemis fleet as the flying deer    glide through the dusk like a silver shadow       mirror thy brow in the lonely mere  miss fitz geralds volume is certainly worth reading  mr richard le galliennes little book volumes in folio as he quaintly calls it is full of dainty verse and delicate fancy  lines such as     and lo the white face of the dawn       yearned like a ghosts against the pane       a sobbing ghost amid the rain    or like a chill and pallid rose    slowly upclimbing from the lawn  strike with their fantastic choice of metaphors a pleasing note  at present mr le galliennes muse seems to devote herself entirely to the worship of books and mr le gallienne himself is steeped in literary traditions making keats his model and seeking to reproduce something of keatss richness and affluence of imagery  he is keenly conscious how derivative his inspiration is     verse of my own why ask so poor a thing       when i might gather from the gardenways    of sunny memory fragrant offering       of deathless blooms and white unwithering sprays     shakspeare had given me an english rose       and honeysuckle spenser sweet as dew    or i had brought you from that dreamy close       keats passionblossom or the mystic blue     starflower of shelleys song or shaken gold       from lilies of the blessed damosel    or stolen fire from out the scarlet fold       of swinburnes poppies     yet now that he has played his prelude with so sensitive and so graceful a touch we have no doubt that he will pass to larger themes and nobler subjectmatter and fulfil the hope he expresses in this sextet     for if perchance some music should be mine       i would fling forth its notes like a fierce sea    to wash away the piles of tyranny       to make love free and faith unbound of creed    o for some power to fill my shrunken line       and make a trumpet of my oaten reed  1 the wanderings of oisin and other poems  by w b yeats  kegan paul  2 venetia victrix  by caroline fitz gerald  macmillan and co  3 volumes in folio  by richard le gallienne  elkin mathews     a chinese sage   speaker february 8 1890  a eminent oxford theologian once remarked that his only objection to modern progress was that it progressed forward instead of backwarda view that so fascinated a certain artistic undergraduate that he promptly wrote an essay upon some unnoticed analogies between the development of ideas and the movements of the common seacrab  i feel sure the speaker will not be suspected even by its most enthusiastic friends of holding this dangerous heresy of retrogression  but i must candidly admit that i have come to the conclusion that the most caustic criticism of modern life i have met with for some time is that contained in the writings of the learned chuang tzu recently translated into the vulgar tongue by mr herbert giles her majestys consul at tamsui  the spread of popular education has no doubt made the name of this great thinker quite familiar to the general public but for the sake of the few and the overcultured i feel it my duty to state definitely who he was and to give a brief outline of the character of his philosophy  chuang tzu whose name must carefully be pronounced as it is not written was born in the fourth century before christ by the banks of the yellow river in the flowery land and portraits of the wonderful sage seated on the flying dragon of contemplation may still be found on the simple tea trays and pleasing screens of many of our most respectable suburban households  the honest ratepayer and his healthy family have no doubt often mocked at the domelike forehead of the philosopher and laughed over the strange perspective of the landscape that lies beneath him  if they really knew who he was they would tremble  for chuang tzu spent his life in preaching the great creed of inaction and in pointing out the uselessness of all useful things  do nothing and everything will be done was the doctrine which he inherited from his great master lao tzu  to resolve action into thought and thought into abstraction was his wicked transcendental aim  like the obscure philosopher of early greek speculation he believed in the identity of contraries like plato he was an idealist and had all the idealists contempt for utilitarian systems he was a mystic like dionysius and scotus erigena and jacob bohme and held with them and with philo that the object of life was to get rid of selfconsciousness and to become the unconscious vehicle of a higher illumination  in fact chuang tzu may be said to have summed up in himself almost every mood of european metaphysical or mystical thought from heraclitus down to hegel  there was something in him of the quietist also and in his worship of nothing he may be said to have in some measure anticipated those strange dreamers of mediaeval days who like tauler and master eckhart adored the purum nihil and the abyss  the great middle classes of this country to whom as we all know our prosperity if not our civilisation is entirely due may shrug their shoulders over all this and ask with a certain amount of reason what is the identity of contraries to them and why they should get rid of that selfconsciousness which is their chief characteristic  but chuang tzu was something more than a metaphysician and an illuminist  he sought to destroy society as we know it as the middle classes know it and the sad thing is that he combines with the passionate eloquence of a rousseau the scientific reasoning of a herbert spencer  there is nothing of the sentimentalist in him  he pities the rich more than the poor if he ever pities at all and prosperity seems to him as tragic a thing as suffering  he has nothing of the modern sympathy with failures nor does he propose that the prizes should always be given on moral grounds to those who come in last in the race  it is the race itself that he objects to and as for active sympathy which has become the profession of so many worthy people in our own day he thinks that trying to make others good is as silly an occupation as beating a drum in a forest in order to find a fugitive  it is a mere waste of energy  that is all while as for a thoroughly sympathetic man he is in the eyes of chuang tzu simply a man who is always trying to be somebody else and so misses the only possible excuse for his own existence  yes incredible as it may seem this curious thinker looked back with a sigh of regret to a certain golden age when there were no competitive examinations no wearisome educational systems no missionaries no penny dinners for the people no established churches no humanitarian societies no dull lectures about ones duty to ones neighbour and no tedious sermons about any subject at all  in those ideal days he tells us people loved each other without being conscious of charity or writing to the newspapers about it  they were upright and yet they never published books upon altruism  as every man kept his knowledge to himself the world escaped the curse of scepticism and as every man kept his virtues to himself nobody meddled in other peoples business  they lived simple and peaceful lives and were contented with such food and raiment as they could get  neighbouring districts were in sight and the cocks and dogs of one could be heard in the other yet the people grew old and died without ever interchanging visits  there was no chattering about clever men and no laudation of good men  the intolerable sense of obligation was unknown  the deeds of humanity left no trace and their affairs were not made a burden for posterity by foolish historians  in an evil moment the philanthropist made his appearance and brought with him the mischievous idea of government  there is such a thing says chuang tzu as leaving mankind alone there has never been such a thing as governing mankind  all modes of government are wrong  they are unscientific because they seek to alter the natural environment of man they are immoral because by interfering with the individual they produce the most aggressive forms of egotism they are ignorant because they try to spread education they are selfdestructive because they engender anarchy  of old he tells us the yellow emperor first caused charity and duty to ones neighbour to interfere with the natural goodness of the heart of man  in consequence of this yao and shun wore the hair off their legs in endeavouring to feed their people  they disturbed their internal economy in order to find room for artificial virtues  they exhausted their energies in framing laws and they were failures  mans heart our philosopher goes on to say may be forced down or stirred up and in either case the issue is fatal  yao made the people too happy so they were not satisfied  chieh made them too wretched so they grew discontented  then every one began to argue about the best way of tinkering up society  it is quite clear that something must be done they said to each other and there was a general rush for knowledge  the results were so dreadful that the government of the day had to bring in coercion and as a consequence of this virtuous men sought refuge in mountain caves while rulers of state sat trembling in ancestral halls  then when everything was in a state of perfect chaos the social reformers got up on platforms and preached salvation from the ills that they and their system had caused  the poor social reformers they know not shame nor what it is to blush is the verdict of chuang tzuu upon them  the economic question also is discussed by this almondeyed sage at great length and he writes about the curse of capital as eloquently as mr hyndman  the accumulation of wealth is to him the origin of evil  it makes the strong violent and the weak dishonest  it creates the petty thief and puts him in a bamboo cage  it creates the big thief and sets him on a throne of white jade  it is the father of competition and competition is the waste as well as the destruction of energy  the order of nature is rest repetition and peace  weariness and war are the results of an artificial society based upon capital and the richer this society gets the more thoroughly bankrupt it really is for it has neither sufficient rewards for the good nor sufficient punishments for the wicked  there is also this to be rememberedthat the prizes of the world degrade a man as much as the worlds punishments  the age is rotten with its worship of success  as for education true wisdom can neither be learnt nor taught  it is a spiritual state to which he who lives in harmony with nature attains  knowledge is shallow if we compare it with the extent of the unknown and only the unknowable is of value society produces rogues and education makes one rogue cleverer than another  that is the only result of school boards  besides of what possible philosophic importance can education be when it serves simply to make each man differ from his neighbour  we arrive ultimately at a chaos of opinions doubt everything and fall into the vulgar habit of arguing and it is only the intellectually lost who ever argue  look at hui tzu  he was a man of many ideas  his works would fill five carts but his doctrines were paradoxical  he said that there were feathers in an egg because there were feathers on a chicken that a dog could be a sheep because all names were arbitrary that there was a moment when a swiftlyflying arrow was neither moving nor at rest that if you took a stick a foot long and cut it in half every day you would never come to the end of it and that a bay horse and a dun cow were three because taken separately they were two and taken together they were one and one and two made up three  he was like a man running a race with his own shadow and making a noise in order to drown the echo  he was a clever gadfly that was all  what was the use of him  morality is of course a different thing  it went out of fashion says chuang tzu when people began to moralise  men ceased then to be spontaneous and to act on intuition  they became priggish and artificial and were so blind as to have a definite purpose in life  then came governments and philanthropists those two pests of the age  the former tried to coerce people into being good and so destroyed the natural goodness of man  the latter were a set of aggressive busybodies who caused confusion wherever they went  they were stupid enough to have principles and unfortunate enough to act up to them  they all came to bad ends and showed that universal altruism is as bad in its results as universal egotism  they tripped people up over charity and fettered them with duties to their neighbours  they gushed over music and fussed over ceremonies  as a consequence of all this the world lost its equilibrium and has been staggering ever since  who then according to chuang tzu is the perfect man  and what is his manner of life  the perfect man does nothing beyond gazing at the universe  he adopts no absolute position  in motion he is like water at rest he is like a mirror  and like echo he answers only when he is called upon  he lets externals take care of themselves  nothing material injures him nothing spiritual punishes him  his mental equilibrium gives him the empire of the world  he is never the slave of objective existences  he knows that just as the best language is that which is never spoken so the best action is that which is never done he is passive and accepts the laws of life  he rests in inactivity and sees the world become virtuous of itself  he does not try to bring about his own good deeds  he never wastes himself on effort  he is not troubled about moral distinctions  he knows that things are what they are and that their consequences will be what they will be  his mind is the speculum of creation and he is ever at peace  all this is of course excessively dangerous but we must remember that chuang tzu lived more than two thousand years ago and never had the opportunity of seeing our unrivalled civilisation  and yet it is possible that were he to come back to earth and visit us he might have something to say to mr balfour about his coercion and active misgovernment in ireland he might smile at some of our philanthropic ardours and shake his head over many of our organised charities the school board might not impress him nor our race for wealth stir his admiration he might wonder at our ideals and grow sad over what we have realised  perhaps it is well that chuang tzu cannot return  meanwhile thanks to mr giles and mr quaritch we have his book to console us and certainly it is a most fascinating and delightful volume chuang tzu is one of the darwinians before darwin  he traces man from the germ and sees his unity with nature  as an anthropologist he is excessively interesting and he describes our primitive arboreal ancestor living in trees through his terror of animals stronger than himself and knowing only one parent the mother with all the accuracy of a lecturer at the royal society  like plato he adopts the dialogue as his mode of expression putting words into other peoples mouths he tells us in order to gain breadth of view  as a storyteller he is charming  the account of the visit of the respectable confucius to the great robber che is most vivid and brilliant and it is impossible not to laugh over the ultimate discomfiture of the sage the barrenness of whose moral platitudes is ruthlessly exposed by the successful brigand  even in his metaphysics chuang tzu is intensely humorous  he personifies his abstractions and makes them act plays before us  the spirit of the clouds when passing eastward through the expanse of air happened to fall in with the vital principle  the latter was slapping his ribs and hopping about whereupon the spirit of the clouds said who are you old man and what are you doing  strolling replied the vital principle without stopping for all activities are ceaseless  i want to know something continued the spirit of the clouds  ah cried the vital principle in a tone of disapprobation and a marvellous conversation follows that is not unlike the dialogue between the sphinx and the chimera in flauberts curious drama  talking animals also have their place in chuang tzus parables and stories and through myth and poetry and fancy his strange philosophy finds musical utterance  of course it is sad to be told that it is immoral to be consciously good and that doing anything is the worst form of idleness  thousands of excellent and really earnest philanthropists would be absolutely thrown upon the rates if we adopted the view that nobody should be allowed to meddle in what does not concern him  the doctrine of the uselessness of all useful things would not merely endanger our commercial supremacy as a nation but might bring discredit upon many prosperous and seriousminded members of the shopkeeping classes  what would become of our popular preachers our exeter hall orators our drawingroom evangelists if we said to them in the words of chuang tzu mosquitoes will keep a man awake all night with their biting and just in the same way this talk of charity and duty to ones neighbour drives us nearly crazy  sirs strive to keep the world to its own original simplicity and as the wind bloweth where it listeth so let virtue establish itself  wherefore this undue energy  and what would be the fate of governments and professional politicians if we came to the conclusion that there is no such thing as governing mankind at all  it is clear that chuang tzu is a very dangerous writer and the publication of his book in english two thousand years after his death is obviously premature and may cause a great deal of pain to many thoroughly respectable and industrious persons  it may be true that the ideal of selfculture and selfdevelopment which is the aim of his scheme of life and the basis of his scheme of philosophy is an ideal somewhat needed by an age like ours in which most people are so anxious to educate their neighbours that they have actually no time left in which to educate themselves  but would it be wise to say so  it seems to me that if we once admitted the force of any one of chuang tzus destructive criticisms we should have to put some check on our national habit of selfglorification and the only thing that ever consoles man for the stupid things he does is the praise he always gives himself for doing them  there may however be a few who have grown wearied of that strange modern tendency that sets enthusiasm to do the work of the intellect  to these and such as these chuang tzu will be welcome  but let them only read him  let them not talk about him  he would be disturbing at dinnerparties and impossible at afternoon teas and his whole life was a protest against platform speaking  the perfect man ignores self the divine man ignores action the true sage ignores reputation  these are the principles of chuang tzu  chuang tzu mystic moralist and social reformer  translated from the chinese by herbert a giles hbms consul at tamsui  bernard quaritch     mr paters last volume   speaker march 22 1890  when i first had the privilegeand i count it a very high oneof meeting mr walter pater he said to me smiling why do you always write poetry  why do you not write prose  prose is so much more difficult  it was during my undergraduate days at oxford days of lyrical ardour and of studious sonnetwriting days when one loved the exquisite intricacy and musical repetitions of the ballade and the villanelle with its linked longdrawn echoes and its curious completeness days when one solemnly sought to discover the proper temper in which a triolet should be written delightful days in which i am glad to say there was far more rhyme than reason  i may frankly confess now that at the time i did not quite comprehend what mr pater really meant and it was not till i had carefully studied his beautiful and suggestive essays on the renaissance that i fully realised what a wonderful selfconscious art the art of english prose writing really is or may be made to be  carlyles stormy rhetoric ruskins winged and passionate eloquence had seemed to me to spring from enthusiasm rather than from art  i do not think i knew then that even prophets correct their proofs  as for jacobean prose i thought it too exuberant and queen anne prose appeared to me terribly bald and irritatingly rational  but mr paters essays became to me the golden book of spirit and sense the holy writ of beauty  they are still this to me  it is possible of course that i may exaggerate about them  i certainly hope that i do for where there is no exaggeration there is no love and where there is no love there is no understanding  it is only about things that do not interest one that one can give a really unbiassed opinion and this is no doubt the reason why an unbiassed opinion is always valueless  but i must not allow this brief notice of mr paters new volume to degenerate into an autobiography  i remember being told in america that whenever margaret fuller wrote an essay upon emerson the printers had always to send out to borrow some additional capital is and i feel it right to accept this transatlantic warning  appreciations in the fine latin sense of the word is the title given by mr pater to his book which is an exquisite collection of exquisite essays of delicately wrought works of artsome of them being almost greek in their purity of outline and perfection of form others mediaeval in their strangeness of colour and passionate suggestion and all of them absolutely modern in the true meaning of the term modernity  for he to whom the present is the only thing that is present knows nothing of the age in which he lives  to realise the nineteenth century one must realise every century that has preceded it and that has contributed to its making  to know anything about oneself one must know all about others  there must be no mood with which one cannot sympathise no dead mode of life that one cannot make alive  the legacies of heredity may make us alter our views of moral responsibility but they cannot but intensify our sense of the value of criticism for the true critic is he who bears within himself the dreams and ideas and feelings of myriad generations and to whom no form of thought is alien no emotional impulse obscure  perhaps the most interesting and certainly the least successful of the essays contained in the present volume is that on style  it is the most interesting because it is the work of one who speaks with the high authority that comes from the noble realisation of things nobly conceived  it is the least successful because the subject is too abstract  a true artist like mr pater is most felicitous when he deals with the concrete whose very limitations give him finer freedom while they necessitate more intense vision  and yet what a high ideal is contained in these few pages  how good it is for us in these days of popular education and facile journalism to be reminded of the real scholarship that is essential to the perfect writer who being a true lover of words for their own sake a minute and constant observer of their physiognomy will avoid what is mere rhetoric or ostentatious ornament or negligent misuse of terms or ineffective surplusage and will be known by his tact of omission by his skilful economy of means by his selection and selfrestraint and perhaps above all by that conscious artistic structure which is the expression of mind in style  i think i have been wrong in saying that the subject is too abstract  in mr paters hands it becomes very real to us indeed and he shows us how behind the perfection of a mans style must lie the passion of a mans soul  as one passes to the rest of the volume one finds essays on wordsworth and on coleridge on charles lamb and on sir thomas browne on some of shakespeares plays and on the english kings that shakespeare fashioned on dante rossetti and on william morris  as that on wordsworth seems to be mr paters last work so that on the singer of the defence of guenevere is certainly his earliest or almost his earliest and it is interesting to mark the change that has taken place in his style  this change is perhaps at first sight not very apparent  in 1868 we find mr pater writing with the same exquisite care for words with the same studied music with the same temper and something of the same mode of treatment  but as he goes on the architecture of the style becomes richer and more complex the epithet more precise and intellectual occasionally one may be inclined to think that there is here and there a sentence which is somewhat long and possibly if one may venture to say so a little heavy and cumbersome in movement  but if this be so it comes from those sideissues suddenly suggested by the idea in its progress and really revealing the idea more perfectly or from those felicitous afterthoughts that give a fuller completeness to the central scheme and yet convey something of the charm of chance or from a desire to suggest the secondary shades of meaning with all their accumulating effect and to avoid it may be the violence and harshness of too definite and exclusive an opinion  for in matters of art at any rate thought is inevitably coloured by emotion and so is fluid rather than fixed and recognising its dependence upon moods and upon the passion of fine moments will not accept the rigidity of a scientific formula or a theological dogma  the critical pleasure too that we receive from tracing through what may seem the intricacies of a sentence the working of the constructive intelligence must not be overlooked  as soon as we have realised the design everything appears clear and simple  after a time these long sentences of mr paters come to have the charm of an elaborate piece of music and the unity of such music also  i have suggested that the essay on wordsworth is probably the most recent bit of work contained in this volume  if one might choose between so much that is good i should be inclined to say it is the finest also  the essay on lamb is curiously suggestive suggestive indeed of a somewhat more tragic more sombre figure than men have been wont to think of in connection with the author of the essays of elia  it is an interesting aspect under which to regard lamb but perhaps he himself would have had some difficulty in recognising the portrait given of him  he had undoubtedly great sorrows or motives for sorrow but he could console himself at a moments notice for the real tragedies of life by reading any one of the elizabethan tragedies provided it was in a folio edition the essay on sir thomas browne is delightful and has the strange personal fanciful charm of the author of the religio medici mr pater often catching the colour and accent and tone of whatever artist or work of art he deals with  that on coleridge with its insistence on the necessity of the cultivation of the relative as opposed to the absolute spirit in philosophy and in ethics and its high appreciation of the poets true position in our literature is in style and substance a very blameless work  grace of expression and delicate subtlety of thought and phrase characterise the essays on shakespeare  but the essay on wordsworth has a spiritual beauty of its own  it appeals not to the ordinary wordsworthian with his uncritical temper and his gross confusion of ethical and aesthetical problems but rather to those who desire to separate the gold from the dross and to reach at the true wordsworth through the mass of tedious and prosaic work that bears his name and that serves often to conceal him from us  the presence of an alien element in wordsworths art is of course recognised by mr pater but he touches on it merely from the psychological point of view pointing out how this quality of higher and lower moods gives the effect in his poetry of a power not altogether his own or under his control a power which comes and goes when it wills so that the old fancy which made the poets art an enthusiasm a form of divine possession seems almost true of him  mr paters earlier essays had their purpurei panni so eminently suitable for quotation such as the famous passage on mona lisa and that other in which botticellis strange conception of the virgin is so strangely set forth  from the present volume it is difficult to select any one passage in preference to another as specially characteristic of mr paters treatment  this however is worth quoting at length  it contains a truth eminently suitable for our age     that the end of life is not action but contemplationbeing as    distinct from doinga certain disposition of the mind is in some    shape or other the principle of all the higher morality  in poetry    in art if you enter into their true spirit at all you touch this    principle in a measure these by their sterility are a type of    beholding for the mere joy of beholding  to treat life in the spirit    of art is to make life a thing in which means and ends are identified    to encourage such treatment the true moral significance of art and    poetry  wordsworth and other poets who have been like him in ancient    or more recent times are the masters the experts in this art of    impassioned contemplation  their work is not to teach lessons or    enforce rules or even to stimulate us to noble ends but to withdraw    the thoughts for a while from the mere machinery of life to fix them    with appropriate emotions on the spectacle of those great facts in    mans existence which no machinery affects on the great and    universal passions of men the most general and interesting of their    occupations and the entire world of natureon the operations of    the elements and the appearances of the visible universe on storm and    sunshine on the revolutions of the seasons on cold and heat on loss    of friends and kindred on injuries and resentments on gratitude and    hope on fear and sorrow  to witness this spectacle with appropriate    emotions is the aim of all culture and of these emotions poetry like    wordsworths is a great nourisher and stimulant  he sees nature full    of sentiment and excitement he sees men and women as parts of nature    passionate excited in strange grouping and connection with the    grandeur and beauty of the natural worldimages in his own words    of men suffering amid awful forms and powers  certainly the real secret of wordsworth has never been better expressed after having read and reread mr paters essayfor it requires rereadingone returns to the poets work with a new sense of joy and wonder and with something of eager and impassioned expectation  and perhaps this might be roughly taken as the test or touchstone of the finest criticism  finally one cannot help noticing the delicate instinct that has gone to fashion the brief epilogue that ends this delightful volume  the difference between the classical and romantic spirits in art has often and with much overemphasis been discussed  but with what a light sure touch does mr pater write of it  how subtle and certain are his distinctions  if imaginative prose be really the special art of this century mr pater must rank amongst our centurys most characteristic artists  in certain things he stands almost alone  the age has produced wonderful prose styles turbid with individualism and violent with excess of rhetoric  but in mr pater as in cardinal newman we find the union of personality with perfection  he has no rival in his own sphere and he has escaped disciples  and this not because he has not been imitated but because in art so fine as his there is something that in its essence is inimitable  appreciations with an essay on style  by walter pater fellow of brasenose college  macmillan and co     primavera   pall mall gazette may 24 1890  in the summer term oxford teaches the exquisite art of idleness one of the most important things that any university can teach and possibly as the firstfruits of the dreaming in grey cloister and silent garden which either makes or mars a man there has just appeared in that lovely city a dainty and delightful volume of poems by four friends  these new young singers are mr laurence binyon who has just gained the newdigate mr manmohan ghose a young indian of brilliant scholarship and high literary attainments who gives some culture to christ church mr stephen phillips whose recent performance of the ghost in hamlet at the globe theatre was so admirable in its dignity and elocution and mr arthur cripps of trinity  particular interest attaches naturally to mr ghoses work  born in india of purely indian parentage he has been brought up entirely in england and was educated at st pauls school and his verses show us how quick and subtle are the intellectual sympathies of the oriental mind and suggest how close is the bond of union that may some day bind india to us by other methods than those of commerce and military strength  there is something charming in finding a young indian using our language with such care for music and words as mr ghose does  here is one of his songs     over thy head in joyful wanderings       through heavens wide spaces free    birds fly with music in their wings       and from the blue rough sea       the fishes flash and leap    there is a life of loveliest things       oer thee so fast asleep     in the deep west the heavens grow heavenlier       eve after eve and still    the glorious stars remember to appear       the roses on the hill       are fragrant as before    only thy face of all thats dear       i shall see nevermore  it has its faults  it has a great many faults  but the lines we have set in italics are lovely  the temper of keats the moods of matthew arnold have influenced mr ghose and what better influence could a beginner have  here are some stanzas from another of mr ghoses poems     deepshaded will i lie and deeper yet       in night where not a leaf its neighbour knows    forget the shining of the stars forget       the vernal visitation of the rose    and far from all delights prepare my hearts repose     o crave not silence thou too soon too sure       shall autumn come and through these branches weep    some birds shall cease and flowers no more endure       and thou beneath the mould unwilling creep    and silent soon shalt be in that eternal sleep     green still it is where that fair goddess strays       then follow till around thee all be sere    lose not a vision of her passing face       nor miss the sound of her soft robes that here    sweep over the wet leaves of the fastfalling year  the second line is very beautiful and the whole shows culture and taste and feeling  mr ghose ought some day to make a name in our literature  mr stephen phillips has a more solemn classical muse  his best work is his orestes     me in far lands did justice call cold queen    among the dead who after heat and haste    at length have leisure for her steadfast voice    that gathers peace from the great deeps of hell    she calld me saying i heard a cry by night    go thou and question not within thy halls    my will awaits fulfilment                  and she lies there    my mother ay my mother now o hair    that once i playd with in these halls  o eyes    that for a moment knew me as i came    and lightend up and trembled into love    the next were darkened by my hand  ah me    ye will not look upon me in that world    yet thou perchance art happier if thou gost    into some land of wind and drifting leaves    to sleep without a star but as for me    hell hungers and the restless furies wait  milton and the method of greek tragedy are mr phillipss influences and again we may say what better influences could a young singer have his verse is dignified and has distinction        mr cripps is melodious at times and mr binyon oxfords latest laureate shows us in his lyrical ode on youth that he can handle a difficult metre dexterously and in this sonnet that he can catch the sweet echoes that sleep in the sonnets of shakespeare     i cannot raise my eyelids up from sleep    but i am visited with thoughts of you    slumber has no refreshment half so deep    as the sweet morn that wakes my heart anew     i cannot put away lifes trivial care    but you straightway steal on me with delight    my purest moments are your mirror fair    my deepest thought finds you the truth most bright     you are the lovely regent of my mind    the constant sky to the unresting sea    yet since tis you that rule me i but find    a finer
