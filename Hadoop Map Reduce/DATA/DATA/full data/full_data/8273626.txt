afternoon  mrs elizabeth spender sits near the fire reading a book  she is a tall thin woman with passionate eyes set in an oval face of olive complexion the features are regular and severe her massive dark hair is almost primly arranged  she wears a tailormade costume surmounted by a plain black hat  the door opens and phoebe enters shown in by hake the butler a thin ascetic looking man of about thirty with prematurely grey hair  phoebe mogton is of the fluffy ruffles type petite with a retrousse nose remarkably bright eyes and a quantity of fluffy light hair somewhat untidily arranged  she is fashionably dressed in the fussy flyaway style  elizabeth looks up the two young women shake hands  phoebe  good woman  tisnt three oclock yet is it  elizabeth  about five minutes to  phoebe  annys is on her way  i just caught her in time  to hake  put a table and six chairs  give mamma a hammer and a cushion at her back  hake  a hammer miss  phoebe  a chairmans hammer  havent you got one  hake  im afraid not miss  would a gravy spoon do  phoebe to elizabeth after expression of disgust  fancy a house without a chairmans hammer  to hake  see that theres something  did your wife go to the meeting last night  hake he is arranging furniture according to instructions  im not quite sure miss  i gave her the evening out  phoebe  gave her the evening out  elizabeth  we are speaking of your wife man not your servant  hake  yes miss  you see we dont keep servants in our class somebodys got to put the children to bed  elizabeth  why not the manoccasionally  hake  well you see miss in my case i rarely getting home much before midnight it would make it so late  yesterday being my night off things fitted in so to speak  will there be any writing miss  phoebe  yes  see that theres plenty of blottingpaper  to elizabeth  mamma always splashes so  hake  yes miss  he goes out  elizabeth  did you ever hear anything more delightfully naive  he gave her the evening out  thats how they think of usas their servants  the gentleman hasnt the courage to be straightforward about it  the butler blurts out the truth  why are we meeting here instead of at our own place  phoebe  for secrecy i expect  too many gasbags always about the office  i fancyim not quite surethat mammas got a new idea  elizabeth  leading to holloway  phoebe  well most roads lead there  elizabeth  and end thereso far as i can see  phoebe  youre too impatient  elizabeth  its what our friends have been telling usfor the last fifty years  phoebe  look here if it was only the usual sort of thing mamma wouldnt want it kept secret  im inclined to think its a new departure altogether  the door opens  there enters janet blake followed by hake who proceeds with his work  janet blake is a slight fragilelooking creature her great dark eyesthe eyes of a fanaticemphasise the pallor of her childish face  she is shabbily dressed a plain uninteresting girl until she smiles and then her face becomes quite beautiful  phoebe darts to meet her  good girl  was afraidi say youre wet through  janet  it was only a shower  the buses were all full  i had to ride outside  phoebe  silly kid why didnt you take a cab  janet  ive been reckoning it up  ive been half over london chasing mrs mountcalmvilliers  cabs would have come at the very least to twelveandsix  phoebe  well   janet  to elizabeth  welli want you to put me down as a contributor for twelveandsix  she smiles  its the only way i can give  phoebe  she is taking off janets cloak throws it to hake  have this put somewhere to dry  she pushes janet to the fire  get near the fire  youre as cold as ice  elizabeth  all the seats inside i suppose occupied by the chivalrous sex  janet  oh there was one young fellow offered to give me up his place but i wouldnt let him  you see were claiming equality smiles  elizabeth  and are being granted itin every direction where it works to the convenience of man  phoebe  laughs  is she comingthe villiers woman  janet  yes  i ran her down at lastat her dressmakers  she made an awful fuss about it but i wouldnt leave till shed promised  tell me its something quite important isnt it  phoebe  i dont know anything except that i had an urgent telegram from mamma this morning to call a meeting of the entire council here at three oclock  shes coming up from manchester on purpose to hake  mrs chilvers hasnt returned yet has she  hake  not yet miss  shall i telephone   phoebe  shakes her head  no its all right  i have seen her let her know we are here the moment she comes in  hake  yes miss  he has finished the arrangements  the table has been placed in the centre of the room six chairs round it one of them being a large armchair  he has placed writing materials and a large silver gravy spoon  he is going  phoebe  why arent you sure your wife wasnt at the meeting last night  didnt she say anything  hake  well miss unfortunately just as she was starting mrs comerfordthats the wife of the party that keeps the shop downstairslooked in with an order for the theatre  phoebe  oh  hake  so i thought it best to ask no questions  phoebe  thank you  hake  thank you miss  he goes out  elizabeth  can nothing be done to rouse the workingclass woman out of her apathy  phoebe  well if you ask me i think a good deal has been done  elizabeth  oh whats the use of our deceiving ourselves  the great mass are utterly indifferent  janet  she is seated in an easychair near the fire  i was talking to a woman only yesterdayin bethnal green  she keeps a husband and three children by taking in washing  lord miss she laughed what would we do with the vote if we did have it  only one thing more to give to the men  phoebe  thats rather good  elizabeth  the curse of it is that its true  why should they put themselves out merely that one man instead of another should dictate their laws to them  phoebe  my dear girl precisely the same argument was used against the second reform bill  what earthly difference could it make to the working men whether tory squire or liberal capitalist ruled over them  that was in 1868  today fiftyfour labour members sit in parliament  at the next election they will hold the balance  elizabeth  ah if we could only hold out that sort of hope to them  annys enters  she is in outdoor costume  she kisses phoebe shakes hands with the other two  annyss age is about twentyfive she is a beautiful spirituallooking creature tall and graceful with a manner that is at the same time appealing and commanding her voice is soft and caressing but capable of expressing all the emotions  her likeness to her younger sister phoebe is of the slightest  the colouring is the same and the eyes that can flash but there the similarity ends  she is simply but well dressed her soft hair makes a quiet but wonderfully effective frame to her face  annys  she is taking off her outdoor things  hope im not late i had to look in at caxton house  why are we holding it here  phoebe  mammas instructions  cant tell you anything more except that i gather the matters important and is to be kept secret  annys  mamma isnt here is she  phoebe  shakes her head  reaches st pancras at twoforty looks at her watch  trains late i expect  hake has entered  annys  she hands hake her hat and coat  have something ready in case lady mogton hasnt lunched  is your master in  hake  a messenger came for him soon after you left maam  i was to tell you he would most likely be dining at the house  annys  thank you  hake goes out  annys  to elizabeth  i so want you to meet geoffrey  hell alter your opinion of men  elizabeth  my opinion of men has been altered once or twiceeach time for the worse  annys  why do you dislike men  elizabeth  with a short laugh  why does the slave dislike the slaveowner  phoebe  oh come off the perch  you spend five thousand a year provided for you by a husband that you only see on sundays  wed all be slaves at that price  elizabeth  the chains have always been stretched for the few  my sympathies are with my class  annys  but men like geoffreymen who are devoting their whole time and energy to furthering our cause what can you have to say against them  elizabeth  simply that they dont know what theyre doing  the french revolution was nursed in the salons of the french nobility when the true meaning of the womans movement is understood we shall have to get on without the male sympathiser  a pause  annys  what do you understand is the true meaning of the womans movement  elizabeth  the dragging down of man from his position of supremacy what else can it mean  annys  something much better  the lifting up of woman to be his partner  elizabeth  my dear annys the men who today are advocating votes for women are doing so in the hope of securing obedient supporters for their own political schemes  in new zealand the working man brings his female relations in a van to the poll and sees to it that they vote in accordance with his orders  when man once grasps the fact that woman is not going to be his henchman but his rival men and women will face one another as enemies  the door opens  hake announces lady mogton and dorian st herbert  lady mogton is a large strongfeatured woman with a naturally loud voice  she is dressed with studied carelessness dorian st herbert kc is a tall thin man about thirty  he is elegantly almost dandily dressed  annys  kissing her mother  have you had lunch  lady mogton  in the train  phoebe  who has also kissed her mother and shaken hands with st herbert  we are all here except villiers  shes coming  did you have a good meeting  lady mogton  fairly  some young fool had chained himself to a pillar and thrown the key out of window  phoebe  what did you do  lady mogton  tied a sack over his head and left him there  she turns aside for a moment to talk to st herbert who has taken some papers from his despatchbox  annys  to elizabeth  we must finish out our talk some other time  you are quite wrong  elizabeth  perhaps  lady mogton  we had better begin  i have only got half an hour  janet  i saw mrs villiers  she promised shed come  lady mogton  you should have told her we were going to be photographed  then shed have been punctual  she has taken her seat at the table  st herbert at her right  better put another chair in case she does turn up  janet  does so  shall i take any notes  lady mogton  no  to annys  give instructions that we are not to be interrupted for anything  annys rings bell  st herbert  he turns to phoebe on his right  have you heard the latest  there was an old man of hong kong whose language was terribly strong  enter hake  he brings a bottle and glass which he places  annys  oh hake please dont let us be interrupted for anything if mrs mountcalmvilliers comes show her up  but nobody else  hake  yes maam  st herbert  continuing  it wasnt the words that frightened the birds twas the orrible doubleentendre  lady mogton  who has sat waiting in grim silence  have you finished  st herbert  quite finished  lady mogton  thank you  she raps for silence  you will understand please all that this is a private meeting of the council  nothing that transpires is to be allowed to leak out there is a murmur  silence please for mr st herbert  st herbert  before we begin i should like to remind you ladies that you are all of you persons mentally deficient   the door opens  mrs mountcalmvilliers enters announced by hake  she is a showilydressed flamboyant lady  hake goes out  mrs mountcalmvilliers  i am so sorry  i have only just this minuteshe catches sight of st herbert  you naughty creature why werent you at my meeting last night  the rajah came with both his wives  weve elected them all three honorary members  lady mogton  do you mind sitting down  mrs mountcalmvilliers  here dear  she takes the vacant chair so nice of you  i read about your meeting  what a clever idea  lady mogton  cuts her short  yes  we are here to consider a very important matter  by way of commencement mr st herbert has just reminded us that in the eye of the law all women are imbeciles  mrs mountcalmvilliers  i know dear  isnt it shocking  st herbert  deplorable but of course not your fault  i mention it because of its importance to the present matter  under clause a of the act for the better regulation c c all persons mentally deficient are debarred from becoming members of parliament  the classification has been held to include idiots infants and women  an interruption  lady mogton hammers  bearing this carefully in mind we proceed  he refers to his notes  two years ago a byeelection took place for the southwest division of belfast  mrs mountcalmvilliers  my dear may i  it has just occurred to me  why do we never go to ireland  lady mogton  for various sufficient reasons  mrs mountcalmvilliers  so many of the irish members have expressed themselves quite sympathetically  lady mogton  we wish them to continue to do so  turns to st herbert  im sorry  st herbert  a leader of the orange party was opposed by a nationalist and the proceedings promised to be lively  they promised for a while to be still livelier owing to the nomination at the last moment of the local lunatic  phoebe  to annys  this is where we come in  st herbert  there is always a local lunatic who if harmless is generally a popular character  james washington mccaw appears to have been a particularly cheerful specimen  one of his eccentricities was to always have a skippingrope in his pocket wherever the traffic allowed it he would go through the streets skipping  he said it kept him warm  another of his tricks was to let off fireworks from the roof of his house whenever he heard of the death of anybody of importance  the returning officer refused his nominationwhich so far as his nominators were concerned was intended only as a jokeon the grounds of his being by common report a person of unsound mind  and there so far as southwest belfast was concerned the matter ended  phoebe  pity  st herbert  but not so far as the returning officer was concerned mccaw appears to have been a lunatic possessed of means imbued with all an irishmans love of litigation  he at once brought an action against the returning officer his contention being that his mental state was a private matter of which the returning officer was not the person to judge  phoebe  he wasnt a lunatic all over  st herbert  we none of us are  the case went from court to court in every instance the decision was in favour of the returning officer  until it reached the house of lords  the decision was given yesterday afternoonin favour of the man mccaw  elizabeth  then lunatics at all events are not debarred from going to the poll  st herbert  the mentally deficient are no longer debarred from going to the poll  elizabeth  what grounds were given for the decision  st herbert  he refers again to his notes  a returning officer can only deal with objections arising out of the nomination paper he has no jurisdiction to go behind a nomination paper and constitute himself a court of inquiry as to the fitness or unfitness of a candidate  phoebe  good old house of lords  lady mogton hammers  elizabeth  but i thought it was part of the returning officers duty to inquire into objections that a special time was appointed to deal with them  st  herbert  he will still be required to take cognisance of any informality in the nomination paper or papers  beyond that this decision relieves him of all further responsibility  janet  but this gives us everything  st herbert  it depends upon what you call everything  it gives a woman the right to go to the polla right which as a matter of fact she has always possessed  phoebe  then why did the returning officer for camberwell in 1885   st herbert  because he did not know the law  and miss helen taylor had not the means possessed by our friend mccaw to teach it to him  annys  rises  she goes to the centre of the room  lady mogton  where are you going  annys  she turns there are tears in her eyes  the question seems to recall her to herself  nowhere  i am so sorry  i cant help it  it seems to me to mean so much  it gives us the right to go before the peopleto plead to them not for ourselves for them again she seems to lose consciousness of those at the table of the room  to the men we will say  will you not trust us  is it harm we have ever done you  have we not suffered for you and with you  were we not sent into the world to be your helpmeet  are not the children ours as well as yours  shall we not work together to shape the world where they must dwell  is it only the mothervoice that shall not be heard in your councils  is it only the mother hand that shall not help to guide  to the women we will say tell themtell them it is from no love of ourselves that we come from our sheltered homes into the street  it is to give not to getto mingle with the sterner judgments of men the deeper truths that god through pain has taught to womento mingle with mans justice womans pity till there shall arise the perfect lawnot made of man nor woman but of both each bringing what the other lacks  and they will listen to us  till now it has seemed to them that we were clamouring only for selfish ends  they have not understood  we shall speak to them of common purposes use the language of fellowcitizens  they will see that we are worthy of the place we claim  they will welcome us as helpers in a common cause  they   she turnsthe present comes back to her  lady mogton  after a pause  the business she dwells severely on the word before the meeting   annys  she resents herself meekly  apologising generally  i must learn to control myself  lady mogton  who has waitedis mccaw versus potts  its bearing upon the movement for the extension of the franchise to women  my own view i venture to submit in the form of a resolution  she takes up a paper on which she has been writing  as follows  that the council of the womans parliamentary franchise league having regard to the decision of the house of lords in mccaw v potts   st herbert  looking over  two ts  lady mogton resolves to bring forward a woman candidate to contest the next byeelection  suddenly to mrs mountcalm villiers who is chattering  do you agree or disagree  mrs mountcalmvilliers  my dear  how can you ask  of course we all agree  to elizabeth you agree dont you  elizabeth  of course even if elected she would not be allowed to take her seat  phoebe  how do you know  nothing more full of surprises than english law  lady mogton  at the present stage i regard that point as immaterial  what i am thinking of is the advertisement  a female candidate upon the platform will concentrate the whole attention of the country on our movement  st herbert  it might even be prudentuntil you have got the vote to keep it dark that you will soon be proceeding to the next inevitable step  elizabeth  you think even man could be so easily deceived  st herbert  man has had so much practice in being deceived  it comes naturally to him  elizabeth  poor devil  lady mogton  the only question remaining to be discussed is the candidate  annys  is there not danger that between now and the next bye election the government may having regard to this case bring in a bill to stop women candidates from going to the poll  st herbert  i have thought of that  fortunately the case seems to have attracted very little attention  if a byeelection occurred soon there would hardly be time  lady mogton  it must be the very next one that does occurwherever it is  janet  i am sure that in the east end we should have a chance  phoebe  great scott  just think  if we were to win it  st herbert  if you could get a straight fight against a liberal i believe you would  annys  why is the government so unpopular  st herbert  well take the weather alonetwelve degrees of frost again last night  janet  in st georges road the sewer has burst  the water is in the rooms where the children are sleeping  she clenches her hands  mrs mountcalmvilliers  she shakes her head  something ought really to be done  lady mogton  has anybody any suggestion to makeas regards the candidate  theres no advantage in going outside  it will have to be one of ourselves  mrs mountcalmvilliers  wont you dear  lady mogton  i shall be better employed organising  my own feeling is that it ought to be annys  to st herbert  what do you think  st herbert  undoubtedly  annys  id rather not  lady mogton  its not a question of liking  its a question of duty  for this occasion we shall be appealing to the male voter our candidate must be a woman popular with men  the choice is somewhat limited  elizabeth  no one will put up so good a fight as you  annys  will you give me till this evening  lady mogton  what for  annys  i should like to consult geoffrey  lady mogton  you think he would object  annys  a little doubtfully  no  but we have always talked everything over together  lady mogton  absurd  hes one of our staunchest supporters  of course hell be delighted  elizabeth  i think the thing ought to be settled at once  lady mogton  it must be  i have to return to manchester tonight we shall have to get to work immediately  st herbert  geoffrey will surely take it as a compliment  janet  dont you feel that woman all over the world is calling to you  annys  it isnt that  im not trying to shirk it  i merely thought that if there had been timeof course if you really think   lady mogton  you consent  annys  yes  if its everybodys wish  lady mogton  thats settled  phoebe  she springs up waving a handkerchief  chilvers for ever  janet  rises  god bless you  mrs mountcalmvilliers  clapping her hands  now we shant be long  lady mogton  hammers  order please  the three subside  this is serious business  the next step is of course   the door opens geoffrey enters  he is a youngishlooking man of three or four and thirty  lady mogton at the sound of the door turns  st herbert rises  there is a pause  lady mogton  weve been talking about you  we must apologise for turning your drawingroom   geoffrey  my dear motherinlaw it is providence  he kisses her  there is no one i was more longing to see  annys  she has risen  hake told me you would be dining at the house  geoffrey  he comes to her kisses her he is in a state of suppressed excitement  i shall be  i came back to bring you some news  phoebe  weve got some news for you  have you heard   geoffrey  he stays her  may i claim mans privilege for the first word  it is news i am sure you will all be delighted to hear  a friend of yours has been appointed to an office whereit is quite possiblehe may be of service to you  phoebe  governorship of holloway gaol  geoffrey  not a bad guess  very near it  to the under secretaryship for home affairs  lady mogton  who is it  geoffrey  he bows  your affectionate and devoted servant  annys  you  phoebe  genuinely delighted  she is not a quick thinker  bravo congratulations old boy  she has risenshe slaps him on the back  annys  geoffrey  she puts her arms about him  you never told me anything  geoffrey  i know dear  i was afraid  it mightnt have come off and then you would have been so disappointed  annys  there are tears in her eyes  she still clings to him  i am so glad  oh i am so glad  geoffrey  it is all your doing  you have been such a splendid help  he breaks gently away from her  turns to st herbert with a lighter tone  havent you anything to say to a fellow  youre not usually dumb  st herbert  it has all been so suddenas the early victorian heroine was fond of remarking  geoffrey  laughs  it has been sudden  we had none of us any idea till yesterday that old bullock was thinking of resigning  elizabeth  she has risen and moved towards the fire  wont it necessitate a byeelection  lady mogton and st herbert have been thinking it out  on the others the word falls like a bombshell  geoffrey  he turns to her  he does not see their faces  yes but i dont anticipate a contest  the conservatives are without a candidate and i am on good terms with the labour party  perhaps mr hunnablehe laughs then turning catches sight of his wifes face  from annys he looks to the others  lady mogton  she has risen  you havent heard then of mccaw versus potts  geoffrey  mccaw versus potts  what the   st herbert  was decided in the house of lords late yesterday afternoon  briefly stated it confers upon women the right of becoming parliamentary candidates  geoffrey  he is staggered  you mean   lady mogton  having regard to which we have decided to bring forward a woman candidate to contest the next byeelection  geoffrey  um  i see  annys  but we never thoughtwe never anticipated it would be geoffreys  lady mogton  i really cannot admit that that alters the case geoffrey himself would never dream i am sure of asking us to sacrifice our cause to his convenience  geoffrey  no  of course not  certainly not  lady mogton  it is perhaps unfortunate that the candidate selected   annys  it is quite impossible  such a dilemma was never dreamed of  lady mogton  and if not  is the solidarity of woman   geoffrey  beginning to guess  forgive my impatience but whom have you selected  elizabeth  when she likes she can be quite sweet  your wife he expected it  we rather assumed she appeals to the others with a gesture i think that the president of the mans league for the extension of the franchise to women would regard it as a compliment  geoffrey  his dislike of her is already in existence  yes  very thoughtful  annys  you must choose some one else  phoebe  but there is no one else  annys  theres mamma  phoebe   mammas too heavy  annys  well then theres elizabeththeres you  geoffrey  yes  why not you  you and i could have a jolly little fight  lady mogton  this is not a laughing matter  if i could think of any one to take annyss place i should not insist  i cannot  phoebe  you see it mustnt be a crank  geoffrey  he is losing his temper  yes i suppose that does limit you  elizabeth  and thenthanks to youmrs chilvers has had such excellent training in politics  it was that i think that decided us  geoffrey  convention forbids his strangling her  will somebody kindly introduce me to this lady  st herbert  ah yes of course  you dont know each other do you  mr geoffrey chilversmrs joseph spender  mrs spender mr chilvers mp  elizabeth  sweetly  delighted  geoffrey  not  charmed  lady mogton  to annys  i am not indifferent to your difficulty but the history of woman my dear annys is a history of sacrifice we give our sonsif necessary our husbands  mrs mountcalmvilliers  affected  how true  annys  but you are not asking me to give him  you are asking me to fight him  i cant  lady mogton  you mean you wont  annys  you can put it that way if you like  i wont  a pause  janet  i thought mrs chilvers had pledged her word  elizabeth  yes  but without her husbands consent  so of course it doesnt count  geoffrey  he turns on her  why not youif there must be a fight  or would it be against your principles  elizabeth  not in the least  geoffrey  ah  elizabeth  i would offer myself as a substitute  only it might seem like coming between husband and wife  geoffrey  he turns away with a grunt of disgust  phoebe  its awfully rough on you geoffrey  i can see it from your point of view  but one cant help remembering the things that you yourself have said  geoffrey  i know i know  ive been going up and down the country excusing even your excesses on the ground that no movement can force its way to the front without treading on innumerable toes for me now to cry halt merely because it happens to be my own toes that are in the way would beridiculousabsurdwould be monstrous  nobody contradicts him  you are perfectly justified if this case means what you say it doesin putting up a candidate against me for east poplar  only naturally it cannot be annys he reaches out his hand to where annys stands a little behind him takes her hand  annys and i have fought more than one election it has been side by side  elizabeth  the lady a little behind  geoffrey  he moves away with an expression of deep annoyance  janet  she comes forward  she holds forth her hands with a half appealing halfcommanding gesture  she almost seems inspired would it not be so much better if in this first political contest between man and woman the opponents were two people honouring one another loving one another  would it not show to all the world that man and woman may meetcontend in public life without anger without scorn  there is a pause  they stand listening  i do not know but it seems to me that if mr chilvers could bring himself to do this it would be such a big thingperhaps the most chivalrous thing that a man has ever done to help women  if he would put aside quite voluntarily all the mans privilegejust say to the people now chooseone of us two to serve you  we stand before you equal my wife and i  i dont know how to put it but i feel that by merely doing that one thing mr chilvers would solve the whole problem  it would prove that good men are ready to give us of their free accord all that we claim  we should gain our rights not by warfare but through love and understanding  wouldnt that beso much better  she looksher hands still appealingfrom one to the other  another silence  they have all been carried a little off their feet by janets earnestness  annys  she touches him  what do you think dear  geoffrey  yes theres a

rather like me dont you  st herbert  puzzled  yes  geoffrey  if i were to suddenly hit you on the nose what would happen  st herbert  i understand  woman has suddenly started hitting man on the nose  her excuse being that she really couldnt keep her hands off him any longer  jawbones  he has pinned the poster to the wall  they begun it to ear them talk youd think as man had never done anything

hopefully  up sir  geoffrey  no jawbones  into the dustheap with the rest  jawbones is disgusted  ginger is triumphant  geoffrey  i must talk to sigsby  hes taking the whole thing too seriously  it will be some time before we reach that stage  to jawbones  ask mrs chinn to bring me a cup of tea  jawbones goes out  he seats himself at table and takes up some correspondence  to ginger  are you waiting for any one  ginger  a letter from her ladyship  she picks up from the desk and hands him the letter sigsby had thrown there  her ladyship thought you ought to be consulted  geoffrey  he reads the short letter with a gathering frownhands it across to st herbert  st herbert  having read he passes it back in silence  geoffrey  to ginger  do you know the contents of this letter  ginger  the matter has been discussed among usinformally  geoffrey  tell lady mogton illtalk to her myself on the subject  ginger  thank you  she collects her etceteras  good afternoon  geoffrey  shortly  good afternoon  ginger  she bows graciously to st herbert who responds  goes out  geoffrey  the devil of it is that its the truth  st herbert  somebody was bound to say it sooner or later  geoffrey  yes but ones own wife  this is a confoundedly awkward situation  st herbert  he comes to him stands looking down at him  did it never occur to you when you were advocating equal political rights for women that awkward situations might arise  geoffrey  he leans back in his chair  do you remember tommy the terrier as they used to call him in the housewas always preaching socialism  st herbert  quite the most amusing man i ever met  geoffrey  and not afraid of being honest  do you remember his answer when somebody asked him what he would do if socialism by any chance really became established in england  he had just married an american heiress  he said he should emigrate  i am still convinced that woman is entitled to equal political rights with man  i didnt think it was coming in my time  there are points in the problem remaining to be settled before we can arrive at a working solution  this is one of them  he takes up the letter and reads  are you prepared to have as your representative a person who for six months out of every year may be incapacitated from serving you  its easy enough to say i oughtnt to allow my supporters to drag in the personal element  i like it even less myself  but whats the answer  jawbones enters with a tray  jawbones  places tray on table  teas coming in a minute sir he is clearing away  geoffrey  never mind all that  he hands him a slip  take this to the printers  tell them i must have a proof tonight  jawbones  yes sir  finds his cap and goes out  st herbert  the answer i should say would be that the majority of women will continue to find something better to do  the women who will throw themselves into politics will be the unattached women the childless women  in an instant he sees his mistake but it is too late  geoffrey  he rises crosses to the desk throws into a waste paperbasket a piece of crumpled paper that was in his hand then turns  the personal note has entered into the discussion  the women who want to be childlesswhat about them  st herbert  he shrugs his shoulders  are there any such  geoffrey  there are women who talk openly of womans share in the general scheme being a burden on heran incubus  st herbert  a handful of cranks  to the normal woman motherhood has always been the one supreme desire  geoffrey  because children crowned her with honour  the barren woman was despised  all that is changing  this movement is adding impulse to it  st herbert  movements do not alter instincts  geoffrey  but they do  ever since man emerged from the jungle he has been shedding his instinctsshaping them to new desires where do you find this allprevailing instinct towards maternity among the women of society who sacrifice it without a moments hesitation to their vanityto their mere pleasures  the middle class womanshe too is demanding freedom  children servants the homethey are too much for her nerves  and now there comes this new development appealing to the intellectual woman  is there not danger of her preferring political ambition the excitement of public life to what has come to be regarded as the drudgery of turning four walls into a home of peopling the silence with the voices of the children  he crosses to the table lays his hand again upon the open letter  how do you know that this may not be her answeri have no children  i never mean to have children  sigsby enters in company with ben lamb mp  lamb is a short thickset goodtempered man  ah lamb how are you  lamb  they greet one another  how are things going  sigsby  theyre not going at all well  geoffrey  sigsby was ever the child of despondency  sigsby  yes and so will you be when you find yourself at the bottom of the poll  geoffrey  the notion takes him by surprise  lamb  its going to be a closer affair than any of us thought its the joke of the thing that appears to have got hold of them they want to see what will happen  geoffrey  mans fatal curiosity concerning the eternal feminine  sigsby  yes and they wont have to pay for it  that will be our department  st herbert  to sigsby  what do you think theyll do supposing by any chance mrs chilvers should head the poll  sigsby  how do you meanwhatll

in the room the electionall things  whats all this  we thought woman hadnt got the fighting instinctthat we knew her  my boy were in the infants class  sigsby  if you want to be his majestys undersecretary for home affairs you take my tip guvnor youll win this election  geoffrey  what more can i do than im doing  how can i countenance this sort of thing  he indicates the posters  declare myself dead against the whole movement  lamb  youll do it later  may as well do it soon  geoffrey  why must i do it  lamb  because youre beginning to find out what it means  a pause  the door is open  annys is standing there  annys  dare we venture into the enemys camp  she enters laughing followed by elizabeth and phoebe annys is somewhat changed from the grave dreamy annys of a short week ago she is brimming over with vitalityexcitement  there is a decisiveness an egoism about her that seems new to her  the womens skirts make a flutter  a breeze seems to have entered annys runs to her husband  for the moment the election fades away they are all smiles tenderness for one another  annys  dont tell will you  mamma would be so shocked  do you know you havent been near me for three days  geoffrey  umph  i like that  where were you last night  annys  last night  in the neighbourhood of leicester square till three oclock  oh geoff theres such a lot wants altering  she turns to greet the

i bring some more cups and saucers sir  geoffrey  ah yes  to annys  youll have some tea  annys  strong please mrs chinn  mrs chinn goes out  laughs  yes i know its bad for me  she puts a hand over his mouth  phoebe  old mother chinn is quite right you know geoff  youre not putting up a good fight  geoffrey  a slight irritability begins to show itself  i frankly confess that i am not used to fighting women  elizabeth  yes  it was easier no doubt when we took it lying down  annys  you promised if i brought you that you would be good  geoffrey  i wish it had been you  phoebe  yes but we dont  as she and elizabeth move away  did you have a row with the doctor when you were born  to which elizabeth replies though the words reach only phoebe i might have if i had known that my mother was doing all the work while he was pocketing the fee  lamb  you see mrs chilvers our difficulty is that there is nothing to be said against youexcept one thing  annys  whats that  lamb  that youre a woman  annys  smiling  isnt that enough  sigsby  quite enough mrs chilvers if the guvnor would only say it  annys  to geoffrey  why dont you  ill promise not to deny it  the others drift apart  they group themselves near to the window they talk togethergrow evidently interested and excited  geoffrey  i have just had a letter from yourelection agent expressing indignation with one of my supporters for merely having hinted at the fact  annys  i dont understand  geoffrey  he takes from the table the letter and hands it to her in silence  he seats himself on the settee and watches her  annys  she seats herself on a chair just opposite to him reads the letter through in silence  in my case it does not apply  geoffrey  how do you know  annys  the atmosphere has grown suddenly oppressive  oh ii think we might find some other reason than that  she hands him back the letter  geoffrey  its the only one of any importance  it embraces all the others  shall woman be motheror politician  he puts the letter in his pocket  annys  why cannot she be both  geoffrey  he is looking at her searchingly  because if she is the one she doesnt want to be the other  a silence  annys  you are wrong  it is the mother instinct that makes us politicians  we want to take care of the world  geoffrey  exactly  you think mans job more interesting than your own  annys  after a moment  who told you that it was a mans job  geoffrey  well  he shrugs his shoulders  we cant do yours  annys  cant we help each other  geoffrey  as for instance in this election  he gives a short laugh  annys  of course this is an exceptional case  geoffrey  its an epitome of the whole question  you are trying to take my job away from me  to the neglect of your own  annys  after another moments silence  havent i always tried to do my duty  geoffrey  i have thought so  annys  oh my dear we mustnt quarrel  you will win this election  i want you to win it  next time we must fight side by side again  geoffrey  dont you see  fighting you means fighting the whole movement  he indicates the posters pinned to the walls  that sort of thing  annys  after a brief inspection  not that way  shaking her head  it would break my heart for you to turn against us  win because you are the better man  smiling  i want you to be the better man  geoffrey  i would rather be your husband  annys  smiling  isnt that the same thing  geoffrey  no  i want a wife  annys  what precisely do you mean by wife  geoffrey  its an oldestablished word  mrs chinn has entered to complete the tea arrangements  she is arranging the table  mrs chinn  theres a deputation downstairs sir just come for you  geoffrey  what are they  mrs chinn  its one of those societies for the reform of something  they said you were expecting them  sigsby

the physical relationship between the sexes i think  geoffrey  oh only that  sigsby  something of the sort  he goes out  mrs chinn also by the other door  geoffrey  rising  will you pour out  annys  she has been thinking  she comes back to the present  we shant be in your way  geoffrey  oh no  it will make it easier to get rid of them  annys changes her chair  the others gather round  the service and drinking of tea proceeds in the usual course  to elizabeth  youll take some tea  elizabeth  thank you  geoffrey  you must be enjoying yourself just now  elizabeth  makes a moue  they insist on my being agreeable  annys  its so good for her  teaches her selfcontrol  lamb  i gather from mrs spender that in the perfect world there will be no men at all  elizabeth  oh yes they will be there  but in their proper place  st herbert  thats why you didnt notice them  the deputation reaches the door  the sound of voices is heard  phoebe  shes getting on very well  if she isnt careful shell end up by being a flirt  the deputation enters guided by sigsby  its number is five two men and three women  eventually they group themselvessome standing some sittingeach side of geoffrey  the others gather round annys who keeps her seat at the opposite side of the table  sigsby  talking as he enters  exactly what ive always maintained  hopper  it would make the husband quite an interesting person  sigsby  cheerfully  thats the idea  here we are guvnor this is mr chilvers  geoffrey bows the deputation also  sigsby introduces a remarkably boyishlooking man dressed in knickerbockers  sigsby  this is mr peekin who has kindly consented to act as spokesman  to the deputation generally  will you have some tea  miss borlasse  a thickset masculinefeatured lady with short hair and heavy eyebrows  her deep decisive tone settles the question  thank you  we have so little time  mr peekin  we propose mr chilvers to come to the point at once he is all smiles caressing gestures  geoffrey  excellent  peekin  if i left a baby at your door what would you do with it  geoffrey  for a moment he is taken aback recovers himself  are you thinking of doing so  peekin  its not impossible  geoffrey  well it sounds perhaps inhospitable but do you know i really think i should ask you to take it away again  peekin  yes but by the time you find it there i shall have disappearedskedaddled  hopper  good  he rubs his hands  smiles at the others  geoffrey  in that case i warn you that i shall hand it over to the police  peekin  he turns to the others  i dont myself see what else mr chilvers could be expected to do  miss borlasse  hed be a fool not to  geoffrey  thank you  so far we seem to be in agreement  and now may i ask to what all this is leading  peekin  he changes from the debonnair to the dramatic  how many men mr chilvers leave their babies every year at the door of povertystricken women  what are they expected to do with them  a moment  the deputation murmur approval  geoffrey  i see  but is there no difference between the two doors i am not an accomplice  peekin  an accomplice  is the ignorant servantgirlfirst lured into the publichouse cajoled tricked deceived by false promisesthe halfstarved shopgirl in the hands of the practised libertineis she an accomplice  mrs peekin  a dowdilydressed untidy woman but the face is sweet and tender  ah mr chilvers if you could only hear the stories that i have heard from dying lips  geoffrey  very pitiful my dear lady  and alas only too old but there are others  it would not be fair to blame always the man  annys  unnoticed drawn by the subject she has risen and come down  perhaps not  but the punishment always falls on the woman is that quite fair  geoffrey  he is irritated at annyss incursion into the discussion  my dear annys that is natures law not mans  all man can do is to mitigate it  peekin  that is all we ask  the suffering the shame must always be the womans  surely that is sufficient  geoffrey  what do you propose  miss borlasse  in her deep fierce tones  that all children born out of wedlock should be a charge upon the rates  miss ricketts  a slight fair middleaged woman with a nervous hesitating manner  of course only if the mother wishes it  geoffrey  the proposal staggers him  but the next moment it inspires him with mingled anger and amusement  my dear good people have you stopped for one moment to consider what the result of your proposal would be  peekin  for one thing mr chilvers the adding to the populace of healthy children in place of the stunted and diseased abortions that is all that these poor women out of their scanty earnings can afford to present to the state  geoffrey  humph  that incidentally it would undermine the whole institution of marriage let loose the floodgates that at present hold immorality in check doesnt appear to trouble you  that the law must be altered to press less heavily upon the womanthat the man must be made an equal sharer in the penaltyall that goes without saying  the remedy you propose would be a thousand times worse than the disease  annys  and meanwhile  until you have devised this scheme there is a note of contempt in her voice under which escape for the man will be impossible  geoffrey  the evil must continue  as other evils have to until the true remedy is found  peekin  he has hurriedly consulted with the others  all have risenhe turns to geoffrey  you will not support our demand  geoffrey  support it  do you mean that you cannot yourselves see that you are holding out an indemnity to every profligate male and female throughout the landthat you would be handicapping in the struggle for existence every honest man and woman desirous of bringing up their children in honour and in love  your suggestion is monstrous  peekin  the little man is not without his dignity  we apologise mr chilvers for having taken up your time  geoffrey  i am sorry the matter was one offering so little chance of agreement  peekin  we will make only one slight further trespass on your kindness  mrs chilvers if one may judge would seem to be more in sympathy with our views  might weit would be a saving of time and shoe leather he smilesmight we take this opportunity of laying our case before her  geoffrey  it would be useless  a short silence  annys with elizabeth and phoebe a little behind her stands right  lamb sigsby and st herbert are behind geoffrey centre  the deputation is left  hopper  do we gather that in this election you speak for both candidates  geoffrey  in matters of common decency yes  my wife does not associate herself with movements for the encouragement of vice  there is another moments silence  annys  but geoffrey dearwe should not be encouraging the evil we should still seek to find the man to punish him  the woman would still suffer   geoffrey  my dear annys this is neither the time nor place for you and me to argue out the matter  i must ask you to trust to my judgment  annys  i can understand your refusing but why do you object to my   geoffrey  because i do not choose for my wifes name to be linked with a movement that i regard as criminal  i forbid it  it was the moment that was bound to come  the mans instincts training have involuntarily asserted themselves  shall the woman yield  if so then down goes the whole movementher claim to freedom of judgment of action in all things  all watch the struggle with breathless interest  annys  she speaks very slowly very quietly but with a new note in her voice  i am sorry but i have given much thought to this matter andi do not agree with you  mrs peekin  you will help us  annys  i will do what i can  peekin  he takes from his pocket a folded paper  it is always so much more satisfactory when these things are in writing candidates with the best intentions in the world are apt to forget  he has spread the paper on a corner of the table  he has in his hand his fountainpen  annys  with a smile  i am not likely to forget but if you wish itshe approaches the table  geoffrey  he interposes  his voice is very low almost a whisper  my wife will not sign  annys  she also speaks low but there is no yielding in her voice  i am not only your wife  i have a duty also to others  geoffrey  it is for you to choose  he leaves the way open to her  the silence can almost be felt  she moves to the table takes up the paper  it contains but a few lines of writing  having read it she holds out her hand for the pen  peekin puts it in her hand  with a firm hand she signs folds the paper and returns it to him  she remains standing by the table  with the removal of the tension there comes a rustle a breaking of the silence  miss ricketts  she seizes annyss hand hanging listlessly by her side and stooping kisses it  miss borlasse  that is all isnt it  peekin  we thank you mrs chilvers  good afternoon  annys  the natural reaction is asserting itself  she pulls herself together sufficiently to murmur her answer  good afternoon  mrs peekin  the deputation is moving away she takes from her waist a small bunch of flowers and turning places them in annyss hand  annys  she smiles remains standing silent the flowers in her hand  good afternoons are exchanged with some of the others finally  peekin  good afternoon mr chilvers  geoffrey  who has moved away  good afternoon  the deputation joins sigsby by the door  he leads them out  elizabeth  to phoebe  are you going my way  phoebe  she glances round at annys  yes ill come with you  st herbert  i will put you into a bus if you will let me  we dont sport

desk pretending to look at some papers  i shall look in about ten oclock  lamb  one or two things i want to say to you  goodbye for the present  geoffrey  goodbye  phoebe  goodbye old man  she stretches out her hand  geoffrey  goodbye  she shakes hands with a smile exchanges a casual goodbye with elizabeth  they go towards the door  sigsby reenters  sigsby  to lamb  are you going  lamb  yes

fall the flowers on the table  she crosses to where geoffrey still stands by the desk his back towards her  she stretches out her hand touches him  he does not move  geoffrey  but still he takes no notice  i am so sorry  we must talk it over quietlyat home  geoffrey  he turns  home  i have no home  i have neither children nor wife  i keep a political opponent  annys starts back with a cry  he crosses in front of her and seats himself at the table  the flowers are lying there he throws them into the wastepaper basket  annys  she puts on her cloak moves towards the door  halfway she pauses makes a movement towards him  but he will not see then a hard look comes into her eyes and without another word she goes out leaving the door open  sigsby is heard moving in the other room  geoffrey  he is writing  sigsby  sigsby  hallo  geoffrey  that poster i told young gordon i wouldnt sanction the woman spouting politics the man returning to a slatterns home  sigsby enters  sigsby  i have

to know  st herbert  where most things end  in the millennium according to its advocates  in the ruin of the country according to its opponents  in mild surprise on the part of the next generation that ever there was any fuss about it  sigsby  in amazement you mean that their fathers were so blind as not to see where it was leading  my boy this is going to alter the whole relationship between the sexes  st herbert  is it so perfect as it is  a silence  might it not be established on a more workable a more enduring basis if woman were allowed a share in the shaping of it  some woman in the crowd starts the refrain well hang old asquith on a sour apple tree  it is taken up with quiet earnestness by others  sigsby  shaping it  nice sort of shape it will be by the time that lot with a gesture including the crowd lady mogton  co  have done knocking it about  wouldnt be any next generation to be surprised at anything if some of them had their way  st herbert  the housebreakers come firstnot a class of work demanding much intelligence the builders come later  have you seen chilvers  lamb  i left him at the house  he couldnt get away  sigsby  theres your objectlesson for you  we dont need to go far  a mans whole career ruined by the wife he nourishes  st herbert  how do you mean ruined  sigsby  so it is  if she wins the election and claims the seat do you think the cabinet will want him  their latest addition compelled to appeal to the house of commons to fight for him against his own womenfolk  grunts  hell be the laughingstock of the whole country  st herbert  do you know for certain that they mean to claim the seat  sigsby  wait and see is their answer  lamb  hasnt chilvers any idea  sigsby  cant get him to talk  dont think hes seen her since that shindy over the deputation  lamb  humph  sigsby  even if she herself wished to draw back the others would overrule her  lamb  im not so sure of that  shes got a way of shutting her mouth that reminds me of my old woman  sigsby  the arrangement as he explained it to me was that the whole thing was to end with the polling  it was to have been a mere joke a mere ballon dessai  the mistake he made was thinking he could depend on her  lamb  guess she made the same mistake  you can fight and shake hands afterwards it doesnt go with kissing  sigsby  man and woman were not made to fight  it was never intended  the womans marseillaise has been taken up by the crowd  the chorus has been reached  oh damn your row  he slams to the window it was ajar  jawbones has entered with his purchases  turning from window he sees jawbones goes to meet him  couldnt they do anything  jawbones  he has bought a new hat has also brought back the remains  he shakes his head  no good for anything else but a memento  sigsby  with a grunt he snatches the thing and flings it into a corner  tries on the new one  jawbones  ows it feel  sigsby with the help of jawbones attends to his appearance  lamb  to st herbert  no use talking to her i suppose  st herbert  shrugs his shoulders  shell do what she imagines to be her duty  women are so uncivilised  a burst of cheering is heard  a shrill male voice  three cheers for winston churchill  it is followed by an explosion of yells  st herbert  whos that  lamb  he has opened the window  phoebe mogton  sigsby  what a family  janet has entered  janet  is that mrs chilvers  to lamb

william  jawbones  because in spite of all i love yer  ginger  she looks into the future  what will i be  a general servant without wages  jawbones  the question as it seems to me is which of us two

she slips the ring over her finger still with her eyes drawing him  he catches her to him in fierce passion kisses her  a loud shrill female cheer comes from the crowd  the cheer is renewed and renewed  jawbones  he breaks away and goes to the window  ullo  what are they shoutin about now  he looks out  its the donah  ginger  mrs chilvers  jawbones  yus  better not get wearin itmay shock

laughing while she rearranges her hat and hair  a little embarrassing  that redhaired girlshe carried me right up the steps  i was afraid she would   jawbones has been quick enough to swing a chair into place just in time to receive her  she recovers herself  thank you  elizabeth  she hands annys a smellingbottle  to jawbones  open the window a few inches  he does so  some woman much interrupted is making a speech  janet opens the door a little way and looks in  janet  oh it is you  i am glad  she goes out again  elizabeth  are the others all here  ginger  er ladyship is watching the counting  miss phoebe as just gone out   phoebe enters  oh ere she is  phoebe  hullo  she is taking off her things  wherever have you been  weve been scouring the neighbourhood   lady mogton enters followed by janet  i say youre looking jolly chippy  elizabeth  we had an extra enthusiastic meeting  she spoke for rather a long time  i made her come home with me and lie down  i think she is all right now  lady mogton  would you like to see a doctor  phoebe  there is a very good man close here  she turns to jawbones who is still near the window  gordon   annys  interrupting  no  please dont  i am quite all right i hate strange doctors  phoebe  well let me send for whitby he could be here in twenty minutes  annys  i wish you would all leave me alone  theres absolutely nothing to fuss about whatever  we pampered womenwe cant breathe the same air that ordinary mortals have to  we ought to be ashamed of ourselves  phoebe  to herself  obstinate pig  she catches jawbones eye unnoticed by the others she takes him aside  they whisper  annys  how is it going  lady mogton  you must be prepared for winning  she puts again the question that annys has frequently been asked to answer during the last few days  what are you going to do  mrs mountcalmvilliers enters as usual in a flutter of excitement  mrs mountcalmvilliers  am i late  they brush her back into silence  elizabeth takes charge of her  annys  she has risen  you think it wise tactics to make it impossible for geoffrey to be anything else in the future but our enemy  lady mogton  contemptuously  you are thinking of him and not of the cause  annys  and if i were  havent i made sacrifice enoughmore than any of you will ever know  ayand would make more if i felt it was demanded of me  i dont  her burst of anger is finished she turns smiling  im much more cunning than you think  there will be other elections we shall want to fight  with the under secretary for home affairs in sympathy with us the government will find it difficult to interfere  dont you see how clever i am  jawbones having received his instructions from phoebe has slipped out unobserved  he has beckoned to ginger she has followed him  phoebe has joined the group  mrs mountcalmvilliers  theres something in that  janet  is mr chilvers still in sympathy with us  phoebe  of course he is  a bit rubbed up the wrong way just at present thats our fault  when annys goes down early next mouth to fight the exchange division of manchester we shall have him with us  a moment  lady mogton  where do you get that from  phoebe  from st herbert  the present member is his cousin  they say he cant live more than a week  mrs mountcalmvilliers  it really seems like providence  annys  has taken the opportunity of giving phoebe a grateful squeeze of the hand  lady mogton  you will fight manchester  annys  yes  laughs  and make myself a public nuisance if i win  lady mogton  well must be content with that i suppose  better not come in the rooms rather crowded  ill keep you informed how things are going  she goes out followed by janet  mrs mountcalmvilliers  ill stay with you dear  phoebe  i want you to come and be photographed for the daily mirror  the mans waiting downstairs  elizabeth  ill stop with annys  mrs mountcalmvilliers  im not quite sure you know that i take well by flashlight  phoebe  you wait till youve seen mamma  we must have you  they want you for the centre of the page  mrs mountcalmvilliers  well if its really   phoebe  to the others  shall see you again  she winks  then to mrs mountcalmvilliers  we mustnt keep them waiting  they are giving us a whole page  phoebe takes mrs mountcalmvilliers out  elizabeth has followed to the door she closes it  annys has reseated herself facing the fire  elizabeth  when did you see your husband last  annys  not sincetuesday wasnt it that we went round to his rooms  why  elizabeth  im thinking about manchester  what was it he said to you  annys  oh we were both of us a little overexcited i suppose he hasshe hesitates finally answershe has always been so eager for children  elizabeth  yes  so many men are not having to bear the pain and inconvenience themselves  annys  oh well they have to provide for them when they do come thats fair enough division i su  suddenly she turns fiercely why do you talk like that  as if we women were cowards  do you think if god sent me a child i should grudge him the price  elizabeth  do you want him to  annys  i dont know prayed him to once  elizabeth  she lays her hand upon her  it isnt a few more mothers that the world has need of  it is the women whom god has appointedto whom he has given freedom that they may champion the cause of the mothers helpless by reason of their motherhood  a moment  geoffrey enters  geoffrey  good evening  annys  rises a smile struggles for possession  but he only shakes hands and it dies away  elizabeth  good evening  they shake hands  geoffrey  you are not interested in the counting  annys  the room is rather crowded  mamma thought i would be better out here  how have you been  geoffrey  oh all right  its going to be a very near thing they tell me  annys  yes i shall be glad when its over  geoffrey  its always a trying time  what are you going to do if you win  lady mogton looks in  lady mogton  seeing geoffrey  oh good evening  geoffrey  good evening  lady mogton  chilvers 2960annys chilvers 2874  she disappearscloses door  annys  perhaps im not going to win  she goes to him smiling i hope youll win  i would so much rather you won  geoffrey  very kind of you  im afraid that wont make it a certainty  annys  his answer has hardened her again  how can i  it would not be fair  without your consent i should never have entered upon it  it was understood that the seat in any case would be yours  geoffrey  i would rather you considered yourself quite free  in warfare it doesnt pay to be fair to ones enemy  annys  still hardening  besides there is no need  there will be other opportunities  i can contest some other constituency  if i win claim the seat for that  a moment  geoffrey  so this is only the beginning  you have decided to devote yourself to a political career  annys  why not  geoffrey  if i were to ask you to abandon it to come back to your place at my sidehelping me strengthening me  annys  you mean you would have me abandon my own taskmerge myself in you  geoffrey  be my wife  annys  it would not be right  i too have my work  geoffrey  if it takes you away from me  annys  why need it take me away from you  why cannot we work together for common
