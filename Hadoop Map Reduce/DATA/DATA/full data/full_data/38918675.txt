such an intensity of passion expressed in his face in the fingers of his hand which closed slowly and convulsively as if they were clutching the throat of a struggling viper there was so much hate in those muttered words so much power such compelling and awesome determination that an ominous silence fell upon the village lads and the men who sat with him in the low narrow room of the auberge des trois vertus  even the man in the tattered coat and threadbare breeches whoperched upon the centre tablehad been haranguing the company on the subject of the rights of man paused in his peroration and looked down on pierre half afraid of that fierce flame of passionate hate which his own words had helped to kindle  the silence however had only lasted a few moments the next pierre was on his feet and a cry like that of a bull in a slaughterhouse escaped his throat  in the name of god he shouted let us cease all that senseless talking havent we planned enough and talked enough to satisfy our puling consciences the time has come to strike mes amis to strike i say to strike at those cursed aristocrats who have made us what we areignorant wretched downtroddensenseless clods to work our fingers to the bone our bodies till they break so that they may wallow in their pleasures and their luxuries strike i say he reiterated while his eyes glowed and his breath came and went through his throat with a hissing sound strike as the men and women struck in paris on that great day in july to them the bastille stood for tyranny and they struck at it as they would at the head of a tyrantand the tyrant cowered cringed made termshe was frightened at the wrath of the people that is what happened in paris that is what must happen in nantes the château of the duc de kernogan is our bastille let us strike at it tonight and if the arrogant aristocrat resists well raze his house to the ground the hour the day the darkness are all propitious the arrangements hold good the neighbours are ready strike i say  he brought his hard fist crashing down upon the table so that mugs and bottles rattled his enthusiasm had fired all his hearers his hatred and his lust of revenge had done more in five minutes than all the tirades of the agitators sent down from paris to instil revolutionary ideas into the slowmoving brains of village lads  who will give the signal queried one of the older men quietly  i will came a lusty response from pierre  he strode to the door and all the men jumped to their feet ready to follow him dragged into this hotheaded venture by the mere force of one mans towering passion they followed pierre like sheepsheep that have momentarily become intoxicatedsheep that have become fiercea strange sight trulyand yet one that the man in the tattered coat who had done so much speechifying lately watched with eager interest and presently related with great wealth of detail to m de mirabeau the champion of the people  it all came about through the death of a pair of pigeons he said  the death of the pigeons however was only the spark which set all these turbulent passions ablaze they had been smouldering for half a century and had been ready to burst into flames for the past decade  antoine melun the wheelwright who was to have married louise pierres sister had trapped a pair of pigeons in the woods of m le duc de kernogan he had done it to assert his rights as a manhe did not want the pigeons though he was a poor man he was no poorer than hundreds of peasants for miles around but he paid imposts and taxes until every particle of profit which he gleaned from his miserable little plot of land went into the hands of the collectors whilst m le duc de kernogan paid not one sou towards the costs of the state and he had to live on what was left of his own rye and wheat after m le ducs pigeons had had their fill of them  antoine melun did not want to eat the pigeons which he had trapped but he desired to let m le duc de kernogan know that god and nature had never intended all the beasts and birds of the woods to be the exclusive property of one man rather than another so he trapped and killed two pigeons and m le ducs headbailiff caught him in the act of carrying those pigeons home  whereupon antoine was arrested for poaching and thieving he was tried at nantes under the presidency of m le duc de kernogan and ten minutes ago while the man in the tattered coat was declaiming to a number of peasant lads in the coffeeroom of the auberge des trois vertus on the subject of their rights as men and citizens some one brought the news that antoine melun had just been condemned to death and would be hanged on the morrow  that was the spark which had fanned pierre adets hatred of the aristocrats to a veritable conflagration the news of antoine meluns fate was the bleat which rallied all those human sheep around their leader for pierre had naturally become their leader because his hatred of m le duc was more tangible more powerful than theirs pierre had had more education than they his father jean adet the miller had sent him to a school in nantes and when pierre came home m le curé of vertou took an interest in him and taught him all he knew himselfwhich was not muchin the way of philosophy and the classics but later on pierre took to reading the writings of m jeanjacques rousseau and soon knew the contrat social almost by heart he had also read the articles in m marats newspaper lami du peuple and like antoine melun the wheelwright he had got it into his head that it was not god nor yet nature who had intended one man to starve while another gorged himself on all the good things of this world  he did not however speak of these matters either to his father or to his sister or to m le curé but he brooded over them and when the price of bread rose to four sous he muttered curses against m le duc de kernogan and when famine prices ruled throughout the district those curses became overt threats and by the time that the pinch of hunger was felt in vertou pierres passion of fury against the duc de kernogan had turned to a frenzy of hate against the entire noblesse of france  still he said nothing to his father nothing to his mother and sister but his father knew old jean would watch the stormclouds which gathered on pierres lowering brow he heard the muttered curses which escaped from pierres lips whilst he worked for the liegelord whom he hated but jean was a wise man and knew how useless it is to put out a feeble hand in order to stem the onrush of a torrent he knew how useless are the words of wisdom from an old man to quell the rebellious spirit of the young  jean was on the watch and evening after evening when the work on the farm was done pierre would sit in the small low room of the auberge with other lads from the village talking talking of their wrongs of the arrogance of the aristocrats the sins of m le duc and his family the evil conduct of the king and the immorality of the queen and men in ragged coats and tattered breeches came in from nantes and even from paris in order to harangue these village lads and told them yet further tales of innumerable wrongs suffered by the people at the hands of the aristos and stuffed their heads full of schemes for getting even once and for all with those men and women who fattened on the sweat of the poor and drew their luxury from the hunger and the toil of the peasantry  pierre sucked in these harangues through every pore they were meat and drink to him his hate and passions fed upon these effusions till his whole being was consumed by a maddening desire for reprisals for vengeancefor the lust of triumph over those whom he had been taught to fear  and in the low narrow room of the auberge the fevered heads of village lads were bent together in conclave and the ravings and shoutings of a while ago were changed to whisperings and low murmurings behind barred doors and shuttered windows men exchanged cryptic greetings when they met in the village street enigmatical signs passed between them while they worked strangers came and went at dead of night to and from the neighbouring villages m le ducs overseers saw nothing heard nothing guessed nothing m le curé saw much and old jean adet guessed a great deal but they said nothing for nothing then would have availed  then came the catastrophe   ii  pierre pushed open the outer door of the auberge des trois vertus and stepped out under the porch a gust of wind caught him in the face the night so the chronicles of the time tell us was as dark as pitch on ahead lay the lights of the city flickering in the gale to the left the wide tawny ribbon of the river wound its turbulent course toward the ocean the booming of the waters swollen by the recent melting of the snow sounded like the weird echoes of invisible cannons far away  without hesitation pierre advanced his little troop followed him in silence they were a little sobered now that they came out into the open and that the fumes of cider and of hot perspiring humanity no longer obscured their vision or inflamed their brain  they knew whither pierre was going it had all been prearrangedthroughout this past summer in the musty parlour of the auberge behind barred doors and shuttered windowsall they had to do was to follow pierre whom they had tacitly chosen as their leader they walked on behind him their hands buried in the pockets of their thin tattered breeches their heads bent forward against the fury of the gale  pierre made straight for the millhis homewhere his father lived and where louise was even now crying her eyes out because antoine melun her sweetheart had been condemned to be hanged for killing two pigeons  at the back of the mill was the dwelling house and beyond it a small farmery for jean adet owned a little bit of land and would have been fairly well off if the taxes had not swallowed up all the money that he made out of the sale of his rye and his hay just here the ground rose sharply to a little hillock which dominated the flat valley of the loire and commanded a fine view over the more distant villages  pierre skirted the mill and without looking round to see if the others followed him he struck squarely to the right up a narrow lane bordered by tall poplars and which led upwards to the summit of the little hillock around which clustered the tumbledown barns of his fathers farmery  the gale lashed the straight tall stems of the poplars until they bent nearly double and each tiny bare twig sighed and whispered as if in pain pierre strode on and the others followed in silence they were chilled to the bone under their scanty clothes but they followed on with grim determination set teeth and anger and hate seething in their hearts  the top of the rising ground was reached it was pitch dark and the men when they halted fell up against one another trying to get a foothold on the sodden ground but pierre seemed to have eyes like a cat he only paused one moment to get his bearings thenstill without a wordhe set to work a large barn and a group of small circular straw ricks loomed like solid masses out of the darknessblack silhouetted against the black of the stormy sky pierre turned toward the barn those of his comrades who were in the forefront of the small crowd saw him disappearing inside one of those solid shadowy masses that looked so ghostlike in the night  anon those who watched and who happened to be facing the interior of the barn saw sparks from a tinder flying in every direction the next moment they could see pierre himself quite clearly he was standing in the middle of the barn and intent on lighting a roughlyfashioned torch with his tinder soon the resin caught a spark and pierre held the torch inclined toward the ground so that the flames could lick their way up the shaft the flickering light cast a weird glow and deep grotesque shadows upon the face and figure of the young man his hair lanky and dishevelled fell over his eyes his mouth and jaw illumined from below by the torch looked unnaturally large and showed his teeth gleaming white like the fangs of a beast of prey his shirt was torn open at the neck and the sleeves of his coat were rolled up to the elbow he seemed not to feel either the cold from without or the scorching heat of the flaming torch in his hand but he worked deliberately and calmly without haste or febrile movements grim determination held his excitement in check  at last his work was done the men who had pressed forward in order to watch him fell back as he advanced torch in hand they knew exactly what he was going to do they had thought it all out planned it spoken of it till even their unimaginative minds had visualised this coming scene with absolutely realistic perception and yet now that the supreme hour had come now that they saw pierretorch in handprepared to give the signal which would set ablaze the seething revolt of the countryside their heart seemed to stop its beating within their body they held their breath their toilworn hands went up to their throats as if to repress that awful choking sensation which was so like fear  but pierre had no such hesitations if his breath seemed to choke him as it reached his throat if it escaped through his set teeth with a strange whistling sound it was because his excitement was that of a hungry beast who had sighted his prey and is ready to spring and devour his hand did not shake his step was firm the gusts of wind caught the flame of his torch till the sparks flew in every direction and scorched his hair and his hands and while the others recoiled he strode on to the strawrick that was nearest  for one moment he held the torch aloft there was triumph now in his eyes in his whole attitude he looked out into the darkness far away which seemed all the more impenetrable beyond the restricted circle of flickering torchlight it seemed as if he would wrest from that inky blackness all the secrets which it hidall the enthusiasm the excitement the passions the hatred which he would have liked to set ablaze as he would the strawricks anon  are you ready mes amis he called  aye aye they repliednot gaily not lustily but calmly and under their breath  one touch of the torch and the dry straw began to crackle a gust of wind caught the flame and whipped it into energy it crept up the side of the little rick like a glowing python that wraps its prey in its embrace another gust of wind and the flame leapt joyously up to the pinnacle of the rick and sent forth other tongues to lick and to lick to enfold the straw to devour to consume  but pierre did not wait to see the consummation of his work of destruction already with a few rapid strides he had reached his fathers second strawrick and this too he set alight and then another and another until six blazing furnaces sent their lurid tongues of flames twisting and twirling writhing and hissing through the stormy night  within the space of two minutes the whole summit of the hillock seemed to be ablaze and pierre like a god of fire torch in hand seemed to preside over and command a multitude of everspreading flames to his will excitement had overmastered him now the lust to destroy was upon him and excitement had seized all the others too  there was shouting and cursing and laughter that sounded mirthless and forced and calls to pierre and oaths of revenge memory like an evilintentioned witch was riding invisibly in the darkness and she touched each seething brain with her fevergiving wand every man had an outrage to remember an injustice to recall and strong brown fists were shaken aloft in the direction of the château de kernogan whose lights glimmered feebly in the distance beyond the loire  death to the tyrant a la lanterne les aristos the peoples hour has come at last no more starvation no more injustice equality liberty a mort les aristos  the shouts the curses the crackling flames the howling of the wind the soughing of the trees made up a confusion of sounds which seemed hardly of this earth the blazing ricks the flickering red light of the flames had finally transformed the little hillock behind the mill into another brocken on whose summit witches and devils do of a truth hold their revels  a moi shouted pierre again and he threw his torch down upon the ground and once more made for the barn the others followed him in the barn were such weapons as these wretched penniless peasants had managed to collectscythes poles axes saws anything that would prove useful for the destruction of the château de kernogan and the proposed browbeating of m le duc and his family all the men trooped in in the wake of pierre the entire hillock was now a blaze of lightlurid and red and flickeringalternately teased and fanned and subdued by the gale so that at times every object stood out clearly cut every blade of grass every stone in bold relief and in the ruts and fissures every tiny pool of muddy water shimmered like strings of fireopals whilst at others a pall of inky darkness smokeladen and impenetrable would lie over the ground and erase the outline of farmbuildings and distant mill and of the pushing and struggling mass of humanity inside the barn  but pierre heedless of light and darkness of heat or of cold proceeded quietly and methodically to distribute the primitive implements of warfare to this crowd of ignorant men who were by now over ready for mischief and with every weapon which he placed in willing hands he found the right words for willing earswords which would kindle passion and lust of vengeance most readily where they lay dormant or would fan them into greater vigour where they smouldered  for thee this scythe hector lebrun he would say to a tall lanky youth whose emaciated arms and bony hands were stretched with longing toward the bright piece of steel remember last years harvest the heavy tax thou wert forced to pay so that not one sou of profit went into thy pocket and thy mother starved whilst m le duc and his brood feasted and danced and shiploads of corn were sunk in the loire lest abundance made bread too cheap for the poor  for thee this pickaxe henri meunier remember the new roof on thy hut which thou didst build to keep the wet off thy wifes bed who was crippled with agueand the heavy impost levied on thee by the taxcollector for this improvement to thy miserable hovel  this pole for thee charles blanc remember the beating administered to thee by the ducs bailiff for daring to keep a tame rabbit to amuse thy children  remember remember mes amis he added exultantly remember every wrong you have endured every injustice every blow remember your poverty and his wealth your crusts of dry bread and his succulent meals your rags and his silks and velvets remember your starving children and ailing mother your careladen wife and toilworn daughters forget nothing mes amis tonight and at the gates of the château de kernogan demand of its arrogant owner wrong for wrong and outrage for outrage  a deafening cry of triumph greeted this peroration scythes and sickles and axes and poles were brandished in the air and several scores of hands were stretched out to pierre and clasped in this newlyformed bond of vengeful fraternity   iii  then it was that with vigorous play of the elbows jean adet the miller forced his way through the crowd till he stood face to face with his son  unfortunate he cried what is all this what dost thou propose to do whither are ye all going  to kernogan they all shouted in response  en avant pierre we follow cried some of them impatiently  but jean adetwho was a powerful man despite his yearshad seized pierre by the arm and dragged him to a distant corner of the barn  pierre he said in tones of command i forbid thee in the name of thy duty and the obedience which thou dost owe to me and to thy mother to move another step in this hotheaded adventure i was on the highroad walking homewards when that conflagration and the senseless cries of these poor lads warned me that some awful mischief was afoot pierre my son i command thee to lay that weapon down  but pierrewho in his normal state was a dutiful son and sincerely fond of his fathershook himself free from jean adets grasp  father he said loudly and firmly this is no time for interference we are all of us men here and know our own minds what we mean to do tonight we have thought on and planned for weeks and months i pray you father let me be i am not a child and i have work to do  not a child exclaimed the old man as he turned appealingly to the lads who had stood by silent and sullen during this little scene not a child but you are all only children my lads you dont know what you are doing you dont know what terrible consequences this mad escapade will bring upon us all upon the whole village aye and the countryside do you suppose for one moment that the château of kernogan will fall at the mercy of a few ignorant unarmed lads like yourselves why four hundred of you would not succeed in forcing your way even as far as the courtyard of the palace m le duc has had wind for some time of your turbulent meetings at the auberge he has kept an armed guard inside his castle yard for weeks past a company of artillery with two guns hoisted upon his walls my poor lads you are running straight to ruin go home i beg of you forget this nights escapade nothing but misery to you and yours can result from it  they listened quietly if surlily to jean adets impassioned words far be it from their thoughts to flout or to mock him paternal authority commanded respect even among the most rough but they all felt that they had gone too far now to draw back the savour of anticipated revenge had been too sweet to be forgone quite so readily and pierre with his vigorous personality his glowing eloquence his compelling power had more influence over them than the sober counsels of prudence and the wise admonitions of old jean adet not one word was spoken but with an instinctive gesture every man grasped his weapon more firmly and then turned to pierre thus electing him their spokesman  pierre too had listened in silence to all that his father said striving to hide the burning anxiety which was gnawing at his heart lest his comrades allowed themselves to be persuaded by the old mans counsels and their ardour be cooled by the wise dictates of prudence but when jean adet had finished speaking and pierre saw each man thus grasping his weapon all the more firmly and in silence a cry of triumph escaped his lips  it is all in vain father he cried our minds are made up a host of angels from heaven would not bar our way now to victory and to vengeance  pierre admonished the old man  it is too late my father said pierre firmly en avant lads  yes en avant en avant assented some we have wasted too much time as it is  but unfortunate lads admonished the old man what are you going to doa handful of youwhere are you going  we go straight to the crossroads now father said pierre firmly the firing of your ricksfor which i humbly crave your pardonis the preconcerted signal which will bring the lads from all the neighbouring villagesfrom goulaine and les sorinières and doulon and tournebride to our meeting place never you fear there will be more than four hundred of us and a company of paid soldiers is not like to frighten us eh lads  no no en avant they shouted and murmured impatiently there has been too much talking already and we have wasted precious time  pierre entreated the miller  but no one listened to the old man now a general movement down the hillock had already begun and pierre turning his back on his father had pushed his way to the front of the crowd and was now leading the way down the slope up on the summit the fire was already burning low only from time to time an imprisoned tongue of flame would dart out of the dying embers and leap fitfully up into the night a dull red glow illumined the small farmery and the mill and the slowly moving mass of men along the narrow road whilst clouds of black dense smoke were tossed about by the gale pierre walked with head erect he ceased to think of his father and he never looked back to see if the others followed him he knew that they did like the strawricks a while ago they had become the prey of a consuming fire the fire of their own passion which had caught them and held them and would not leave them now until their ardour was consumed in victory or defeat   iv  m le duc de kernogan had just finished dinner when jacques labrunière his headbailiff came to him with the news that a rabble crowd composed of the peasantry of goulaine and vertou and the neighbouring villages had assembled at the crossroads there held revolutionary speeches and was even now marching toward the castle still shouting and singing and brandishing a miscellaneous collection of weapons chiefly consisting of scythes and axes  the guard is under arms i imagine was m le ducs comment on this not altogether unforeseen piece of news  everything is in perfect order replied the headbailiff cooly for the defence of m le duc and his propertyand of mademoiselle  m le duc who had been lounging in one of the big armchairs in the stately hall of kernogan jumped to his feet at these words his cheeks suddenly pallid and a look of deadly fear in his eyes  mademoiselle he said hurriedly by gd labrunière i had forgottenmomentarily  m le duc stammered the bailiff in anxious inquiry  mademoiselle de kernogan is on her way homeeven nowshe spent the day with mme le marquise dherbignacshe was to return at about eight oclock if those devils meet her carriage on the road  there is no cause for anxiety m le duc broke in labrunière hurriedly i will see that half a dozen men get to horse at once and go and meet mademoiselle and escort her home  yes  yes  labrunière murmured the duc who seemed very much overcome with terror now that his daughters safety was in jeopardy see to it at once quick quick i shall wax crazy with anxiety  while labrunière ran to make the necessary arrangements for an efficient escort for mademoiselle de kernogan and gave the sergeant in charge of the posse the necessary directions m le duc remained motionless huddled up in the capacious armchair his head buried in his hand shivering in front of the huge fire which burned in the monumental hearth himself the prey of nameless overwhelming terror  he knewnone betterthe appalling hatred wherewith he and all his family and belongings were regarded by the local peasantry astride upon his manifold rightsfeudal territorial seignorial rightshe had all his life ridden roughshod over the prejudices the miseries the undoubted rights of the poor people who were little better than serfs in the possession of the high and mighty duc de kernogan he also knewnone betterthat gradually very gradually it is true but with unerring certainty those same downtrodden ignorant miserable and halfstarved peasants were turning against their oppressors that riots and outrages had occurred in many rural districts in the north and that the insidious poison of social revolution was gradually creeping toward the south and west and had already infected the villages and small townships which were situated quite unpleasantly close to nantes and to kernogan  for this reason he had kept a company of artillery at his own expense inside the precincts of his château and with the aristocrats open contempt for this peasantry which it had not yet learned to fear he had disdained to take further measures for the repression of local gatherings and would not pay the village rabble the compliment of being afraid of them in any way  but with his daughter yvonne in the open roadway on the very night when an assembly of that same rabble was obviously bent on mischief matters became very serious insult outrage or worse might befall the proud aristocrats only child and knowing that from these people whom she had been taught to look upon as little better than beasts she could expect neither mercy nor chivalry the duc de kernogan within his unassailable castle felt for his daughters safety the most abject the most deadly fear which hath ever unnerved any man  labrunière a few minutes later did his best to reassure his master  i have ordered the men to take the best horses out of the stables m le duc he said and to cut across the fields toward la gramoire so as to intercept mademoiselles coach ere it reach the crossroads i feel confident that there is no cause for alarm he added emphatically  pray god you are right labrunière murmured the duc feebly do you know how strong the rabble crowd is  no monseigneur not exactly camille the underbailiff who brought me the news was riding homewards across the meadows about an hour ago when he saw a huge conflagration which seemed to come from the back of adets mill the whole sky has been lit up by a lurid light for the past hour and i fancied myself that adets straw must be on fire but camille pushed his horse up the rising ground which culminates at adets farmery it seems that he heard a great deal of shouting which did not seem to be accompanied by any attempt at putting out the fire so he dismounted and led his horse round the hillock skirting adets farm buildings so that he should not be seen under cover of darkness he heard and saw the old miller with his son pierre engaged in distributing scythes poles and axes to a crowd of youngsters and haranguing them wildly all the time he also heard pierre adet speak of the conflagration as a preconcerted signal and say that he and his mates would meet the lads of the neighbouring villages at the crossroads  and that four hundred of them would then march on kernogan and pillage the castle  bah quoth m le duc in a voice hoarse with execration and contempt a lot of oafs who will give the hangman plenty of trouble tomorrow as for that adet and his son they shall suffer for this  i can promise them that if only mademoiselle were home he added with a heartrending sigh   v  indeed had m le duc de kernogan been gifted with second sight the agony of mind which he was enduring would have been aggravated an hundredfold at the very moment when the headbailiff was doing his best to reassure his liegelord as to the safety of mlle de kernogan her coach was speeding along from the château of herbignac toward those same crossroads where a couple of hundred hotheaded peasant lads were planning as much mischief as their unimaginative minds could conceive  the fury of the gale had in no way abated and now a heavy rain was fallinga drenching sopping rain which in the space of half an hour had added five centimetres to the depth of the mud on the roads and had in that same space of time considerably damped the enthusiasm of some of the poor lads three score or so had assembled from goulaine two score from les sorinières some three dozen from doulon they had rallied to the signal in hot haste gathered their scythes and spades very eager and excited and had reached the crossroads which were much nearer to their respective villages than to jean adets farm and the mill even while the old man was admonishing his son and the lads of vertou on the summit of the blazing hillock here they had spent half an hour in cooling their heels and their tempers under the drenching rainwet to the skinfuming and fretting at the delay  but even sodamped in ardour and chilled to the marrowthey were still a dangerous crowd and prudence ought to have dictated to mademoiselle de kernogan the wiser course of ordering her coachman jeanmarie to head his horses back toward herbignac the moment that the outrider reported that a mob armed with scythes spades and axes held the crossroads and that it would be dangerous for the coach to advance any further  already for the past few minutes the sound of loud shouting had been heard even above the tramp of the horses and the clatter of the coach jeanmarie had pulled up and sent one of the outriders on ahead to see what was amiss the man returned with very unpleasant tidingsin his opinion it certainly would be dangerous to go any further the mob appeared bent on mischief he had heard threats and curses all levelled against m le duc de kernoganthe conflagration up at vertou was evidently a signal which would bring along a crowd of malcontents from all the neighbouring villages he was for turning back forthwith but mademoiselle put her head out of the window just then and asked what was amiss on hearing that jeanmarie and the postilion and outriders were inclined to be afraid of a mob of peasant lads who had assembled at the crossroads and were apparently threatening to do mischief she chided them for their cowardice  jeanmarie she called scornfully to the old coachman who had been in her fathers service for close on half a century do you really mean to tell me that you are afraid of that rabble  why no mademoiselle so please you replied the old man nettled in his pride by the taunt but the temper of the peasantry round here has been ugly of late and tis your safety i have got to guard  tis my commands you have got to obey retorted mademoiselle with a gay little laugh which mitigated the peremptoriness of her tone if my father should hear that theres trouble on the road he will die of anxiety if i do not return so whip up the horses jeanmarie no one will dare to attack the coach  but mademoiselle remonstrated the old man  ah çà she broke in more impatiently am i to be openly disobeyed best join that rabble jeanmarie if you have no respect for my commands  thus twitted by mademoiselles sharp tongue jeanmarie could not help but obey he tried to peer into the distance through the veil of blinding rain which beat against his face and stung the horses to restlessness but the light from the coach lanthorns prevented his seeing clearly into the darkness beyond still it seemed to him that on ahead a dense and solid mass was moving toward the coach also that the sound of shouting and of excited humanity was considerably nearer than it had been before no doubt the mob had perceived the lights of the coach and was even now making towards it with what intent jeanmarie divined all too accurately  but he had his orders and though he was an old and trusted servant disobedience these days was not even to be thought of so he did as he was bid he whipped up his horses which were highspirited and answered to the lash with a bound and a plunge forward mlle de kernogan leaned back on the cushions of the coach she was satisfied that jeanmarie had done as he was told and she was not in the least afraid  but less than five minutes later she had a rude awakening the coach gave a terrific lurch the horses reared and plunged there was a deafening clamour all around men were shouting and cursing there was the clash of wood and iron and the cracking of whips the tramp of horses hoofs in the soft ground and the dull thud of human bodies falling in the mud followed by loud cries of pain there was the sudden crash of broken glass the coach lanthorns had been seized and broken it seemed to yvonne de kernogan that out of the darkness faces distorted with fury were peering at her through the windowpanes but through all the confusion the coach kept moving on jeanmarie stuck to his post as did also the postilion and the four outriders and with whip and tongue they urged their horses to break through the crowd regardless of human lives knocking and trampling down men and lads heedless of curses and blasphemies which were hurled on them and on the occupants of the coach whoever they might be  the next moment however the coach came to a sudden halt and a wild cry of triumph drowned the groans of the injured and the dying  kernogan kernogan was shouted from every side  adet adet  you limbs of satan cried jeanmarie youll rue this nights work and weep tears of blood for the rest of your lives let me tell you that mademoiselle is in the coach when m le duc hears of this there will be work for the hangman  mademoiselle in the coach broke in a hoarse voice with a rough tone of command lets look at her  aye aye lets have a look at mademoiselle came with a volley of objurgations and curses from the crowd  you devilsyou would dare protested jeanmarie  within the coach yvonne de kernogan hardly dared to breathe she sat bolt upright her cape held tightly round her shoulders her eyes dilated now with excitement if not with fear were fixed upon the darkness beyond the windowpanes she could see nothing but she felt the presence of that hostile crowd who had succeeded in overpowering jeanmarie and were intent on doing her harm  but she belonged to a caste which never reckoned cowardice amongst its many faults during these few moments when she knew that her life hung on the merest thread of chance she neither screamed nor fainted but sat rigidly still her heart beating in unison with the agonising seconds which went so fatefully by and even now when the carriage door was torn violently open and even through the darkness she discerned vaguely the forms of these avowed enemies close beside her and anon felt a rough hand seize her wrist she did not move but said quite calmly with hardly a tremor in her voice  who are you and what do you want  an outburst of harsh and ironical laughter came in response  who are we my fine lady said the foremost man in the crowd he who had seized her wrist and was half in and half out of the coach at this moment we are the men who throughout our lives have toiled and starved whilst you and such as you travel in fine coaches and eat your fill what we want why just the spectacle of such a fine lady as you are being knocked down into the mud just as our wives and daughters are if they happen to be in the way when your coach is passing isnt that it mes amis  aye aye they replied shouting lustily into the mud with the fine lady out with her adet lets have a look at mademoiselle how she will look with her face in the mud out with her quick  but the man who was still half in and half out of the coach and who had hold of mademoiselles wrist did not obey his mates immediately he drew her nearer to him and suddenly threw his rough begrimed arms round her and with one hand pulled back her hood then placing two fingers under her chin he jerked it up till her face was level with his own  yvonne de kernogan was certainly no coward but at the loathsome contact of this infuriated and vengeful creature she was overcome with such a hideous sense of fear that for the moment consciousness almost left her not completely alas for though she could not distinguish his face she could feel his hot breath upon her cheeks she could smell the nauseating odour of his damp clothes and she could hear his hoarse mutterings as for the space of a few seconds he held her thus close to him in an embrace which to her was far more awesome than that of death  and just to punish you my fine lady he said in a whisper which sent a shudder of horror right through her to punish you for what you are the brood of tyrants proud disdainful a budding tyrant yourself to punish you for every misery my mother and sister have had to endure for every luxury which you have enjoyed i will kiss you on the lips and the cheeks and just between your white throat and chin and never as long as you live if you die this night or live to be an hundred will you be able to wash off those kisses showered upon you by one who hates and loathes youa miserable peasant whom you despise and who in your sight is lower far than your dogs  yvonne with eyes closed hardly breathed but through the veil of semiconsciousness which mercifully wrapped her senses she could still hear those awful words and feel the pollution of those loathsome kisses with whichtrue to his threatthis creaturehalf man wholly devil whom she could not see but whom she hated and feared as she would satan himselfnow covered her face and throat  after that she remembered nothing more consciousness mercifully forsook her altogether when she recovered her senses she was within the precincts of the castle a confused murmur of voices reached her ears and her fathers arms were round her gradually she distinguished what was being said she gathered the threads of the story which jeanmarie and the postilion and outriders were hastily unravelling in response to m le ducs commands  these men of course knew nothing of the poignant little drama which had been enacted inside the coach all they knew was that they had been surrounded by a rough crowda hundred or so strongwho brandished scythes and spades that they had made valiant efforts to break through the crowd by whipping up their horses but that suddenly some of those devils more plucky than the others seized the horses by their bits and rendered poor jeanmarie quite helpless he thought then that all would be up with the lot of them and was thinking of scrambling down from his box in order to protect mademoiselle with his body and the pistols which he had in the boot when happily for every one concerned he heard in the distanceabove the clatter which that abominable rabble was making the hurried tramp of horses at once he jumped to the conclusion that these could be none other than a company of soldiers sent by m le duc this spurred him to a fresh effort and gave him a new idea to carmail the postilion who had a pistol in his holster he gave the peremptory order to fire a shot into the air or into the crowd jeanmarie cared not which this carmail did and at once the horses already maddened by the crowd plunged and reared wildly shaking themselves free jeanmarie however had them well in hand and from far away there came the cries of encouragement from the advancing horsemen who were bearing down on them full tilt the next moment there was a general mêlée jeanmarie saw nothing save his horses heads but the outriders declared that men were trampled down like flies all around while others vanished into the night  what happened after that none of the men knew or cared jeanmarie galloped his horses all the way to the castle and never drew rein until the precincts were reached   vi  had m de kernogan had his way and a free hand to mete out retributive justice in the proportion that he desired there is no doubt that the hangman of nantes would have been kept exceedingly busy as it was a number of arrests were effected the following dayhalf the manhood of the countryside was implicated in the aborted jacquerie and the city prison was not large enough to hold it all  a court of justice presided over by m le duc and composed of half a dozen men who were directly or indirectly in his employ pronounced summary sentences on the rioters which were to have been carried out as soon as the necessary arrangements for such wholesale executions could be made nantes was turned into a city of wailing peasantwomenmothers sisters daughters wives of the condemned trooped from their villages into the city loudly calling on m le duc for mercy besieging the improvised courthouse the prison gates the town residence of m le duc the palace of the bishop they pushed their way into the courtyards and the very corridors of those buildingsflunkeys could not cope with themthey fought with fists and elbows for the right to make a direct appeal to the liegelord who had power of life and death over their men  the municipality of nantes held aloof from this distressful state of things and the town councillors the city functionaries and their families shut themselves up in their houses in order to avoid being a witness to the heartrending scenes which took place uninterruptedly round the courthouse and the prison the mayor himself was powerless to interfere but it is averred that he sent a secret courier to paris to m de mirabeau who was known to be a personal friend of his with a detailed account of the jacquerie and of the terrible measures of reprisal contemplated by m le duc de kernogan together with an earnest request that pressure from the highest possible quarters be brought to bear upon his grace so that he should abate something of his vengeful rigours  poor king louis who in these days was being terrorised by the national assembly and swept off his feet by the eloquence of m de mirabeau was only too ready to make concessions to the democratic spirit of the day he also desired his noblesse to be equally ready with such concessions he sent a personal letter to m le duc not only asking him but commanding him to show grace and mercy to a lot of misguided peasant lads whose loyalty and adherencehe urgedmight be won by a gracious and unexpected act of clemency  the kings commands could not in the nature of things be disobeyed the same stroke of the pen which was about to send half a hundred young countrymen to the gallows granted them m le ducs gracious pardon and their liberty the only exception to this general amnesty being pierre adet the son of the miller m le ducs servants had deposed to seeing him pull open the door of the coach and stand for some time half in and half out of the carriage obviously trying to terrorise mademoiselle mademoiselle refused either to corroborate or to deny this statement but she had arrived fainting at the gate of the château and she had been very ill ever since she had sustained a serious shock to her nerves so the doctor hastily summoned from paris had averred and it was supposed that she had lost all recollection of the terrible incidents of that night  but m le duc was satisfied that it was pierre adets presence inside the coach which had brought about his daughters mysterious illness and that heartrending look of nameless horror which had dwelt in her eyes ever since therefore with regard to that man m le duc remained implacable and as a concession to a fathers outraged feelings both the mayor of nantes and the city functionaries accepted adets condemnation without a murmur of dissent  the sentence of death finally passed upon pierre the son of jean adet miller of vertou could not however be executed for the simple reason that pierre had disappeared and that the most rigorous search instituted in the neighbourhood and for miles around failed to bring him to justice one of the outriders who had been in attendance on mademoiselle on that fateful night declared that when jeanmarie finally whipped up his horses at the approach of the party of soldiers adet fell backwards from the step of the carriage and was run over by the hind wheels and instantly killed but his body was never found among the score or so which were left lying there in the mud of the road until the women and old men came to seek their loved ones among the dead  pierre adet had disappeared but m le ducs vengeance had need of a prey the outrage which he was quite convinced had been perpetrated against his daughter must be punished by deathif not by the death of the chief offender then by that of the one who stood nearest to him thus was jean adet the miller dragged from his home and cast into prison was he not implicated himself in the riots camille the bailiff had seen and heard him among the insurgents on the hillock that night at first it was stated that he would be held as hostage for the reappearance of his son but pierre adet had evidently fled the countryside he was obviously ignorant of the terrible fate which his own folly had brought upon his father many thought that he had gone to seek his fortune in paris where his talents and erudition would ensure him a good place in the present mad rush for equality amongst all men certain it is that he did not return and that with merciless hate and vengeful relentlessness m le duc de kernogan had jean adet hanged for a supposed crime said to be committed by his son  jean adet died protesting his innocence but the outburst of indignation and revolt aroused by this crying injustice was swamped by the torrent of the revolution which gathering force by these very acts of tyranny and of injustice soon swept innocent and guilty alike into a vast whirlpool of blood and shame and tears     book one bath 1793  chapter i  the moor   i  silence loneliness desolation  and the darkness of late afternoon in november when the fog from the bristol channel has laid its pall upon moor and valley and hill the last grey glimmer of a wintry sunset has faded in the west earth and sky are wrapped in the gloomy veils of oncoming night some little way ahead a tiny light flickers feebly  surely we cannot be far now  a little more patience mounzeer twenty minutes and we be there  twenty minutes mordieu and i have ridden since the morning and you tell me it was not far  not far mounzeer but we be not orzemen either of us we doant travel very fast  how can i ride fast on this heavy beast and in this satané mud my horse is up to his knees in it and i am wetah wet to my skin in this sacré fog of yours  the other made no reply indeed he seemed little inclined for conversation his whole attention appeared to be riveted on the business of keeping in his saddle and holding his horses head turned in the direction in which he wished it to go he was riding a yard or two ahead of his companion and it did not need any assurance on his part that he was no horseman he sat very loosely in his saddle his broad shoulders bent his head thrust forward his knees turned out his hands clinging alternately to the reins and to the pommel with that ludicrous inconsequent gesture peculiar to those who are wholly unaccustomed to horse exercise  his attitude in fact as well as the promiscuous set of clothes which he worea labourers smock a battered high hat threadbare corduroys and fishermans bootsat once suggested the loafer the donothing who hangs round the yards of halfway houses and posting inns on the chance of earning a few coppers by an easy job which does not entail too much exertion on his part and which will not take him too far from his favourite haunts when he spokewhich was not oftenthe soft burr in the pronunciation of the sibilants betrayed the westcountryman  his companion on the other hand was obviously a stranger high of stature and broadly built his wide shoulders and large hands and feet his square head set upon a short thick neck all bespoke the physique of a labouring man whilst his townmade clotheshis heavy caped coat admirably tailored his buckskin breeches and boots of fine leathersuggested if not absolutely the gentleman at any rate one belonging to the welltodo classes though obviously not quite so inexperienced in the saddle as the other man appeared to be he did not look very much at home in the saddle either he held himself very rigid and upright and squared his shoulders with a visible effort at seeming at ease like a townsman out for a constitutional on the fashionable promenade of his own city or a cavalry subaltern but lately emerged from a riding school he spoke english quite fluently even colloquially at times but with a marked gallic accent   ii  the road along which the two cavaliers were riding was unspeakably lonely and desolatean offshoot from the main bath to weston road it had been quite a good secondary road once the accounts of the county administration under date 1725 go to prove that it was completed in that year at considerable expense and with stone brought over for the purpose all the way from draycott quarries and for twenty years after that a coach used to ply along it between chelwood and redhill as well as two or three carriers and of course there was all the traffic in connexion with the stanton markets and the norton fairs but that was nigh on fifty years ago now and somehowonce the mailcoach was discontinuedit had never seemed worth while to keep the road in decent repair it had gone from bad to worse since then and travelling on it these days either ahorse or afoot had become very unpleasant it was full of ruts and crevasses and kneedeep in mud as the stranger had very appositely remarked and the stone parapet which bordered it on either side and which had once given it such an air of solidity and of value was broken down in very many places and threatened soon to disappear altogether  the country round was as lonely and desolate as the road and that sense of desolation seemed to pervade the very atmosphere right through the darkness which had descended on upland and valley and hill though nothing now could be seen through the gloom and the mist the senses were conscious that even in broad daylight there would be nothing to see loneliness dwelt in the air as well as upon the moor there were no homesteads for miles around no cattle grazing no pastures no hedges nothingjust arid wasteland with here and there a group of stunted trees or an isolated yew and tracts of rough coarse grass not nearly good enough for cattle to eat  there are vast stretches of upland equally desolate in many parts of europenotably in northern spainbut in england where they are rare they seem to gain an additional air of loneliness through the very life which pulsates in their vicinity this bit of somersetshire was one of them in this year of grace 1793 despite the proximity of bath and its fashionable life its gaieties and vitality distant only a little over twenty miles and of bristol distant less than thirty it had remained wild and forlorn almost savage in its grim isolation primitive in the grandeur of its solitude   iii  the road at the point now reached by the travellers begins to slope in a gentle gradient down to the level of the chew a couple of miles further on it was midway down this slope that the only sign of living humanity could be perceived in that tiny light which glimmered persistently the air itself under its mantle of fog had become very still only the water of some tiny moorland stream murmured feebly in its stony bed ere it lost its entity in the bosom of the river far away  five more minutes and we be at th bottom inn quoth the man who was ahead in response to another impatient ejaculation from his companion  if we dont break our necks meanwhile in this confounded darkness retorted the other for his horse had just stumbled and the inexperienced rider had been very nearly pitched over into the mud  i be as anxious to arrive as you are mounzeer observed the countryman laconically  i thought you knew the way muttered the stranger  ave i not brought you safely through the darkness retorted the other you was pretty well ztranded at chelwood mounzeer or i be much mistaken who else would ave brought you out ere at this time o night id like to knowand in this weather too you wanted to get to th bottom inn and didnt know ow to zet about it none o the gaffers up to chelwood peared eager to elp you when i come along well ive brought you to th bottom inn and whoa whoa my beauty whoa confound you whoa  and for the next moment or two the whole of his attention had perforce to be concentrated on the business of sticking to his saddle whilst he brought his faggedout illconditioned nag to a standstill  the little glimmer of light had suddenly revealed itself in the shape of a lanthorn hung inside the wooden porch of a small house which had loomed out of the darkness and the fog it stood at an angle of the road where a narrow lane had its beginnings ere it plunged into the moor beyond and was swallowed up by the allenveloping gloom the house was small and ugly square like a box and built of grey stone its front flush with the road its rear flanked by several small outbuildings above the porch hung a plain signboard bearing the legend the bottom inn in white letters upon a black ground to right and left of the porch there was a window with closed shutters and on the floor above two more windowsalso shutteredcompleted the architectural features of the bottom inn  it was uncompromisingly ugly and uninviting for beyond the faint glimmer of the lanthorn only one or two narrow streaks of light filtrated through the chinks of the shutters   iv  the travellers after some difference of opinion with their respective horses contrived to pull up and to dismount without any untoward accident the stranger looked about him peering into the darkness the place indeed appeared dismal and inhospitable enough its solitary aspect suggested footpads and the abode of cutthroats the silence of the moor the pall of mist and gloom that hung over upland and valley sent a shiver through his spine  you are sure this is the place he queried  cant ye zee the zign retorted the other gruffly  can you hold the horses while i go in  i doant know as ow i can mounzeer ive never eld two orzes all at once suppose they was to start kickin or thought o runnin away  running away you fool muttered the stranger whose temper had evidently suffered grievously during the weary cold journey from chelwood ill break your satané head if anything happens to the beasts how can i get back to bath save the way i came do you think i want to spend the night in this godforsaken hole  without waiting to hear any further protests from the lout he turned into the porch and with his riding whip gave three consecutive raps against the door of the inn followed by two more the next moment there was the sound of a rattling of bolts and chains the door was cautiously opened and a timid voice queried  is it mounzeer  pardieu who else growled the stranger open the door woman i am perished with cold  with an unceremonious kick he pushed the door further open and strode in a woman was standing in the dimly lighted passage as the stranger walked in she bobbed him a respectful curtsey  it is all right mounzeer she said the captains in the coffeeroom he came over from bristol early this afternoon  no one else here i hope he queried curtly  no one zir it aint their hour not yet youll ave the ouse to yourself till after midnight after that therell be a bustle i reckon two shiploads come into watchet last nightbrandy and cloth mounzeer so the captain says and worth a mint o money the pack orzes will be through yere in the small hours  thats all right then send me in a bite and a mug of hot ale  ill see to it mounzeer  and stayhave you some sort of stabling where the man can put the two horses up for an hours rest  aye aye zir  very well then see to that too and see that the horses get a feed and a drink and give the man something to eat  very good mounzeer this way zir ill see the man presently straight down the passage zir the coffeeroom is on the right the captains there waiting for ye  she closed the front door carefully then followed the stranger to the door of the coffeeroom outside an anxious voice was heard muttering a string of inconsequent and wholly superfluous whoas of a truth the two wearied nags were only too anxious for a little rest     chapter ii  the bottom inn   i  a man was sitting huddled up in the inglenook of the small coffeeroom sipping hot ale from a tankard which he had in his hand  anything less suggestive of a rough seafaring life than his appearance it would be difficult to conceive and how he came by the appellation the captain must for ever remain a mystery he was small and spare with thin delicate face and slender hands though dressed in very rough garments he was obviously ill at ease in them his narrow shoulders scarcely appeared able to bear the weight of the coarsely made coat and his thin legs did not begin to fill the big fishermans boots which reached midway up his lean thighs his hair was lank and plentifully sprinkled with grey he wore it tied at the nape of the neck with a silk bow which certainly did not harmonise with the rest of his clothing a widebrimmed felt hat something the shape of a sailors but with higher crownof the shape worn by the peasantry in brittanylay on the bench beside him  when the stranger entered he had greeted him curtly speaking in french  the room was inexpressibly stuffy and reeked of the fumes of stale tobacco stale victuals and stale beer but it was warm and the stranger stiff to the marrow and wet to the skin uttered an exclamation of wellbeing as he turned to the hearth wherein a bright fire burned cheerily he had put his hat down when first he entered and had divested himself of his big coat now he held one foot and then the other to the blaze and tried to infuse new life into his numbed hands  the captain took scant notice of his comings and goings he did not attempt to help him off with his coat nor did he make an effort to add another log to the fire he sat silent and practically motionless save when from time to time he took a sip out of his mug of ale but whenever the newcomer came within his immediate circle of vision he shot a glance at the latters elegant attirethe wellcut coat the striped waistcoat the boots of fine leatherthe glance was quick and comprehensive and full of scorn a flash that lasted only an instant and was at once veiled again by the droop of the flaccid lids which hid the pale keen eyes  when the woman has brought me something to eat and drink the stranger said after a while we can talk i have a good hour to spare as those miserable nags must have some rest  he too spoke in french and with an air of authority not to say arrogance which caused the captains glance of scorn to light up with an added gleam of hate and almost of cruelty but he made no remark and continued to sip his ale in silence and for the next halfhour the two men took no more notice of one another just as if they had never travelled all those miles and come to this desolate spot for the sole purpose of speaking with one another during the course of that halfhour the woman brought in a dish of mutton stew a chunk of bread a piece of cheese and a jug of spiced ale and placed them on the table all of these good things the stranger consumed with an obviously keen appetite when he had eaten and drunk his fill he rose from the table drew a bench into the inglenook and sat down so that his profile only was visible to his friend the captain  now citizen chauvelin he said with at attempt at ease and familiarity not unmixed with condescension i am ready for your news   ii  chauvelin had winced perceptibly both at the condescension and the familiarity it was such a very little while ago that men had trembled at a look a word from him his silence had been wont to strike terror in quaking hearts it was such a very little while ago that he had been president of the committee of public safety all powerful the right hand of citizen robespierre the master sleuthhound who could track an unfortunate suspect down to his most hidden lair before whose keen pale eyes the innermost secrets of a soul stood revealed who guessed at treason ere it was wholly born who scented treachery ere it was formulated a year ago he had with a word sent scores of men women and children to the guillotinehe had with a sign brought the whole machinery of the ruthless committee to work against innocent or guilty alike on mere suspicion or to gratify his own hatred against all those whom he considered to be the enemies of that bloody revolution which he had helped to make now his presence his silence had not even the power to ruffle the selfassurance of an upstart  but in the hard school both of success and of failure through which he had passed during the last decade there was one lesson which armand once marquis de chauvelin had learned to the last letter and that was the lesson of selfcontrol he had winced at the others familiarity but neither by word nor gesture did he betray what he felt  i can tell you he merely said quite curtly all i have to say in far less time than it has taken you to eat and drink citizen adet  but suddenly at sound of that name the other had put a warning hand on chauvelins arm even as he cast a rapid anxious look all round the narrow room  hush man he murmured hurriedly you know quite well that that name must never be pronounced here in england i am martinroget now he added as he shook off his momentary fright with equal suddenness and once more resumed his tone of easy condescension and try not to forget it  chauvelin without any haste quietly freed his arm from the others grasp his pale face was quite expressionless only the thin lips were drawn tightly over the teeth now and a curious hissing sound escaped faintly from them as he said  ill try and remember citizen that here in england you are an aristo the same as all these confounded english whom may the devil sweep into a bottomless sea  martinroget gave a short complacent laugh  ah he said lightly no wonder you hate them citizen chauvelin you too were an aristo here in england oncenot so very long ago i am thinkingspecial envoy to his majesty king george whatuntil failure to bring one of these satané britishers to book made you  er  well made you what you are now  he drew up his tall broad figure as he spoke and squared his massive shoulders as he looked down with a fatuous smile and no small measure of scorn on the hunchedup little figure beside him it had seemed to him that something in the nature of a threat had crept into chauvelins attitude and he still flushed with his own importance his immeasurable belief in himself at once chose to measure his strength against this man who was the personification of failure and disgracethis man whom so many people had feared for so long and whom it might not be wise to defy even now  no offence meant citizen chauvelin he added with an air of patronage which once more made the other wince i had no wish to wound your susceptibilities i only desired to give you timely warning that what i do here is no ones concern and that i will brook interference and criticism from no man  and chauvelin who in the past had oft with a nod sent a man to the guillotine made no reply to this arrogant taunt his small figure seemed to shrink still further within itself and anon he passed his thin clawlike hand over his face as if to obliterate from its surface any expression which might war with the utter humility wherewith he now spoke  nor was there any offence meant on my part citizen martinroget he said suavely do we not both labour for the same end the glory of the republic and the destruction of her foes  martinroget gave a sigh of satisfaction the battle had been won he felt himself strong againstronger than before through that very act of deference paid to him by the once allpowerful chauvelin now he was quite prepared to be condescending and jovial once again  of course of course he said pleasantly as he once more bent his tall figure to the fire we are both servants of the republic and i may yet help you to retrieve your past failures citizen by giving you an active part in the work i have in hand and now he added in a calm businesslike manner the manner of a master addressing a servant who has been found at fault and is taken into favour again let me hear your news  i have made all the arrangements about the ship said chauvelin quietly  ah that is good news indeed what is she  she is a dutch ship her master and crew are all dutch  thats a pity a danish master and crew would have been safer  i could not come across any danish ship willing to take the risks said chauvelin dryly  well and what about this dutch ship then  she is called the hollandia and is habitually engaged in the sugar trade but her master does a lot of contrabandmore that than fair trading i imagine anyway he is willing for the sum you originally named to take every risk and incidentally to hold his tongue about the whole business  for two thousand francs  yes  and he will run the hollandia into le croisic  when you command  and there is suitable accommodation on board her for a lady and her woman  i dont know what you call suitable said chauvelin with a sarcastic tone which the other failed or was unwilling to note and i dont know what you call a lady the accommodation available on board the hollandia will be sufficient for two men and two women  and her masters name queried martinroget  some outlandish dutch name replied chauvelin it is spelt k u y p e r the devil only knows how it is pronounced  well and does captain  k u y p e r understand exactly what i want  he says he does the hollandia will put into portishead on the last day of this month you and your guests can get aboard her any day after that you choose she will be there at your disposal and can start within an hour of your getting aboard her master will have all his papers ready he will have a cargo of west indian sugar on boarddestination amsterdam consignee mynheer van smeereverything perfectly straight and square french aristos émigrés on board on their way to join the army of the princes there will be no difficulty in england  and none in le croisic the man is running no risks  he thinks he is france does not make dutch ships and dutch crews exactly welcome just now does she  certainly not but in le croisic and with citizen adet on board  i thought that name was not to be mentioned here retorted chauvelin dryly  you are right citizen whispered the other it escaped me and  already he had jumped to his feet his face suddenly pale his whole manner changed from easy arrogant selfassurance to uncertainty and obvious dread he moved to the window trying to subdue the sound of his footsteps upon the uneven floor   iii  are you afraid of eavesdroppers citizen roget queried chauvelin with a shrug of his narrow shoulders  no there is no one there only a lout from chelwood who brought me here the people of the house are safe enough they have plenty of secrets of their own to keep  he was obviously saying all this in order to reassure himself for there was no doubt that his fears were on the alert with a febrile gesture he unfastened the shutters and pushed them open peering out into the night  hallo he called  but he received no answer  it has started to rain he said more calmly i imagine that lout has found shelter in an outhouse with the horses  very likely commented chauvelin laconically  then if you have nothing more to tell me quoth martinroget i may as well think about getting back rain or no rain i want to be in bath before midnight  ball or supperparty at one of your duchesses queried the other with a sneer i know them  to this martinroget vouchsafed no reply  how are things at nantes he asked  splendid carrier is like a wild beast let loose the prisons are overfull the surplus of accused condemned and suspect fills the cellars and warehouses along the wharf priests and suchlike trash are kept on disused galliots up stream the guillotine is never idle and friend carrier fearing that she might give outget tired whator break downhas invented a wonderful way of getting rid of shoals of undesirable people at one magnificent swoop you have heard tell of it no doubt  yes i have heard of it remarked the other curtly  he began with a load of priests requisitioned an old barge ordered baudet the shipbuilder to construct half a dozen portholes in her bottom baudet demurred he could not understand what the order could possibly mean but foucaud and lambertycarriers agentsyou know themexplained that the barge would be towed down the loire and then up one of the smaller navigable streams which it was feared the royalists were preparing to use as a way for making a descent upon nantes and that the idea was to sink the barge in midstream in order to obstruct the passage of their army baudet satisfied put five of his men to the task everything was ready on the 16th of last month i know the woman pichot who keeps a small tavern opposite la sécherie she saw the barge glide up the river toward the galliot where twentyfive priests of the diocese of nantes had been living for the past two months in the company of rats and other vermin as noxious as themselves most lovely moonlight there was that night the loire looked like a living ribbon of silver foucaud and lamberty directed operations and carrier had given them full instructions they tied the calotins up two and two and transferred them from the galliot to the barge it seems they were quite pleased to go had enough of the rats i presume the only thing they didnt like was being searched some had managed to secrete silver ornaments about their person when they were arrested crucifixes and such like they didnt like to part with these it seems but foucaud and lamberty relieved them of everything but the necessary clothing and they didnt want much of that seeing whither they were going foucaud made a good pile so they say selfseeking avaricious brute hell learn the way to one of carriers barges too one day ill bet  he rose and with quick footsteps moved to the table there was some ale left in the jug which the woman had brought for martinroget a while ago chauvelin poured the contents of it down his throat he had talked uninterruptedly in short jerky sentences without the slightest expression of horror at the atrocities which he recounted his whole appearance had become transfigured while he spoke gone was the urbane manner which he had learnt at courts long ago gone was the last instinct of the gentleman sunk to proletarianism through stress of circumstances or financial straits or even political convictions the erstwhile marquis de chauvelinenvoy of the republic at the court of st jameshad become citizen chauvelin in deed and in fact a part of that rabble which he had elected to serve one of that vile crowd of bloodthirsty revolutionaries who had sullied the pure robes of liberty and of fraternity by spattering them with blood now he smacked his lips wiped his mouth with his sleeve and burying his hands in the pockets of his breeches he stood with legs wide apart and a look of savage satisfaction settled upon his pale face martinroget had made no comment upon the narrative he had resumed his seat by the fire and was listening attentively now while the other drank and paused he showed no sign of impatience but there was something in the look of the bent shoulders in the rigidity of the attitude in the large square hands tightly clasped together which suggested the deepest interest and an intentness that was almost painful  i was at the woman pichots tavern that night resumed chauvelin after a while i saw the bargea moving coffin whatgliding down stream towed by the galliot and escorted by a small boat the floating battery at la samaritaine challenged her as she passed for carrier had prohibited all navigation up or down the loire until further notice foucaud lamberty fouquet and osullivan the armourer were in the boat they rowed up to the pontoon and vailly the chief gunner of the battery challenged them once more however they had some sort of written authorisation from carrier for they were allowed to pass vailly remained on guard he saw the barge glide further down stream it seems that the moon on that time was hidden by a cloud but the night was not dark and vailly watched the barge till she was out of sight she was towed past trentemoult and chantenay into the wide reach of the river just below cheviré where as you know the loire is nearly two thousand feet wide  once more he paused looking down with grim amusement on the bent shoulders of the other man  well  chauvelin laughed the query sounded choked and hoarse whether through horror excitement or mere impatient curiosity it were impossible to say  well he retorted with a careless shrug of the shoulders i was too far up stream to see anything and vailly saw nothing either but he heard so did others who happened to be on the shore close by  what did they hear  the hammering replied chauvelin curtly when the portholes were knocked open to let in the flood of water and the screams and yells of five and twenty drowning priests  not one of them escaped i suppose  not one  once more chauvelin laughed he had a way of laughingjust like thatin a peculiar mirthless derisive manner as if with joy at another mans discomfiture at anothers material or moral downfall there is only one language in the world which has a word to express that type of mirth the word is schadenfreude  it was chauvelins turn to triumph now he had distinctly perceived the signs of an inward shudder which had gone right through martinrogets spine he had also perceived through the mans bent shoulders his silence his rigidity that his soul was filled with horror at the story of that abominable crime which hechauvelinhad so blandly retailed and that he was afraid to show the horror which he felt and the man who is afraid can never climb the ladder of success above the man who is fearless   iv  there was silence in the low raftered room for awhile silence only broken by the crackling and sizzling of damp logs in the hearth and the taptapping of a loosely fastened shutter which sounded weird and ghoulish like the knocking of ghosts against the windowframe martinroget bending still closer to the fire knew that chauvelin was watching him and that chauvelin had triumphed fordespite failure despite humiliation and disgracethat mans heart and will had never softened he had remained as merciless as fanatical as before and still looked upon every sign of pity and humanity for a victim of that bloody revolutionwhich was his child the thing of his creation yet worshipped by him its creatoras a crime against patriotism and against the republic  and martinroget fought within himself lest something he might say or do a look a gesture should give the other man an indication that the horrible account of a hideous crime perpetrated against twentyfive defenceless men had roused a feeling of unspeakable horror in his heart that was the punishment of these callous makers of a ruthless revolutionthat was their hell upon earth that they were doomed to hate and to fear one another every man feeling that the others hand was up against him as it had been against law and order against the guilty and the innocent the rebel and the defenceless every man knowing that the other was always there on the alert ready to pounce like a beast of prey upon any victimfriend comrade brotherwho came within reach of his hand  like many men stronger than himself pierre adetor martinroget as he now called himselfhad been drawn into the vortex of bloodshed and of tyranny out of which now he no longer had the power to extricate himself nor had he any wish to extricate himself he had too many past wrongs to avenge too much injustice on the part of fate and circumstance to make good to wish to draw back now that a newlyfound power had been placed in the hands of men such as he through the revolt of an entire people the sickening sense of horror which a moment ago had caused him to shudder and to turn away in loathing from chauvelin was only like the feeble flicker of a light before it wholly dies downthe light of something purer early lessons of childhood former ideals earlier aspirations now smothered beneath the passions of revenge and of hate  and he would not give chauvelin the satisfaction of seeing him wince he was himself ashamed of his own weakness he had deliberately thrown in his lot with these men and he was determined not to fall a victim to their denunciations and to their jealousies so now he made a great effort to pull himself together to bring back before his mind those memorypictures of past tyranny and oppression which had effectually killed all sense of pity in his heart and it was in a tone of perfect indifference which gave no loophole to chauvelins sneers that he asked after awhile  and was citizen carrier altogether pleased with the result of his patriotic efforts  oh quite replied the other he has no ones orders to take he is proconsulvirtual dictator in nantes and he has vowed that he will purge the city from all save its most deserving citizens the cargo of priests was followed by one of malefactors nightbirds cutthroats and such like that is where carriers patriotism shines out in all its glory it is not only priests and aristos you seeother miscreants are treated with equal fairness  yes i see he is quite impartial remarked martinroget coolly  quite retorted chauvelin as he once more sat down in the inglenook and leaning his elbows upon his knees he looked straight and deliberately into the other mans face and added slowly you will have no cause to complain of carriers want of patriotism when you hand over your bag of birds to him  this time martinroget had obviously winced and chauvelin had the satisfaction of seeing that his thrust had gone home though martinrogets face was in shadow there was something now in his whole attitude in the clasping and unclasping of his large square hands which indicated that the man was labouring under the stress of a violent emotion in spite of this he managed to say quite coolly what do you mean exactly by that citizen chauvelin  oh replied the other you know well enough what i meani am no fool what or the revolution would have no use for me if after my many failures she still commands my services and employs me to keep my eyes and ears open it is because she knows that she can count on me i do keep my eyes and ears open citizen adet or martinroget whatever you like to call yourself and also my mindand i have a way of putting two and two together to make four there are few people in nantes who do not know that old jean adet the miller was hanged four years ago because his son pierre had taken part in some kind of open revolt against the tyranny of the cidevant duc de kernogan and was not there to take his punishment himself i knew old jean adet i was on the place du bouffay at nantes when he was hanged  but already martinroget had jumped to his feet with a muttered blasphemy  have done man he said roughly have done and he started pacing up and down the narrow room like a caged panther snarling and showing his teeth whilst his rough toilworn hands quivered with the desire to clutch an unseen enemy by the throat and to squeeze the life out of him think you he added hoarsely that i need reminding of that  no i do not think that citizen replied chauvelin calmly i only desired to warn you  warn me of what  nervous agitated restless martinroget had once more gone back to his seat his hands were trembling as he held them up mechanically to the blaze and his face was the colour of lead in contrast with his restlessness chauvelin appeared the more calm and bland  why should you wish to warn me asked the other querulously but with an attempt at his former overbearing manner what are my affairs to youwhat do you know about them  oh nothing nothing citizen martinroget replied chauvelin pleasantly i was only indulging the fancy i spoke to you about just now of putting two and two together in order to make four the chartering of a smugglers craftaristos on board herher ostensible destination hollandher real objective le croisic le croisic is now the port for nantes and we dont bring aristos into nantes these days for the object of providing them with a featherbed and a competence what  and retorted martinroget quietly if your surmises are correct citizen chauvelin what then  oh nothing replied the other indifferently only  take care citizen  that is all  take care of what  of the man who brought me chauvelin to ruin and disgrace  oh i have heard of that legend before now said martinroget with a contemptuous shrug of the shoulders the man they call the scarlet pimpernel you mean  why yes  what have i to do with him  i dont know but remember that i myself have twice been after that man here in england that twice he slipped through my fingers when i thought i held him so tightly that he could not possibly escape and that twice in consequence i was brought to humiliation and to shame i am a marked man nowthe guillotine will soon claim me for her future use your affairs citizen are no concern of mine but i have marked that scarlet pimpernel for mine own i wont have any blunderings on your part give him yet another triumph over us all  once more martinroget swore one of his favourite oaths  by satan and all his brood man he cried in a passion of fury have done with this interference have done i say i have nothing to do i tell you with your satané scarlet pimpernel my concern is with  with the duc de kernogan broke in chauvelin calmly and with his daughter i know that well enough you want to be even with them over the murder of your father i know that too all that is your affair but beware i tell you to begin with the secrecy of your identity is absolutely essential to the success of your plan what  of course it is but  but nevertheless your identity is known to the most astute the keenest enemy of the republic  impossible asserted martinroget hotly  the duc de kernogan  bah he had never the slightest suspicion of me think you his high and mightiness in those faroff days ever looked twice at a village lad so that he would know him again four years later i came into this country as an émigré stowed away in a smugglers ship like a bundle of contraband goods i have papers to prove that my name is martinroget and that i am a banker from brest the worthy bishop of brestdenounced to the committee of public safety for treason against the republicwas given his life and a safe conduct into spain on the condition that he gave memartinrogetletters of personal introduction to various highborn émigrés in holland in germany and in england armed with these i am invulnerable i have been presented to his royal highness the regent and to the élite of english society in bath i am the friend of m le duc de kernogan now and the accredited suitor for his daughters hand  his daughter broke in chauvelin with a sneer and his pale keen eyes had in them a spark of malicious mockery  martinroget made no immediate retort to the sneer a curious hot flush had spread over his forehead and his ears leaving his cheeks wan and livid  what about the daughter reiterated chauvelin  yvonne de kernogan has never seen pierre adet the millers son replied the other curtly she is now the affianced wife of martinroget the millionaire banker of brest tonight i shall persuade m le duc to allow my marriage with his daughter to take place within the week i shall plead pressing business in holland and my desire that my wife shall accompany me thither the duke will consent and yvonne de kernogan will not be consulted the day after my wedding i shall be on board the hollandia with my wife and fatherinlaw and together we will be on our way to nantes where carrier will deal with them both  you are quite satisfied that this plan of yours is known to no one that no one at the present moment is aware of the fact that pierre adet the millers son and martinroget banker of brest are one and the same  quite satisfied replied martinroget emphatically  very well then let me tell you this citizen rejoined chauvelin slowly and deliberately that in spite of what you say i am as convinced as that i am here alive that your real identity will be knownif it is not known alreadyto a gentleman who is at this present moment in bath and who is known to you to me to the whole of france as the scarlet pimpernel  martinroget laughed and shrugged his shoulders  impossible he retorted pierre adet no longer exists  he never existed  much anyhow he ceased to be on that stormy day in september 1789 unless your pet enemy is a wizard he cannot know  there is nothing that my pet enemyas you call himcannot ferret out if he has a mind to beware of him citizen martinroget beware i tell you  how can i laughed the other contemptuously if i dont know who he is  if you did retorted chauvelin it wouldnt help you  much but beware of every man you dont know beware of every stranger you meet trust no one above all follow no one he is there where you least expect him under a disguise you would scarcely dream of  tell me who he is thensince you know himso that i may duly beware of him  no rejoined chauvelin with the same slow deliberation i will not tell you who he is knowledge in this case would be a very dangerous thing  dangerous to whom  to yourself probably to me and to the republic most undoubtedly no i will not tell you who the scarlet pimpernel is but take my advice citizen martinroget he added emphatically go back to paris or to nantes and strive there to serve your country rather than run your head into a noose by meddling with things here in england and running after your own schemes of revenge  my own schemes of revenge exclaimed martinroget with a hoarse cry that was like a snarl it seemed as if he wanted to say something more but that the words choked him even before they reached his lips the hot flush died down from his forehead and his face was once more the colour of lead he took up a log from the corner of the hearth and threw it with a savage defiant gesture into the fire  somewhere in the house a clock struck nine   v  martinroget waited until the last echo of the gong had died away then he said very slowly and very quietly  forgo my own schemes of revenge can you even remotely guess citizen chauvelin what it would mean to a man of my temperament and of my calibre to give up that for which i have toiled and striven for the past four years think of what i was on that day when a conglomeration of adverse circumstances turned our proposed expedition against the château de kernogan into a disaster for our village lads and a triumph for the duc i was knocked down and crushed all but to death by the wheels of mlle de kernogans coach i managed to crawl in the mud and the cold and the rain on my hands and knees hurt bleeding half dead as far as the presbytery of vertou where the curé kept me hidden at risk of his own life for two days until i was able to crawl farther away out of sight the curé did not know i did not know then of the devilish revenge which the duc de kernogan meant to wreak against my father the news reached me when it was all over and i had worked my way to paris with the few sous in my pocket which that good curé had given me earning bed and bread as i went along i was an ignorant lout when i arrived in paris i had been one of the cidevant kernogans labourershis chattel whatlittle better or somewhat worse off than a slave there i heard that my father had been foully murderedhung for a crime which i was supposed to have committed for which i had not even been tried then the change in me began for four years i starved in a garret toiling like a galleyslave with my hands and muscles by day and at my books by night and what am i now i have worked at books at philosophy at science i am a man of education i can talk and discuss with the best of those dd aristos who flaunt their caprices and their mincing manners in the face of the outraged democracy of two continents i speak englishalmost like a nativeand danish and german too i can quote english poets and criticise m de voltaire i am an aristo what for this i have worked citizen chauvelinday and nightoh those nights how i have slaved to make myself what i now am and all for the one objectthe sole object without which existence would have been absolutely unendurable that object guided me helped me to bear and to toil it cheered and comforted me to be even one day with the duc de kernogan and with his daughter to be their master to hold them at my mercy to destroy or pardon as i choose to be the arbiter of their fate i have worked for four years now my goal is in sight and you talk glibly of forgoing my own schemes of revenge believe me citizen chauvelin he concluded it would be easier for me to hold my right hand into those flames until it hath burned to a cinder than to forgo the hope of that vengeance which has eaten into my soul it would hurt much less  he had spoken thus at great length but with extraordinary restraint never once did he raise his voice or indulge in gesture he spoke in even monotonous tones like one who is reciting a lesson and he sat straight in front of the fire his elbow on his knee his chin resting in his hand and his eyes fixed upon the flames  chauvelin had listened in perfect silence the scorn the resentful anger the illconcealed envy of the fallen man for the successful upstart had died out of his glance martinrogets story the intensity of feeling betrayed in that absolute outward calm had caused a chord of sympathy to vibrate in the others atrophied heart how well he understood that vibrant passion of hate that longing to exact an eye for an eye an outrage for an outrage was not his own life given over now to just such a longinga mad aching desire to be even once with that hated enemy that maddening mocking elusive scarlet pimpernel who had fooled and baffled him so often   vi  some few moments had gone by since martinrogets harsh monotonous voice had ceased to echo through the low raftered room silence had fallen between the two menthere was indeed nothing more to say the one had unburthened his overfull heart and the other had understood they were of a truth made to understand one another and the silence between them betokened sympathy  around them all was still the stillness of a mistladen night in the house no one stirred the shutter even had ceased to creak only the crackling of the wood fire broke that silence which soon became oppressive  martinroget was the first to rouse himself from this trancelike state wherein memory was holding such ruthless sway he brought his hands sharply down on his knees turned to look for a moment on his companion gave a short laugh and finally rose saying briskly the while  and now citizen i shall have to bid you adieu and make my way back to bath the nags have had the rest they needed and i cannot spend the night here  he went to the door and opening it called a loud hallo there  the same woman who had waited on him on his arrival came slowly down the stairs in response  the man with the horses commanded martinroget peremptorily tell him ill be ready in two minutes  he returned to the room and proceeded to struggle into his heavy coat chauvelin as before making no attempt to help him he sat once more huddled up in the inglenook hugging his elbows with his thin white hands there was a smile half scornful but not wholly dissatisfied around his bloodless lips when martinroget was ready to go he called out quietly after him  the hollandia remember at portishead on the last day of the month captain  k u y p e r  quite right replied martinroget laconically im not like to forget  he then picked up his hat and riding whip and went out   vii  outside in the porch he found the woman bending over the recumbent figure of his guide  he be azleep mounzeer she said placidly fast azleep i do believe  asleep cried martinroget roughly well soon see about waking him up  he gave the man a violent kick with the toe of his boot the man groaned stretched himself turned over and rubbed his eyes the light of the swinging lanthorn showed him the wrathful face of his employer he struggled to his feet very quickly after that  stir yourself man cried martinroget savagely as he gripped the fellow by the shoulder and gave him a vigorous shaking bring the horses along now and dont keep me waiting or therell be trouble  all right mounzeer all right muttered the man placidly as he shook himself free from the uncomfortable clutch on his shoulder and leisurely made his way out of the porch  havent you got a boy or a man who can give that lout a hand with those sacré horses queried martinroget impatiently he hardly knows a horses head from its tail  no zir ive no one tonight replied the woman gently my man and my son they be gone down to watchet to elp with the cargo and the packorzes they wont be ere neither till after midnight but she added more cheerfully i can straighten a saddle if you want it  thats all right thenbut  he paused suddenly for a loud cry of hallo well im  rang through the night from the direction of the rear of the house the cry expressed both surprise and dismay  what the  is it called martinroget loudly in response  the orzes  what about them  to this there was no reply and with a savage oath and calling to the woman to show him the way martinroget ran out in the direction whence had come the cry of dismay he fell straight into the arms of his guide who promptly set up another cry more dismal more expressive of bewilderment than the first  they be gone he shouted excitedly  who have gone queried the frenchman  the orzes  the horses what in  do you mean  the orzes have gone mounzeer there was no door to the ztables and they be gone  youre a fool growled martinroget who of a truth had not taken in as yet the full significance of the mans jerky sentences horses dont walk out of the stables like that they cant have done if you tied them up properly  i didnt tie them up protested the man i didnt know ow to tie the beastly nags up and there was no one to elp me i didnt think theyd walk out like that  well if theyre gone youll have to go and get them back somehow thats all said martinroget whose temper by now was beyond his control and who was quite ready to give the lout a furious thrashing  get them back mounzeer wailed the man ow can i in the dark too besides if i did come nose to nose wi em i shouldnt know ow to get em would you mounzeer he added with bland impertinence  i shall know how to lay you out you satané idiot growled martinroget if i have to spend the night in this hole  he strode on in the darkness in the direction where a little glimmer of light showed the entrance to a wide barn which obviously was used as a rough stabling he stumbled through a yard and over a miscellaneous lot of rubbish it was hardly possible to see ones hands before ones eyes in the darkness and the fog the woman followed him offering consolation in the shape of a seat in the coffeeroom whereon to pass the night for indeed she had no bed to spare and the man from chelwood brought up the rearstill ejaculating cries of astonishment rather than distress  you are that careless man the woman admonished him placidly and i give you a lanthorn and all for to look after your orzes properly  but you didnt give me a and for to tie em up in their stalls and give em their feed drat em i ate orzes and all to do with em  didnt you give em the feed i give you for em then  no i didnt think you id go into one o them narrow stalls and get kicked for my pains  then they was ungry pore things she concluded and went out after the ay whats just outside i dont know ow youll ever get em back in this fog  there was indeed no doubt that the nags had made their way out of the stables in that irresponsible fashion peculiar to animals and that they had gone astray in the dark there certainly was no sound in the night to denote their presence anywhere near  well get em all right in the morning remarked the woman with her exasperating placidity  tomorrow morning exclaimed martinroget in a passion of fury and what the dl am i going to do in the meanwhile  the woman reiterated her offers of a seat by the fire in the coffeeroom  the men wont mind ye zir she said heaps of em are frenchies like yourself and ill tell em you aint a spying on em  its no more than five mile to chelwood said the man blandly and maybe you get a better shakedown there  a fivemile tramp growled martinroget whose wrath seemed to have spent itself before the hopelessness of his situation in this fog and gloom and kneedeep in mud therell be a sovereign for you woman he added curtly if you can give me a clean bed for the night  the woman hesitated for a second or two  well a zovereign is tempting zir she said at last you shall ave my sons bed i know ed rather ave the zovereign if e was ever zo tired this way zir she added as she once more turned toward the house mind them urdles there  and where am i goin to zleep called the man from chelwood after the two retreating figures  ill look after the man for you zir said the woman for a matter of a shillin e can sleep in the coffeeroom and ill give im is breakfast too  not one farthing will i pay for the idiot retorted martinroget savagely let him look after himself  he had once more reached the porch without another word and not heeding the protests and curses of the unfortunate man whom he had left standing shelterless in the middle of the yard he pushed open the front door of the house and once more found himself in the passage outside the coffeeroom  but the woman had turned back a little before she followed her guest into the house and she called out to the man in the darkness  you may zleep in any of them outhouses and welcome and zure therell be a bit o porridge for ye in the mornin  think ye ill stop came in a furious growl out of the gloom and conduct that dd frogeater back to chelwood no fear five miles aint nothin to me and e can keep the miserable shillin ed ave give me for my pains let im get is orzes back izelf and get to chelwood as best e can im off and you can tell im zo from me itll make im sleep all the better i reckon  the woman was obviously not of a disposition that would ever argue a matter of this sort out she had done her best she reckoned both for master and man and if they chose to quarrel between themselves that was their business and not hers  so she quietly went into the house again barred and bolted the door and finding the stranger still waiting for her in the passage she conducted him to a tiny room on the floor above  my sons room mounzeer she said i ope as ow yell be comfortable  it will do all right assented martinroget is the captain sleeping in the house tonight he added as with an afterthought  only in the coffeeroom mounzeer i couldnt give im a bed the captain will be leaving with the pack orzes a couple of hours before dawn shall i tell im you be ere  no no he replied promptly dont tell him anything i dont want to see him again and hell be gone before im awake i reckon  that e will zir most like goodnight zir  goodnight andmindthat lout gets the two horses back again for my use in the morning i shall have to make my way to chelwood as early as may be  aye aye zir assented the woman placidly it were no use she thought to upset the mounzeers temper once more by telling him that his guide had decamped time enough in the morning when she would be less busy  and my john can see im as far as chelwood she thought to herself as she finally closed the door on the stranger and made her way slowly down the creaking stairs     chapter iii  the assembly rooms   i  the sigh of satisfaction was quite unmistakable  it could be heard from end to end from corner to corner of the building it sounded above the din of the orchestra who had just attacked with vigour the opening bars of a schottische above the brouhaha of moving dancers and the froufrou of skirts it travelled from the small octagon hall through the central salon to the tearoom the ballroom and the cardroom it reverberated from the gallery in the ballroom to the maids gallery it distracted the ladies from their gossip and the gentlemen from their cards  it was a universal heartfelt ah of intense and pleasurable satisfaction  sir percy blakeney and his lady had just arrived it was close on midnight and the ball had positively languished what was a ball without the presence of sir percy his royal highness too had been expected earlier than this but it was not thought that he would come at all despite his promise if the spoilt pet of bath society remained unaccountably absent and the assembly rooms had worn an air of woe even in the face of the gaily dressed throng which filled every vast room in its remotest angle  but now sir percy blakeney had arrived just before the clocks had struck midnight and exactly one minute before his royal highness drove up himself from the royal apartments lady blakeney was looking more radiant and beautiful than ever before so everyone remarked when a few moments later she appeared in the crowded ballroom on the arm of his royal highness and closely followed by my lord anthony dewhurst and by sir percy himself who had the young duchess of flintshire on his arm  what do you mean you incorrigible rogue her grace was saying with playful severity to her cavalier by coming so late to the ball another two minutes and you would have arrived after his royal highness himself and how would you have justified such solecism i would like to know  by swearing that thoughts of your grace had completely addled my poor brain he retorted gaily and that in the mental contemplation of such charms i forgot time place social duties everything  even the homage due to truth she laughed cannot you for once in your life be serious sir percy  impossible dear lady whilst your dainty hand rests upon mine arm   ii  it was not often that his royal highness graced bath with his presence and the occasion was made the excuse for quite exceptional gaiety and brilliancy the new fashions of this memorable year of 1793 had defied the declaration of war and filtrated through from paris london milliners had not been backward in taking the hint and though most of the more starchy dowagers obstinately adhered to the prewar fashionsthe huge hooped skirts stiff stomachers pointed waists voluminous panniers and monumental head erectionsthe young and smart matrons were everywhere to be seen in the new gracefully flowing skirts innocent of steel constructions the high waist line the pouter pigeonlike draperies over their pretty bosoms  her grace of flintshire looked ravishing with her curly fair hair entirely free from powder and lady betty draitunes waist seemed to be nestling under her armpits of course lady blakeney wore the very latest thing in striped silks and gossamerlike muslin and lace and it was hard to enumerate all the pretty débutantes and young brides who fluttered about the assembly rooms this night  and gliding through that motley throng brightplumaged like a swarm of butterflies there were a few figures dressed in sober blacks and greysthe émigrés over from francemen women young girls and gilded youth from out that seething cauldron of revolutionary francewho had shaken the dust of that rampant demagogism from off their buckled shoes taking away with them little else but their lives mostly chary of speech grave in their demeanour bearing upon their wan faces traces of that horror which had seized them when they saw all the traditions of their past tottering around them the proletariat whom they had despised turning against them with all the fury of caged beasts let loose their kindred and friends massacred their king and queen murdered the shelter and security which hospitable england had extended to them had not altogether removed from their hearts the awful sense of terror and of gloom  many of them had come to bath because the more genial climate of the west of england consoled them for the inclemencies of londons fogs received with open arms and with that lavish hospitality which the refugees and the oppressed had already learned to look for in england they had gradually allowed themselves to be drawn into the fashionable life of the gay little city the comtesse de tournai was here and her daughter lady ffoulkes sir andrews charming and happy bride and m paul déroulède and his wifebeautiful juliette déroulède with the strange haunted look in her large eyes as of one who has looked closely on death and m le duc de kernogan with his exquisite daughter whose pretty air of seriousness and of repose sat so quaintly upon her young face but every one remarked as soon as m le duc entered the rooms that m martinroget was not in attendance upon mademoiselle which was quite against the order of things also that m le duc appeared to keep a more sharp eye than usual upon his daughter in consequence and that he asked somewhat anxiously if milor anthony dewhurst was in the room and looked obviously relieved when the reply was in the negative  at which trifling incident every one who was in the know smiled and whispered for m le duc made it no secret that he favoured his own compatriots suit for mademoiselle yvonnes hand rather than that of my lord tonywhichas old euclid has itis absurd   iii  but with the arrival of the royal party m de kernogans troubles began to begin with though m martinroget had not arrived my lord tony undoubtedly had he had come in in the wake of lady blakeney but very soon he began wandering round the room obviously in search of some one immediately there appeared to be quite a conspiracy among the young folk in the ballroom to keep both lord tonys and mlle yvonnes movements hidden from the prying eyes of m le duc and anon his royal highness after a comprehensive survey of the ballroom and a few gracious words to his more intimate circle wandered away to the cardroom and as luck would have it he claimed m le duc de kernogan for a partner at faro  now m le duc was a courtier of the old régime to have disobeyed the royal summons would in his eyes have been nothing short of a crime he followed the royal party to the cardroom and on his way thither had one gleam of comfort in that he saw lady blakeney sitting on a sofa in the octagon hall engaged in conversation with his daughter whilst lord anthony dewhurst was nowhere in sight  however the gleam of comfort was very brief for less than a quarter of an hour after he had sat down at his highness table lady blakeney came into the cardroom and stood thereafter for some little while close beside the princes chair the next hour after that was one of special martyrdom for the anxious father for he knew that his daughter was in all probability sitting out in a specially secluded corner in the company of my lord tony  if only martinroget were here   iv  martinroget with the eagle eyes and the airs of an accredited suitor would surely have intervened when my lord tony in the face of the whole brilliant assembly in the ballroom drew mlle de kernogan into the seclusion of the recess underneath the gallery  my lord tony was never very glib of tongue that peculiar dignified shyness which is one of the chief characteristics of wellbred englishmen caused him to be tonguetied when he had most to say it was just with gesture and an appealing pressure of his hand upon her arm that he persuaded yvonne de kernogan to sit down beside him on the sofa in the remotest and darkest corner of the recess and there she remained beside him silent and grave for a moment or two and stole timid glances from time to time through the veil of her lashes at the finelychiselled expressive face of her young english lover  he was pining to put a question to her and so great was his excitement that his tongue refused him service and she knowing what was hovering on his lips would not help him out but a humorous twinkle in her dark eyes and a faint smile round her lips lit up the habitual seriousness of her young face  mademoiselle  he managed to stammer at last mademoiselle yvonne  you have seen lady blakeney  yes she replied demurely i have seen lady blakeney  and  and  she told you  yes lady blakeney told me many things  she told you that  that in gods name mademoiselle yvonne he added desperately do help me outit is cruel to tease me cant you see that im nearly crazy with anxiety  then she looked up at him her dark eyes glowing and brilliant her face shining with the light of a great tenderness  nay milor she said earnestly i had no wish to tease you but you will own tis a grave and serious step which lady blakeney suggested that i should take i have had no time to think  as yet  but there is no time for thinking mademoiselle yvonne he said naïvely if you will consent oh you will consent will you not he pleaded  she made no immediate reply but gradually her hand which rested upon the sofa stole nearer and then nearer to his and with a quiver of exquisite happiness his hand closed upon hers the tips of his fingers touched the smooth warm palm and poor lord tony had to close his eyes for a moment as his sense of superlative ecstasy threatened to make him faint slowly he lifted that soft white hand to his lips  upon my word yvonne he said with quiet fervour you will never have cause to regret that you have trusted me  i know that well milor she replied demurely  she settled down a shade or two closer to him still  they were now like two birds in a cosy nestsecluded from the rest of the assembly who appeared to them like dreamfigures flitting in some other world that had nothing to do with their happiness the strains of the orchestra who had struck the measure of the first figure of a contredanse sounded like fairymusic distant unreal in their ears only their love was real their joy in one anothers company their hands clasped closely together  tell me she said after awhile how it all came about it is all so terribly sudden  so exquisitely sudden i was prepared of course  but not so soon  and certainly not tonight tell me just how it happened  she spoke english quite fluently with just a charming slight accent which he thought the most adorable thing he had ever heard  you see dear heart he replied and there was a quiver of intense feeling in his voice as he spoke there is a man who not only is the friend whom i love best in all the world but is also the one whom i trust absolutely more than myself two hours ago he sent for me and told me that grave danger threatened youthreatened our love and our happiness and he begged me to urge you to consent to a secret marriage  at once  tonight  and you think this  this friend knew  i know he replied earnestly that he knew or he would not have spoken to me as he did he knows that my whole life is in your exquisite handshe knows that our happiness is somehow threatened by that man martinroget how he obtained that information i could not guess  he had not the time or the inclination to tell me i flew to make all arrangements for our marriage tonight and prayed to godas i have never prayed in my life beforethat you dear heart would deign to consent  how could i refuse when lady blakeney advised she is the kindest and dearest friend i possess she and your friend ought to know one another will you not tell me who he is  i will present him to you dear heart as soon as we are married he replied with awkward evasiveness then suddenly he exclaimed with boyish enthusiasm i cant believe it i cant believe it it is the most extraordinary thing in the world  what is that milor she asked  that you should have cared for me at all for of course you must care or you wouldnt be sitting here with me now  you would not have consented  would you  you know that i do care milor she said in her grave quiet way how could it be otherwise  but i am so stupid and so slow he said naïvely why look at me now my heart is simply bursting with all that i want to say to you but i just cant find the words and i do nothing but talk rubbish and feel how you must despise me  once more that humorous little smile played for a moment round yvonne de kernogans serious mouth she didnt say anything just then but her delicate fingers gave his hand an expressive squeeze  you are not frightened he asked abruptly  frightened of what she rejoined  at the step you are going to take  would i take it she retorted gently if i had any misgivings  oh if you had do you know that even now  he continued clumsily and haltingly now that i have realised just what it will mean to have you  and just what it would mean to me god help meif i were to lose you  well that even now i would rather go through that hell than that you should feel the least bit doubtful or unhappy about it all  again she smiled gently tenderly up into his eager boyish face  the only unhappiness she said gravely that could ever overtake me in the future would be parting from you milor  oh god bless you for that my dear god bless you for that but for pitys sake turn your dear eyes away from me or i vow i shall go crazy with joy men do go crazy with joy sometimes you know and i feel that in another moment i shall stand up and shout at the top of my voice to all the people in the room that within the next few hours the loveliest girl in all the world is going to be my wife  she certainly wont be that if you do shout it at the top of your voice milor for father would hear you and there would be an end to our beautiful adventure  it will be a beautiful adventure wont it he sighed with unconcealed ecstasy  so beautiful my dear lord she replied with gentle earnestness so perfect in fact that i am almost afraid something must happen presently to upset it all  nothing can happen he assured her m martinroget is not here and his royal highness is even now monopolising m le duc de kernogan so that he cannot get away  your friend must be very clever to manipulate so many strings on our behalf  it is long past midnight now sweetheart he said with sudden irrelevance  yes i know i have been watching the time and i have already thought everything out for the best i very often go home from balls and routs in the company of lady ffoulkes and sleep in her house those nights father is always quite satisfied when i do that and tonight he will be doubly satisfied feeling that i shall be taken away from your society lady ffoulkes is in the secret of course so lady blakeney told me and she will be ready for me in a few minutes now shell take me home with her and there i will change my dress and rest for awhile waiting for the happy hour she will come to the church with me and then  oh then oh my dear milor she added suddenly with a deep sigh whilst her whole face became irradiated with a light of intense happiness as you say it is the most wonderful thing in all the worldthisour beautiful adventure together  the parson will be ready at halfpast six dear heart it was the earliest hour that i could secure  after that we go at once to your church and the priest will tie up any loose threads which our english parson failed to make tight after those two ceremonies we shall be very much married shant we and nothing can come between us dear heart can it he queried with a look of intense anxiety on his young face  nothing she replied then she added with a short sigh poor father  dear heart he will only fret for a little while i dont believe he can really want you to marry that man martinroget it is just obstinacy on his part he cant have anything against me really  save of course that i am not clever and that i shall never do anything very big in the world  except to love you yvonne with my whole heart and soul and with every fibre and muscle in me oh ill do that he added with boyish enthusiasm better than anyone else in all the world could do and your father will ill be bound forgive me for stealing you when he sees that you are happy and contented and have everything you want and  and  as usual lord tonys eloquence was not equal to all that it should have expressed he blushed furiously and with a quaint shy gesture passed his large wellshaped hand over his smooth brown hair i am not much i know he continued with a winning air of selfdeprecation and you are far above me as the starsyou are so wonderful so clever so accomplished and i am nothing at all  but  but i have plenty of highborn connexions and i have plenty of money and influential friends  and  and sir percy blakeney who is the most accomplished and finest gentleman in england calls me his friend  she smiled at his eagerness she loved him for his clumsy little ways his halting speech that big loving heart of his which was too full of fine and noble feelings to find vent in mere words  have you ever met a finer man in all the world he added enthusiastically  yvonne de kernogan smiled once more her recollections of sir percy blakeney showed her an elegant man of the world whose mind seemed chiefly occupied on the devising and the wearing of exquisite clothes in the uttering of lively witticisms for the entertainment of his royal friend and the ladies of his entourage it showed her a man of great wealth and vast possessions who seemed willing to spend both in the mere pursuit of pleasures she liked sir percy blakeney well enough but she could not understand clever and charming marguerite blakeneys adoration for her inane and foppish husband nor the wholehearted admiration openly lavished upon him by men like sir andrew ffoulkes my lord hastings and others she would gladly have seen her own dear milor choose a more sober and intellectual friend but then she loved him for his marvellous power of wholehearted friendship for his loyalty to those he cared for for everything in fact that made up the sum total of his winning personality and she pinned her faith on that other mysterious friend whose individuality vastly intrigued her  i am more interested in your anonymous friend she said quaintly than in sir percy blakeney but he too is kindness itself and lady blakeney is an angel i like to think that the happiest days of my lifeour honeymoon my dear lordwill be spent in their house  blakeney has lent me combwich hall for as long as we like to stay there well drive thither directly after the service dear heart and then well send a courier to your father and ask for his blessing and his forgiveness  poor father sighed yvonne again but evidently compassion for the father whom she had elected to deceive did not weigh over heavily in the balance of her happiness her little hand once more stole like a timid and confiding bird into the shelter of his firm grasp   v  in the cardroom at his highness table sir percy blakeney was holding the bank and seemingly luck was dead against him around the various tables the ladies stood about chattering and hindering the players nothing appeared serious tonight not even the capricious chances of hazard  his royal highness was in rare good humour for he was winning prodigiously  her grace of flintshire placed her perfumed and beringed hand upon sir percy blakeneys shoulder she stood behind his chair chattering incessantly in a high flutey treble just like a canary blakeney vowed that she was so ravishing that she had put dame fortune to flight  you have not yet told us sir percy she said roguishly how you came to arrive so late at the ball  alas madam he sighed dolefully twas the fault of my cravat  your cravat  aye indeed you see i spent the whole of today in perfecting my new method for tying a butterfly bow so as to give the neck an appearance of utmost elegance with a minimum of discomfort lady blakeney will bear me out when i say that i set my whole mind to my task was i not busy all day mdear he added making a formal appeal to marguerite who stood immediately behind his highness chair and with her luminous eyes full of merriment and shining with happiness fixed upon her husband  you certainly spent a considerable time in front of the lookingglass she said gaily with two valets in attendance and my lord tony an interested spectator in the proceedings  there now rejoined sir percy triumphantly her ladyships testimony thoroughly bears me out and now you shall see what tony says on the matter tony wheres tony he added as his lazy grey eyes sought the brilliant crowd in the cardroom tony where the devil are you  there was no reply and anon sir percys merry gaze encountered that of m le duc de kernogan who dressed in sober black looked strangely conspicuous in the midst of this throng of brightcoloured butterflies and whose grave eyes as they rested on the gorgeous figure of the english exquisite held a world of contempt in their glance  ah m le duc continued blakeney returning that scornful look with his habitual goodhumoured one i had not noticed that mademoiselle yvonne was not with you else i had not thought of inquiring so loudly for my friend tony  my lord antoine is dancing with my daughter sir percy said the other man gravely in excellent if somewhat laboured english he had my permission to ask her  and is a thrice happy man in consequence retorted blakeney lightly though i fear me m martinrogets wrath will descend upon my poor tonys head with unexampled vigour in consequence  m martinroget is not here this evening broke in the duchess and methought she added in a discreet whisper that my lord tony was all the happier for his absence the two young people have spent a considerable time together under the shadow of the gallery in the ballroom and if i mistake not lord tony is making the most of his time  she talked very volubly and with a slight northcountry brogue which no doubt made it a little difficult for the stranger to catch her every word but evidently m le duc had understood the drift of what she said for now he rejoined with some acerbity  mlle de kernogan is too well educated i hope to allow the attentions of any gentleman against her fathers will  come come m de kernogan here interposed his royal highness with easy familiarity lord anthony dewhurst is the son of my old friend the marquis of atiltone one of our most distinguished families in this country who have helped to make english history he has moreover inherited a large fortune from his mother who was a cruche of crewkerne and one of the richest heiresses in the land he is a splendid fellowa fine sportsman a loyal gentleman his attentions to any young lady however highborn can be but flatteringand i should say welcome to those who have her future welfare at heart  but in response to this gracious tirade m le duc de kernogan bowed gravely and his stern features did not relax as he said coldly  your royal highness is pleased to take an interest in the affairs of my daughter i am deeply grateful  there was a seconds awkward pause for every one felt that despite his obvious respect and deference m le duc de kernogan had endeavoured to inflict a snub upon the royal personage and one or two hotheaded young fops in the immediate entourage even muttered the word impertinence inaudibly through their teeth only his royal highness appeared not to notice anything unusual or disrespectful in m le ducs attitude it seemed as if he was determined to remain goodhumoured and pleasant at any rate he chose to ignore the remark which had offended the ears of his entourage only those who stood opposite to his highness on the other side of the card table declared afterwards that the prince had frowned and that a haughty rejoinder undoubtedly hovered on his lips  be that as it may he certainly did not show the slightest sign of illhumour quite gaily and unconcernedly he scooped up his winnings which sir percy blakeney who held the bank was at this moment pushing towards him  dont go yet m de kernogan he said as the frenchman made a movement to work his way out of the crowd feeling no doubt that the atmosphere round him had become somewhat frigid if not exactly inimical dont go yet i beg of you pardi cant you see that you have been bringing me luck as a rule blakeney who can so well afford to lose has the devils own good fortune but tonight i have succeeded in getting some of my own back from him do not i entreat you break the run of my luck by going  oh monseigneur rejoined the old courtier suavely how can my poor presence influence the gods who of a surety always preside over your highness fortunes  dont attempt to explain it my dear sir quoth the prince gaily i only know that if you go now my luck may go with you and i shall blame you for my losses  oh in that case monseigneur  and with all that blakeney continued his highness once more taking up the cards and turning to his friend remember that we still await your explanation as to your coming so late to the ball  an omission your royal highness rejoined blakeney an absence of mind brought about by your severity and that of her grace the trouble was that all my calculations with regard to the exact adjustment of the butterfly bow were upset when i realised that the set of the present day waistcoat would not harmonise with it less than two hours before i was due to appear at this ball my mind had to make a complete volteface in the matter of cravats i became bewildered lost utterly confused i have only just recovered and one word of criticism on my final efforts would plunge me now into the depths of despair  blakeney you are absolutely incorrigible retorted his highness with a laugh m le duc he added once more turning to the grave frenchman with his wonted graciousness i pray you do not form your judgment on the gilded youth of england by the example of my friend blakeney some of us can be serious when occasion demands you know  your highness is pleased to jest said m de kernogan stiffly what greater occasion for seriousness can there be than the present one true england has never suffered as france is suffering now but she has engaged in a conflict against the most powerful democracy the world has ever known she has thrown down the gauntlet to a set of human beasts of prey who are as determined as they are ferocious england will not emerge victorious from this conflict monseigneur if her sons do not realise that war is not mere sport and that victory can only be attained by the sacrifice of levity and of pleasure  he had dropped into french in response to his highness remark in order to express his thoughts more accurately the princea little bored no doubtseemed disinclined to pursue the subject nevertheless it seemed as if once again he made a decided effort not to show illhumour he even gave a knowing winka winkin the direction of his friend blakeney and of her grace as if to beg them to set the ball of conversation rolling once more along a smoothera less boringpath he was obviously quite determined not to release m de kernogan from attendance near his royal person   vi  as usual sir percy threw himself in the breach filling the sudden pause with his infectious laugh  la he said gaily how beautifully m le duc does talk ffoulkes he added addressing sir andrew who was standing close by ill wager you ten pounds to a pinch of snuff that you couldnt deliver yourself of such splendid sentiments even in your own native lingo  i wont take you blakeney retorted sir andrew with a laugh im no good at peroration  you should hear our distinguished guest m martinroget on the same subject continued sir percy with mock gravity by gad cant he talk i feel a dd worm when he talks about our national levity our insane worship of sport our  our  m le duc he added with becoming seriousness and in atrocious french i appeal to you does not m martinroget talk beautifully  m martinroget replied the duc gravely is a man of marvellous eloquence fired by overwhelming patriotism he is a man who must command respect wherever he goes  you have known him long m le duc queried his royal highness graciously  indeed not very long monseigneur he came over as an émigré from brest some three months ago hidden in a smugglers ship he had been denounced as an aristocrat who was furthering the cause of the royalists in brittany by helping them plentifully with money but he succeeded in escaping not only with his life but also with the bulk of his fortune  ah m martinroget is rich  he is sole owner of a rich banking business in brest monseigneur which has an important branch in america and correspondents all over europe monseigneur the bishop of brest recommended him specially to my notice in a very warm letter of introduction wherein he speaks of m martinroget as a gentleman of the highest patriotism and integrity were i not quite satisfied as to m martinrogets antecedents and present connexions i would not have ventured to present him to your highness  nor would you have accepted him as a suitor for your daughter m le duc cest entendu concluded his highness urbanely m martinrogets wealth will no doubt cover his lack of birth  there are plenty of highborn gentlemen devoted to the royalist cause monseigneur rejoined the duc in his grave formal manner but the most just and purest of causes must at times be helped with money the vendéens in brittany the princes at coblentz are all sorely in need of funds  and m martinroget soninlaw of m le duc de kernogan is more likely to feed those funds than m martinroget the plain business man who has no aristocratic connexions concluded his royal highness dryly but even so m le duc he added more gravely surely you cannot be so absolutely certain as you would wish that m martinrogets antecedents are just as he has told you monseigneur the bishop of brest may have acted in perfect good faith  monseigneur the bishop of brest your highness is a man who has our cause the cause of our king and of our faith as much at heart as i have myself he would know that on his recommendation i would trust any man absolutely he was not like to make careless use of such knowledge  and you are quite satisfied that the worthy bishop did not act under some dire pressure   quite satisfied monseigneur replied the duc firmly what pressure could there be that would influence a prelate of such high integrity as monseigneur the bishop of brest   vii  there was silence for a moment or two during which the heavy bracket clock over the door struck the first hour after midnight his royal highness looked round at lady blakeney and she gave him a smile and an almost imperceptible nod sir andrew ffoulkes had in the meanwhile quietly slipped away  i understand said his royal highness quite gravely turning back to m le duc and i must crave your pardon sir for what must have seemed to you an indiscretion you have given me a very clear exposé of the situation i confess that until tonight it had seemed to meand to all your friends monsieur a trifle obscure in fact it had been my intention to intercede with you in favour of my young friend lord anthony dewhurst who of a truth is deeply enamoured of your daughter  though your highness wishes are tantamount to a command yet would i humbly assert that my wishes with regard to my daughter are based upon my loyalty and my duty to my sovereign king louis xvii whom may god guard and protect and that therefore it is beyond my power now to modify them  may god trounce you for an obstinate fool murmured his highness in english and turning his head away so that the other should not hear him but aloud and with studied graciousness he said  m le duc will you not take a hand at hazard my luck is turning and i have faith in yours we must fleece blakeney tonight he has had satans own luck these past few weeks such good fortune becomes positively revolting  there was no more talk of mlle de kernogan after that indeed her father felt that her future had already been discussed far too freely by all these wellwishers who of a truth were not a little indiscreet he thought that the manners and customs of good society were very peculiar here in this fogridden england what business was it of all these highborn ladies and gentlemenof his royal highness himself for that matterwhat plans he had made for yvonnes future martinroget was bourgeois by birth but he was vastly rich and had promised to pour a couple of millions into the coffers of the royalist army if mlle de kernogan became his wife a couple of millions with more to follow no doubt and a loyal adherence to the royalist cause was worth these days all the blue blood that flowed in my lord anthony dewhursts veins  so at any rate thought m le duc this night while his royal highness kept him at cards until the late hours of the morning     chapter iv  the father   i  it was close on ten oclock now in the morning on the following day and m le duc de kernogan was at breakfast in his lodgings in laura place when a courier was announced who was the bearer of a letter for m le duc  he thought the man must have been sent by martinroget who mayhap was sick seeing that he had not been present at the assembly rooms last night and the duc took the letter and opened it without misgivings he read the address on the top of the letter combwich halla place unknown to him and the first words of the letter dear father and even then he had no misgivings  in fact he had to read the letter through three times before the full meaning of its contents had penetrated into his brain whilst he read he sat quite still and even the hand which held the paper had not the slightest tremor when he had finished he spoke quite quietly to his valet  give the courier a glass of ale frédérick he said and tell him he can go there is no answer andstay he added i want you to go round at once to m martinrogets lodgings and ask him to come and speak with me as early as possible  the valet left the room and m le duc deliberately read through the letter from end to end for the fourth time there was no doubt no possible misapprehension his daughter yvonne de kernogan had eloped clandestinely with my lord anthony dewhurst and had been secretly married to him in the small hours of the morning in the protestant church of st james and subsequently before a priest of her own religion in the priory church of st john the evangelist  she apprised her father of this fact in a few sentences which purported to be dictated by profound affection and filial respect but in which m de kernogan failed to detect the slightest trace of contrition yvonne his yvonne the sole representative now of the old raceeloped like a kitchenwench yvonne his daughter his asset for the future his thing his fortune that which he meant with perfect egoism to sacrifice on the altar of his own beliefs and his own loyalty to the kingship of france yvonne had taken her future in her own hands she knew that her hand her person were the purchase price of so many millions to be poured into the coffers of the royalist cause and she had disposed of both in direct defiance of her fathers will and of her duty to her king and to his cause  yvonne de kernogan was false to her traditions false to her father false to her king and country in the years to come when the chroniclers of the time came to write the histories of the great families that had rallied round their king in the hour of his deadly peril the name of kernogan would be erased from those glorious pages the kernogans will have failed in their duty failed in their loyalty oh the shame of it all the shame  the duc was far too proud a gentleman to allow his valet to see him under the stress of violent emotion but now that he was alone his thin hard facewith that air of gravity which he had transmitted to his daughterbecame distorted with the passion of unbridled fury he tore the letter up into a thousand little pieces and threw the fragments into the fire on the bureau beside him there stood a miniature of yvonne de kernogan painted by hall three years ago and framed in a circlet of brilliants m le ducs eyes casually fell upon it he picked it up and with a violent gesture of rage threw it on the floor and stamped upon it with his heel destroying in this paroxysm of silent fury a work of art worth many hundred pounds  his daughter had deceived him she had also upset all his plans whereby the army of m le prince de condé would have been enriched by a couple of million francs in addition to the shame upon her father she had also brought disgrace upon herself and her good name for she was a minor and this clandestine marriage contracted without her fathers consent was illegal in france illegal everywhere save perhaps in englandof this m de kernogan was not quite sure but he certainly didnt care and in this solemn moment he registered a vow that never as long as he lived would he be reconciled to that english nincompoop who had dared to filch his daughter from him and neveras long as he livedwould he by his consent render the marriage legal and the children born of that wedlock legitimate in the eyes of his countrys laws  a calm akin to apathy had followed his first outbreak of fury he sat down in front of the fire and buried his chin in his hand something of course must be done to get his daughter back if only martinroget were here he would know better how to act would martinroget stick to his bargain and accept the girl for wife now that her fame and honour had been irretrievably tarnished there was the question which the next halfhour would decide m de kernogan cast a feverish anxious look on the clock half an hour had gone by since frédérick went to seek martinroget and the latter had not yet appeared  until he had seen martinroget and spoken with martinroget m de kernogan could decide nothing for one brief mad moment the project had formed itself in his disordered brain to rush down to combwich hall and provoke that impudent englishman who had stolen his daughter to kill him or be killed by him in either case yvonne would then be parted from him for ever but even then the thought of martinroget brought more sober reflection martinroget would see to it martinroget would know what to do after all the outrage had hit the accredited lover just as hard as the father  but why in the name of  did martinroget not come   ii  it was past midday when at last martinroget knocked at the door of m le ducs lodgings in laura place the older man had in the meanwhile gone through every phase of overwhelming emotions the outbreak of unreasoning furywhen like a maddened beast that bites and tears he had broken his daughters miniature and trampled it under foothad been followed by a kind of dull apathy when for close upon an hour he had sat staring into the flames trying to grapple with an awful reality which seemed to elude him all the time he could not believe that this thing had really happened that yvonne his wellbred dutiful daughter who had shown such marvellous courage and presence of mind when the necessity of flight and of exile had first presented itself in the wake of the awful massacres and wholesale executions of her own friends and kindred that she should have elopedlike some flirtatious wenchand outraged her father in this monstrous fashion by a clandestine marriage with a man of alien race and of a heretical religion m de kernogan could not realise it it passed the bounds of possibility the very flames in the hearth seemed to dance and to mock the bare suggestion of such an atrocious transgression  to this gloomy numbing of the senses had succeeded the inevitable morbid restlessness the pacing up and down the narrow room the furtive glances at the clock the frequent orders to frédérick to go out and see if m martinroget was not yet home for frédérick had come back after his first errand with the astounding news that m martinroget had left his lodgings the previous day at about four oclock and had not been seen or heard of since in fact his landlady was very anxious about him and was sorely tempted to see the towncrier on the subject  four times did frédérick have to go from laura place to the bear inn in union street where m martinroget lodged and three times he returned with the news that nothing had been heard of mounzeer yet the fourth timeit was then close on middayhe came back runningthankful to bring back the good tidings since he was tired of that walk from laura place to the bear inn m martinroget had come home he appeared very tired and in rare illhumour but frédérick had delivered the message from m le duc whereupon m martinroget had become most affable and promised that he would come round immediately in fact he was even then treading hard on frédéricks heels   iii  my daughter has gone she left the ball clandestinely last night and was married to lord anthony dewhurst in the small hours of the morning she is now at a place called combwich hallwith him  m le duc de kernogan literally threw these words in martinrogets face the moment the latter had entered the room and frédérick had discreetly closed the door  what what stammered the other vaguely i dont understand what do you mean he added bewildered at the ducs violence tired after his nights adventure and the long ride in the early morning irritable with want of sleep and decent food he stared uncomprehending at the duc who had once more started pacing up and down the room like a caged beast with hands tightly clenched behind his back his eyes glowering both at the newcomer and at the imaginary presence of his most bitter enemythe man who had dared to come between him and his projects for his daughter  martinroget passed his hand across his brow like a man who is not yet fully awake  what do you mean he reiterated hazily  just what i say retorted the other roughly yvonne has eloped with that nincompoop lord anthony dewhurst they have gone through some sort of marriage ceremony together and she writes me a letter this morning to tell me that she is quite happy and contented and spending her honeymoon at a place called combwich hall honeymoon he repeated savagely as if to lash his fury up anew tsha  martinroget on the other hand was not the man to allow himself to fall into a state of frenzy which would necessarily interfere with calm consideration  he had taken the fact in now yvonnes elopement with his english rival the clandestine marriage everything but he was not going to allow his inward rage to obscure his vision of the future he did not spend the next precious secondsas men of his race are wont to doin smashing things around him in raving and fuming and gesticulating no that was not the temper m martinroget was in at this moment when fate and a girls folly were ranging themselves against his plans his friend citizen chauvelin would have envied him his calm in the face of this disaster  whilst m le duc still stormed and raved martinroget sat down quietly in front of the fire rested his chin in his hand and waited for a lull in the other mans paroxysm ere he spoke  from your attitude m le duc he then said quietly hiding obvious sarcasm behind a veil of studied deference from your attitude i gather that your wishes with regard to mlle de kernogan have undergone no modification you would still honour me by desiring that she should become my wife  i am not in the habit of changing my mind said m le duc gruffly he desired the marriage he coveted martinrogets millions for the royalist cause but he had no love for the man all the pride of the kernogans their long line of ancestry rebelled against the thought of a fair descendant of this glorious race being allied to a roturiera bourgeoisa tradesman what and the cause of king and country counted few greater martyrdoms than that of the duc de kernogan whenever he met the banker martinroget on an equal social footing  then there is not much harm done rejoined the latter coolly the marriage is not a legal one it need not even be dissolvedmademoiselle de kernogan is still mademoiselle de kernogan and i her humble and faithful adorer  m le duc paused in his restless walk  you would  he stammered then checked himself turning abruptly away he had some difficulty in hiding the scorn wherewith he regarded the others coolness bourgeois blood was not to be gainsaid the tradesmanor banker whatever he waswho hankered after an alliance with mademoiselle de kernogan and was ready to lay down a couple of millions for the privilegewas not to be deterred from his purpose by any considerations of pride or of honour m le duc was satisfied and reassured but he despised the man for his leniency for all that  the marriage is no marriage at all according to the laws of france reiterated martinroget calmly  no it is not assented the duke roughly  for a while there was silence martinroget seemed immersed in his own thoughts and not to notice the febrile comings and goings of the other man  what we have to do m le duc he said after a while is to induce mlle de kernogan to return here immediately  how are you going to accomplish that sneered the duke  oh i was not suggesting that i should appear in the matter at all rejoined martinroget with a shrug of the shoulders  then how can i   surely  argued the younger man tentatively  you mean   martinroget nodded despite these ambiguous halfspoken sentences the two men had understood one another  we must get her back of course assented the duke who had suddenly become as calm as the other man  there is no harm done reiterated martinroget with slow and earnest emphasis  whereupon the duke completely pacified drew a chair close to the hearth and sat down leaning his elbows on his knees and holding his fine aristocratic hands to the blaze  frédérick came in half an hour later to ask if m le duc would have his luncheon he found the two gentlemen sitting quite close together over the dying embers of a fire that had not been fed for close upon an hour and that prince of valets was glad to note that m le ducs temper had quite cooled down and that he was talking calmly and very affably to m martinroget     chapter v  the nest   i  there are lovely days in england sometimes in november or december days when the departing year strives to make us forget that winter is nigh and autumn smiles gentle and benignant caressing with a still tender kiss the last leaves of the scarlet oak which linger on the boughs and touching up with a vivid brush the evergreen verdure of bay trees of ilex and of yew the sky is of that pale translucent blue which dwellers in the south never see with the soft transparency of an aquamarine as it fades into the misty horizon at midday and at dusk the thrushes sing kiss me quick kiss me quick kiss me quick in the naked branches of old acacias and chestnuts and the robins don their crimson waistcoats and dart in and out among the coppice and through the feathery arms of larch and pine and the sun which tips the prickly points of holly leaves with gold joins in this merry makebelieve that winter is still a very very long way off and that mayhap he has lost his way altogether and is never coming to this balmy beautiful land again  just such a day was the penultimate one of november 1793 when lady anthony dewhurst sat at a desk in the wide bay window of the drawingroom in combwich hall trying to put into a letter to lady blakeney all that her heart would have wished to express of love and gratitude and happiness  three whole days had gone by since that exciting night when before break of day in the dimlylighted old church in the presence of two or three faithful friends she had plighted her troth to lord anthony even whilst other kind friendsincluding his royal highnessformed part of the little conspiracy which kept her father occupied and if necessary would have kept m martinroget out of the way since then her life had been one continuous dream of perfect bliss from the moment when after the second religious ceremony in the roman catholic church she found herself alone in the carriage with milor and felt his armsso strong and yet so tenderclosing round her and his lips pressed to hers in the first masterful kiss of complete possession until this hour when she saw his tall elegant figure hurrying across the garden toward the gate and suddenly turning toward the window whence he knew that she was watching him every hour and every minute had been nothing but unalloyed happiness  even there where she had looked for sorrow and difficulty her path had been made smooth for her her father who she had feared would prove hard and irreconcilable had been tender and forgiving to such an extent that tears almost of shame would gather in her eyes whenever she thought of him  as soon as she arrived at combwich hall she had written a long and deeply affectionate letter to her father imploring his forgiveness for the deception and unfilial conduct which on her part must so deeply have grieved him she pleaded for her right to happiness in words of impassioned eloquence she pleaded for her right to love and to be loved for her right to a home which a husbands devotion would make a paradise for her  this letter she had sent by special courier to her father and the very next day she had his reply she had opened the letter with trembling fingers fearful lest her fathers harshness should mar the perfect serenity of her life she was afraid of what he would say for she knew her father well knew his faults as well as his qualities his pride his obstinacy his unswerving determination and his loyalty to the kings causeall of which must have been deeply outraged by his daughters highhanded action but as she began to read astonishment amazement at once filled her soul she could hardly trust her comprehension hardly believe that what she read could indeed be reality and not just the continuance of the happy dream wherein she was dwelling these days  her fathergently reproachfulhad not one single harsh word to utter he would not he said at the close of his life after so many bitter disappointments stand in the way of his daughters happiness you should have trusted me my child he wrote and indeed yvonne could not believe her eyes i had no idea that your happiness was at stake in this marriage or i should never have pressed the claims of my own wishes in the matter i have only you in the world left now that misery and exile are to be my portion is it likely that i would allow any personal desires to weigh against my love for you  happy as she was yvonne criedcried bitterly with remorse and shame when she read that letter how could she have been so blind so senseless as to misjudge her father so her young husband found her in tears and had much ado to console her he too read the letter and was deeply touched by the kind reference to himself contained therein my lord anthony is a gallant gentleman wrote m le duc de kernogan he will make you happy my child and your old father will be more than satisfied all that grieves me is that you did not trust me sooner a clandestine marriage is not worthy of a daughter of the kernogans  i did speak most earnestly to m le duc said lord tony reflectively when i begged him to allow me to pay my addresses to you but then he added cheerfully i am such a clumsy lout when i have to talk at any lengthand especially clumsy when i have to plead my own cause i suppose i put my case so badly before your father mdear that he thought me three parts an idiot and would not listen to me  i too begged and entreated him dear she said with a smile but he was very determined then and vowed that i should marry m martinroget despite my tears and protestations dear father i suppose he didnt realise that i was in earnest  he has certainly accepted the inevitable very gracefully was my lord tonys final comment   ii  then they read the letter through once more sitting close together he with one arm round her shoulder she nestling against his chest her hair brushing against his lips and with the letter in her hands which she could scarcely read for the tears of joy which filled her eyes  i dont feel very well today the letter concluded the dampness and the cold have got into my bones moreover you two young love birds will not desire company just yet but tomorrow if the weather is more genial i will drive over to combwich in the afternoon and perhaps you will give me supper and a bed for the night send me word by the courier who will forthwith return to bath if this will be agreeable to you both  could anything be more adorable more delightful it was just the last drop that filled yvonnes cup of happiness right up to the brim   iii  the next afternoon she sat at her desk in order to tell lady blakeney all about it she made out a copy of her fathers letter and put that in with her own and begged dear lady blakeney to see lady ffoulkes forthwith and tell her all that had happened she herself was expecting her father every minute and milor tony had gone as far as the gate to see if the barouche was in sight  half an hour later m de kernogan had arrived and his daughter lay in his arms happy beyond the dreams of men he looked rather tired and wan and still complained that the cold had got into his bones evidently he was not very well and yvonne after the excitement of the meeting felt not a little anxious about him as the evening wore on he became more and more silent he hardly would eat anything and soon after eight oclock he announced his desire to retire to bed  i am not ill he said as he kissed his daughter and bade her a fond goodnight only a little wearied  with emotion no doubt i shall be better after a nights rest  he had been quite cordial with my lord tony though not effusive which was only naturalhe was at all times a very reserved man andunlike those of his racenever demonstrative in his manner but with his daughter he had been singularly tender with a wistful affection which almost suggested remorse even though it was she who on his arrival had knelt down before him and had begged for his blessing and his forgiveness   iv  but the following morning he appeared to be really ill his cheeks looked sunken almost livid his eyes dim and hollow nevertheless he would not hear of staying on another day or so  no no he declared emphatically i shall be better in bath it is more sheltered there here the north winds would drive me to my bed very quickly i shall take a course of baths at once they did me a great deal of good before you remember yvonnein september when i caught a chill  they soon put me right that is all that ails me now ive caught a chill  he did his best to reassure his daughter but she was far from satisfied more especially as he hardly would touch the cup of chocolate which she had prepared for him with her own hands  i shall be quite myself again in bath he declared and in a day or two when you can spare the timeor when milor can spare youperhaps you will drive over to see how the old father is getting on eh  indeed she said firmly i shall not allow you to go to bath alone if you will go i shall accompany you  nay he protested that is foolishness my child the barouche will take me back quite comfortably it is less than two hours drive and i shall be quite safe and comfortable  you will be quite safe and comfortable in my company she retorted with a tender anxious glance at his pale face and the nervous tremor of his hands i have consulted with my dear husband and he has given his consent that i should accompany you  but you cant leave milor like that my child he protested once more he will be lonely and miserable without you  yes i think he will she said wistfully but he will be all the happier when you are well again and i can return to combwich satisfied  whereupon m le duc yielded he kissed and thanked his daughter and seemed even relieved at the prospect of her company the barouche was ordered for eleven oclock and a quarter of an hour before that time lord tony had his young wife in his arms bidding her a sad farewell  i hate your going from me sweetheart he said as he kissed her eyes her hair her lips i cannot bear you out of my sight even for an hour  let alone a couple of days  yet i must go dear heart she retorted looking up with that sweet grave smile of hers into his eager young face i could not let him travel alone  could i  no no he assented somewhat dubiously but remember dear heart that you are infinitely precious and that i shall scarce live for sheer anxiety until i have you here safe once more in my arms  ill send you a courier this evening she rejoined as she extricated herself gently from his embrace and if i can come back tomorrow  ill ride over to bath in any case in the morning so that i may escort you back if you really can come  i will come if i am reassured about father oh my dear lord she added with a wistful little sigh i knew yesterday morning that i was too happy and that something would happen to mar the perfect felicity of these last few days  you are not seriously anxious about m le ducs health dear heart  no not seriously anxious farewell milor it is au revoir  a few hours and well resume our dream   v  there was nothing in all that to arouse my lord tonys suspicions all day he was miserable and forlorn because yvonne was not therebut he was not suspicious  fate had a blow in store for him from which he was destined never wholly to recover but she gave him no warning no premonition he spent the day in making up arrears of correspondence for he had a large private fortune to administertrust funds on behalf of brothers and sisters who were minorsand he always did it conscientiously and to the best of his ability the last few days he had lived in a dream and there was an accumulation of business to go through in the evening he expected the promised courier who did not arrive but his was not the sort of disposition that would fret and fume because of a contretemps which might be attributable to the weatherit had rained heavily since afternoonor to sundry trifling causes which he at combwich ten or a dozen miles from bath could not estimate he had no suspicions even then how could he have how could he guess nevertheless when he ultimately went to bed it was with the firm resolve that he would in any case go over to bath in the morning and remain there until yvonne was able to come back with him  combwich without her was anyhow unendurable   vi  he started for bath at nine oclock in the morning it was still raining hard it had rained all night and the roads were very muddy he started out without a groom a little after halfpast ten he drew rein outside his house in chandos buildings and having changed his clothes he started to walk to laura place the rain had momentarily left off and a pale wintry sun peeped out through rolling banks of grey clouds he went round by way of saw close and the upper borough walls as he wanted to avoid the fashionable throng that crowded the neighbourhood of the pump room and the baths his intention was to seek out the blakeneys at their residence in the circus after he had seen yvonne and obtained news of m le duc  he had no suspicions why should he have  the abbey clock struck a quarterpast eleven when finally he knocked at the house in laura place long afterwards he remembered how just at that moment a dense grey mist descended into the valley he had not noticed it before now he saw that it had enveloped this part of the city so that he could not even see clearly across the place  a woman came to open the door lord tony then thought this strange considering how particular m le duc always was about everything pertaining to the management of his household the house of a poor exile he was wont to say but nevertheless that of a gentleman  can i go straight up he asked the woman who he thought was standing ostentatiously in the hall as if to bar his way i desire to see m le duc  ye can walk upstairs zir said the woman speaking with a broad somersetshire accent but i doubt me if yell see is grace the duke es been gone these two days  tony had paid no heed to her at first he had walked across the narrow hall to the oak staircase and was halfway up the first flight when her last words struck upon his ear  quite without meaning for the moment  but nevertheless he paused one foot on one tread and the other two treads below  and he turned round to look at the woman a swift frown across his smooth forehead  gone these two days he repeated mechanically what do you mean  well is grace left the day afore yesterdaythursday it was is man went yesterday afternoon with luggage and sich  e went by coach e did leave off she cried suddenly what are ye doin yere urtin me  for lord tony had rushed down the stairs again and was across the hall gripping the unoffending woman by the wrist and glaring into her expressionless face until she screamed with fright  i beg your pardon he said humbly as he released her wrist all the instincts of the courteous gentleman arrayed against his loss of control i  i forgot myself for the moment he stammered would you mind telling me again  what  what you said just now  the woman was prepared to put on the airs of outraged dignity she even glanced up at the malapert with scorn expressed in her small beady eyes but at sight of his face her anger and her fears both fell away from her lord tony was white to the lips his cheeks were the colour of dead ashes his mouth trembled his eyes alone glowed with illrepressed anxiety  is grace she said with slow emphasis for of a truth she thought that the young gentleman was either sick or daft is grace left this ouse the day afore yesterday in a hired barouche is manfrederickwent yesterday afternoon with the liggage e caught the bristol coach at two oclock i was is graces ousekeeper and i am to look after the ouse and the zervants until i ear from is grace again thems my orders i know no more than im tellin ye  but his grace returned here yesterday forenoon argued lord tony calmly mechanically as one who

mechanically  your pardon my lord ill go fetch th letter   vii  lord tony never moved while the woman shuffled across the passage and down the back stairs he was like a man who has received a knockout blow and has not yet had time to recover his scattered senses at first when the woman spoke his mind had jumped to fears of some awful accident  runaway horses  a broken barouche  or a sudden aggravation of the ducs illhealth but soon he was forced to reject what now would have seemed a consoling thought had there been an accident he would have hearda rumour would have reached himyvonne would have sent a courier he did not know yet what to think his mind was like a slate over which a clumsy hand had passed a wet spongeimpressions recollections above all a hideous nameless fear were all blurred and confused within his brain  the woman came back carrying a letter which was crumpled and greasy from a prolonged sojourn in the pocket of her apron lord tony took the letter and broke its heavy seal the woman watched him curiously pityingly now for he was good to look on and she scented the significance of the tragedy which she had been the means of revealing to him but he had become quite unconscious of her presence of everything in fact save those few sentences written in french in a cramped hand and which seemed to dance a wild saraband before his eyes       milor       you tried to steal my daughter from me but i have taken her from      you now by the time this reaches you we shall be on the high seas      on our way to holland thence to coblentz where mademoiselle de      kernogan will in accordance with my wishes be united in lawful      marriage to m martinroget whom i have chosen to be her husband      she is not and never was your wife as far as one may look into the      future i can assure you that you will never in life see her      again  and to this monstrous document of appalling callousness and coldblooded cruelty there was appended the signature of andré dieudonné duc de kernogan  but unlike the writer thereof lord anthony dewhurst neither stormed nor raged he did not even tear the execrable letter into an hundred fragments his firm hand closed over it with one convulsive clutch and that was all then he slipped the crumpled paper into his pocket quite deliberately he took out some money and gave a piece of silver to the woman  i thank you very much he said somewhat haltingly i quite understand everything now  the woman curtseyed and thanked him tears were in her eyes for it seemed to her that never had she seen such grief depicted upon any human face she preceded him to the hall door and held it open for him while he passed out after the brief gleam of sunshine it had started to rain again but he didnt seem to care the woman suggested fetching a hackney coach but he refused quite politely quite gently he even lifted his hat as he went out obviously he did not know what he was doing then he went out into the rain and strode slowly across the place     chapter vi  the scarlet pimpernel   i  instinct kept him away from the more frequented streetsand instinct after awhile drew him in the direction of his friends house at the comer of the circus sir percy blakeney had not gone out fortunately the lacquey who opened the door to my lord tony stared astonished and almost paralysed for the moment at the extraordinary appearance of his lordship rain dropped down from the brim of his hat on to his shoulders his boots were muddy to the knees his clothes wringing wet his eyes were wild and hazy and there was a curious tremor round his mouth  the lacquey declared with a knowing wink afterwards that his lordship must ave been drinkin  but at the moment his sense of duty urged him to show my lordwho was his masters friendinto the library whatever condition he was in he took his dripping coat and hat from him and marshalled him across the large square hall  sir percy blakeney was sitting at his desk writing when lord tony was shown in he looked up and at once rose and went to his friend  sit down tony he said quietly while i get you some brandy  he forced the young man down gently into a chair in front of the fire and threw another log into the blaze then from a cupboard he fetched a flask of brandy and a glass poured some out and held it to tonys lips the latter drankunresistinglike a child then as some warmth penetrated into his bones he leaned forward resting his elbows on his knees and buried his face in his hands blakeney waited quietly sitting down opposite to him until his friend should be able to speak  and after all that you told me on monday night were the first words which came from tonys quivering lips and the letter you sent me over on tuesday oh i was prepared to mistrust martinroget why i never allowed her out of my sight but her father how could i guess  can you tell me exactly what happened  lord tony drew himself up and staring vacantly into the fire told his friend the events of the past four days on wednesday the courier with m de kernogans letter breathing kindness and forgiveness on thursday his arrival and seeming illhealth on friday his departure with yvonne tony spoke quite calmly he had never been anything but calm since first in the house in laura place he had received that awful blow  i ought to have known he concluded dully i ought to have guessed especially since you warned me  i warned you that martinroget was not the man he pretended to be said blakeney gently i warned you against him but i too failed to suspect the duc de kernogan we are britishers you and i my dear tony he added with a quaint little laugh our minds will never be quite equal to the tortuous ways of these latin races but we are not going to waste time now talking about the past we have got to find your wife before those brutes have time to wreak their devilries against her  on the high seas  on the way to holland  thence to coblentz  murmured tony i have not yet shown you the ducs letter to me  he drew from his pocket the crumpled damp piece of paper on which the ink had run into patches and blotches and which had become almost undecipherable now sir percy took it from him and read it through  the duc de kernogan and lady anthony dewhurst are not on their way to holland and to coblentz he said quietly as he handed the letter back to lord tony  not on their way to holland queried the young man with a puzzled frown what do you mean  blakeney drew his chair closer to his friend a marvellous and subtle change had suddenly taken place in his individuality only a few moments ago he was the polished elegant man of the world then the kindly and understanding friendselfcontained reserved with a perfect manner redolent of sympathy and dignity suddenly all that was changed his manner was still perfect and outwardly calm his gestures scarce his speech deliberate but the compelling power of the leaderwhich is the birthright of such menglowed and sparkled now in his deepset eyes the spirit of adventure and reckless daring was awakeinsistent and rampantand subtle effluvia of enthusiasm and audacity emanated from his entire personality  sir percy blakeney had sunk his individuality in that of the scarlet pimpernel  i mean he said returning his friends anxious look with one that was inspiring in its unshakable confidence i mean that on monday last the night before your weddingwhen i urged you to obtain yvonne de kernogans consent to an immediate marriagei had followed martinroget to a place called the bottom inn on goblin combea place well known to every smuggler in the county  you percy exclaimed tony in amazement  yes i laughed the other lightly why not i had had my suspicions of him for some time as luck would have it he started off on the monday afternoon by hired coach to chelwood i followed from chelwood he wanted to go on to redhill but the roads were axle deep in mud and evening was gathering in very fast nobody would take him he wanted a horse and a guide i was on the spotas disreputable a barloafer as you ever saw in your life i offered to take him he had no choice he had to take me no one else had offered i took him to the bottom inn there he met our esteemed friend m chauvelin  chauvelin cried tony suddenly roused from the dull apathy of his immeasurable grief at sound of that name which recalled so many exciting adventures such mad wild hairbreadth escapes chauvelin what in the world is he doing here in england  brewing mischief of course replied blakeney dryly in disgrace discredited a marked manwhat you willmy friend m chauvelin has still an infinite capacity for mischief through the interstices of a badly fastened shutter i heard two blackguards devising infinite devilry that is why tony he added i urged an immediate marriage as the only real protection for yvonne de kernogan against those blackguards  would to god you had been more explicit exclaimed tony with a bitter sigh  would to god i had rejoined the other but there was so little time with licences and what not all to arrange for and less than an hour to do it in and would you have suspected the duc himself of such execrable duplicity even if you had known as i did then that the socalled martinroget hath name adet and that he matures thoughts of deadly revenge against the duc de kernogan and his daughter  martinroget the bankerthe exiled royalist who  he may be a banker now  but he certainly is no royalisthe is the son of a peasant who was unjustly put to death four years ago by the duc de kernogan  ye gods  he came over to england plentifully supplied with moneyi could not gather if the money is his or if it has been entrusted to him by the revolutionary government for purposes of spying and corruptionbut he came to england in order to ingratiate himself with the duc de kernogan and his daughter and then to lure them back to france for what purpose you may well imagine  good god man  you cant mean   he has chartered a smugglers craftor rather chauvelin has done it for him her name is the hollandia her master hath name kuyper she was to be in portishead harbour on the last day of november all her papers in order cargo of west india sugar destination amsterdam consignee some mynheer over there but martinroget or whatever his name may be and no doubt our friend chauvelin too were to be aboard her and also m le duc de kernogan and his daughter and the hollandia is to put into le croisic for nantes whose revolutionary proconsul that infamous carrier is of course chauvelins bosom friend  sir percy blakeney finished speaking lord tony had listened to him quietly and in silence now he rose and turned resolutely to his friend there was no longer any trace in him of that stunned apathy which had been the primary result of the terrible blow his young face was still almost unrecognisable from the lines of grief and horror which marred its habitual fresh boyish look he looked twenty years older than he had done a few hours ago but there was also in his whole attitude now the virility of more mature manhood its determination and unswerving purpose  and what can i do now he asked simply knowing that he could trust his friend and leader with what he held dearest in all the world without you blakeney i am of course impotent and lost i havent the head to think i havent sufficient brains to pit against those cunning devils but if you will help me  then he checked himself abruptly and the look of hopeless despair once more crept into his eyes  i am mad percy he said with a selfdeprecating shrug of the shoulders gone crazy with grief i suppose or i shouldnt talk of asking your help of risking your life in my cause  tony if you talk that rubbish i shall be forced to punch your head retorted blakeney with his light laugh why man he added gaily cant you see that i am aching to have at my old friend chauvelin again  and indeed the zest of adventure the zest to fight never dormant was glowing with compelling vigour now in those lazy eyes of his which were resting with such kindliness upon his stricken friend go home tony he added go you rascal and collect what things you want while i send for hastings and ffoulkes and see that four good horses are ready for us within the hour tonight we sleep at portishead tony the daydream is lying off there ready to sail at any hour of the day or night the hollandia has twentyfour hours start of us alas and we cannot overtake her now but well be in nantes ere those devils can do much mischief and once in nantes why tony man think of the glorious escapes weve had together you and i think of the gay mad rides across the north of france with halffainting women and swooning children across our saddlebows think of the day when we smuggled the de tournais out of calais harbour the day we snatched juliette déroulède and her paul out of the tumbril and tore across paris with that howling mob at our heels think think tony of all the happiest merriest moments of your life and they will seem dull and lifeless beside what is in store for you when with your dear wifes arms clinging round your neck well fly along the quays of nantes on the road to liberty ah tony lad were it not for the anxiety which i know is gnawing at your heart i would count this one of the happiest hours of my happy life  he was so full of enthusiasm so full of vitality that life itself seemed to emanate from him and to communicate itself to the very atmosphere around hope lit up my lord tonys wan face he believed in his friend as mediæval ascetics believed in the saints whom they adored enthusiasm had crept into his veins dull despair fell away from him like a mantle  god bless you percy he exclaimed as his firm and loyal hand grasped that of the leader whom he revered  nay retorted blakeney with sudden gravity he hath done that already pray for his help today lad as you have never prayed before     chapter vii  marguerite   i  lord tony had gone and for the space of five minutes sir percy blakeney stood in front of the hearth staring into the fire something lay before him something had to be done now which represented the heavy price that had to be paid for those mad and happy adventures for that reckless daring aye for that selfless supreme sacrifice which was as the very breath of life to the scarlet pimpernel  and in the dancing flames he could see marguerites blue eyes her ardent hair her tender smile all pleading with him not to go she had so much to give himso much happiness such an infinity of love and he was all that she had in the world it seemed to him as if he could feel her arms around him even now as if he could hear her voice whispering appealingly do not go am i nothing to you that thoughts of others should triumph over my pleading that the need of others should outweigh mine own most pressing need i want you percy aye even i you have done so much for othersit is my turn now  but even as in a kind of trance those words seemed to reach his strained senses he knew that he must go that he must tear himself away once more from the clinging embrace of her dear arms and shut his eyes to the tears which anon would fill her own destiny demanded that he should go he had chosen his path in life himself at first only in a spirit of wild recklessness a mad tossing of his life into the scales of fate but now that same destiny which he had chosen had become his master he no longer could draw back what he had done once twenty times an hundred times that he must do again all the while that the weak and the defenceless called mutely to him from across the seas all the while that innocent women suffered and orphaned children cried  and today it was his friend his comrade who had come to him in his distress the young wife whom he idolised was in the most dire peril that could possibly threaten any woman she was at the mercy of a man who driven by the passion of revenge meant to show her no mercy and the devil alone knew these days to what lengths of infamy a man so driven would go  the minutes sped on blakeneys eyes grew hot and wearied from staring into the fire he closed them for a moment and then quietly turned to go   ii  all those who knew marguerite blakeney these days marvelled if she was ever unhappy lady ffoulkes who was her most trusted friend vowed that she was not she had momentsdayssometimes weeks of intense anxiety which amounted to acute agony whenever she saw her husband start on one of those expeditions to france wherein every minute every hour he risked his life and more in order to snatch yet another threatened victim from the awful clutches of those merciless terrorists she endured soultorture such as few women could have withstood who had not her splendid courage and her boundless faith but against such crushing sorrow she had to set off the happiness of those reunions with the man whom she loved so passionatelyhappiness which was so great that it overrode and conquered the very memory of past anxieties  marguerite blakeney suffered terribly at timesat others she was overwhelmingly happythe measure of her life was made up of the bitter dregs of sorrow and the sparkling wine of joy no she was not altogether unhappy and gradually that enthusiasm which irradiated from the whole personality of the valiant scarlet pimpernel which dominated his every action entered into marguerite blakeneys blood too his vitality was so compelling those impulses which carried him headlong into unknown dangers were so generous and were actuated by such pure selflessness that the noblehearted woman whose very soul was wrapped up in the idolised husband allowed herself to ride by his side on the buoyant waves of his enthusiasm and of his desires she smothered every expression of anxiety she swallowed her tears she learned to say the word goodbye and forgot the word stay   iii  it was half an hour after midday when percy knocked at the door of her boudoir she had just come in from a walk in the meadows round the town and along the bank of the river the rain had overtaken her and she had come in very wet but none the less exhilarated by the movement and the keen damp saltladen air which came straight over the hills from the channel she had taken off her hat and her mantle and was laughing gaily with her maid who was shaking the wet out of a feather she looked round at her husband when he entered and with a quick gesture ordered the maid out of the room  she had learned to read every line on percys face every expression of his lazy heavylidded eyes she saw that he was dressed with more than his usual fastidiousness but in dark clothes and travelling mantle she knew moreover by that subtle instinct which had become a second nature and which warned her whenever he meant to go  nor did he announce his departure to her in so many words as soon as the maid had gone he took his beloved in his arms  they have stolen tonys wife from him he said with that light quaint laugh of his i told you that the man martinroget had planned some devilish mischiefwell he has succeeded so far thanks to that unspeakable fool the duc de kernogan  he told her briefly the history of the past few days  tony did not take my warning seriously enough he concluded with a sigh he ought never to have allowed his wife out of his sight  marguerite had not interrupted him while he spoke at first she just lay in his arms quiescent and listening nerving herself by a supreme effort not to utter one sigh of misery or one word of appeal then as her knees shook under her she sank back into a chair by the hearth and he knelt beside her with his arms clasped tightly round her shoulders his cheek pressed against hers he had no need to tell her that duty and friendship called that the call of honour was once againas it so often has been in the worldlouder than that of love  she understood and she knew and he with that supersensitive instinct of his understood the heroic effort which she made  your love dear heart he whispered will draw me back safely home as it hath so often done before you believe that do you not  and she had the supreme courage to murmur yes     chapter viii  the road to portishead   i  it was not until bath had very obviously been left behind that yvonne de kernoganlady anthony dewhurstrealised that she had been trapped  during the first halfhour of the journey her father had lain back against the cushions of the carriage with eyes closed his face pale and wan as if with great suffering yvonne her mind a prey to the gravest anxiety sat beside him holding his limp cold hand in hers once or twice she ventured on a timid question as to his health and he invariably murmured a feeble assurance that he felt well only very tired and disinclined to talk anon she suggesteddiffidently for she did not mean to disturb himthat the driver did not appear to know his way into bath he had turned into a side road which she felt sure was not the right one m le duc then roused himself for a moment from his lethargy he leaned forward and gazed out of the window  the man is quite right yvonne he said quietly he knows his way he brought me along this road yesterday he gets into bath by a slight détour but it is pleasanter driving  this reply satisfied her she was a stranger in the land and knew little or nothing of the environs of bath true last monday morning after the ceremony of her marriage she had driven out to combwich but dawn was only just breaking then and she had lain for the most partwearied and happyin her young husbands arms she had taken scant note of roads and signposts  a few minutes later the coach came to a halt and yvonne looking through the window saw a man who was muffled up to the chin and enveloped in a huge travelling cape mount swiftly up beside the driver  who is that man she queried sharply  some friend of the coachmans no doubt murmured her father in reply to whom he is giving a lift as far as bath  the barouche had moved on again  yvonne could not have told you why but at her fathers last words she had felt a sudden cold grip at her heartthe first since she started it was neither fear nor yet suspicion but a chill seemed to go right through her she gazed anxiously through the window and then looked at her father with eyes that challenged and that doubted but m le duc would not meet her gaze he had once more closed his eyes and sat quite still pale and haggard like a man who is suffering acutely   ii  father we are going back to bath are we not  the query came out trenchant and hard from her throat which now felt hoarse and choked her whole being was suddenly pervaded by a vast and nameless fear time had gone on and there was no sign in the distance of the great city m de kernogan made no reply but he opened his eyes and a curious glance shot from them at the terrorstricken face of his daughter  then she knewknew that she had been tricked and trappedthat her father had played a hideous and complicated rôle of hypocrisy and duplicity in order to take her away from the husband whom she idolised  fear and her love for the man of her choice gave her initiative and strength before m de kernogan could realise what she was doing before he could make a movement to stop her she had seized the handle of the carriage door wrenched the door open and jumped out into the road she fell on her face in the mud but the next moment she picked herself up again and started to rundown the road which the carriage had just traversed on and on as fast as she could go she ran on blindly unreasoningly impelled by a purely physical instinct to escape not thinking how childish how futile such an attempt was bound to be  already after the first few minutes of this swift career over the muddy road she heard quick heavy footsteps behind her her father could not run like thatthe coachman could not have thus left his horsesbut still she could hear those footsteps at a runa quicker run than hersand they were gaining on herevery minute every second the next she felt two powerful arms suddenly seizing her by the shoulders she stumbled and would once more have fallen but for those same strong arms which held her close  let me go let me go she cried panting  but she was held and could no longer move she looked up into the face of martinroget who without any hesitation or compunction lifted her up as if she had been a bale of light goods and carried her back toward the coach she had forgotten the man who had been picked up on the road awhile ago and had been sitting beside the coachman since  he deposited her in the barouche beside her father then quietly closed the door and once more mounted to his seat on the box the carriage moved on again m de kernogan was no longer lethargic he looked down on his daughters inert form beside him and not one look of tenderness or compassion softened the hard callousness of his face  any resistance my child he said coldly will as you see be useless as well as undignified i deplore this necessary violence but i should be forced once more to requisition m martinrogets help if you attempted such foolish tricks again when you are a little more calm we will talk openly together  for the moment she was lying back against the cushions of the carriage her nerves having momentarily given way before this appalling catastrophe which had overtaken her and the hideous outrage to which she was being subjected by her own father she was sobbing convulsively but in the face of his abominable callousness she made a great effort to regain her selfcontrol her pride her dignity came to the rescue she had had time in those few seconds to realise that she was indeed more helpless than any bird in a fowlers net and that only absolute calm and presence of mind could possibly save her now  if indeed there was the slightest hope of salvation  she drew herself up and resolutely dried her eyes and readjusted her hair and her hood and mantle  we can talk openly at once sir she said coldly i am ready to hear what explanation you can offer for this monstrous outrage  i owe you no explanation my child he retorted calmly presently when you are restored to your own sense of dignity and of selfrespect you will remember that a lady of the house of kernogan does not elope in the night with a stranger and a heretic like some kitchenwench having so far forgotten herself my daughter must alas take the consequences which i deplore of her own sins and lack of honour  and no doubt father she retorted stung to the quick by his insults that you too will anon be restored to your own sense of selfrespect and remember that hitherto no gentleman of the house of kernogan has acted the part of a liar and of a hypocrite  silence he commanded sternly  yes she reiterated wildly it was the rôle of a liar and of a hypocrite that you played from the moment when you sat down to pen that letter full of protestations of affection and forgiveness until like a veritable judas you betrayed your own daughter with a kiss shame on you father she cried shame  enough he said as he seized her wrist so roughly that the cry of pain which involuntarily escaped her effectually checked the words in her mouth you are mad beside yourself a thoughtless senseless creature whom i shall have to coerce more effectually if you do not cease your ravings do not force me to have recourse once again to m martinrogets assistance to keep your undignified outburst in check  the name of the man whom she had learned to hate and fear more than any other human being in the world was sufficient to restore to her that measure of selfcontrol which had again threatened to leave her  enough indeed she said more calmly the brain that could devise and carry out such infamy in cold blood is not like to be influenced by a defenceless womans tears will you at least tell me whither you are taking me  we go to a place on the coast now he replied coldly the outlandish name of which has escaped me there we embark for holland from whence we shall join their royal highnesses at coblentz it is at coblentz that your marriage with m martinroget will take place and  stay father she broke in speaking quite as calmly as he did ere you go any further understand me clearly for i mean every word that i say in the sight of godif not in that of the laws of francei am the wife of lord anthony dewhurst by everything that i hold most sacred and most dear i swear to you that i will never become martinrogets wife i would die first she added with burning but resolutely suppressed passion  he shrugged his shoulders  pshaw my child he said quietly many a time since the world began have women registered such solemn and sacred vows only to break them when force of circumstance and their own good sense made them ashamed of their own folly  how little you know me father was all that she said in reply   iii  indeed yvonne de kernoganyvonne dewhurst as she was now in sight of god and menhad far too much innate dignity and selfrespect to continue this discussion seeing that in any case she was physically the weaker and that she was absolutely helpless and defenceless in the hands of two men one of whomher own fatherwho should have been her protector was leagued with her bitterest enemy against her  that martinroget was her enemyaye and her fathers tooshe had absolutely no doubt some obscure yet keen instinct was working in her heart urging her to mistrust him even more wholly than she had done before just now when he laid ruthless hands on her and carried her inert and halfswooning back into the coach and she lay with closed eyes her very soul in revolt against this contact with him against the feel of his arms around her a vague memory surcharged with horror and with dread stirred within her brain and over the vista of the past few years she looked back upon an evening in the autumna rough night with the wind from the atlantic blowing across the lowlands of poitou and soughing in the willow trees that bordered the loireshe seemed to hear the tumultuous cries of enraged human creatures dominating the sound of the gale she felt the crowd of evilintentioned men around the closed carriage wherein she sat calm and unafraid darkness then was all around her she could not see she could only hear and feel and she heard the carriage door being wrenched open and she felt the cold breath of the wind upon her cheek and also the hot breath of a man in a passion of fury and of hate  she had seen nothing then and mercifully semiunconsciousness had dulled her aching senses but even now her soul shrunk with horror at the vague remembrance of that ghostlike formthe spirit of hate and of revengeof its rough arms encircling her shoulders its fingers under her chinand then that awful loathsome contaminating kiss which she thought then would have smirched her for ever it had taken all the pure sweet kisses of a brave and loyal man whom she loved and revered to make her forget that hideous indelible stain and in the arms of her dear milor she had forgotten that one terrible moment when she had felt that the embrace of death must be more endurable than that of this unknown and hated man  it was the memory of that awful night which had come back to her as in a flash while she lay passive and broken in martinrogets arms of course for the moment she had no thought of connecting the rich banker from brest the enthusiastic royalist and émigré with one of those turbulent uneducated peasant lads who had attacked her carriage that night all that she was conscious of was that she was outraged by his presence just as she had been outraged then and that the contact of his hands of his arms was absolutely unendurable  to fight against the physical power which held her a helpless prisoner in the hands of the enemy was sheer impossibility she knew that and was too proud to make feeble and futile efforts which could only end in defeat and further humiliation she felt hideously wretched and lonelythoughts of her husband who at this hour was still serenely unconscious of the terrible catastrophe which had befallen him brought tears of acute misery to her eyes what would he do whentomorrow perhapshe realised that his bride had been stolen from him that he had been fooled and duped as she had been too what could he do when he knew  she tried to solace her own soulagony by thinking of his influential friends who of course would help him as soon as they knew there was that mysterious and potent friend of whom he spoke so little who already had warned him of coming danger and urged on the secret marriage which should have proved a protection there was sir percy blakeney of whom he spoke much who was enormously rich independent the most intimate friend of the regent himself there was  but what was the use of clinging even for one instant to those feeble cords of hopes broken lyre by the time her dear lord knew that she was gone she would be on the high seas far out of his reach  and she had not even the solace of tearsheartbroken sobs rose in her throat but she resolutely kept them back her fathers cold impassive face the callous glitter in his eyes told her that every tear would be in vain her most earnest appeal an object for his sneers   iv  as to how long the journey in the coach lasted after that yvonne dewhurst could not have said it may have been a few hours it may have been a cycle of years she had been younga happy bride a dutiful daughterwhen she left combwich hall she was an old woman now a supremely unhappy one parted from the man she loved without hope of ever seeing him again in life and feeling nothing but hatred and contempt for the father who had planned such infamy against her  she offered no resistance whatever to any of her fathers commands after the first outburst of revolt and indignation she had not even spoken to him  there was a halt somewhere on the way when in the lowraftered room of a postinginn she had to sit at table with the two men who had compassed her misery she was thirsty feverish and weak she drank some milk in silence she felt ill physically as well as mentally and the constant effort not to break down had helped to shatter her nerves as she had stepped out of the barouche without a word so she stepped into it again when it stood outside ready with a fresh relay of horses to take her further still further away from the cosy little nest where even now her young husband was waiting longingly for her return the people of the inna kindlylooking woman a portly middleaged man one or two young ostlers and servingmaids were standing about in the yard when her father led her to the coach for a moment the wild idea rushed to her mind to run to these people and demand their protection to proclaim at the top of her voice the infamous act which was dragging her away from her husband and her home and lead her a helpless prisoner to a fate that was infinitely worse than death she even ran to the woman who looked so benevolent and so kind she placed her small quivering hand on the others rough toilworn one and in hurried appealing words begged for her help and the shelter of a home till she could communicate with her husband  the woman listened with a look of kindly pity upon her homely face she patted the small trembling hand and stroked it gently tears of compassion gathered in her eyes  yes yes my dear she said soothingly speaking as she would to a sick woman or to a child i quite understand i wouldna fret if i was you i would jess go quietly with your pore father e knows whats best for you that e do you come long wi me she added as she drew yvonnes hands through her arm ill see yere comfortable in the coach  yvonne bewildered could not at first understand either the womans sympathy or her obvious indifference to the pitiable tale untiloh the shame of itshe saw the two young servingmaids looking on her with equal pity expressed in their round eyes and heard one of them whispering to the other  pore lady so zad aint it im that zorry for the pore father  and the girl with a significant gesture indicated her own forehead and glanced knowingly at her companion yvonne felt a hot flush rise to the very roots of her hair so her father and martinroget had thought of everything and had taken every precaution to cut the ground from under her feet wherever a halt was necessary wherever the party might come in contact with the curious or the indifferent it would be given out that the poor young lady was crazed that she talked wildly and had to be kept under restraint  yvonne as she turned away from that last faint glimmer of hope encountered martinrogets glance of triumph and saw the sneer which curled his full lips her father came up to her just then and took her over from the kindly hostess with the ostentatious manner of one who has charge of a sick person and must take every precaution for her welfare  another loss of dignity my child he said to her in french so that none but martinroget could catch what he said i guessed that you would commit some indiscretion you see so m martinroget and myself warned all the people at the inn the moment we arrived we told them that i was travelling with a sick daughter who had become crazed through the death of her lover and believed herselflike most crazed persons doto be persecuted and oppressed you have seen the result they pitied you even the servingmaids smiled it would have been wiser to remain silent  whereupon he handed her into the barouche with loving care a crowd of sympathetic onlookers gazing with obvious compassion on the poor crazed lady and her sorely tried father  after this episode yvonne gave up the struggle  no one but god could help her if he chose to perform a miracle   v  the rest of the journey was accomplished in silence yvonne gazed unseeing through the carriage window as the barouche rattled on the cobblestones of the streets of bristol she marvelled at the number of people who went gaily by along the streets unheeding unknowing that the greatest depths of misery to which any human being could sink had been probed by the unfortunate young girl who wideeyed mute and brokenhearted gazed out upon the busy world without  portishead was reached just when the grey light of day turned to a gloomy twilight yvonne unresisting insentient went whither she was bidden to go better that than to feel martinrogets coercive grip on her arm or to hear her fathers curt words of command  she walked along the pier and anon stepped into a boat hardly knowing what she was doing the twilight was welcome to her for it hid much from her view and her eyeshot with unshed tearsached for the restful gloom she realised that the boat was being rowed along for some little way down the stream that frédérick who had come she knew not how or whence was in the boat too with some luggage which she recognised as being familiar that another woman was there whom she did not know but who appeared to look after her comforts wrapped a shawl closer round her knees and drew the hood of her mantle closer round her neck but it was all like an ugly dream the voices of her father and of martinroget who were talking in monosyllables the sound of the oars as they struck the water or creaked in their rowlocks came to her as from an everreceding distance  a couple of hours later she came back to complete consciousness she was in a narrow place which at first appeared to her like a cupboard the atmosphere was both cold and stuffy and reeked of tar and of oil she was lying on a hard bed with her mantle and a shawl wrapped round her it was very dark save where the feeble glimmer of a lamp threw a circle of light around above her head there was a constant and heavy tramping of feet and the sound of incessant and varied creakings and groanings of wood cordage and metal filled the night air with their weird and dismal sounds a slow feeling of movement coupled with a gentle oscillation confirmed the unfortunate girls first waking impression that she was on board a ship how she had got there she did not know she must ultimately have fainted in the small boat and been carried aboard she raised herself slightly on her elbow and peered round her into the dark corners of the cabin opposite to her upon a bench also wrapped up in shawl and mantle lay the woman who had been in attendance on her in the boat  the womans heavy breathing indicated that she was fast asleep  loneliness misery desolation encompassed the happy bride of yesterday with a moan of exquisite soulagony she fell back against the hard cushions and for the first time this day a convulsive flow of tears eased the superacuteness of her misery     chapter ix  the coast of france   i  the whole of that wretched mournful day yvonne dewhurst spent upon the deck of the ship which was bearing her away every hour every minute further and still further from home and happiness she seldom spoke she ate and drank when food was brought to her she was conscious neither of cold nor of wet of wellbeing or ill she sat upon a pile of cordages in the stern of the ship leaning against the taffrail and in imagination seeing the coast of england fade into illimitable space  part of the time it rained and then she sat huddled up in the shawls and tarpaulins which the woman placed about her then when the sun came out she still sat huddled up closing her eyes against the glare  when daylight faded into dusk and then twilight into night she gazed into nothingness as she had gazed on water and sky before thinking thinking thinking this could not be the endit could not so much happiness such pure love such perfect companionship as she had had with the young husband whom she idolised could not all be wrenched from her like that without previous foreboding and without some warning from fate this miserable sordid wretched journey to an unknown land could not be the epilogue to the exquisite romance which had suddenly changed the dreary monotony of her life into one long glowing dream of joy and of happiness this could not be the end  and gazing into the immensity of the far horizon she thought and thought and racked her memory for every word every look which she had had from her dear milor and upon the grey background of sea and sky she seemed to perceive the vague and dim outline of that mysterious friendthe man who knew everythingwho foresaw everything even and above all the dangers that threatened those whom he loved he had foreseen this awful danger too oh if only milor and she herself had realised its full extent but now surely surely he would help he would know what to do milor was wont to speak of him as being omniscient and having marvellous powers  once or twice during the day m le duc de kernogan came to sit beside his daughter and tried to speak a few words of comfort and of sympathy of a truthhere on the open seafar both from home and kindred and from the new friends he had found in hospitable englandhis heart smote him for all the wrong he had done to his only child he dared not think of the gentle and patient wife who lay at rest in the churchyard of kernogan for he feared that with his thoughts he would conjure up her pale avenging ghost who would demand an account of what he had done with her child  cold and exposurethe discomfort of the long seajourney in this rough trading ship had somewhat damped m de kernogans pride and obstinacy his loyalty to the cause of his king had paled before the demands of a fathers duty toward his helpless daughter   ii  it was close on six oclock and the night after the turbulent and capricious alternations of rain and sunshine promised to be beautifully clear though very cold the pale crescent of the moon had just emerged from behind the thick veil of cloud and mist which still hung threateningly upon the horizon a fitful sheen of silver danced upon the waves  m le duc stood beside his daughter he had inquired after her health and wellbeing and received her monosyllabic reply with an impatient sigh m martinroget was pacing up and down the deck with restless and vigorous strides he had just gone by and made a loud and cheery comment on the weather and the beauty of the night  could yvonne dewhurst have seen her fathers face now or had she cared to study it she would have perceived that he was gazing out to sea in the direction to which the schooner was heading with an intent look of puzzlement and that there was a deep furrow between his brows half an hour went by and he still stood there silent and absorbed then suddenly a curious exclamation escaped his lips he stooped and seized his daughter by the wrist  yvonne he said excitedly tell me am i dreaming or am i crazed  what is it she asked coldly  out there look just tell me what you see  he appeared so excited and his pressure on her wrist was so insistent that she dragged herself to her feet and looked out to sea in the direction to which he was pointing  tell me what you see he reiterated with evergrowing excitement and she felt that the hand which held her wrist trembled violently  the light from a lighthouse i think she said  and besides that  another lighta much smaller oneconsiderably higher up it must be perched up on some cliffs  anything else  yes there are lights dotted about here and there some village on the coast  on the coast he murmured hoarsely and we are heading towards it  so it appears she said indifferently what cared she to what shore she was being taken every land save england was exile to her now  just at this moment m martinroget in his restless wanderings once more passed by  m martinroget called the duc  and vaguely yvonne wondered why his voice trembled so  at your service m le duc replied the other as he came to a halt and then stood with legs wide apart firmly planted upon the deck his hands buried in the pockets of his heavy mantle his head thrown back as if defiantly his whole attitude that of a master condescending to talk with slaves  what are those lights over there ahead of us asked m le duc quietly  the lighthouse of le croisic m le duc replied martinroget dryly and of the guardhouse above and the harbour below all at your service he added with a sneer  monsieur exclaimed the duc  eh what queried the other blandly  what does this mean  in the vague dim light of the moon yvonne could just distinguish the two men as they stood confronting one another martinroget tall massive with arms now folded across his breast shrugging his broad shoulders at the ducs impassioned queryand her father who suddenly appeared to have shrunk within himself who raised one trembling hand to his forehead and with the other sought with pathetic entreaty the support of his daughters arm  what does this mean he murmured again  only replied martinroget with a laugh that we are close to the coast of france and that with this unpleasant but useful northwesterly wind we shall be in nantes two hours before midnight  in nantes queried the duc vaguely not understanding speaking tonelessly like a somnambulist or a man in a trance he was leaning heavily now on his daughters arm and she with that motherly instinct which is ever present in a good womans heart even in the presence of her most cruel enemy drew him tenderly towards her gave him the support he needed not quite understanding herself yet what it was that had befallen them both  yes in nantes m le duc reiterated martinroget with a sneer  but twas to holland we were going  to nantes m le duc retorted the other with a ringing note of triumph in his voice to nantes from which you fled like a coward when you realised that the vengeance of an outraged people had at last overtaken you and your kind  i do not understand stammered the duc and mechanically nowinstinctivelyfather and daughter clung to one another as if each was striving to protect the other from the raving fury of this madman never for a moment did they believe that he was sane excitement they thought had turned his brain he was acting and speaking like one possessed  i dare say it would take far longer than the next four hours while we glide gently along the loire to make such as you understand that your arrogance and your pride are destined to be humbled at last and that you are now in the power of those men who awhile ago you did not deem worthy to lick your boots i dare say he continued calmly you think that i am crazed well perhaps i am but sane enough anyhow m le duc to enjoy the full flavour of revenge  revenge what have we done what has my daughter done stammered the duc incoherently you swore you loved her  desired to make her your wife  i consented  she  martinrogets harsh laugh broke in on his vague murmurings  and like an arrogant fool you fell into the trap he said with calm irony and you were too blind to see in martinroget suitor for your daughters hand pierre adet the son of the victim of your execrable tyranny the innocent man murdered at your bidding  pierre adet  i dont understand  tis but little meseems that you do understand m le duc sneered the other but turn your memory back i pray you to the night four years ago when a few hotheaded peasant lads planned to give you a fright in your castle of kernogan  the plan failed and pierre adet the leader of that unfortunate band managed to fly the country whilst you like a crazed and blind tyrant administered punishment right and left for the fright which you had had just think of it those boors those louts that swinish herd of human cattle had dared to raise a cry of revolt against you to death with them all to death where is pierre adet the leader of those hogs to him an exemplary punishment must be meted a deterrent against any other attempt at revolt well m le duc do you remember what happened then pierre adet severely injured in the mêlée had managed to crawl away into safety while he lay betwixt life and death first in the presbytery of vertou then in various ditches on his way to paris he knew nothing of what happened at nantes when he returned to consciousness and to active life he heard that his father jean adet the miller who was innocent of any share in the revolt had been hanged by order of m le duc de kernogan  he paused awhile and a curious laughhalfconvulsive and not unmixed with sobsshook his broad shoulders neither the duc nor yvonne made any comment on what they heard the duc felt like a fly caught in a deathdealing web he was dazed with the horror of his position dazed above all with the rush of bitter remorse which had surged up in his heart and mind when he realised that it was his own folly his obstinacyaye and his heartlessness which had brought this awful fate upon his daughter and yvonne felt that whatever she might endure of misery and hopelessness was nothing in comparison with what her father must feel with the addition of bitter selfreproach  are you beginning to understand the position better now m le duc queried martinroget after awhile  the duc sank back nerveless upon the pile of cordages close by yvonne was leaning with her back against the taffrail her two arms outstretched the northwest wind blowing her soft brown hair about her face whilst her eyes sought through the gloom to read the lines of cruelty and hatred which must be distorting martinrogets face now  and she said quietly after awhile you have waited all these years monsieur nursing thoughts of revenge and of hate against us ah believe me she added earnestly though god knows my heart is full of misery at this moment and though i know that at your bidding death will so soon claim me and my father as his own yet would i not change my wretchedness for yours  and i citizeness he said roughly addressing her for the first time in the manner prescribed by the revolutionary government would not change places with any king or other tyrant on earth yes he added as he came a step or two closer to her i have waited all these years for four years i have thought and striven and planned planned to be even with your father and with you one day you had fled the countrylike cowards bahready to lend your arms to the foreigner against your own country in order to reestablish a tyrant upon the throne whom the whole of the people of france loathed and detested you had fled but soon i learned whither you had gone then i set to work to gain access to you i learned english i too went to england  under an assumed name  with the necessary introductions so as to gain a footing in the circles in which you moved i won your fathers condescensionalmost his friendship the rich banker from brest should be fleeced in order to provide funds for the armies that were to devastate franceand the rich banker of brest refused to be fleeced unless he was lured by the promise of mlle de kernogans hand in marriage  you need not monsieur rejoined yvonne coldly while martinroget paused in order to draw breath you need not believe me take the trouble to recount all the machinations which you carried through in order to gain your ends enough that my father was so foolish as to trust you and that we are now completely in your power but  there is no but he broke in gruffly you are in my power and will be made to learn the law of the talion which demands an eye for an eye a life for a life that is the law which the people are applying to that herd of aristos who were arrogant tyrants once and are shrinking cowering slaves now oh you were very proud that night mademoiselle yvonne de kernogan when a few peasant lads told you some home truths while you sat disdainful and callous in your carriage but there is one fact that you can never efface from your memory strive how you may and that is that for a few minutes i held you in my arms and that i kissed you my fine lady aye kissed you like i would any pert kitchen wench even i pierre adet the millers son  he drew nearer and nearer to her as he spoke she leaning against the taffrail could not retreat any further from him he laughed  if you fall over into the water i shall not complain he said it will save our proconsul the trouble and the guillotine some work but you need not fear i am not trying to kiss you again you are nothing to me you and your father less than nothing your death in misery and wretchedness is all i want whether you find a dishonoured grave in the loire or by suicide i care less than nothing but let me tell you this he added and his voice came now like a hissing sound through his set teeth that there is no intention on my part to make glorious martyrs of you both i dare say you have heard some pretty stories over in england of aristos climbing the steps of the guillotine with an ecstatic look of martyrdom upon their face and tales of the tumbrils of paris laden with men and women going to their death and shouting god save the king all the way that is not the sort of paltry revenge which would satisfy me my father was hanged by yours as a malefactorhanged i say like a common thief he a man who had never wronged a single soul in the whole course of his life who had been an example of fine living of hard work of noble courage through many adversities my mother was left a widownot the honoured widow of an honourable manbut a pariah the relict of a malefactor who had died of the hangmans ropemy sister was left an orphandishonouredwithout hope of gaining the love of a respectable man all that i and my family owe to cidevant m le duc de kernogan and therefore i tell you that both he and his daughter shall not die like martyrs but like malefactors tooshameddishonouredloathed and execrated even by their own kindred take note of that m le duc de kernogan you have sown shame shame shall you reap and the name of which you are so proud will be dragged in the mire until it has become a byword in the land for all that is despicable and base  perhaps at no time of his life had martinroget erstwhile pierre adet spoken with such an intensity of passion even though he was at all times turbulent and a ready prey to his own emotions but all that he had kept hidden in the inmost recesses of his heart ever since as a young stripling he had chafed at the social conditions of his country now welled forth in that wild harangue for the first time in his life he felt that he was really master of those who had once despised and oppressed him he held them and was the arbiter of their fate the sense of possession and of power had gone to his head like wine he was intoxicated with his own feeling of triumphant revenge and this impassioned rhetoric flowed from his mouth like the insentient babble of a drunken man  the duc de kernogan sitting on the coil of cordages with his elbows on his knees and his head buried in his hands had no thought of breaking in on the other mans ravings the bitterness of remorse paralysed his thinking faculties martinrogets savage words struck upon his senses like blows from a sledgehammer he knew that nothing but his own folly was the cause of yvonnes and his own misfortune yvonne had been safe from all evil fortune under the protection of her fine young english husband hethe father who should have been her chief protectorhad dragged her by brute force away from that husbands care and had landed her  where a shudder like acute ague went through the unfortunate mans whole body as he thought of the future  nor did yvonne dewhurst attempt to make reply to her enemys delirious talk she would not give him even the paltry satisfaction of feeling that he had stung her into a retort she did not fear himshe hated him too much for thatbut like her father she had no illusions as to his power over them both while he stormed and raved she kept her eyes steadily fixed upon him she could only just barely distinguish him in the gloom and he no doubt failed to see the expression of lofty indifference wherewith she contrived to regard him but he felt her contempt and but for the presence of the sailors on the deck he probably would have struck her  as it was when from sheer lack of breath he had to pause he gave one last look of hate on the huddled figure of the duc and the proud upstanding one of yvonne then with a laugh which sounded like that of a fiendso cruel so callous was it he turned on his heel and as he strode away towards the bow his tall figure was soon absorbed in the surrounding gloom   iii  the duc de kernogan and his daughter saw little or nothing of martinroget after that for awhile longer they caught sight of him from time to time as he walked up and down the deck with ceaseless restlessness and in the company of another man who was much shorter and slimmer than himself and whom they had not noticed hitherto martinroget talked most of the time in a loud and excited voice the other appearing to listen to him with a certain air of deference whether the conversation between these two was actually intended for the ears of the two unfortunates or whether it was merely chance which brought certain phrases to their ears when the two men passed closely by it were impossible to say certain it is that from such chance phrases they gathered that the barque would not put into nantes as the navigation of the loire was suspended for the nonce by order of proconsul carrier he had need of the river for his awesome and nefarious deeds yvonnes ears were regaled with talestold with loud ostentationof the terrible noyades the wholesale drowning of men women and children malefactors and traitors so as to ease the burden of the guillotine  after three bells it got so bitterly cold that yvonne fearing that her father would become seriously ill suggested their going down to their stuffy cabins together after all even the foul and shutup atmosphere of these close airless cupboards was preferable to the propinquity of those two human fiends up on deck and the tales of horror and brutality which they loved to tell  and for two hours after that father and daughter sat in the narrow celllike place locked in each others arms she had everything to forgive and he everything to atone for but yvonne suffered so acutely her misery was so great that she found it in her heart to pity the father whose misery must have been even greater than hers the supreme solace of bestowing love and forgiveness and of easing the racking paroxysms of remorse which brought the unfortunate man to the verge of dementia warmed her heart towards him and brought surcease to her own sorrow     book two nantes december 1793  chapter i  the tigers lair   i  nantes is in the grip of the tiger  representative carrierwith powers as of a proconsulhas been sent down to stamp out the lingering remnants of the counterrevolution la vendée is temporarily subdued the army of the royalists driven back across the loire but traitors still aboundthis the national convention in paris hath decreedthere are traitors everywhere they were not all massacred at cholet and savenay disbanded yes but not exterminated and wolves must not be allowed to run loose lest they band again and try to devour the flocks  therefore extermination is the order of the day every traitor or wouldbe traitorevery son and daughter and father and mother of traitors must be destroyed ere they do more mischief and carriercarrier the coward who turned tail and bolted at choletis sent to nantes to carry on the work of destruction wolves and wolflings all let none survive give them fair trial of course as traitors they have deserved deathhave they not taken up arms against the republic and against the will and the reign of the people but let a court of justice sit in nantes town let the whole nation know how traitors are dealt with let the nation see that her rulers are both wise and just let wolves and wolflings be brought up for trial and set up the guillotine on place du bouffay with four executioners appointed to do her work there would be too much work for two or even three let there be fourand let the work of extermination be complete  and carrierwith powers as of a proconsularrives in nantes town and sets to work to organise his household civil and militarywith pomp and circumstancefor the son of a small farmer destined originally for the church and for obscurity is now virtual autocrat in one of the great cities of france he has power of life and death over thousands of citizensunder the direction of justice of course so now he has citizens of the bedchamber and citizens of the household he has a guard of honour and a company of citizens of the guard and above all he has a crowd of spies around himservants of the committee of public safety so they are calledthey style themselves la compagnie marat in honour of the great patriot who was foully murdered by a female wolfling  so la compagnie marat is formedthey wear red bonnets on their headsno stockings on their feetshort breeches to display their bare shins their captain fleury has access at all times to the person of the proconsul to make report on the raids which his company effect at all hours of the day or night their powers are supreme too in and out of houseshowever privateup and down the streetsthrough shops taverns and warehouses along the quays and the yardseverywhere they go everywhere they have the right to go to ferret and to spy to listen to search to interrogatethe redcapped company is paid for what it can find piecework what work for the guillotine  and they it is who keep the guillotine busy too busy in fact and the court of justice sitting in the hôtel du département is overworked too carrier gets impatient why waste the time of patriots by so much paraphernalia of justice wolves and wolflings can be exterminated so much more quickly more easily than that it only needs a stroke of genius one stroke and carrier has it  he invents the noyades  the drownages we may call them  they are so simple an old flatbottomed barge the work of two or three ships carpenters portholes below the waterline and made to open at a given moment all so very very simple then a journey downstream as far as belle isle or la maréchale and sentence of deportation executed without any trouble on a whole crowd of traitorsvertical deportation carrier calls it facetiously and is mightily proud of his invention and of his witticism too  the first attempt was highly successful ninety priests and not one escaped think of the work it would have entailed on the guillotineand on the friends of carrier who sit in justice in the hôtel du département ninety heads bah that old flatbottomed barge is the most wonderful laboursaving machine  after that the drownages become the order of the day the redcapped company recruits victims for the hecatomb and over nantes town there hangs a pall of unspeakable horror the prisons are not vast enough to hold all the victims so the huge entrepôt the bonded warehouse on the quay is converted instead of chests of coffee it is now encumbered with human freight into it pellmell are thrown all those who are destined to assuage carriers passion for killing ten thousand of them men women and young children counterrevolutionists innocent tradesmen thieves aristocrats criminals and women of evil famethey are herded together like cattle without straw whereon to lie without water without fire with barely food enough to keep up the last attenuated thread of a miserable existence  and when the warehouse gets over full to the loire with thema hundred or two at a time pestilence dysentery decimates their numbers under pretence of hygienic requirements two hundred are flung into the river on the 14th day of december two hundredmany of them womencrowds of children and a batch of parish priests  some there are among carriers colleaguesthose up in pariswho protest such wholesale butchery will not redound to the credit of any revolutionary governmentit even savours of treacheryit is unpatriotic there are the emissaries of the national convention deputed from paris to supervise and controlthey protest as much as they darebut such men are swept off their feet by the torrent of carriers gluttony for blood carriers mission is to purge the political body of every evil that infests it vague and yet precise he reckons that he has full powers and thinks he can flaunt those powers in the face of those sent to control him he does it too for three whole months ere he in his turn meets his doom but for the moment he is omnipotent he has to make report every week to the committee of public safety and he sends brief garbled versions of his doings he is pacifying la vendée he is stamping out the remnants of the rebellion he is purging the political body of every evil that infests it anon he succeeds in getting the emissaries of the national convention recalled he is impatient of control they are weak pusillanimous unpatriotic he must have freedom to act for the best  after that he remains virtual dictator with none but obsequious terrified myrmidons around him these are too weak to oppose him in any way and the municipality dare not protest eithernor the district councilnor the departmental they are merely sheep who watch others of their flock being sent to the slaughter  after that from within his lair the man tiger decides that it is a pity to waste good barges on the cattle fling them out he cries fling them out tie two and two together man and woman criminal and aristo the thief with the cidevant dukes daughter the cidevant marquis with the slut from the streets fling them all out together into the loire and pour a hail of grape shot above them until the last struggler has disappeared equality he cries equality for all fraternity unity in death  his friends call this new invention of his marriage républicain and he is pleased with the mot  and republican marriages become the order of the day   ii  nantes itself now is akin to a deserta desert wherein the air is filled with weird sounds of cries and of moans of furtive footsteps scurrying away into dark and secluded byways of musketry and confused noises of sorrow and of lamentations  nantes is a city of the deada city of sleepers only carrier is awakethinking and devising and planning shorter ways and swifter for the extermination of traitors  in the hôtel de la villestreux the tiger has built his lair at the apex of the island of feydeau with the windows of the hotel facing straight down the loire from here there is a magnificent view downstream upon the quays which are now deserted and upon the once prosperous port of nantes  the staircase of the hotel which leads up to the apartments of the proconsul is crowded every day and all day with suppliants and with petitioners with the citizens of the household and the members of the compagnie marat  but no one has access to the person of the dictator he stands aloof apart hidden from the eyes of the world a mysterious personality whose word sends hundreds to their death whose arbitrary will has reduced a once flourishing city to abject poverty and squalor no tyrant has ever surrounded himself with a greater paraphernalia of pomp and circumstanceno aristo has ever dwelt in greater luxury the spoils of churches and chateaux fill the hôtel de la villestreux from attic to cellar gold and silver plate adorn his table priceless works of art hang upon his walls he lolls on couches and chairs which have been the restingplace of kings the wholesale spoliation of the entire countryside has filled the demagogues abode with all that is most sumptuous in the land  and he himself is far more inaccessible than was le roi soleil in the days of his most towering arrogance than were the popes in the glorious days of mediæval rome jean baptiste carrier the son of a small farmer the obscure deputy for cantal in the national convention dwells in the hôtel de la villestreux as in a stronghold no one is allowed near him save a fewa very fewintimates his valet two or three women fleury the commander of the marats and that strange and abominable youngster jacques lalouët about whom the chroniclers of that tragic epoch can tell us so littlea cynical young braggart said to be a cousin of robespierre and the son of a midwife of nantes beardless handsome and vicious the only human beingso we are toldwho had any influence over the sinister proconsul mere hangeron of carrier or spy of the national convention no one can saya malignant personality which has remained an enigma and a mystery to this hour  none but these few are ever allowed now inside the inner sanctuary wherein dwells and schemes the dictator even lamberty fouquet and the others of the staff are kept at arms length martinroget chauvelin and other strangers are only allowed as far as the anteroom the door of the inner chamber is left open and they hear the proconsuls voice and see his silhouette pass and repass in front of them but that is all  fear of assassinationthe inevitable destiny of the tyranthaunts the mantiger even within the fastnesses of his lair day and night a carriage with four horses stands in readiness on la petite hollande the great open treebordered place at the extreme end of the isle feydeau and on which give the windows of the hôtel de la villestreux day and night the carriage is readywith coachman on the box and postillion in the saddle who are relieved every two hours lest they get sleepy or slackwith luggage in the boot and provisions always kept fresh inside the coach everything always ready lest somethinga warning from a friend or a threat from an enemy or merely a sudden access of unreasoning terror the haunting memory of a bloody actshould decide the tyrant at a moments notice to fly from the scenes of his brutalities   iii  carrier in the small room which he has fitted up for himself as a sumptuous boudoir paces up and down just like a wild beast in its cage and he rubs his large bony hands together with the excitement engendered by his own cruelties by the success of this wholesale butchery which he has invented and carried through  there never was an uglier man than carrier with that long hatchetface of his those abnormally high cheekbones that stiff lanky hair that drooping flaccid mouth and protruding underlip nature seemed to have set herself the task of making the face a true mirror of the soulthe dark and hideous soul on which of a surety satan had already set his stamp but he is dressed with scrupulous carenot to say eleganceand with a display of jewelry the provenance of which is as unjustifiable as that of the works of art which fill his private sanctum in every nook and cranny  in front of the tall window heavy curtains of crimson damask are drawn closely together in order to shut out the light of day the room is in all but total darkness for that is the proconsuls latest caprice that no one shall see him save in semiobscurity  captain fleury has stumbled into the room swearing lustily as he barks his shins against the angle of a priceless louis xv bureau he has to make report on the work done by the compagnie marat fiftythree priests from the department of anjou who have refused to take the new oath of obedience to the government of the republic the redcapped company who tracked them down and arrested them vow that all these calotins have precious objectsmoney jewelry gold plateconcealed about their persons what is to be done about these things are the calotins to be allowed to keep them or to dispose of them for their own profit  carrier is highly delighted what a haul  confiscate everything he cries then ship the whole crowd of that pestilential rabble and dont let me hear another word about them  fleury goes and that same night fiftythree priests are shipped in accordance with the orders of the proconsul and carrier still rubbing his large bony hands contentedly together exclaims with glee  what a torrent eh what a torrent what a revolution  and he sends a letter to robespierre and to the committee of public safety he makes report  public spirit in nantes he writes is magnificent it has risen to the most sublime heights of revolutionary ideals   iv  after the departure of fleury carrier suddenly turned to a slender youth who was standing close by the window gazing out through the folds of the curtain on the fine vista of the loire and the quays which stretched out before him  introduce citizen martinroget into the anteroom now lalouët he said loftily i will hear what he has to say and citizen chauvelin may present himself at the same time  young lalouët lolled across the room smothering a yawn  why should you trouble about all that rabble he said roughly it is nearly dinnertime and you know that the chef hates the soup to be kept waiting  i shall not trouble about them very long replied carrier who had just started picking his teeth with a tiny gold tool open the door boy and let the two men come  lalouët did as he was told the door through which he passed he left wide open he then crossed the anteroom to a further door threw it open and called in a loud voice  citizen chauvelin citizen martinroget  for all the world like the ceremonious audiences at versailles in the days of the great louis  there was sound of eager whisperings of shuffling of feet of chairs dragged across the polished floor young lalouët had already and quite unconcernedly turned his back on the two men who at his call had entered the room  two chairs were placed in front of the door which led to the private sanctuarystill wrapped in religious obscuritywhere carrier sat enthroned the youth curtly pointed to the two chairs then went back to the inner room the two men advanced the full light of midday fell upon them from the tall window on their rightthe pale grey colourless light of december they bowed slightly in the direction of the audience chamber where the vague silhouette of the proconsul was alone visible  the whole thing was a farce martinroget held his lips tightly closed together lest a curse or a sneer escaped them chauvelins face was impenetrablebut it is worthy of note that just one year later when the halfdemented tyrant was in his turn brought before the bar of the convention and sentenced to the guillotine it was citizen chauvelins testimony which weighed most heavily against him  there was silence for a time martinroget and chauvelin were waiting for the dictators word he sat at his desk with the scanty light which filtrated between the curtains immediately behind him his ungainly form with the high shoulders and moplike shaggy hair half swallowed up by the surrounding gloom he was deliberately keeping the other two men waiting and busied himself with turning over desultorily the papers and writing tools upon his desk in the intervals of picking at his teeth and muttering to himself all the time as was his wont young lalouët had resumed his post beside the curtained window and he was giving sundry signs of his growing impatience  at last carrier spoke  and now citizen martinroget he said in tones of that lofty condescension which he loved to affect i am prepared to hear what you have to tell me with regard to the cattle which you brought into our city the other day where are the aristos now and why have they not been handed over to commandant fleury  the girl replied martinroget who had much ado to keep his vehement temper in check and who chose for the moment to ignore the second of carriers peremptory queries the girl is in lodgings in the carrefour de la poissonnerie the house is kept by my sister whose lover was hanged four years ago by the cidevant duc de kernogan for trapping two pigeons a dozen or so lads from our old villagemen who worked with my father and others who were my friendslodge in my sisters house they keep a watchful eye over the wench for the sake of the past for my sake and for the sake of my sister louise the cidevant kernogan woman is wellguarded i am satisfied as to that  and where is the cidevant duc  in the house next doora tavern at the sign of the rat morta place which is none too reputable but the landlordlemoineis a good patriot and he is keeping a close eye on the aristo for me  and now will you tell me citizen rejoined carrier with that unctuous suavity which always veiled a threat will you tell me how it comes that you are keeping a couple of traitors alive all this while at the countrys expense  at mine broke in martinroget curtly  at the countrys expense reiterated the proconsul inflexibly bread is scarce in nantes what traitors eat is stolen from good patriots if you can afford to fill two mouths at your expense i can supply you with some that have never done aught but proclaim their adherence to the republic you have had those two aristos inside the city nearly a week and  only three days interposed martinroget and you must have patience with me citizen carrier remember i have done well by you by bringing such high game to your bag  your high game will be no use to me retorted the other with a harsh laugh if i am not to have the cooking of it you have talked of disgrace for the rabble and of your own desire for vengeance over them but  wait citizen broke in martinroget firmly let us understand one another before i embarked on this business you gave me your promise that no onenot even youwould interfere between me and my booty  and no one has done so hitherto to my knowledge citizen rejoined carrier blandly the kernogan rabble has been yours to do with what you likeerso far he added significantly i said that i would not interfere and i have not done so up to now even though the pestilential crowd stinks in the nostrils of every good patriot in nantes but i dont deny that it was a bargain that you should have a free hand with them  for a time and jean baptiste carrier has never yet gone back on a given word  martinroget made no comment on this peroration he shrugged his broad shoulders and suddenly fell to contemplating the distant landscape he had turned his head away in order to hide the sneer which curled his lips at the recollection of that bargain struck with the imperious proconsul it was a matter of five thousand francs which had passed from one pocket to the other and had bound carrier down to a definite promise  after a brief while carrier resumed at the same time he said my promise was conditional remember i want that cattle out of nantesi want the bread they eati want the room they occupy i cant allow you to play fast and loose with them indefinitelya week is quite long enough  three days corrected martinroget once more  well three days or eight rejoined the other roughly too long in any case i must be rid of them out of this city or i shall have all the spies of the convention about mine ears i am beset with spies citizen martinroget yes even ijean baptiste carrierthe most selfless the most devoted patriot the republic has ever known mine enemies up in paris send spies to dog my footsteps to watch mine every action they are ready to pounce upon me at the slightest slip to denounce me to drag me to their barthey have already whetted the knife of the guillotine which is to lay low the head of the finest patriot in france  hold on hold on jean baptiste my friend here broke in young lalouët with a sneer we dont want protestations of your patriotism just now it is nearly dinner time  carrier had been carried away by his own eloquence at lalouëts mocking words he pulled himself together murmured you young viper in tones of tigerish affection and then turned back to martinroget and resumed more calmly  theyll be saying that i harbour aristos in nantes if i keep that kernogan rabble here any longer so i must be rid of them citizen martinroget  say within the next fourandtwenty hours he paused for a moment or two then added drily that is my last word and you must see to it what is it you do want to do with them enfin  i want their death replied martinroget with a curse and he brought his heavy fist crashing down upon the arm of his chair but not a martyrs death understand i dont want the pathetic figure of yvonne kernogan and her father to remain as a picture of patient resignation in the hearts and minds of every other aristo in the land i dont want it to excite pity or admiration death is nothing for such as they they glory in it they are proud to die the guillotine is their final triumph what i want for them is shame  degradation  a sensational trial that will cover them with dishonour i want their name dragged in the mirethemselves an object of derision or of loathing i want articles in the moniteur giving account of the trial of the cidevant duc de kernogan and his daughter for something that is ignominious and base i want shame and mud slung at themnoise and beating of drums to proclaim their dishonour noise noise that will reach every corner of the land aye that will reach coblentz and germany and england it is that which they would resentthe shame of itthe disgrace to their name  tshaw exclaimed carrier why dont you marry the wench citizen martinroget that would be disgrace enough for her ill warrant he added with a loud laugh enchanted at his witticism  i would tomorrow replied the other who chose to ignore the coarse insult if she would consent that is why i have kept her at my sisters house these three days  bah you have no need of a traitors consent my consent is sufficient ill give it if you like the laws of the republic permit nay desire every good patriot to ally himself with an aristo if he have a mind and the kernogan wench face to face with the guillotineor worsewould surely prefer your embraces citizen what  a deep frown settled between martinrogets glowering eyes and gave his face a sinister expression  i wonder  he muttered between his teeth  then cease wondering citizen retorted carrier cynically and try our republican marriage on your kernogans  thief linked to aristo cutthroat to a proud wench  and then the loire shame dishonour fal lal i say death swift and sure and unerring nothing better has yet been invented for traitors  martinroget shrugged his shoulders  you have never known he said quietly what it is to hate  carrier uttered an exclamation of impatience  bah he said that is all talk and nonsense theories what citizen chauvelin is a living example of the futility of all that rubbish he too has an enemy it seems whom he hates more thoroughly than any good patriot has ever hated the enemies of the republic and hath this deadly hatred availed him forsooth he too wanted the disgrace and dishonour of that confounded englishman whom i would simply have tossed into the loire long ago without further process what is the result the englishman is over in england safe and sound making long noses at citizen chauvelin who has much ado to keep his own head out of the guillotine  martinroget once more was silent a look of sullen obstinacy had settled upon his face  you may be right citizen carrier he muttered after awhile  i am always right broke in carrier curtly  exactly  but i have your promise  and ill keep it as i have said for another four and twenty hours curse you for a mulish fool added the proconsul with a snarl what in the dls name do you want to do you have talked a vast deal of rubbish but you have told me nothing of your plans have you any  that are worthy of my attention   v  martinroget rose from his seat and began pacing up and down the narrow room his nerves were obviously on edge it was difficult for any manlet alone one of his temperament and halftutored dispositionto remain calm and deferential in face of the overbearance of this brutal jackinoffice martinrogethimself an upstartloathed the offensive selfassertion of that uneducated and bestial parvenu who had become allpowerful through the sole might of his savagery and it cost him a mighty effort to keep a violent retort from escaping his lipsa retort which probably would have cost him his head  chauvelin on the other hand appeared perfectly unconcerned he possessed the art of outward placidity to a masterly degree throughout all this while he had taken no part in the discussion he sat silent and all but motionless facing the darkened room in front of him as if he had done nothing else in all his life but interview great dictators who chose to keep their sacred persons in the dark only from time to time did his slender fingers drum a tattoo on the arm of his chair  carrier had resumed his interesting occupation of picking his teeth his long thin legs were stretched out before him from beneath his flaccid lids he shot swift glances upwards whenever martinroget in his restless pacing crossed and recrossed in front of the open door but anon when the latter came to a halt under the lintel and with his foot almost across the threshold young lalouët was upon him in an instant barring the way to the inner sanctum  keep your distance citizen he said drily no one is allowed to enter here  instinctively martinroget had drawn backsuddenly awed despite himself by the air of mystery which hung over that darkened room and by the dim silhouette of the sinister tyrant who at his approach had with equal suddenness cowered in his lair drawing his limbs together and thrusting his head forward low down over the desk like a leopard crouching for a spring but this spell of awe only lasted a few seconds during which martinrogets unsteady gaze encountered the halfmocking wholly supercilious glance of young lalouët  the next he had recovered his presence of mind but this crowning act of audacious insolence broke the barrier of his selfrestraint an angry oath escaped him  are we he exclaimed roughly back in the days of capet the tyrant and of versailles that patriots and citizens are treated like menials and obtrusive slaves pardieu citizen carrier let me tell you this  pardieu citizen martinroget retorted carrier with a growl like that of a savage dog let me tell you that for less than two pins ill throw you into the next barge that will float with open portholes down the loire get out of my presence you swine ere i call fleury to throw you out  martinroget at the insult and the threat had become as pale as the linen at his throat a cold sweat broke out upon his forehead and he passed his hand two or three times across his brow like a man dazed with a sudden and violent blow his nerves already overstrained and very much on edge gave way completely he staggered and would have measured his length across the floor but that his hand encountered the back of his chair and he just contrived to sink into it sick and faint horrorstruck and pallid  a low cacklesomething like a laughbroke from chauvelins thin lips as usual he had witnessed the scene quite unmoved  my friend martinroget forgot himself for the moment citizen carrier he said suavely already he is ready to make amends  jacques lalouët looked down for a moment with infinite scorn expressed in his fine eyes on the presumptuous creature who had dared to defy the omnipotent representative of the people then he turned on his heel but he did not go far this time he remained standing close beside the doorthe terrier guarding his master  carrier laughed loud and long it was a hideous strident laugh which had not a tone of merriment in it  wake up friend martinroget he said harshly i bear no malice i am a good dog when i am treated the right way but if anyone pulls my tail or treads on my paws why i snarl and growl of course if the offence is repeated  i bite  remember that and now let us resume our discourse though i confess i am getting tired of your kernogan rabble  while the great man spoke martinroget had succeeded in pulling himself together his throat felt parched his hands hot and moist he was like a man who had been stumbling along a road in the dark and been suddenly pulled up on the edge of a yawning abyss into which he had all but fallen with a few harsh words with a monstrous insult carrier had made him feel the gigantic power which could hurl any man from the heights of selfassurance and of ambition to the lowest depths of degradation he had shown him the glint of steel upon the guillotine  he had been hit as with a sledgehammerthe blow hurt terribly for it had knocked all his selfesteem into nothingness and pulverised his selfconceit it had in one moment turned him into a humble and cringing sycophant  i had no mind he began tentatively to give offence my thoughts were bent on the kernogans they are a fine haul for us both citizen carrier and i worked hard and long to obtain their confidence over in england and to induce them to come with me to nantes  no one denies that you have done well retorted carrier gruffly and not yet wholly pacified if the haul had not been worth having you would have received no help from me  i have shown my gratitude for your help citizen carrier i would show it again  more substantially if you desire  he spoke slowly and quite deferentially but the suggestion was obvious carrier looked up into his face the light of measureless cupiditythe cupidity of the coarsegrained enriched peasantglittered in his pale eyes it was by a great effort of will that he succeeded in concealing his eagerness beneath his habitual air of lofty condescension  eh what he queried airily  if another five thousand francs is of any use to you  you seem passing rich citizen martinroget sneered carrier  i have slaved and saved for four years what i have amassed i will sacrifice for the completion of my revenge  well rejoined carrier with an expressive wave of the hand it certainly is not good for a pureminded republican to own too much wealth have we not fought he continued with a grandiloquent gesture for equality of fortune as well as of privileges  a sardonic laugh from young lalouët broke in on the proconsuls eloquent effusion  carrier swore as was his wont but after a second or two he began again more quietly  i will accept a further six thousand francs from you citizen martinroget in the name of the republic and all her needs the republic of france is up in arms against the entire world she hath need of men of arms of  oh cut that interposed young lalouët roughly  but the overvain high and mighty despot who was ready to lash out with unbridled fury against the slightest show of disrespect on the part of any other man only laughed at the boys impudence  curse you you young viper he said with that rude familiarity which he seemed to reserve for the boy you presume too much on my forbearance these children you know citizen name of a dog he added roughly we are wasting time what was i saying   that you would take six thousand francs replied martinroget curtly in return for further help in the matter of the kernogans  why yes rejoined carrier blandly i was forgetting but ill show you what a good dog i am ill help you with those kernogans  but you mistook my words citizen tis ten thousand francs you must pour into the coffers of the republic for her servants will have to be placed at the disposal of your private schemes of vengeance  ten thousand francs is a large sum said martinroget let me hear what you will do for me for that  he had regained something of his former complacency the man who buysbe it goods consciences or servicesis always for the moment master of the man who sells carrier despite his dictatorial ways felt this disadvantage no doubt for his tone was more bland his manner less curt only young jacques lalouët stood bylike a snarling terrierstill arrogant and still disdainfulthe master of the situationseeing that neither schemes of vengeance nor those of corruption had ruffled his selfassurance he remained beside the door ready to pounce on either of the two intruders if they showed the slightest sign of forgetting the majesty of the great proconsul   vi  i told you just now citizen martinroget resumed carrier after a brief pause and i suppose you knew it already that i am surrounded with spies  spies citizen murmured martinroget somewhat taken aback by this sudden irrelevance i didnt know  i imagine any one in your position  thats just it broke in carrier roughly my position is envied by those who are less competent less patriotic than i am nantes is swarming with spies mine enemies in paris are working against me they want to undermine the confidence which the national convention reposes in her accredited representative  preposterous ejaculated young lalouët solemnly  well rejoined carrier with a savage oath you would have thought that the convention would be only too thankful to get a strong man at the head of affairs in this hotbed of treason and of rebellion you would have thought that it was no ones affair to interfere with the manner in which i administer the powers that have been given me i command in nantes what yet some busybodies up in paris some fools seem to think that we are going too fast in nantes they have become weaklings over there since marat has gone it seems that they have heard rumours of our flatbottomed barges and of our fine republican marriages apparently they disapprove of both they dont realise that we have to purge an entire city of every kind of rabbletraitors as well as criminals they dont understand my aspirations my ideals he added loftily and with a wide sweeping gesture of his arm which is to make nantes a model city to free her from the taint of crime and of treachery and  an impatient exclamation from young lalouët once again broke in on carriers rhetoric and martinroget was able to slip in the query which had been hovering on his lips  and is this relevant citizen carrier he asked to the subject which we have been discussing  it is replied carrier drily as you will see in a moment learn then that it has been my purpose for some time to silence mine enemies by sending to the national convention a tangible reply to all the accusations which have been levelled against me it is my purpose to explain to the assembly my reasons for mine actions in nantes my drownages my republican marriages all the coercive measures which i have been forced to take in order to purge the city from all that is undesirable  and think you citizen carrier queried martinroget without the slightest trace of a sneer that up in paris they will understand your explanations  yes they willthey must when they realise that everything that i have done has been necessitated by the exigencies of public safety  they will be slow to realise that mused the other the national convention today is not what the constitutional assembly was in 92 it has become soft and sentimental many there are who will disapprove of your doings robespierre talks loftily of the dignity of the republic  her impartial justice the girondins  carrier interposed with a coarse imprecation he suddenly leaned forward sprawling right across the desk a shaft of light from between the damask curtains caught the end of his nose and the tip of his protruding chin distorting his face and making it seem grotesque as well as hideous in the dim light he appeared excited and inflated with vanity he always gloried in the atrocities which he committed and though he professed to look with contempt on every one of his colleagues he was always glad of an opportunity to display his inventive powers before them and to obtain their fulsome eulogy  i know well enough what they talk about in paris he said but i have an answera substantial definite answer for all their rubbish dignity of the republic bah impartial justice tis force strength spartan vigour that we want  and ill show them listen to my plan citizen martinroget and see how it will work in with yours my idea is to collect together all the most disreputable and notorious evildoers of this city  there are plenty in the entrepôt at the present moment and there are plenty more still at large in the streets of nantesthieves malefactors forgers of state bonds assassins and women of evil fame  and to send them in a batch to paris to appear before the committee of public safety whilst i will send to my colleagues there a letter couched in terms of gentle reproach see i shall say what i have to contend with in nantes see the moral pestilence that infests the city these evildoers are but a few among the hundreds and thousands of whom i am vainly trying to purge this city which you have entrusted to my care they wont know how to deal with the rabble he continued with his harsh strident laugh they may send them to the guillotine wholesale or deport them to cayenne and they will have to give them some semblance of a trial in any case but they will have to admit that my severe measures are justified and in future i imagine they will leave me more severely alone  if as you say urged martinroget the national convention give your crowd a trial you will have to produce some witnesses  so i will retorted carrier cynically so i will have i not said that i will round up all the most noted evildoers in the town there are plenty of them i assure you lately my company marat have not greatly troubled about them after savenay there was such a crowd of rebels to deal with there was no room in our prisons for malefactors as well but we can easily lay our hands on a couple of hundred or so and members of the municipality or of the district council or tradespeople of substance in the city will only be too glad to be rid of them and will testify against those that were actually caught redhanded not one but has suffered from the pestilential rabble that has infested the streets at night and lately i have been pestered with complaints of all these nightbirdsmen and women and  suddenly he paused he had caught martinrogets feverish gaze fixed excitedly upon him whereupon he leaned back in his chair threw his head back and broke into loud and immoderate laughter  by the devil and all his myrmidons citizen he said as soon as he had recovered his breath meseems you have tumbled to my meaning as a pig into a heap of garbage is not ten thousand francs far too small a sum to pay for such a perfect realisation of all your dreams well send the kernogan girl and her father to paris with the herd what i promise you that such filth and mud will be thrown on them and on their precious name that no one will care to bear it for centuries to come  martinroget of a truth had much ado to control his own excitement as the proconsul unfolded his infamous plan he had at once seen as in a vision the realisation of all his hopes what more awful humiliation what more dire disgrace could be devised for proud kernogan and his daughter than being herded together with the vilest scum that could be gathered together among the flotsam and jetsam of the population of a seaport town what more perfect retaliation could there be for the ignominious death of jean adet the miller  martinroget leaned forward in his chair the hideous figure of carrier was no longer hideous to him he saw in that misshapen gawky form the very embodiment of the god of vengeance the wielder of the flail of retributive justice which was about to strike the guilty at last  you are right citizen carrier he said and his voice was thick and hoarse with excitement he rested his elbow on his knee and his chin in his hand he hammered his nails against his teeth that was exactly in my mind while you spoke  i am always right retorted carrier loftily no one knows better than i do how to deal with traitors  and how is the whole thing to be accomplished the wench is in my sisters house at present  the father is in the rat mort  and the rat mort is an excellent place i know of none better it is one of the worstfamed houses in the whole of nantes  the meetingplace of all the vagabonds the thieves and the cutthroats of the city  yes i know that to my cost my sisters house is next door to it at night the street is not safe for decent females to be abroad and though there is a platoon of marats on guard at le bouffay close by they do nothing to free the neighbourhood of that pest  bah retorted carrier with cynical indifference they have more important quarry to net rebels and traitors swarm in nantes what commandant fleury has had no time hitherto to waste on mere cutthroats although i had thoughts before now of razing the place to the ground citizen lamberty has his lodgings on the other side and he does nothing but complain of the brawls that go on there o nights sure it is that while a stone of the rat mort remains standing all the nighthawks of nantes will congregate around it and brew mischief there which is no good to me and no good to the republic  yes i know all about the rat mort i found a nights shelter there four years ago when  when the cidevant duc de kernogan was busy hanging your fatherthe millerfor a crime which he never committed well then citizen martinroget continued carrier with one of his hideous leers since you know the rat mort so well what say you to your fair and stately yvonne de kernogan and her father being captured there in the company of the lowest scum of the population of nantes  you mean  murmured martinroget who had become livid with excitement  i mean that my marats have orders to raid some of the haunts of our nantese cutthroats and that they may as well begin tonight and with the rat mort they will make a descent on the house and a thorough perquisition and every personman woman and childfound on the premises will be arrested and sent with a batch of malefactors to paris there to be tried as felons and criminals and deported to cayenne where they will i trust rot as convicts in that pestilential climate think you concluded the odious creature with a sneer that when put face to face with the alternative your kernogan wench will still refuse to become the wife of a fine patriot like yourself  i dont know murmured martinroget i  i  but i do know broke in carrier roughly that ten thousand francs is far too little to pay for so brilliant a realisation of all ones hopes ten thousand francs tis an hundred thousand you should give to show your gratitude  martinroget rose and stretched his large heavy figure to its full height he was at great pains to conceal the utter contempt which he felt for the abominable wretch before whom he was forced to cringe  you shall have ten thousand francs citizen carrier he said slowly it is all that i possess in the world nowthe last remaining fragment of a sum of twentyfive thousand francs which i earned and scraped together for the past four years you have had five thousand francs already and you shall have the other ten i do not grudge it if twenty years of my life were any use to you i would give you that in exchange for the help you are giving me in what means far more than life to me  the proconsul laughed and shrugged his shouldersof a truth he thought citizen martinroget an awful fool  very well then he said we will call the matter settled i confess that it amuses me although remember that i have warned you with all these aristos i believe in the potency of my barges rather than in your elaborate schemes still it shall never be said that jean baptiste carrier has left a friend in the lurch  i am grateful for your help citizen carrier said martinroget coldly then he added slowly as if reviewing the situation in his own mind tonight you say  yes tonight my marats under the command of citizen fleury will make a descent upon the rat mort those shall be my orders the place will be swept clean of every man woman and child who is inside if your two kernogans are there  well he said with a cynical laugh and a shrug of his shoulders they can be sent up to paris with the rest of the herd  the dinner bell has gone long ago here interposed young lalouët drily the soup will be stonecold and the chef redhot with anger  you are right citizen lalouët said carrier as he leaned back in his chair once more and stretched out his long legs at his ease we have wasted far too much time already over the affairs of a couple of aristos who ought to have been at the bottom of the loire a week ago the audience is ended he added airily and he made a gesture of overweening condescension for all the world like the one wherewith the grand monarque was wont to dismiss his courtiers  chauvelin rose too and quietly turned to the door he had not spoken a word for the past halfhour ever since in fact he had put in a conciliatory word on behalf of his impetuous colleague whether he had taken an active interest in the conversation or not it were impossible to say but now just as he was ready to go and young lalouët prepared to close the doors of the audience chamber something seemed suddenly to occur to him and he called somewhat peremptorily to the young man  one moment citizen he said  what is it now queried the youth insolently and from his fine eyes there shot a glance of contempt on the meagre figure of the once powerful terrorist  about the kernogan wench continued chauvelin she will have to be conveyed some time before night to the tavern next door there may be agencies at work on her behalf  agencies broke in the boy gruffly what agencies  oh said chauvelin vaguely we all know that aristos have powerful friends these days it will not be over safe to take the girl across after dark from one house to another  the alley is badly lighted the wench will not go willingly she might scream and create a disturbance and draw  er  those same unknown agencies to her rescue i think a body of marats should be told off to convey her to the rat mort  young lalouët shrugged his shoulders  thats your affair he said curtly eh carrier and he glanced over his shoulder at the proconsul who at once assented  martinrogetstruck by his colleagues argumentwould have interposed but carrier broke in with one of his uncontrolled outbursts of fury  ah ça he exclaimed enough of this now citizen lalouët is right and i have done enough for you already if you want the kernogan wench to be at the rat mort you must see to getting her there yourself she is next door what i wont have anything to do with it and i wont have my marats implicated in the affair either name of a dog have i not told you that i am beset with spies it would of a truth be a climax if i was denounced as having dragged aristos to a house of illfame and then had them arrested there as malefactors now out with you i have had enough of this if your rabble is at the rat mort tonight they shall be arrested with all the other cutthroats that is my last word the rest is your affair lalouët the door  and without another word and without listening to further protests from martinroget or chauvelin jacques lalouët closed the doors of the audience chamber in their face   vii  outside on the landing martinroget swore a violent all comprehensive oath  to think that we are under the heel of that skunk he said  and that in the pursuit of our own ends we have need of his help added chauvelin with a sigh  if it were not for that and even now continued martinroget moodily i doubt what i can do yvonne de kernogan will not follow me willingly either to the rat mort or elsewhere and if i am not to have her conveyed by the guard  he paused and swore again his companions silence appeared to irritate him  what do you advise me to do citizen chauvelin he asked  for the moment replied chauvelin imperturbably i should advise you to join me in a walk along the quay as far as le bouffay i have work to see to inside the building and the northwesterly wind is sure to be of good counsel  an angry retort hovered on martinrogets lips but after a second or two he succeeded in holding his irascible temper in check he gave a quick sigh of impatience  very well he said curtly let us to le bouffay by all means i have much to think on and as you say the northwesterly wind may blow away the cobwebs which for the nonce do oercloud my brain  and the two men wrapped their mantles closely round their shoulders for the air was keen then they descended the staircase of the hotel and went out into the street     chapter ii  le bouffay   i  in the centre of the place the guillotine stood idlethe paint had worn off her sidesshe looked weatherbeaten and forlornstern and forbidding still but in a kind of sullen loneliness with the ugly stains of crimson on her turned to rust and grime  the place itself was deserted in strange contrast to the bustle and the movement which characterised it in the days when the death of men women and children was a daily spectacle here for the crowd then a constant stream of traffic of carts and of tumbrils of soldiers and gaffers encumbered it in every corner now a few tumbledown booths set up against the frontage of the grim edificeonce the stronghold of the dukes of brittany now little else but a huge prisona few vendors and still fewer purchasers of the scanty wares displayed under their ragged awnings one or two idlers loafing against the mudstained walls one or two urchins playing in the gutters were the only signs of life martinroget with his colleague chauvelin turned into the place from the quaythey walked rapidly and kept their mantles closely wrapped under their chin for the afternoon had turned bitterly cold it was then close upon five oclocka dark moonless starless night had set in with only a suspicion of frost in the damp air but a blustering northwesterly wind blowing down the river and tearing round the narrow streets and the open place caused passersby to muffle themselves shivering yet tighter in their cloaks  martinroget was talking volubly and excitedly his tall broad figure towering above the slender form of his companion from time to time he tossed his mantle aside with an impatient febrile gesture and then paused in the middle of the place with one hand on the other mans shoulder marking a point in his discourse or emphasising his argument with short staccato sentences and brief emphatic words chauvelinplacid and impenetrable as usuallistened much and talked little he was ready to stand still or to walk along just as his colleagues mood demanded in the darkness and with the collar of a large mantle pulled tightly up to his ears it was impossible to guess by any sign in his face what was going on in his mind  they were a strange contrast these two mentemperamentally as well as physicallyeven though they had so much in common and were both the direct products of that same social upheaval which was shaking the archaic dominion of france to its very foundations martinroget tall broadshouldered bullnecked the typical selfeducated peasant with square jaw and flat head with wide bony hands and spatulated fingers and chauvelinthe aristocrat turned demagogue thin and fraillooking bland of manner and suave of speech with delicate hands and pale almost ascetic face  the one represented all that was most brutish and sensual in this fight of one caste against the other the thirst for the others blood the human beast that has been brought to bay through wrongs perpetrated against it by others and has turned upon its oppressors lashing out right and left with blind and lustful fury at the crowd of tyrants that had kept him in subjection for so long whilst chauvelin was the personification of the spiritual side of this bloody revolutionthe spirit of cool and calculating reprisals that would demand an eye for an eye and see that it got two the idealist who dreams of the righteousness of his own cause and the destruction of its enemies but who leaves to others the accomplishment of all the carnage and the bloodshed which his idealism has demanded and which his reason has appraised as necessary for the triumph of which he dreams chauvelin was the man of thought and martinroget the man of action with the one revenge and reprisals were selfish desires the avenging of wrongs done to himself or to his caste hatred for those who had injured him or his kindred the other had no personal feelings of hatred he had no personal wrongs to avenge his enemies were the enemies of his party the erstwhile tyrants who in the past had oppressed an entire people every man woman or child who was not satisfied with the present reign of terror who plotted or planned for its overthrow who was not ready to see husband father wife or child sacrificed for the ultimate triumph of the revolution was in chauvelins sight a noxious creature fit only to be trodden under heel and ground into subjection or annihilation as a danger to the state  martinroget was the personification of sansculottism of rough manners and foul speechhe chafed against the conventions which forced him to wear decent clothes and boots on his feethe would gladly have seen every one go about the streets halfnaked unwashed a living sign of that downward levelling of castes which he and his friends stood for and for which they had fought and striven and committed every crime which human passions let loose could invent chauvelin on the other hand was one of those who wore fine linen and buckled shoes and whose hands were delicately washed and perfumed whilst they signed decrees which sent hundreds of women and children to a violent and cruel death  the one trod in the paths of danton the other followed in the footsteps of robespierre   ii  together the two men mounted the outside staircase which leads up past the lodge of the concierge and through the clerks office to the interior of the stronghold outside the monumental doors they had to wait a moment or two while the clerk examined their permits to enter  will you come into my office with me asked chauvelin of his companion i have a word or two to add to my report for the paris courier tonight i wont be long  you are still in touch with the committee of public safety then asked martinroget  always replied the other curtly  martinroget threw a quick suspicious glance on his companion darkness and the broad brim of his sugarloaf hat effectually concealed even the outlines of chauvelins face and martinroget fell to musing over one or two things which carrier had blurted out awhile ago the whole of france was overrun with spies these daysevery one was under suspicion every one had to be on his guard every word was overheard every glance seen every sign noted  what was this man chauvelin doing here in nantes what reports did he send up to paris by special courier he the miserable failure who had ceased to count was nevertheless in constant touch with that awful committee of public safety which was wont to strike at all times and unexpectedly in the dark martinroget shivered beneath his mantle for the first time since his schemes of vengeance had wholly absorbed his mind he regretted the freedom and safety which he had enjoyed in england and he marvelled if the miserable game which he was playing would be worth the winning in the end nevertheless he had followed chauvelin without comment the man appeared to exercise a fascination over hima kind of subtle power which emanated from his small shrunken figure from his pale keen eyes and his wellmodulated suave mode of speech   iii  the clerk had handed the two men their permits back they were allowed to pass through the gates  in the hall some halfdozen men were nominally on guardnominally because discipline was not over strict these days and the men sat or lolled about the place two of them were intent on a game of dominoes another was watching them whilst the other three were settling some sort of quarrel among themselves which necessitated vigorous and emphatic gestures and the copious use of expletives one man who appeared to be in command divided his time impartially between the dominoplayers and those who were quarrelling  the vast place was insufficiently lighted by a chandelier which hung from the ceiling and a couple of small oillamps placed in the circular niches in the wall opposite the front door  no one took any notice of martinroget or of chauvelin as they crossed the hall and presently the latter pushed open a door on the left of the main gates and held it open for his colleague to pass through  you are sure that i shall not be disturbing you queried martinroget  quite sure replied the other curtly and there is something which i must say to you  where i know that i shall not be overheard  then he followed martinroget into the room and closed the door behind him the room was scantily furnished with a square deal table in the centre two or three chairs a brokendown bureau leaning against one wall and an iron stove wherein a meagre fire sent a stream of malodorous smoke through sundry cracks in its chimneypipe from the ceiling there hung an oillamp the light of which was thrown down upon the table by a large green shade made of cardboard  chauvelin drew a chair to the bureau and sat down he pointed to another and martinroget took a seat beside the table he felt restless and excitedhis nerves all on the jar his colleagues calm sardonic glance acted as a further irritant to his temper  what is it that you wished to say to me citizen chauvelin he asked at last  just a word citizen replied the other in his quiet urbane manner i have accompanied you faithfully on your journey to england i have placed my feeble powers at your disposal awhile ago i stood between you and the proconsuls wrath this i think has earned me the right of asking what you intend to do  i dont know about the right retorted martinroget gruffly but i dont mind telling you as you remarked awhile ago the northwest wind is wont to be of good counsel i have thought the matter over whilst i walked with you along the quay and i have decided to act on carriers suggestion our eminent proconsul said just now that it was the duty of every true patriot to marry an aristo an he be free and chance puts a comely wench in his way i mean he added with a cynical laugh to act on that advice and marry yvonne de kernogan  if i can  she has refused you up to now  yes  up to now  you have threatened herand her father  yesboth not only with death but with shame  and still she refuses  apparently said martinroget with evergrowing irritation  it is often difficult rejoined chauvelin meditatively to compel these aristos they are obstinate  oh dont forget that i am in a position now to bring additional pressure on the wench that lout carrier has splendid ideasa brute what but clever and full of resource that suggestion of his about the rat mort is splendid  you mean to try and act on it  of course i do said martinroget roughly i am going over presently to my sisters house to see the kernogan wench again and to have another talk with her then if she still refuses if she still chooses to scorn the honourable position which i offer her i shall act on carriers suggestion it will be at the rat mort tonight that she and i will have our final interview and there when i dangle the prospect of cayenne and the convicts brand before her she may not prove so obdurate as she has been up to now  hm that is as may be was chauvelins dry comment personally i am inclined to agree with carrier death swift and surethe loire or the guillotineis the best that has yet been invented for traitors and aristos but we wont discuss that again i know your feelings in the matter and in a measure i respect them but if you will allow me i would like to be present at your interview with the soidisant lady anthony dewhurst i wont disturb you and i wont say a word  but there is something i would like to make sure of  what is that  whether the wench has any hopes  said chauvelin slowly whether she has received a message or has any premonition  whether in short she thinks that outside agencies are at work on her behalf  tshaw exclaimed martinroget impatiently you are still harping on that scarlet pimpernel idea  i am retorted the other drily  as you please but understand citizen chauvelin that i will not allow you to interfere with my plans whilst you go off on one of those wildgoose chases which have already twice brought you into disrepute  i will not interfere with your plans citizen rejoined chauvelin with unwonted gentleness but let me in my turn impress one thing upon you and that is that unless you are as wary as the serpent as cunning as the fox all your precious plans will be upset by that interfering englishman whom you choose to disregard  what do you mean  i mean that i know himto my costand you do not but you will an i am not gravely mistaken make acquaintance with him ere your great adventure with these kernogan people is successfully at an end believe me citizen martinroget he added impressively you would have been far wiser to accept carriers suggestion and let him fling that rabble into the loire for you  pshaw you are not childish enough to imagine citizen chauvelin that your englishman can spirit away that wench from under my sisters eyes do you know what my sister suffered at the hands of the kernogans do you think that she is like to forget my fathers ignominious death any more than i am and she mourns a lover as well as a fathershe mourns her youth her happiness the mother whom she worshipped think you a better gaoler could be found anywhere and there are friends of minelads of our own village men who hate the kernogans as bitterly as i do myselfwho are only too ready to lend louise a hand in case of violence and after thatsuppose your magnificent scarlet pimpernel succeeded in hoodwinking my sister and in evading the vigilance of a score of determined village lads who would sooner die one by one than see the kernogan escapesuppose all that i say there would still be the guard at every city gate to challenge no no it couldnt be done citizen chauvelin he added with a complacent laugh your englishman would need the help of a legion of angels what to get the wench out of nantes this time  chauvelin made no comment on his colleagues impassioned harangue memory had taken him back to that one day in september in boulogne when he too had set one prisoner to guard a precious hostage it brought back to his mind a vision of a strangely picturesque figure as it appeared to him in the windowembrasure of the old castlehall1 it brought back to his ears the echo of that quaint irresponsible laughter of that lazy drawling speech of all that had acted as an irritant on his nerves ere he found himself baffled foiled eating out his heart with vain reproach at his own folly  i see you are unconvinced citizen martinroget he said quietly and i know that it is the fashion nowadays among young politicians to sneer at chauvelinthe living embodiment of failure but let me just add this when you and i talked matters over together at the bottom inn in the wilds of somersetshire i warned you that not only was your identity known to the man who calls himself the scarlet pimpernel but also that he knew every one of your plans with regard to the kernogan wench and her father you laughed at me then  do you remember you shrugged your shoulders and jeered at what you call my farfetched ideas  just as you do now well will you let me remind you of what happened within fourandtwenty hours of that warning which you chose to disregard  yvonne de kernogan was married to lord anthony dewhurst and  i know all that man broke in martinroget impatiently it was all a mere coincidence  the marriage must have been planned long before that  your scarlet pimpernel could not possibly have had anything to do with it  perhaps not rejoined chauvelin drily but mark what has happened since just now when we crossed the place i saw in the distance a figure flitting pastthe gorgeous figure of an exquisite who of a surety is a stranger in nantes and carried upon the wings of the northwesterly wind there came to me the sound of a voice which of late i have only heard in my dreams on my soul citizen martinroget he added with earnest emphasis i assure you that the scarlet pimpernel is in nantes at the present moment that he is scheming plotting planning to rescue the kernogan wench out of your clutches he will not leave her in your power on this i would stake my life she is the wife of one of his dearest friends he will not abandon her not while he keeps that resourceful head of his on his shoulders unless you are desperately careful he will outwit you of that i am as convinced as that i am alive  bah you have been dreaming citizen chauvelin rejoined martinroget with a laugh and shrugging his broad shoulders your mysterious englishman in nantes why man the navigation of the loire has been totally prohibited these last fourteen daysno carriage van or vehicle of any kind is allowed to enter the cityno man woman or child to pass the barriers without special permit signed either by the proconsul himself or by fleury the captain of the marats why even i when i brought the kernogans in overland from le croisic i was detained two hours outside nantes while my papers were sent in to carrier for inspection you know that you were with me  i know it replied chauvelin drily and yet  he paused with one clawlike finger held erect to demand attention the door of the small room in which they sat gave on the big hall where the halfdozen marats were stationed the single window at right angles to the door looked out upon the place below it was from there that suddenly there came the sound of a loud peal of laughterquaint and merrysomewhat inane and affected and at the sound chauvelins pale face took on the hue of ashes and even martinroget felt a strange sensation of cold creeping down his spine  for a few seconds the two men remained quite still as if a spell had been cast over them through that lighthearted peal of rippling laughter then equally suddenly the younger man shook himself free of the spell with a few long strides he was already at the door and out in the vast hall chauvelin following closely on his heels   iv  the clock in the tower of the edifice was even then striking five the marats in the hall looked up with lazy indifference at the two men who had come rushing out in such an abrupt and excited manner  any stranger been through here queried chauvelin peremptorily of the sergeant in command  no replied the latter curtly how could they without a permit  he shrugged his shoulders and the men resumed their game and their argument martinroget would have parleyed with them but chauvelin had already crossed the hall and was striding past the clerks office and the lodge of the concierge out toward the open martinroget after a moments hesitation followed him  the place was wrapped in gloom from the platform of the guillotine an oillamp hoisted on a post threw a small circle of light around small pieces of tallow candle set in pewter sconces glimmered feebly under the awnings of the booths and there was a streetlamp affixed to the wall of the old château immediately below the parapet of the staircase and others at the angles of the rue de la monnaye and the narrow ruelle des jacobins  chauvelins keen eyes tried to pierce the surrounding darkness he leaned over the parapet and peered into the remote angles of the building and round the booths below him  there were a few people on the place some walking rapidly across from one end to the other intent on business others pausing in order to make purchases at the booths up and down the steps of the guillotine a group of street urchins were playing hideandseek round the angles of the narrow streets the vague figures of passersby flitted to and fro now easily discernible in the light of the street lanthorns anon swallowed up again in the darkness beyond whilst immediately below the parapet two or three men of the company marat were lounging against the walls their red bonnets showed up clearly in the flickering light of the street lamps as did their bare shins and the polished points of their sabots but of an elegant picturesque figure such as chauvelin had described awhile ago there was not a sign  martinroget leaned over the parapet and called peremptorily  hey there citizens of the company marat  one of the redcapped men looked up leisurely  your desire citizen he queried with insolent deliberation for they were mighty men this bodyguard of the great proconsul his spies and tools in the awesome work of frightfulness which he carried on so ruthlessly  is that you paul friche queried martinroget in response  at your service citizen came the glib reply delivered not without mock deference  then come up here i wish to speak with you  i cant leave my post nor can my mates retorted the man who had answered to the name of paul friche come down citizen an you desire to speak with us  martinroget swore lustily  the insolence of that rabble  he murmured  hush ill go interposed chauvelin quickly do you know that man friche is he trustworthy  yes i know him as for being trustworthy  added martinroget with a shrug of the shoulders he is a corporal in the marats and high in favour with commandant fleury  every second was of value and chauvelin was not the man to waste time in useless parleyings he ran down the stairs at the foot of which one of the redcapped gentry deigned to speak with him  have you seen any strangers across the place just now he queried in a whisper  yes replied the man friche two  then he spat upon the ground and added spitefully aristos what in fine clotheslike yourself citizen  which way did they go  down the ruelle des jacobins  when  two minutes ago  why did you not follow them aristos and  i would have followed retorted paul friche with studied insolence twas you called me away from my duty  after them then urged chauvelin peremptorily they cannot have gone far they are english spies and remember citizen that theres a reward for their apprehension  the man grunted an eager assent the word reward had fired his zeal in a trice he had called to his mates and the three marats soon sped across the place and down the ruelle des jacobins where the surrounding gloom quickly swallowed them up  chauvelin watched them till they were out of sight then he rejoined his colleague on the landing at the top of the stairs for a second or two longer the click of the mens sabots upon the stones resounded on the adjoining streets and across the place and suddenly that same quaint merry somewhat inane laugh woke the echoes of the grim buildings around and caused many a head to turn inquiringly marvelling who it could be that had the heart to laugh these days in the streets of nantes   v  five minutes or so later the three marats could vaguely be seen recrossing the place and making their way back to le bouffay where martinroget and chauvelin still stood on the top of the stairs excited and expectant at sight of the men chauvelin ran down the steps to meet them  well he queried in an eager whisper  we never saw them replied paul friche gruffly though we could hear them clearly enough talking laughing and walking very rapidly toward the quay then suddenly the earth or the river swallowed them up we saw and heard nothing more  chauvelin swore and a curious hissing sound escaped his thin lips  dont be too disappointed citizen added the man with a coarse laugh my mate picked this up at the corner of the ruelle when i fancy we were pressing the aristos pretty closely  he held out a small bundle of papers tied together with a piece of red ribbon the bundle had evidently rolled in the mud for the papers were covered with grime chauvelins thin clawlike fingers had at once closed over them  you must give me back those papers citizen said the man they are my booty i can only give them up to citizencaptain fleury  ill give them to the citizencaptain myself retorted chauvelin for the moment you had best not leave your post of duty he added more peremptorily seeing that the man made as he would follow him  i take orders from no one except  protested the man gruffly  you will take them from me now broke in chauvelin with a sudden assumption of command and authority which sat with weird strangeness upon his thin shrunken figure go back to your post at once ere i lodge a complaint against you for neglect of duty with the citizen proconsul  he turned on his heel and without paying further heed to the man and his mutterings he remounted the stone stairs  no success i suppose queried martinroget  none replied chauvelin curtly  he had the packet of papers tightly clasped in his hand he was debating in his mind whether he would speak of them to his colleague or not  what did friche say asked the latter impatiently  oh very little he and his mates caught sight of the strangers and followed them as far as the quays but they were walking very fast and suddenly the marats lost their trace in the darkness it seemed according to paul friche as if the earth or the night had swallowed them up  and was that all  yes that was all  i wonder added martinroget with a light laugh and a careless shrug of his wide shoulders i wonder if you and i citizen chauvelinand paul friche too for that matterhave been the victims of our nerves  i wonder assented chauvelin drily andquite quietlyhe slipped the packet of papers in the pocket of his coat  then we may as well adjourn there is nothing else you wish to say to me about that enigmatic scarlet pimpernel of yours  nonothing  and you still would like to hear what the kernogan wench will say and see how she will look when i put my final proposal before her  if you will allow me  then come said martinroget my sisters house is close by  footnotes  footnote 1 this adventure is recorded in the elusive pimpernel     chapter iii  the fowlers   i  in order to reach the carrefour de la poissonnerie the two men had to skirt the whole edifice of le bouffay walk a little along the quay and turn up the narrow alley opposite the bridge they walked on in silence each absorbed in his own thoughts  the house occupied by the citizeness adet lay back a little from the others in the street it was one of an irregular row of mean squalid tumbledown houses some of them little more than leanto sheds built into the walls of le bouffay most of them had overhanging roofs which stretched out like awnings more than half way across the road and even at midday shut out any little ray of sunshine which might have a tendency to peep into the street below  in this year ii of the republic the carrefour de la poissonnerie was unpaved dark and evilsmelling for two thirds of the year it was ankledeep in mud the rest of the time the mud was baked into cakes and emitted clouds of sticky dust under the shuffling feet of the passersby at night it was dimly lighted by one or two brokendown lanthorns which were hung on transverse chains overhead from house to house these lanthorns only made a very small circle of light immediately below them the rest of the street was left in darkness save for the faint glimmer which filtrated through an occasional illfitting doorway or through the chinks of some insecurely fastened shutter  the carrefour de la poissonnerie was practically deserted in the daytime only a few childrenmiserable little atoms of humanity showing their meagre emaciated bodies through the scanty rags which failed to cover their nakednessplayed weird mirthless games in the mud and filth of the street but at night it became strangely peopled with vague and furtive forms that were wont to glide swiftly by beneath the hanging lanthorns in order to lose themselves again in the welcome obscurity beyond men and womenillclothed and unshod with hands buried in pockets or beneath scanty shawlstheir feet ofttimes bare making no sound as they went squishing through the mud a perpetual silence used to reign in this kingdom of squalor and of darkness where nighthawks alone fluttered their wings only from time to time a joyless greeting of booncompanions or the hoarse cough of some wretched consumptive would wake the dormant echoes that lingered in the gloom   ii  martinroget knew his way about the murky street well enough he went up to the house which lay a little back from the others it appeared even more squalid than the rest not a sound came from withinhardly a lightonly a narrow glimmer found its way through the chink of a shutter on the floor above to right and left of it the houses were tall with walls that reeked of damp and of filth from one of thesethe one on the leftan iron sign dangled and creaked dismally as it swung in the wind just above the sign there was a window with partially closed shutters through it came the sound of two husky voices raised in heated argument  in the open space in front of louise adets house vague forms standing about or lounging against the walls of the neighbouring houses were vaguely discernible in the gloom martinroget and chauvelin as they approached were challenged by a raucous voice which came to them out of the inky blackness around  halt who goes there  friends replied martinroget promptly is citizeness adet within  yes she is retorted the man bluntly excuse me friend adeti did not know you in this confounded darkness  no harm done said martinroget and it is i who am grateful to you all for your vigilance  oh said the other with a laugh theres not much fear of your bird getting out of its cage have no fear friend adet that kernogan rabble is well looked after  the small group dispersed in the darkness and martinroget rapped against the door of his sisters house with his knuckles  that is the rat mort he said indicating the building on his left with a nod of the head a very unpleasant neighbourhood for my sister and she has oft complained of itbut name of a dog wont it prove useful this night  chauvelin had as usual followed his colleague in silence but his keen eyes had not failed to note the presence of the village lads of whom martinroget had spoken there are no eyes so watchful as those of hate nor is there aught so incorruptible every one of these men here had an old wrong to avenge an old score to settle with those cidevant kernogans who had once been their masters and who were so completely in their power now louise adet had gathered round her a far more efficient bodyguard than even the proconsul could hope to have  a moment or two later the door was opened softly and cautiously and martinroget asked is that you louise for of a truth the darkness was almost deeper within than without and he could not see who it was that was standing by the door  yes it is replied a weary and querulous voice enter quickly the wind is cruel and i cant keep myself warm who is with you pierre  a friend said martinroget drily we want to see the aristo  the woman without further comment closed the door behind the newcomers the place now was as dark as pitch but she seemed to know her way about like a cat for her shuffling footsteps were heard moving about unerringly a moment or two later she opened another door opposite the front entrance revealing an inner rooma sort of kitchenwhich was lighted by a small lamp  you can go straight up she called curtly to the two men  the narrow winding staircase was divided from this kitchen by a wooden partition martinroget closely followed by chauvelin went up the stairs on the top of these there was a tiny landing with a door on either side of it martinroget without any ceremony pushed open the door on his right with his foot  a tallow candle fixed in a bottle and placed in the centre of a table in the middle of the room flickered in the draught as the door flew open it was bare of everything save a table and a chair and a bundle of straw in one corner the tiny window at right angles to the door was innocent of glass and the northwesterly wind came in an icy stream through the aperture on the table in addition to the candle there was a broken pitcher halffilled with water and a small chunk of brown bread blotched with stains of mould  on the chair beside the table and immediately facing the door sat yvonne lady dewhurst on the wall above her head a hand unused to calligraphy had traced in clumsy characters the words liberté fraternité egalité and below that ou la mort   iii  the men entered the narrow room and chauvelin carefully closed the door behind him he at once withdrew into a remote comer of the room and stood there quite still wrapped in his mantle a small silent mysterious figure on which yvonne fixed dark inquiring eyes  martinroget restless and excited paced up and down the small space like a wild animal in a cage from time to time exclamations of impatience escaped him and he struck one fist repeatedly against his open palm yvonne followed his movements with a quiet uninterested glance but chauvelin paid no heed whatever to him  he was watching yvonne ceaselessly and closely  three days incarceration in this windswept attic the lack of decent food and of warmth the want of sleep and the horror of her present position all following upon the soulagony which she had endured when she was forcibly torn away from her dear milor had left their mark on yvonne dewhursts fresh young face the look of gravity which had always sat so quaintly on her piquant features had now changed to one of deep and abiding sorrow her large dark eyes were circled and sunk they had in them the unnatural glow of fever as well as the settled look of horror and of pathetic resignation her soft brown hair had lost its lustre her cheeks were drawn and absolutely colourless  martinroget paused in his restless walk for a moment he stood silent and absorbed contemplating by the flickering light of the candle all the havoc which his brutality had wrought upon yvonnes dainty face  but yvonne after a while ceased to look at himshe appeared to be unconscious of the gaze of these two men each of whom was at this moment only thinking of the evil which he meant to inflict upon hereach of whom only thought of her as a helpless bird whom he had at last ensnared and whom he could crush to death as soon as he felt so inclined  she kept her lips tightly closed and her head averted she was gazing across at the unglazed window into the obscurity beyond marvelling in what direction lay the sea and the shores of england  martinroget crossed his arms over his broad chest and clutched his elbows with his hands with an obvious effort to keep control over his movements and his temper in check the quiet almost indifferent attitude of the girl was exasperating to his overstrung nerves  look here my girl he said at last roughly and peremptorily i had an interview with the proconsul this afternoon he chides me for my leniency toward you three days he thinks is far too long to keep traitors eating the bread of honest citizens and taking up valuable space in our city yesterday i made a proposal to you have you thought on it  yvonne made no reply she was still gazing out into nothingness and just at that moment she was very far away from the narrow squalid room and the company of these two inhuman brutes she was thinking of her dear milor and of that lovely home at combwich wherein she had spent three such unforgettable days she was remembering how beautiful had been the colour of the bare twigs in the chestnut coppice when the wintry sun danced through and in between them and drew fantastic patterns of living gold upon the carpet of dead leaves and she remembered too how exquisite were the tints of russet and blue on the distant hills and how quaintly the thrushes had called kiss me quick she saw again those trembling leaves of a delicious faintly crimson hue which still hung upon the branches of the scarlet oak and the early flowering heath which clothed the moors with a gorgeous mantle of rosy amethyst  martinrogets harsh voice brought her abruptly back to the hideous reality of the moment  your obstinacy will avail you nothing he said speaking quietly even though a note of intense irritation was distinctly perceptible in his voice the proconsul has given me a further delay wherein to deal leniently with you and with your father if i am so minded you know what i have proposed to you life with me as my wifein which case your father will be free to return to england or to go to the devil as he pleasesor the death of a malefactor for you both in the company of all the thieves and evildoers who are mouldering in the prisons of nantes at this moment another delay wherein to choose between an honourable life and a shameful death the proconsul waits but tonight he must have his answer  then yvonne turned her head slowly and looked calmly on her enemy  the tyrant who murders innocent men women and children she said can have his answer now i choose death which is inevitable in preference to a life of shame  you seem he retorted to have lost sight of the fact that the law gives me the right to take by force that which you so obstinately refuse  have i not said she replied that death is my choice life with you would be a life of shame  i can get a priest to marry us without your consent and your religion forbids you to take your own life he said with a sneer  to this she made no reply but he knew that he had his answer smothering a curse he resumed after a while  so you prefer to drag your father to death with you yet he has begged you to consider your decision and to listen to reason he has given his consent to our marriage  let me see my father she retorted firmly and hear him say that with his own lips  ah she added quickly for at her words martinroget had turned his head away and shrugged his shoulders with wellassumed indifference you cannot and dare not let me see him for three days now you have kept us apart and no doubt fed us both up with your lies my father is duc de kernogan marquis de trentemoult she added proudly he would far rather die side by side with his daughter than see her wedded to a criminal  and you my girl rejoined martinroget coldly would you see your father branded as a malefactor linked to a thief and sent to perish in the loire  my father she retorted will die as he has lived a brave and honourable gentleman the brand of a malefactor cannot cling to his name sorrow we are ready to enduredeath is less than nothing to uswe will but follow in the footsteps of our king and of our queen and of many whom we care for and whom you and your proconsul and your colleagues have brutally murdered shame cannot touch us and our honour and our pride are so far beyond your reach that your impious and bloodstained hands can never sully them  she had spoken very slowly and very quietly there were no heroics about her attitude even martinrogetcallous brute though he wasfelt that she had only spoken just as she felt and that nothing that he might say no plea that he might urge would ever shake her determination  then it seems to me he said that i am only wasting my time by trying to make you see reason and commonsense you look upon me as a brute well perhaps i am at any rate i am that which your father and you have made me four years ago when you had power over me and over mine you brutalised us today wethe peopleare your masters and we make you suffer not for allthat were impossiblebut for part of what you made us suffer that after all is only bare justice by making you my wife i would have saved you from deathnot from humiliation for that you must endure and at my hands in a full measurebut i would have made you my wife because i still have pleasant recollections of that kiss which i snatched from you on that nevertobeforgotten night and in the darknessa kiss for which you would gladly have seen me hang then if you could have laid hands on me  he paused trying to read what was going on behind those fine eyes of hers with their vacant farseeing gaze which seemed like another barrier between her and him at this rough allusion to that moment of horror and of shame she had not moved a muscle nor did her gaze lose its fixity  he laughed  it is an unpleasant recollection eh my proud lady the first kiss of passion was not implanted on your exquisite lips by that fine gentleman whom you deemed worthy of your hand and your love but by pierre adet the millers son what a creature not quite so human as your horse or your pet dog neither you nor i are like to forget that methinks  yvonne vouchsafed no reply to the taunt and for a moment there was silence in the room until chauvelins thin suave voice broke in quite gently  do not lose your patience with the wench citizen martinroget your time is too precious to be wasted in useless recriminations  i have finished with her retorted the other sullenly she shall be dealt with now as i think best i agree with citizen carrier he is right after all to the loire with the lot of that foul brood  nay here rejoined chauvelin with placid urbanity are you not a little harsh citizen with our fair yvonne remember women have moods and megrims what they indignantly refuse to yield to us one day they will grant with a smile the next our beautiful yvonne is no exception to this rule ill warrant  even while he spoke he threw a glance of warning on his colleague there was something enigmatic in his manner at this moment in the strange suavity wherewith he spoke these words of conciliation and of gentleness martinroget was as usual ready with an impatient retort he was in a mood to bully and to brutalise to heap threat upon threat to win by frightfulness that which he could not gain by persuasion perhaps that at this moment he desired yvonne de kernogan for wife more even than he desired her death at any rate his headstrong temper was ready to chafe against any warning or advice but once again chauvelins stronger mentality dominated over his less resolute colleague martinrogetthe fowlerwas in his turn caught in the net of a keener snarer than himself and whilstwith the obstinacy of the weakhe was making mental resolutions to rebuke chauvelin for his interference later on he had already fallen in with the latters attitude  the wench has had three whole days wherein to alter her present mood he said more quietly and you know yourself citizen that the proconsul will not wait after today  the day is young yet rejoined chauvelin it still hath six hours to its credit six hours three hundred and sixty minutes he continued with a pleasant little laugh time enough for a woman to change her mind three hundred and sixty times let me advise you citizen to leave the wench to her own meditations for the present and i trust that she will accept the advice of a man who has a sincere regard for her beauty and her charms and who is old enough to be her father and seriously think the situation over in a conciliatory spirit m le duc de kernogan will be grateful to her for of a truth he is not over happy either at the moment  and will be still less happy in the dépôt tomorrow it is overcrowded and typhus i fear me is rampant among the prisoners he has i am convincedin spite of what the citizeness says to the contrarya rooted objection to being hurled into the loire or to be arraigned before the bar of the convention not as an aristocrat and a traitor but as an unit of an undesirable herd of criminals sent up to paris for trial by an anxious and harried proconsul there there he added benignly we will not worry our fair yvonne any longer will we citizen i think she has grasped the alternative and will soon realise that marriage with an honourable patriot is not such an untoward fate after all  and now citizen martinroget he concluded i pray you allow me to take my leave of the fair lady and to give you the wise recommendation to do likewise she will be far better alone for awhile night brings good counsel so they say  he watched the girl keenly while he spoke her impassivity had not deserted her for a single moment but whether her calmness was of hope or of despair he was unable to decide on the whole he thought it must be the latter hope would have kindled a spark in those dark purplerimmed eyes it would have brought moisture to the lips a tremor to the hand  the scarlet pimpernel was in nantesthat fact was established beyond a doubtbut chauvelin had come to the conclusion that so far as yvonne dewhurst herself was concerned she knew nothing of the mysterious agencies that were working on her behalf  chauvelins hand closed with a nervous contraction over the packet of papers in his pocket something of the secret of that enigmatic english adventurer lay revealed within its folds chauvelin had not yet had the opportunity of examining them the interview with yvonne had been the most important business for the moment  from somewhere in the distance a city clock struck six the afternoon was wearing on the keenest brain in europe was on the watch to drag one woman and one man from the deadly trap which had been so successfully set for them a few hours more and chauvelin in his turn would be pitting his wits against the resources of that intricate brain and he felt like a warhorse scenting blood and battle he was aching to get to workaching to form his plansto lay his snaresto dispose his trap so that the noble english quarry should not fail to be caught within its meshes  he gave a last look to yvonne who was still sitting quite impassive gazing through the squalid walls into some beautiful distance the reflection of which gave to her pale wan face an added beauty  let us go citizen martinroget he said peremptorily there is nothing else that we can do here  and martinroget the weaker morally of the two yielded to the stronger personality of his colleague he would have liked to stay on for awhile to gloat for a few moments longer over the helplessness of the woman who to him represented the root of every evil which had ever befallen him and his family but chauvelin commanded and he felt impelled to obey he gave one long last look on yvonnea look that was as full of triumph as of mockeryhe looked round the four dank walls the unglazed window the broken pitcher the mouldy bread revenge was of a truth the sweetest emotion of the human heart pierre adetson of the miller who had been hanged by orders of the duc de kernogan for a crime which he had never committedwould not at this moment have changed places with fortunes benjamin   iv  downstairs in louise adets kitchen martinroget seized his colleague by the arm  sit down a moment citizen he said persuasively and tell me what you think of it all  chauvelin sat down at the others invitation all his movements were slow deliberate perfectly calm  i think he said drily as far as your marriage with the wench is concerned that you are beaten my friend  tshaw the exclamation raucous and surcharged with hate came from louise adet she too like pierremore so than pierre mayhaphad cause to hate the kernogans she too like pierre had lived the last three days in the full enjoyment of the thought that fate and chance were about to level things at last between herself and those detested aristos silent and sullen she was shuffling about in the room among her pots and pans but she kept an eye upon her brothers movements and an ear on what he said men were apt to lose grit where a pretty wench was concerned it takes a womans rancour and a womans determination to carry a scheme of vengeance against another to a successful end  martinroget rejoined more calmly  i knew that she would still be obstinate he said if i forced her into a marriage which i have the right to do she might take her own life and make me look a fool so i dont want to do that i believe in the persuasiveness of the rat mort tonight he added with a cynical laugh and if that fails well i was never really in love with the fair yvonne and now she has even ceased to be desirable if the rat mort fails to act on her sensibilities as i would wish i can easily console myself by following carriers herd to paris louise shall come with meeh little sisterand well give ourselves the satisfaction of seeing m le duc de kernogan and his exquisite daughter stand in the felons docktried for malpractices and for evil living well see them branded as convicts and packed off like so much cattle to cayenne that will be a sight he concluded with a deep sigh of satisfaction which will bring rest to my soul  he paused his face looked sullen and evil under the domination of that passion which tortured him  louise adet had shuffled up close to her brother in one hand she held the wooden spoon wherewith she had been stirring the soup with the other she brushed away the dark lank hair which hung in strands over her high pale forehead in appearance she was a woman immeasurably older than her years her face had the colour of yellow parchment her skin was stretched tightly over her high cheekbonesher lips were colourless and her eyes large wideopen were pale in hue and circled with red just now a deep frown of puzzlement between her brows added a sinister expression to her cadaverous face  the rat mort she queried in that tired voice of hers cayenne what is all that about  a splendid scheme of carriers my louise replied martinroget airily we convey the kernogan woman to the rat mort tonight a descent will be made on that tavern of illfame by a company of marats and every man woman and child within it will be arrested and sent to paris as undesirable inhabitants of this most moral city in paris they will be tried as malefactors or evildoerscut throats thieves what and deported as convicts to cayenne or else sent to the guillotine the kernogans among that herd what sayest thou to that little sister thy father thy lover hung as thieves m le duc and mademoiselle branded as convicts tis pleasant to think on eh  louise made no reply she stood looking at her brother her pale redrimmed eyes seemed to drink in every word that he uttered while her bony hand wandered mechanically across and across her forehead as if in a pathetic endeavour to clear the brain from everything save of the satisfying thoughts which this prospect of revenge had engendered  chauvelins gentle voice broke in on her meditations  in the meanwhile he said placidly remember my warning citizen martinroget there are passing clever and mighty agencies at work even at this hour to wrest your prey from you how will you convey the wench to the rat mort carrier has warned you of spiesbut i have warned you against a crowd of english adventurers far more dangerous than an army of spies three pairs of eyesprobably more and one pair the keenest in europewill be on the watch to seize upon the woman and to carry her off under your very nose  martinroget uttered a savage oath  that brute carrier has left me in the lurch he said roughly i dont believe in your nightmares and your english adventurers still it would have been better if i could have had the woman conveyed to the tavern under armed escort  armed escort has been denied you and anyway it would not be much use you and i citizen martinroget must act independently of carrier your friends down there he added indicating the street with a jerk of the head must redouble their watchfulness the village lads of vertou are of a truth no match intellectually with our english adventurers but they have vigorous fists in case there is an attack on the wench while she walks across to the rat mort  it would be simpler here interposed louise roughly if we were to knock the wench on the head and then let the lads carry her across  it would not be simpler retorted chauvelin drily for carrier might at any moment turn against us commandant fleury with half a company of marats will be posted round the rat mort remember they may interfere with the lads and arrest them and snatch the wench from us when all our plans may fall to the ground  one never knows what double game carrier may be playing no no the girl must not be dragged or carried to the rat mort she must walk into the trap of her own free will  but name of a dog how is it to be done ejaculated martinroget and he brought his clenched fist crashing down upon the table the woman will not follow meor louise eitheranywhere willingly  she must follow a stranger thenor one whom she thinks a strangersome one who will have gained her confidence  impossible  oh nothing is impossible citizen rejoined chauvelin blandly  do you know a way then queried the other with a sneer  i think i do if you will trust me that is  i dont know that i do your mind is so intent on those english adventurers you are like as not to let the aristos slip through your fingers  well citizen retorted chauvelin imperturbably will you take the risk of conveying the fair yvonne to the rat mort by twelve oclock tonight i have very many things to see to i confess that i should be glad if you will ease me from that responsibility  i have already told you that i see no way retorted martinroget with a snarl  then why not let me act  what are you going to do  for the moment i am going for a walk on the quay and once more will commune with the northwest wind  tshaw ejaculated martinroget savagely  nay citizen resumed chauvelin blandly the winds of heaven are excellent counsellors i told you so just now and you agreed with me they blow away the cobwebs of the mind and clear the brain for serious thinking you want the kernogan girl to be arrested inside the rat mort and you see no way of conveying her thither save by the use of violence which for obvious reasons is to be deprecated carrier for equally obvious reasons will not have her taken to the place by force on the other hand you admit that the wench would not follow you willinglywell citizen we must find a way out of that impasse for it is too unimportant an one to stand in the way of our plans for this i must hold a consultation with the northwest wind  i wont allow you to do anything without consulting me  am i likely to do that to begin with i shall have need of your cooperation and that of the citizeness  in that case  muttered martinroget grudgingly but remember he added with a return to his usual selfassured manner remember that yvonne and her father belong to me and not to you i brought them into nantes for mine own purposesnot for yours i will not have my revenge jeopardised so that your schemes may be furthered  who spoke of my schemes citizen martinroget broke in chauvelin with perfect urbanity surely not i what am i but an humble tool in the service of the republic a tool that has proved uselessa failure what my only desire is to help you to the best of my abilities your enemies are the enemies of the republic my ambition is to help you in destroying them  for a moment longer martinroget hesitated he abominated this suggestion of becoming a mere instrument in the hands of this man whom he still would have affected to despisehad he dared but here came the difficulty he no longer dared to despise chauvelin he felt the strength of the manthe clearness of his intellect and though hemartinrogetstill chose to disregard every warning in connexion with the english spies he could not wholly divest his mind from the possibility of their presence in nantes carriers scheme was so magnificent so satisfying that the exmillers son was ready to humble his pride and set his arrogance aside in order to see it carried through successfully  so after a moment or two despite the fact that he positively ached to shut chauvelin out of the whole business martinroget gave a grudging assent to his proposal  very well he said you see to it so long as it does not interfere with my plans  it can but help them rejoined chauvelin suavely if you will act as i shall direct i pledge you my word that the wench will walk to the rat mort of her free will and at the hour when you want her what else is there to say  when and where shall we meet again  within the hour i will return here and explain to you and to the citizeness what i want you to do we will get the aristos inside the rat mort never fear and after that i think that we may safely leave carrier to do the rest what  he picked up his hat and wrapped his mantle round him he took no further heed of martinroget or of louise for suddenly he had felt the crackling of crisp paper inside the breastpocket of his coat and in a moment the spirit of the man had gone aroaming out of the narrow confines of this squalid abode it had crossed the english channel and wandered once more into a brilliantlylighted ballroom where an exquisitely dressed dandy declaimed inanities and doggrel rhymes for the delectation of a flippant assembly it heard once more the lazy drawling speech the inane affected laugh it caught the glance of a pair of lazy grey eyes fixed mockingly upon him chauvelins thin clawlike hand went back to his pocket it felt that packet of papers it closed over it like a vultures talon does upon a prey he no longer heard martinrogets obstinate murmurings he no longer felt himself to be the disgraced humiliated servant of the state rather did he feel once more the master the leader the successful weaver of an hundred clever intrigues the enemy who had baffled him so often had chosen once more to throw down the glove of mocking defiance so be it the battle would be fought this nighta decisive oneand long live the republic and the power of the people  with a curt nod of the head chauvelin turned on his heel and without waiting for martinroget to follow him or for louise to light him on his way he strode from the room and out of the house and had soon disappeared in the darkness in the direction of the quay   v  once more free from the encumbering companionship of martinroget chauvelin felt free to breathe and to think he the obscure and impassive servant of the republic the coldblooded terrorist who had gone through every phrase of an exciting career without moving a muscle of his grave countenance felt as if every one of his arteries was on fire he strode along the quay in the teeth of the northwesterly wind grateful for the cold blast which lashed his face and cooled his throbbing temples  the packet of papers inside his coat seemed to sear his breast  before turning to go along the quay he paused hesitating for a moment what he would do his very humble lodgings were at the far end of the town and every minute of time was precious inside le bouffay where he had a small room allotted to him as a minor representative in nantes of the committee of public safety there was the ever present danger of prying eyes  on the wholesince time was so precioushe decided on returning to le bouffay the concierge and the clerk fortunately let him through without those official delays which hechauvelinwas wont to find so galling ever since his disgrace had put a bar against the opening of every door at the bare mention of his name or the display of his tricolour scarf  he strode rapidly across the hall the men on guard eyed him with lazy indifference as he passed once inside his own sanctum he looked carefully around him he drew the curtain closer across the window and dragged the table and a chair well away from the range which might be covered by an eye at the keyhole it was only when he had thoroughly assured himself that no searching eye or inquisitive ear could possibly be watching over him that he at last drew the precious packet of papers from his pocket he undid the red ribbon which held it together and spread the papers out on the table before him then he examined them carefully one by one  as he did so an exclamation of wrath or of impatience escaped him from time to time once he laughedinvoluntarilyaloud  the examination of the papers took him some time when he had finished he gathered them all together again retied the bit of ribbon round them and slipped the packet back into the pocket of his coat there was a look of grim determination on his face even though a bitter sigh escaped his set lips  oh for the power he muttered to himself which i had a year ago for the power to deal with mine enemy myself so you have come to nantes my valiant sir percy blakeney he added while a short sardonic laugh escaped his thin set lips and you are determined that i shall know how and why you came do you reckon i wonder that i have no longer the power to deal with you well  he sighed again but with more satisfaction this time  well he reiterated with obvious complacency unless that oaf carrier is a bigger fool than i imagine him to be i think i have you this time my elusive scarlet pimpernel     chapter iv  the net   i  it was not an easy thing to obtain an audience of the great proconsul at this hour of the night nor was chauvelin the disgraced servant of the committee of public safety a man to be considered carrier with his love of ostentation and of tyranny found great delight in keeping his colleagues waiting upon his pleasure and he knew that he could trust young jacques lalouët to be as insolent as any tyrants flunkey of yore  i must speak with the proconsul at once had been chauvelins urgent request of fleury the commandant of the great mans bodyguard  the proconsul dines at this hour had been fleurys curt reply  tis a matter which concerns the welfare and the safety of the state  the proconsuls health is the concern of the state too and he dines at this hour and must not be disturbed  commandant fleury urged chauvelin you risk being implicated in a disaster danger and disgrace threaten the proconsul and all his adherents i must speak with citizen carrier at once  fortunately for chauvelin there were two keys which when all else failed were apt to open the doors of carriers stronghold the key of fear and that of cupidity he tried both and succeeded he bribed and he threatened he endured fleurys brutality and lalouëts impertinence but he got his way after an hours weary waiting and ceaseless parleyings he was once more ushered into the antechamber where he had sat earlier in the day the doors leading to the inner sanctuary were open young jacques lalouët stood by them on guard carrier fuming and raging at having been disturbed vented his spleen and illtemper on chauvelin  if the news that you bring me is not worth my consideration he cried savagely ill send you to moulder in le bouffay or to drink the waters of the loire  chauvelin silent selfeffaced allowed the flood of the great mans wrath to spend itself in threats then he said quietly  citizen proconsul i have come to tell you that the english spy who is called the scarlet pimpernel is now in nantes there is a reward of twenty thousand francs for his capture and i want your help to lay him by the heels  carrier suddenly paused in his ravings he sank into a chair and a livid hue spread over his face  its not true he murmured hoarsely  i saw himnot an hour ago  what proof have you  ill show them to youbut not across this threshold let me enter citizen proconsul and close your sanctuary doors behind me rather than before what i have come hither to tell you can only be said between four walls  ill make you tell me broke in carrier in a raucous voice which excitement and fear caused almost to choke in his throat ill make you  curse you for the traitor that you are curse you he cried more vigorously ill make you speak will you shield a spy by your silence you miserable traitor if you do ill send you to rot in the mud of the loire with other traitors less accursed than yourself  if you only knew was chauvelins calm rejoinder to the others ravings how little i care for life i only live to be even one day with an enemy whom i hate that enemy is now in nantes but i am like a bird of prey whose wings have been clipped if you do not help me mine enemy will again go freeand death in that case matters little or nothing to me  for a moment longer carrier hesitated fear had gripped him by the throat chauvelins earnestness seemed to vouch for the truth of his assertion and if this were soif those english spies were indeed in nantesthen his own life was in deadly danger helike every one of those bloodthirsty tyrants who had misused the sacred names of fraternity and of equalityhad learned to dread the machinations of those mysterious englishmen and of their unconquerable leader popular superstition had it that they were spies of the english government and that they were not only bent on saving traitors from wellmerited punishment but that they were hired assassins paid by mr pitt to murder every faithful servant of the republic the name of the scarlet pimpernel so significantly uttered by chauvelin had turned carriers sallow cheeks to a livid hue sick with terror now he called lalouët to him he clung to the boy with both arms as to the one being in this world whom he trusted  what shall we do jacques he murmured hoarsely shall we let him in  the boy roughly shook himself free from the embrace of the great proconsul  if you want twenty thousand francs he said with a dry laugh i should listen quietly to what citizen chauvelin has to say  terror and rapacity were ranged on one side against inordinate vanity the thought of twenty thousand francs made carriers ugly mouth water money was ever scarce these days also the fear of assassination was a spectre which haunted him at all hours of the day and night on the other hand he positively worshipped the mystery wherewith he surrounded himself it had been his boast for some time now that no one save the chosen few had crossed the threshold of his private chamber and he was miserably afraid not only of chauvelins possible evil intentions but also that this despicable exaristo and equally despicable failure would boast in the future of an ascendancy over him  he thought the matter over for fully five minutes during which there was dead silence in the two roomssilence only broken by the stertorous breathing of that wretched coward and the measured ticking of the fine buhl clock behind him chauvelins pale eyes were fixed upon the darkness through which he could vaguely discern the uncouth figure of the proconsul sprawling over his desk which way would his passions sway him chauvelin as he watched and waited felt that his habitual selfcontrol was perhaps more severely taxed at this moment than it had ever been before upon the swaying of those passions the passions of a man infinitely craven and infinitely base depended all hischauvelinshopes of getting even at last with a daring and resourceful foe terror and rapacity were the counsellors which ranged themselves on the side of his schemes but mere vanity and caprice fought a hard battle too  in the end it was rapacity that gained the victory an impatient exclamation from young lalouët roused carrier from his sombre brooding and hastened on a decision which was destined to have such momentous consequences for the future of both these men  introduce citizen chauvelin in here lalouët said the proconsul grudgingly i will listen to what he has to say   ii  chauvelin crossed the threshold of the tyrants sanctuary in no way awed by the majesty of that dreaded presence or confused by the air of mystery which hung about the room  he did not even bestow a glance on the multitudinous objects of art and the priceless furniture which littered the tigers lair his pale face remained quite expressionless as he bowed solemnly before carrier and then took the chair which was indicated to him young lalouët fetched a candelabra from the anteroom and carried it into the audience chamber then he closed the communicating doors the candelabra he placed on a consoletable immediately behind carriers desk and chair so that the latters face remained in complete shadow whilst the light fell full upon chauvelin  well what is it queried the proconsul roughly what is this story of english spies inside nantes how did they get here who is responsible for keeping such rabble out of our city name of a dog but some one has been careless of duty and carelessness these days is closely allied to treason  he talked loudly and volublyhis inordinate terror causing the words to come tumbling almost incoherently out of his mouth finally he turned on chauvelin with a snarl like an angry cat  and how comes it citizen he added savagely that you alone here in nantes are acquainted with the whereabouts of those dangerous spies  i caught sight of them rejoined chauvelin calmly this afternoon after i left you i knew we should have them here the moment citizen martinroget brought the kernogans into the city the woman is the wife of one of them  curse that blundering fool martinroget for bringing that rabble about our ears and those assassins inside our gates  nay why should you complain citizen proconsul rejoined chauvelin in his blandest manner surely you are not going to let the english spies escape this time and if you succeed in laying them by the heelsthere where every one else has failedyou will have earned twenty thousand francs and the thanks of the entire committee of public safety  he paused and young lalouët interposed with his impudent laugh  go on citizen chauvelin he said if there is twenty thousand francs to be made out of this game ill warrant that the proconsul will take a hand in iteh carrier  and with the insolent familiarity of a terrier teasing a grizzly he tweaked the great mans ear  chauvelin in the meanwhile had drawn the packet of papers from his pocket and untied the ribbon that held them together he now spread the papers out on the desk  what are these queried carrier  a few papers replied chauvelin which one of your marats paul friche by name picked up in the wake of the englishmen i caught sight of them in the far distance and sent the marats after them for awhile paul friche kept on their track but after that they disappeared in the darkness  who were the senseless louts growled carrier who allowed a pack of foreign assassins to escape ill soon make them disappear  in the loire  you will do what you like about that citizen carrier retorted chauvelin drily in the meanwhile you would do well to examine these papers  he sorted these out examined them one by one then passed them across to carrier lalouët impudent and inquisitive sat on the corner of the desk dangling his legs with scant ceremony he snatched one paper after another out of carriers hands and examined them curiously  can you understand all this gibberish he asked airily jean baptiste my friend how much english do you know  not much replied the proconsul but enough to recognise that abominable doggrel rhyme which has gone the round of the committees of public safety throughout the country  i know it by heart rejoined young lalouët i was in paris once when citizen robespierre received a copy of it name of a dog added the youngster with a coarse laugh how he cursed  it is doubtful however if citizen robespierre did on that occasion curse quite so volubly as carrier did now  if i only knew why that satané englishman throws so much calligraphy about he said i would be easier in my mind now this senseless rhyme  i dont see  its importance broke in chauvelin quietly i dare say not on the face of it it appears foolish and childish but it is intended as a taunt and is really a poor attempt at humour they are a queer people these english if you knew them as i do you would not be surprised to see a man scribbling off a cheap joke before embarking on an enterprise which may cost him his head  and this inane rubbish is of that sort concluded young lalouët and in his thin high treble he began reciting         we seek him here        we seek him there    those frenchies seek him everywhere        is he in heaven        is he in hll    that demmed elusive pimpernel  pointless and offensive he said as he tossed the paper back on the table  a cursed aristo that englishman of yours growled carrier oh when i get him  he made an expressive gesture which made lalouët laugh  what else have we got in the way of documents citizen chauvelin he asked  there is a letter replied the latter  read it commanded carrier or rather translate it as you read i dont understand the whole of the gibberish  and chauvelin taking up a sheet of paper which was covered with neat minute writing began to read aloud translating the english into french as he went along       here we are at last my dear tony didnt i tell you that we can      get in anywhere despite all precautions taken against us  the impudent devils broke in carrier       did you really think that they could keep us out of nantes      while lady anthony dewhurst is a prisoner in their hands  who is that  the kernogan woman as i told you just now she is married to an englishman who is named dewhurst and who is one of the members of that thrice cursed league  then he continued to read       and did you really suppose that they would spot half a dozen      english gentlemen in the guise of peatgatherers returning at dusk      and covered with grime from their work not like friend tony not      like if you happen to meet mine engaging friend m chambertin      before i have that privilege myself tell him i pray you with my      regards that i am looking forward to the pleasure of making a long      nose at him once more calais boulogne parisnow nantesthe      scenes of his triumphs multiply exceedingly  what in the devils name does all this mean queried carrier with an oath  you dont understand it rejoined chauvelin quietly  no i do not  yet i translated quite clearly  it is not the language that puzzles me the contents seem to me such drivel the man wants secrecy what he is supposed to be astute resourceful above all mysterious and enigmatic yet he writes to his friendmatter of no importance between them recollections of the past known to them bothand threats for the future equally futile and senseless i cannot reconcile it all it puzzles me  and it would puzzle me rejoined chauvelin while the ghost of a smile curled his thin lips did i not know the man futile senseless you say well he does futile and senseless things one moment and amazing deeds of personal bravery and of astuteness the next he is three parts a braggart too he wanted you meall of us to know how he and his followers succeeded in eluding our vigilance and entered our closelyguarded city in the guise of grimy peatgatherers now i come to think of it it was easy enough for them to do that those peatgatherers who live inside the city boundaries return from their work as the night falls in those cursed english adventurers are passing clever at disguisethey are born mountebanks the lot of them money and impudence they have in plenty they could easily borrow or purchase some filthy rags from the cottages on the dunes then mix with the crowd on its return to the city i dare say it was cleverly done that scarlet pimpernel is just a clever adventurer and nothing more so far his marvellous good luck has carried him through now we shall see  carrier had listened in silence something of his colleagues calm had by this time communicated itself to him too he was no longer raving like an infuriated bullhis terror no longer made a halfcringing wholly savage brute of him he was sprawling across the deskhis arms folded his deepset eyes studying closely the wellnigh inscrutable face of chauvelin young lalouët too had lost something of his impudence that mysterious spell which seemed to emanate from the elusive personality of the bold english adventurer had been cast over these two callous bestial natures humbling their arrogance and making them feel that here was no ordinary situation to be dealt with by smashing senseless hitting and the spilling of innocent blood both felt instinctively too that this man chauvelin however wholly he may have failed in the past was nevertheless still the only man who might grapple successfully with the elusive and adventurous foe  are you assuming citizen chauvelin queried carrier after awhile that this packet of papers was dropped purposely by the englishman so that it might get into our hands  there is always such a possibility replied chauvelin drily with that type of man one must be prepared to meet the unexpected  then go on citizen chauvelin what else is there among those satané papers  nothing further of importance there is a map of nantes and one of the coast and of le croisic there is a cutting from le moniteur dated last september and one from the london gazette dated three years ago the moniteur makes reference to the production of athalie at the théâtre molière and the london gazette to the sale of fat cattle at an agricultural show there is a receipted account from a london tailor for two hundred pounds worth of clothes supplied and one from a lyons mercer for an hundred francs worth of silk cravats then there is the one letter which alone amidst all this rubbish appears to be of any consequence  he took up the last paper his hand was still quite steady  read the letter said carrier  it is addressed in the english fashion to lady anthony dewhurst continued chauvelin slowly the kernogan woman you know citizen it says       keep up your courage your friends are inside the city and on the      watch try the door of your prison every evening at one hour before      midnight once you will find it yield slip out and creep      noiselessly down the stairs at the bottom a friendly hand will be      stretched out to you take it with confidenceit will lead you to      safety and to freedom courage and secrecy  lalouët had been looking over his shoulder while he read now he pointed to the bottom of the letter  and there is the device he said we have heard so much about of latea fivepetalled flower drawn in red ink  the scarlet pimpernel i presume  aye the scarlet pimpernel murmured chauvelin as you say braggadocio on his part or accident his letters are certainly in our hands now and will provemust prove the tool whereby we can be even with him once and for all  and you citizen chauvelin interposed carrier with a sneer are mighty lucky to have me to help you this time i am not going to be fooled as candeille and you were fooled last september as you were fooled in calais and héron in paris i shall be seeing this time to the capture of those english adventurers  and that capture should not be difficult added lalouët with a complacent laugh your famous adventurers luck hath deserted him this time an allpowerful proconsul is pitted against him and the loss of his papers hath destroyed the anonymity on which he reckons  chauvelin paid no heed to the fatuous remarks  how little did this flippant young braggart and this coarsegrained bully understand the subtle workings of that same adventurers brain he himselfone of the most astute men of the dayfound it difficult even nowthe losing of those letters in the open streets of nantesit was part of a plan chauvelin could have staked his head on thata part of a plan for the liberation of lady anthony dewhurstbut what planwhat plan  he took up the letter which his colleague had thrown down he fingered it handled it letting the paper crackle through his fingers as if he expected it to yield up the secret which it contained the time had comeof that he felt no doubtwhen he could at last be even with his enemy he had endured more bitter humiliation at the hands of this elusive pimpernel than he would have thought himself capable of bearing a couple of years ago but the time had come at lastif only he kept his every faculty on the alert if fate helped him and his own nerves stood the strain above all if this blundering selfsatisfied carrier could be reckoned on  there lay the one great source of trouble hechauvelinhad no power he was disgraceda failurea nonentity to be sneered at he might protest entreat wring his hands weep tears of blood and not one man would stir a finger to help him this brute who sprawled here across his desk would not lend him half a dozen men to enable him to lay by the heels the most powerful enemy the government of the terror had ever known chauvelin inwardly ground his teeth with rage at his own impotence at his own dependence on this clumsy lout who was at this moment possessed of powers which he himself would give half his life to obtain  but on the other hand he did possess a power which no one could take from himthe power to use others for the furtherance of his own aimsto efface himself while others danced as puppets to his piping carrier had the power he had spies marats prisonguards at his disposal he was greedy for the reward and cupidity and fear would make of him a willing instrument all that chauvelin need do was to use that instrument for his own ends one would be the head to direct the othera mere insentient tool  from this moment onwards every minute every second and every fraction of a second would be full of portent full of possibilities sir percy blakeney was in nantes with at least three or four members of his league he was at this very moment taxing every fibre of his resourceful brain in order to devise a means whereby he could rescue his friends wife from the fate which was awaiting her to gain this end he would dare everything risk everythingrisk and dare a great deal more than he had ever dared and risked before  chauvelin was finding a grim pleasure in reviewing the situation in envisaging the danger of failure which he knew lay in wait for him unless he too was able to call to his aid all the astuteness all the daring all the resource of his own fertile brain he studied his colleagues face keenlythat sullen savage expression in it the arrogance the blundering vanity it was terrible to have to humour and fawn to a creature of that stamp when all ones hopes all ones future ones ideals and the welfare of ones country were at stake  but this additional difficulty only served to whet the mans appetite for action he drew in a long breath of delight like a captive who first after many days and months of weary anguish scents freedom and ozone he straightened out his shoulders a gleam of triumph and of hope shot out of his keen pale eyes he studied carrier and he studied lalouët and he felt that he could master them bothquietly diplomatically with subtle skill that would not alarm the proconsuls rampant selfesteem and whilst this coarsefibred brute gloated in anticipatory pleasure over the handling of a few thousand francs and whilst martinroget dreamed of a clumsy revenge against one woman and one man who had wronged him four years ago hechauvelinwould pursue his work of striking at the enemy of the revolutionof bringing to his knees the man who spent life and fortune in combating its ideals and in frustrating its aims the destruction of such a foe was worthy a patriots ambition  on the other hand some of carriers bullying arrogance had gone he was terrified to the very depths of his cowardly heart and for once he was turning away from his favourite jacques lalouët and inclined to lean on chauvelin for advice robespierre had been known to tremble at sight of that small scarlet device how much more had hecarriercause to be afraid he knew his own limitations and he was terrified of the assassins dagger as marat had perished so he too might end his days and the english spies were credited with murderous intentions and superhuman power in his innermost self carrier knew that despite countless failures chauvelin was mentally his superior and though he never would own to this and at this moment did not attempt to shed his overbearing manner he was watching the other keenly and anxiously ready to follow the guidance of an intellect stronger than his own   iii  at last carrier elected to speak  and now citizen chauvelin he said we know how we stand we know that the english assassins are in nantes the question is how are we going to lay them by the heels  chauvelin gave him no direct reply he was busy collecting his precious papers together and thrusting them back into the pocket of his coat then he said quietly  it is through the kernogan woman that we can get hold of him  how  where she is there will the englishmen be they are in nantes for the sole purpose of getting the woman and her father out of your clutches  then it will be a fine haul inside the rat mort ejaculated carrier with a chuckle eh jacques you young scamp you and i must go and see that what you have been complaining that life was getting monotonous drownagesrepublican marriages they have all palled in their turn on your jaded appetite but the capture of the english assassins eh of that league of the scarlet pimpernel which has even caused citizen robespierre much uneasinessthat will stir up your sluggish blood you lazy young vermin go on go on citizen chauvelin i am vastly interested  he rubbed his dry bony hands together and cackled with glee chauvelin interposed quietly  inside the rat mort eh citizen he queried  why yes citizen martinroget means to convey the kernogan woman to the rat mort doesnt he  he does  and you say that where the kernogan woman is there the englishmen will be  the inference is obvious  which means ten thousand francs from that fool martinroget for having the wench and her father arrested inside the rat mort and twenty thousand for the capture of the english spies have you forgotten citizen chauvelin he added with a raucous cry of triumph that commandant fleury has my orders to make a raid on the rat mort this night with half a company of my marats and to arrest every one whom they find inside  the kernogan wench is not at the rat mort yet quoth chauvelin drily and you have refused to lend a hand in having her conveyed thither  i cant do it my little chauvelin rejoined carrier somewhat sobered by this reminder i cant do it  you understand  my marats taking an aristo to a house of illfame where presently i have her arrested  it wont do  it wont do  you dont know how i am spied upon just now it really would not do i cant be mixed up in that part of the affair the wench must go to the rat mort of her own free will or the whole plan falls to the ground that fool martinroget must think of a way  its his affair after all he must see to it or you can think of a way he added assuming the coaxing ways of a tigercat you are so clever my little chauvelin  yes replied chauvelin quietly i can think of a way the kernogan wench shall leave the house of citizeness adet and walk into the tavern of the rat mort of her own free will your reputation citizen carrier he added without the slightest apparent trace of a sneer your reputation shall be safeguarded in this matter but supposing that in the interval of going from the one house to the other the english adventurer succeeds in kidnapping her  pah is that likely quoth carrier with a shrug of the shoulders  exceedingly likely citizen and you would not doubt it if you knew this scarlet pimpernel as i do i have seen him at his nefarious work i know what he can do there is nothing that he would not venture  there are few ventures in which he does not succeed he is as strong as an ox as agile as a cat he can see in the dark and he can always vanish in a crowd here there and everywhere you never know where he will appear he is a past master in the art of disguise and he is a born mountebank believe me citizen we shall want all the resources of our joint intellects to frustrate the machinations of such a foe  carrier mused for a moment in silence  hm he said after awhile and with a sardonic laugh you may be right citizen chauvelin you have had experience with the rascal  you ought to know him we wont leave anything to chancedont be afraid of that my marats will be keen on the capture well promise commandant fleury a thousand francs for himself and another thousand to be distributed among his men if we lay hands on the english assassins tonight well leave nothing to chance he reiterated with an oath  in which case citizen carrier you must on your side agree to two things rejoined chauvelin firmly  what are they  you must order commandant fleury to place himself and half a company of his marats at my disposal  what else  you must allow them to lend a hand if there is an attempt to kidnap the kernogan wench while she is being conveyed to the rat mort  carrier hesitated for a second or two but only for forms sake it was his nature whenever he was forced to yield to do so grudgingly  very well he said at last ill order fleury to be on the watch and to interfere if there is any streetbrawling outside or near the rat mort will that suit you  perfectly i shall be on the watch toosomewhere close by ill warn commandant fleury if i suspect that the english are making ready for a coup outside the tavern personally i think it unlikelybecause the duc de kernogan will be inside the rat mort all the time and he too will be the object of the englishmens attacks on his behalf citizen martinroget too has about a score or so of his friends posted outside his sisters house they are lads from his village who hate the kernogans as much as he does himself still i shall feel easier in my mind now that i am certain of commandant fleurys cooperation  then it seems to me that we have arranged everything satisfactorily what  everything except the exact moment when commandant fleury shall advance with his men to the door of the tavern and demand admittance in the name of the republic  yes he will have to make quite sure that the whole of our quarry is inside the net eh before he draws the strings  or all our pretty plans fall to nought  as you say rejoined chauvelin we must make sure supposing therefore that we get the wench safely into the tavern that we have her there with her father what we shall want will be some one in observationsome one who can help us to draw our birds into the snare just when we are ready for them now there is a man whom i have in my mind he hath name paul friche and is one of your maratsa surly illconditioned giant  he was on guard outside le bouffay this afternoon i spoke to him  he would suit our purpose admirably  what do you want him to do  only to make himself look as like a nantese cutthroat as he can  he looks like one already broke in jacques lalouët with a laugh  so much the better hell excite no suspicion in that case in the minds of the frequenters of the rat mort then ill instruct him to start a brawla fracassoon after the arrival of the kernogan wench the row will inevitably draw the english adventurers hothaste to the spot either in the hope of getting the kernogans away during the mêlée or with a view to protecting them as soon as they have appeared upon the scene the half company of the marats will descend on the house and arrest every one inside it  it all sounds remarkably simple rejoined carrier and with a leer of satisfaction he turned to jacques lalouët  what think you of it citizen he asked  that it sounds so remarkably simple replied young lalouët that personally i should be half afraid  of what queried chauvelin blandly  if you fail citizen chauvelin  impossible  if the englishmen do not appear  even so the citizen proconsul will have lost nothing he will merely have failed to gain the twenty thousand francs but the kernogans will still be in his power and citizen martinrogets ten thousand francs are in any case assured  friend jeanbaptiste concluded lalouët with his habitual insolent familiarity you had better do what citizen chauvelin wants ten thousand francs are good  and thirty better still our privy purse has been empty far too long and i for one would like the handling of a few brisk notes  it will only be twentyeight citizen lalouët interposed chauvelin blandly for commandant fleury will want one thousand francs and his men another thousand to stimulate their zeal still i imagine that these hard times twentyeight thousand francs are worth fighting for  you seem to be fighting and planning and scheming for nothing citizen chauvelin retorted young lalouët with a sneer what are you going to gain i should like to know by the capture of that daredevil englishman  oh replied chauvelin suavely i shall gain the citizen proconsuls regard i hopeand yours too citizen lalouët i want nothing more except the success of my plan  young lalouët jumped down to his feet he shrugged his shoulders and through his fine eyes shot a glance of mockery and scorn on the thin shrunken figure of the terrorist  how you do hate that englishman citizen chauvelin he said with a light laugh   iv  carrier having fully realised that he in any case stood to make a vast sum of money out of the capture of the band of english spies gave his support generously to chauvelins scheme fleury summoned into his presence was ordered to place himself and half a company of marats at the disposal of citizen chauvelin he demurred and growled like a bear with a sore head at being placed under the orders of a civilian but it was not easy to run counter to the proconsuls will a good deal of swearing one or two overt threats and the citizen commandant was reduced to submission the promise of a thousand francs when the reward for the capture of the english spies was paid out by a grateful government overcame his last objections  i think you should rid yourself of that obstinate oaf was young lalouëts cynical comment when fleury had finally left the audience chamber he is too argumentative for my taste  chauvelin smiled quietly to himself he cared little what became of every one of these nantese louts once his great object had been attained  i need not trouble you further citizen carrier he said as he finally rose to take his leave i shall have my hands full until i myself lay that meddlesome englishman bound and gagged at your feet  the phrase delighted carriers insensate vanity he was overgracious to chauvelin now  you shall do that at the rat mort citizen chauvelin he said with marked affability and i myself will commend you for your zeal to the committee of public safety  always supposing interposed jacques lalouët with his cynical laugh that citizen chauvelin does not let the whole rabble slip through his fingers  if i do concluded chauvelin drily you may drag the loire for my body tomorrow  oh laughed carrier we wont trouble to do that au revoir citizen chauvelin he added with one of his grandiloquent gestures of dismissal i wish you luck at the rat mort tonight  jacques lalouët ushered chauvelin out when he was finally left standing alone at the head of the stairs and young lalouëts footsteps had ceased to resound across the floors of the rooms beyond he remained quite still for awhile his eyes fixed into vacancy his face set and expressionless and through his lips there came a longdrawnout sigh of intense satisfaction  and now my fine scarlet pimpernel he murmured softly once more à nous deux  then he ran swiftly down the stairs and a moment later was once more speeding toward le bouffay     chapter v  the message of hope   i  after martinroget and chauvelin had left her yvonne had sat for a long time motionless almost unconscious it seemed as if gradually hour by hour minute by minute her every feeling of courage and of hope were deserting her three days now she had been separated from her fatherthree days she had been under the constant supervision of a woman who had not a single thought of compassion or of mercy for the aristocrat whom she hated so bitterly  at night curled up on a small bundle of dank straw yvonne had made vain efforts to snatch a little sleep ever since the day when she had been ruthlessly torn away from the protection of her dear milor she had persistently clung to the belief that he would find the means to come to her to wrest her from the cruel fate which her pitiless enemies had devised for her she had clung to that hope throughout that dreary journey from dear england to this abominable city she had clung to it even whilst her father knelt at her feet in an agony of remorse she had clung to hope while martinroget alternately coaxed and terrorised her while her father was dragged away from her while she endured untold misery starvation humiliation at the hands of louise adet but nowquite unaccountablythat hope seemed suddenly to have fled from her leaving her lonely and inexpressibly desolate that small shrunken figure which wrapped in a dark mantle had stood in the corner of the room watching her like a serpent watches its prey had seemed like the forerunner of the fate with which martinroget gloating over her helplessness had already threatened her  she knew of course that neither from him nor from the callous brute who governed nantes could she expect the slightest justice or mercy she had been brought here by martinroget not only to die but to suffer grievously at his hands in return for a crime for which she personally was in no way responsible to hope for mercy from him at the eleventh hour were worse than futile her already overburdened heart ached at thought of her father he suffered all that she suffered and in addition he must be tortured with anxiety for her and with remorse sometimes she was afraid that under the stress of desperate soulagony he might perhaps have been led to suicide she knew nothing of what had happened to him where he was nor whether privations and lack of food or sleep together with martinrogets threats had by now weakened his morale and turned his pride into humiliating submission   ii  a distant towerclock struck the evening hours one after the other yvonne for the past three days had only been vaguely conscious of time martinroget had spoken of a few hours respite only of the proconsuls desire to be soon rid of her well this meant no doubt that the morrow would see the end of it allthe end of her life which such a brief while ago seemed so full of delight of love and of happiness  the end of her life she had hardly begun to live and her dear milor had whispered to her such sweet promises of endless vistas of bliss  yvonne shivered beneath her thin gown the northwesterly blast came in cruel gusts through the unglazed window and a vague instinct of selfpreservation caused yvonne to seek shelter in the one corner of the room where the icy draught did not penetrate quite so freely  eight nine and ten struck from the towerclock far away she heard these sounds as in a dream tired cold and hungry her vitality at that moment was at its lowest ebband with her back resting against the wall she fell presently into a torporlike sleep  suddenly something roused her and in an instant she sat upwideawake and wideeyed every one of her senses conscious and on the alert something had roused herat first she could not say what it wasor remember then presently individual sounds detached themselves from the buzzing in her ears hitherto the house had always been so still except on the isolated occasions when martinroget had come to visit her and his heavy tread had caused every loose board in the tumbledown house to creak it was only louise adets shuffling footsteps which had roused the dormant echoes when she crept upstairs either to her own room or to throw a piece of stale bread to her prisoner  but nowit was neither martinrogets heavy footfall nor the shuffling gait of louise adet which had roused yvonne from her trancelike sleep it was a gentle soft creeping step which was slowly cautiously mounting the stairs yvonne crouching against the wall could count every treadnow and then a board creakednow and then the footsteps halted  yvonne wideeyed her heart stirred by a nameless terror was watching the door  the piece of tallowcandle flickered in the draught its feeble light just touched the remote corner of the room and yvonne heard those soft creeping footsteps as they reached the landing and came to a halt outside the door  every drop of blood in her seemed to be frozen by terror her knees shook her heart almost stopped its beating  under the door something small and white had just been introduceda scrap of paper and there it remainedwhite against the darkness of the unwashed boardsa mysterious message left here by an unknown hand whilst the unknown footsteps softly crept down the stairs again  for awhile longer yvonne remained as she wascowering against the walllike a timid little animal fearful lest that innocentlooking object hid some unthoughtof danger then at last she gathered courage trembling with excitement she raised herself to her knees and then on hands and kneesfor she was very weak and faintshe crawled up to that mysterious piece of paper and picked it up  her trembling hand closed over it with wide staring terrorfilled eyes she looked all round the narrow room ere she dared cast one more glance on that mysterious scrap of paper then she struggled to her feet and tottered up to the table she sat down and with fingers numbed with cold she smoothed out the paper and held it close to the light trying to read what was written on it  her sight was blurred she had to pull herself resolutely together for suddenly she felt ashamed of her weakness and her overwhelming terror yielded to feverish excitement  the scrap of paper contained a messagea message addressed to her in that name of which she was so proudthe name which she thought she would never be allowed to bear again lady anthony dewhurst she reiterated the words several times her lips clinging lovingly to themand just below them there was a small device drawn in red ink  a tiny flower with five petals  yvonne frowned and murmured vaguely puzzledno longer frightened now a flower  drawn in red  what can it mean  and as a vague memory struggled for expression in her troubled mind she added half aloud oh if it should be   but now suddenly all her fears fell away from her hope was once more knocking at the gates of her heartvague memories had taken definite shape  the mysterious letter  the message of hope  the red flower  all were gaining significance she stooped low to read the letter by the feeble light of the flickering candle she read it through with her eyes firstthen with her lips in a soft murmur while her mind gradually took in all that it meant for her       keep up your courage your friends are inside the city and on the      watch try the door of your prison every evening at one hour before      midnight once you will find it yield slip out and creep      noiselessly down the stairs at the bottom a friendly hand will be      stretched out for you take it with confidenceit will lead you to      safety and to freedom courage and secrecy  when she had finished reading her eyes were swimming in tears there was no longer any doubt in her mind about the message now for her dear milor had so often spoken to her about the brave scarlet pimpernel who had risked his precious life many a time ere this in order to render service to the innocent and the oppressed and now of a surety this message came from him from her dear milor and from his gallant chief there was the small devicethe little red flower which had so often brought hope to despairing hearts and it was more than hope that it brought to yvonne it brought certitude and happiness and a sweet tender remorse that she should ever have doubted she ought to have known all along that everything would be for the best she had no right ever to have given way to despair in her heart she prayed for forgiveness from her dear absent milor  how could she ever doubt him was it likely that he would abandon herhe and that brave friend of his whose powers were indeed magical why she ought to have done her best to keep up her physical as well as her mental facultieswho knows but perhaps physical strength might be of inestimable value both to herself and to her gallant rescuers presently  she took up the stale brown bread and ate it resolutely she drank some water and then stamped round the room to get some warmth into her limbs  a distant clock had struck ten awhile agoand if possible she ought to get an hours rest before the time came for her to be strong and to act so she shook up her meagre straw paillasse and lay down determined if possible to get a little sleepfor indeed she felt that that was just what her dear milor would have wished her to do  thus time went bywaking or dreaming yvonne could never afterwards have said in what state she waited during that one long hour which separated her from the great blissful moment the bit of candle burnt low and presently died out after that yvonne remained quite still upon the straw in total darkness no light came in through the tiny window only the cold northwesterly wind blew in in gusts but of a surety the prisoner who was within sight of freedom felt neither cold nor fatigue now  the towerclock in the distance struck the quarters with dreary monotony   iii  the last stroke of eleven ceased to vibrate through the stillness of the winters night  yvonne roused herself from the torporlike state into which she had fallen she tried to struggle to her feet but intensity of excitement had caused a strange numbness to invade her limbs she could hardly move a second or two ago it had seemed to her that she heard a gentle scraping noise at the doora drawing of boltsthe grating of a key in the lockthen again soft shuffling footsteps that came and went and that were not those of louise adet  at last yvonne contrived to stand on her feet but she had to close her eyes and to remain quite still for awhile after that for her ears were buzzing and her head swimming she thought that she must fall if she moved and mayhap lose consciousness  but this state of weakness only lasted a few seconds the next she had groped her way to the door and her hand had found the iron latch it yielded then she waited calling up all her strengthfor the hour had come wherein she must not only think and act for herself but think of every possibility which might occur and act as she imagined her dear lord would require it of her  she pressed the clumsy iron latch further it yielded again and anon she was able to push open the door  excited yet confident she tiptoed out of the room the darknesslike unto pitchwas terribly disconcerting with the exception of her narrow prison yvonne had only once seen the interior of the house and that was when half fainting she had been dragged across its threshold and up the stairs she had therefore only a very vague idea as to where the stairs lay and how she was to get about without stumbling  slowly and cautiously she crept a few paces forward then she turned and carefully closed the door behind her there was not a sound inside the house everything was silent around her neither footfall nor whisperings reached her straining ears she felt about her with her hands she crouched down on her knees anon she discovered the head of the stairs  then suddenly she drew back like a frightened hare conscious of danger all the blood rushed back to her heart making it beat so violently that she once more felt sick and faint a soundgentle as a breathhad broken that absolute and dead silence which up to now had given her confidence she felt suddenly that she was no longer alone in the darknessthat somewhere close by there was some onefriend or foewho was lying in watch for herthat somewhere in the darkness something moved and breathed  the crackling of the paper inside her kerchief served to remind her that her dear milor was on the watch and that the blessed message had spoken of a friendly hand which would be stretched out to her and which she was enjoined to take with confidence reassured she crept on again and anon a softly murmured hushshsh reached her ear it seemed to come from down belownot very farand yvonne having once more located the head of the stairs with her hands began slowly to creep downstairssoftly as a mousestep by stepbut every time that a board creaked she paused terrified listening for louise adets heavy footstep for a sound that would mean the near approach of danger  hushshsh came again as a gentle murmur from below and the something that moved and breathed in the darkness seemed to draw nearer to yvonne  a few more seconds of soulracking suspense a few more steps down the creaking stairs and she felt a strong hand laid upon her wrist and heard a muffled voice whisper in english  all is well trust me follow me  she did not recognise the voice even though there was something vaguely familiar in its intonation yvonne did not pause to conjecture she had been made happy by the very sound of the language which stood to her for every word of love she had ever heard it restored her courage and her confidence in their fullest measure  obeying the whispered command yvonne was content now to follow her mysterious guide who had hold of her hand the stairs were steep and windingat a turn she perceived a feeble light at their foot down below up against this feeble light the form of her guide was silhouetted in a broad dark mass yvonne could see nothing of him beyond the square outline of his shoulders and that of his sugarloaf hat her mind now was thrilled with excitement and her fingers closed almost convulsively round his hand he led her across louise adets back kitchen it was from here that the feeble light camefrom a small oil lamp which stood on the centre table it helped to guide yvonne and her mysterious friend to the bottom of the stairs then across the kitchen to the front door where again complete darkness reigned but soon yvonnewho was following blindly whithersoever she was ledheard the click of a latch and the grating of a door upon its hinges a cold current of air caught her straight in the face she could see nothing for it seemed to be as dark out of doors as in but she had the sensation of that open door of a threshold to cross of freedom and happiness beckoning to her straight out of the gloom within the next second or two she would be out of this terrible place its squalid and dank walls would be behind her on ahead in that thrice welcome obscurity her dear milor and his powerful friend were beckoning to her to come boldly ontheir protecting arms were already stretched out for her it seemed to her excited fancy as if the cold nightwind brought to her ears the echo of their endearing words  she filled her lungs with the keen winter air hope happiness excitement thrilled her every nerve  a short walk my lady whispered the guide still speaking in english you are not cold  no no i am not cold she whispered in reply i am conscious of nothing save that i am free  and you are not afraid  indeed indeed i am not afraid she murmured fervently may god reward you sir for what you do  again there had been that certain somethingvaguely familiarin the way the man spoke which for the moment piqued yvonnes curiosity she did not of a truth know english well enough to detect the very obvious foreign intonation she only felt that sometime in the dim and happy past she had heard this man speak but even this vague sense of puzzlement she dismissed very quickly from her mind was she not taking everything on trust indeed hope and confidence had a very firm hold on her at last     chapter vi  the rat mort   i  the guide had stepped out of the house into the street yvonne following closely on his heels the night was very dark and the narrow little carrefour de la poissonnerie very sparsely lighted somewhere overhead on the right something groaned and creaked persistently in the wind a little further on a street lanthorn was swinging aloft throwing a small circle of dim yellowish light on the unpaved street below by its fitful glimmer yvonne could vaguely perceive the tall figure of her guide as he stepped out with noiseless yet firm tread his shoulder brushing against the side of the nearest house as he kept closely within the shadow of its high wall the sight of his broad back thrilled her she had fallen to imagining whether this was not perchance that gallant and allpowerful scarlet pimpernel himself the mysterious friend of whom her dear milor so often spoke with an admiration that was akin to worship he too was probably tall and broadfor english gentlemen were usually built that way and yvonnes overexcited mind went galloping on the wings of fancy and in her heart she felt that she was glad that she had suffered so much and then lived through such a glorious moment as this  now from the narrow unpaved yard in front of the house the guide turned sharply to the right yvonne could only distinguish outlines the streets of nantes were familiar to her and she knew pretty well where she was the lanthorn inside the clock tower of le bouffay guided herit was now on her rightthe house wherein she had been kept a prisoner these past three days was built against the walls of the great prison house she knew that she was in the carrefour de la poissonnerie  she felt neither fatigue nor cold for she was wildly excited the keen northwesterly wind searched all the weak places in her worn clothing and her thin shoes were wet through but her courage up to this point had never once forsaken her hope and the feeling of freedom gave her marvellous strength and when her guide paused a moment ere he turned the angle of the high wall and whispered hurriedly you have courage my lady she was able to answer serenely in plenty sir  she tried to peer into the darkness in order to realise whither she was being led the guide had come to a halt in front of the house which was next to that of louise adet it projected several feet in front of the latter the thing that had creaked so weirdly in the wind turned out to be a painted sign which swung out from an iron bracket fixed into the wall yvonne could not read the writing on the sign but she noticed that just above it there was a small window dimly lighted from within  what sort of a house it was yvonne could not of course see the frontage was dark save for narrow streaks of light which peeped through the interstices of the door and through the chinks of illfastened shutters on either side not a sound came from within but now that the guide had come to a halt it seemed to yvonnewhose nerves and senses had become preternaturally acutethat the whole air around her was filled with muffled sounds and when she stood still and strained her ears to listen she was conscious right through the inky blackness of vague formsshapeless and silentthat glided past her in the gloom   ii  your friends will meet you here the guide whispered as he pointed to the door of the house in front of him the door is on the latch push it open and walk in boldly then gather up all your courage for you will find yourself in the company of poor people whose manners are somewhat rougher than those to which you have been accustomed but though the people are uncouth you will find them kind above all you will find that they will pay no heed to you so i entreat you do not be afraid your friends would have arranged for a more refined place wherein to come and find you but as you may well imagine they had no choice  i quite understand sir said yvonne quietly and i am not afraid  ah thats brave he rejoined then do as i tell you i give you my word that inside that house you will be perfectly safe until such time as your friends are able to get to you you may have to wait an hour or even two you must have patience find a quiet place in one of the comers of the room and sit there quietly taking no notice of what goes on around you you will be quite safe and the arrival of your friends is only a question of time  my friends sir she said earnestly and her voice shook slightly as she spoke are you not one of the most devoted friends i can ever hope to have i cannot find the words now wherewith to thank you but  i pray you do not thank me he broke in gruffly and do not waste time in parleying the open street is none too safe a place for you just now the house is  his hand was on the latch and he was about to push open the door when yvonne stopped him with a word  my father she whispered with passionate entreaty will you help him too  m le duc de kernogan is as safe as you are my lady he replied he will join you anon i pray you have no fears for him your friends are caring for him in the same way as they care for you  then i shall see him  soon  very soon and in the meanwhile he added i pray you to sit quite still and to wait events  despite anything you may see or hear your fathers safety and your ownnot to speak of that of your friendshangs on your quiescence your silence your obedience  i will remember sir rejoined yvonne quietly i in my turn entreat you to have no fears for me  even while she said this the man pushed the door open   iii  yvonne had meant to be brave above all she had meant to be obedient but even so she could not help recoiling at sight of the place where she had just been told she must wait patiently and silently for an hour or even two  the room into which her guide now gently urged her forward was large and low only dimly lighted by an oillamp which hung from the ceiling and emitted a thin stream of black smoke and evil smell such air as there was was foul and reeked of the fumes of alcohol and charcoal of the smoking lamp and of rancid grease the walls had no doubt been whitewashed once now they were of a dull greyish tint with here and there hideous stains of red or the marks of a set of greasy fingers the plaster was hanging in strips and lumps from the ceiling it had fallen away in patches from the walls where it displayed the skeleton laths beneath there were two doors in the wall immediately facing the front entrance and on each side of the latter there was a small window both insecurely shuttered to yvonne the whole place appeared unspeakably squalid and noisome even as she entered her ears caught the sound of hideous muttered blasphemy followed by quickly suppressed hoarse and mirthless laughter and the piteous cry of an infant at the breast  there were perhaps sixteen to twenty people in the roomamongst them a goodly number of women some of whom had tiny miserable atoms of humanity clinging to their ragged skirts a group of men in tattered shirts bare shins and sabots stood in the centre of the room and had apparently been in conclave when the entrance of yvonne and her guide caused them to turn quickly to the door and to scan the newcomers with a furtive suspicious look which would have been pathetic had it not been so full of evil intent the muttered blasphemy had come from this group one or two of the men spat upon the ground in the direction of the door where yvonne instinctively had remained rooted to the spot  as for the women they only betrayed their sex by the ragged clothes which they wore there was not a face here which had on it a single line of softness or of gentleness they might have been old women or young their hair was of a uniform nondescript colour lank and unkempt hanging in thin strands over their brows their eyes were sunken their cheeks either flaccid or haggardthere was no individuality amongst themjust one uniform sisterhood of wretchedness which had already gone hand in hand with crime  across one angle of the room there was a high wooden counter like a bar on which stood a number of jugs and bottles some chunks of bread and pieces of cheese and a collection of pewter mugs an old man and a fat coarsefeatured middleaged woman stood behind it and dispensed various noxiouslooking liquors above their heads upon the grimy tumbledown wall the republican device liberté egalité fraternité was scrawled in charcoal in huge characters and below it was scribbled the hideous doggrel which an impious mind had fashioned last autumn on the subject of the martyred queen   iv  yvonne had closed her eyes for a moment as she entered now she turned appealingly toward her guide  must it be in here she asked  i am afraid it must he replied with a sigh you told me that you would be brave  she pulled herself together resolutely i will be brave she said quietly  ah thats better he rejoined i give you my word that you will be absolutely safe in here until such time as your friends can get to you i entreat you to gather up your courage i assure you that these wretched people are not unkind miserynot unlike that which you yourself have enduredhas made them what they are no doubt we should have arranged for a better place for you wherein to await your friends if we had the choice but you will understand that your safety and our own had to be our paramount consideration and we had no choice  i quite understand sir said yvonne valiantly and am already ashamed of my fears  and without another word of protest she stepped boldly into the room  for a moment or two the guide remained standing on the threshold watching yvonnes progress she had already perceived an empty bench in the furthest angle of the room up against the door opposite where she hoped or believed that she could remain unmolested while she waited patiently and in silence as she had been ordered to do she skirted the groups of men in the centre of the room as she went but even so she felt more than she heard that muttered insults accompanied the furtive and glowering looks wherewith she was regarded more than one wretch spat upon her skirts on the way  but now she was in no sense frightened only wildly excited even her feeling of horror she contrived to conquer the knowledge that her own attitude and above all her obedience would help her gallant rescuers in their work gave her enduring strength she felt quite confident that within an hour or two she would be in the arms of her dear milor who had risked his life in order to come to her it was indeed well worth while to have suffered as she had done to endure all that she might yet have to endure for the sake of the happiness which was in store for her  she turned to give a last look at her guidea look which was intended to reassure him completely as to her courage and her obedience but already he had gone and had closed the door behind him and quite against her will the sudden sense of loneliness and helplessness clutched at her heart with a grip that made it ache she wished that she had succeeded in catching sight of the face of so valiant a friend the fact that she was safely out of louise adets vengeful clutches was due to the man who had just disappeared behind that door it would be thanks to him presently if she saw her father again yvonne felt more convinced than ever that he was the scarlet pimpernelmilors friendwho kept his valiant personality a mystery even to those who owed their lives to him she had seen the outline of his broad figure she had felt the touch of his hand would she recognise these again when she met him in england in the happy days that were to come in any case she thought that she would recognise the voice and the manner of speaking so unlike that of any english gentleman she had known   v  the man who had so mysteriously led yvonne de kernogan from the house of louise adet to the rat mort turned away from the door of the tavern as soon as it had closed on the young girl and started to go back the way he came  at the angle formed by the high wall of the tavern he paused a moving form had detached itself from the surrounding gloom and hailed him with a cautious whisper  hist citizen martinroget is that you  yes  everything just as we anticipated  everything  and the wench safely inside  quite safely  the other gave a low cackle which might have been intended for a laugh  the simplest means he said are always the best  she never suspected me it was all perfectly simple you are a magician citizen chauvelin added martinroget grudgingly i never would have thought of such a clever ruse  you see rejoined chauvelin drily i graduated in the school of a master of all rusesa master of daring and a past master in the art of mimicry and hope was our great allythe hope that never forsakes a prisonerthat of getting free your fair yvonne had boundless faith in the power of her english friends therefore she fell into our trap like a bird  and like a bird she shall struggle in vain after this said martinroget slowly oh that i could hasten the flight of timethe next few minutes will hang on me like hours and i wish too it were not so bitterly cold he added with a curse this northwesterly wind has got into my bones  on to your nerves i imagine citizen retorted chauvelin with a laugh for my part i feel as warm and comfortable as on a lovely day in june  hark who goes there broke in the other man abruptly as a solitary moving form detached itself from the surrounding inky blackness and the sound of measured footsteps broke the silence of the night  quite in order citizen was the prompt reply  the shadowy form came a step or two further forward  is it you citizen fleury queried chauvelin  himself citizen replied the other  the men had spoken in a whisper fleury now placed his hand on chauvelins arm  we had best not stand so close to the tavern he said the night hawks are already about and we dont want to scare them  he led the others up the yard then into a very narrow passage which lay between louise adets house and the rat mort and was bordered by the high walls of the houses on either side  this is a blind alley he whispered we have the wall of le bouffay in front of us the wall of the rat mort is on one side and the house of the citizeness adet on the other we can talk here undisturbed  overhead there was a tiny window dimly lighted from within chauvelin pointed up to it  what is that he asked  an aperture too small for any human being to pass through replied fleury drily it gives on a small landing at the foot of the stairs i told friche to try and manoeuvre so that the wench and her father are pushed in there out of the way while the worst of the fracas is going on that was your suggestion citizen chauvelin  it was i was afraid the two aristos might get spirited away while your men were tackling the crowd in the taproom i wanted them put away in a safe place  the staircase is safe enough rejoined fleury it has no egress save that on the taproom and only leads to the upper story and the attic the house has no back entranceit is built against the wall of le bouffay  and what about your marats citizen commandant  oh i have them all along the streetentirely under cover but closely on the watchhalf a company and all keen after the game the thousand francs you promised them has stimulated their zeal most marvellously and as soon as paul friche in there has whipped up the tempers of the frequenters of the rat mort we shall be ready to rush the place and i assure you citizen chauvelin that only a disembodied ghostif there be one in the placewill succeed in evading arrest  is paul friche already at his post then  and at workor im much mistaken replied fleury as he suddenly gripped chauvelin by the arm  for just at this moment the silence of the winters night was broken by loud cries which came from the interior of the rat mortvoices were raised to hoarse and raucous criesmen and women all appeared to be shrieking together and presently there was a loud crash as of overturned furniture and broken glass  a few minutes longer citizen fleury said chauvelin as the commandant of the marats turned on his heel and started to go back to the carrefour de la poissonnerie  oh yes whispered the latter well wait awhile longer to give the englishmen time to arrive on the scene the coast is clear for themmy marats are hidden from sight behind the doorways and shopfronts of the houses opposite in about three minutes from now ill send them forward  and good luck to your hunting citizen whispered chauvelin in response  fleury very quickly disappeared in the darkness and the other two men followed in his wake they hugged the wall of the rat mort as they went along and its shadow enveloped them completely their shoes made no sound on the unpaved ground chauvelins nostrils quivered as he drew the keen cold air into his lungs and faced the northwesterly blast which at this moment also lashed the face of his enemy his keen eyes tried to pierce the gloom his ears were strained to hear that merry peal of laughter which in the unforgettable past had been wont to proclaim the presence of the reckless adventurer he knewhe feltas certainly as he felt the air which he breathed that the man whom he hated beyond everything on earth was somewhere close by wrapped in the murkiness of the nightthinking planning intriguing pitting his sharp wits his indomitable pluck his impudent daredevilry against the sure and patient trap which had been set for him  half a company of marats in frontthe walls of le bouffay in the rear chauvelin rubbed his thin hands together  you are not a disembodied ghost my fine scarlet pimpernel he murmured and this time i really think     chapter vii  the fracas in the tavern   i  yvonne had settled herself in a corner of the taproom on a bench and had tried to lose consciousness of her surroundings  it was not easy glances charged with rancour were levelled at her dainty appearancedainty and refined despite the look of starvation and of weariness on her face and the miserable state of her clothingand not a few muttered insults waited on those glances  as soon as she was seated yvonne noticed that the old man and the coarse fat woman behind the bar started an animated conversation together of which she was very obviously the object for the two headsthe lean and the roundwere jerked more than once in her direction presently the manit was george lemoine the proprietor of the rat mortcame up to where she was sitting his lank figure was bent so that his lean back formed the best part of an arc and an expression of mock deference further distorted his ugly face  he came up quite close to yvonne and she found it passing difficult not to draw away from him for the leer on his face was appalling his eyes which were set very near to his hooked nose had a horrible squint his lips were thick and moist and his breath reeked of alcohol  what will the noble lady deign to drink he now asked in an oily suave voice  and yvonne remembering the guides admonitions contrived to smile unconcernedly into the hideous face  i would very much like some wine she said cheerfully but i am afraid that i have no money wherewith to pay you for it  the creature with a gesture of abject humility rubbed his greasy hands together  and may i respectfully ask he queried blandly what are the intentions of the noble lady in coming to this humble abode if she hath no desire to partake of refreshments  i am expecting friends replied yvonne bravely they will be here very soon and will gladly repay you lavishly for all the kindness which you may be inclined to show to me the while  she was very brave indeed and looked this awful misshapen specimen of a man quite boldly in the face she even contrived to smile though she was well aware that a number of men and womenperhaps a dozen altogetherhad congregated in front of her in a compact group around the landlord that they were nudging one another and pointing derisivelymalevolentlyat her it was impossible despite all attempts at valour to mistake the hostile attitude of these people some of the most obscene words coined during these last horrible days of the revolution were freely hurled at her and one woman suddenly cried out in a shrill treble  throw her out citizen lemoine we dont want spies in here  indeed indeed said yvonne as quietly as she could i am no spy i am poor and wreched like yourselves and desperately lonely save for the kind friends who will meet me here anon  aristos like yourself growled one of the men this is no place for you or for them  no no this is no place for aristos cried one of the women in a voice which many excesses and many vices had rendered hoarse and rough spy or not we dont want you in here do we she added as with arms akimbo she turned to face those of her own sex who behind the men had come up in order to see what was going on  throw her out lemoine reiterated a man who appeared to be an oracle amongst the others  please please let me stop here pleaded yvonne if you turn me out i shall not know what to do i shall not know where to meet my friends  pretty story about those friends broke in lemoine roughly how do i know if youre lying or not  from the opposite angle of the room the woman behind the bar had been watching the little scene with eyes that glistened with cupidity now she emerged from behind her stronghold of bottles and mugs and slowly waddled across the room she pushed her way unceremoniously past her customers elbowing men women and children vigorously aside with a deft play of her large muscular arms having reached the forefront of the little group she came to a standstill immediately in front of yvonne and crossing her mighty arms over her ponderous chest she eyed the aristo with unconcealed malignity  we do know that the slut is lyingthat is where you make the mistake lemoine a slut thats what she isand the friend whom shes going to meet  well she added turning with an ugly leer toward the other women we all know what sort of friend that one is likely to be eh mesdames bringing evil fame on this house thats what the wench is after  so as to bring the police about our ears  i wouldnt trust her not another minute out with you and at oncedo you hear this instant  lemoine has parleyed quite long enough with you already  despite all her resolutions yvonne was terribly frightened while the hideous old hag talked and screamed and waved her coarse red arms about the unfortunate young girl with a great effort of will kept repeating to herself i am not frightenedi must not be frightened he assured me that these people would do me no harm but now when the woman had ceased speaking there was a general murmur of  throw her out spy or aristo we dont want her here whilst some of the men added significantly i am sure that she is one of carriers spies and in league with his marats we shall have those devils in here in a moment if we dont look out throw her out before she can signal to the marats  ugly faces charged with hatred and virulence were thrust threateningly forwardone or two of the women were obviously looking forward to joining in the scramble when this stuckup wench would presently be hurled out into the street  now then my girl out you get concluded the woman lemoine as with an expressive gesture she proceeded to roll her sleeves higher up her arm she was about to lay her dirty hands on yvonne and the poor girl was nearly sick with horror when one of the mena huge coarse giant whose muscular torso covered with grease and grime showed almost naked through a ragged shirt which hung from his shoulders in stripsseized the woman lemoine by the arm and dragged her back a step or two away from yvonne  dont be a fool petite mère he said accompanying this admonition with a blasphemous oath slut or no the wench may as well pay you something for the privilege of staying here look at that cloak shes wearingthe shoeleather on her feet arent they worth a bottle of your sour wine  whats that to you paul friche retorted the woman roughly as with a vigorous gesture she freed her arm from the mans grasp is this my house or yours  yours of course replied the man with a coarse laugh and a still coarser jest but this wont be the first time that i have saved you from impulsive folly yesterday you were for harbouring a couple of rogues who were marats in disguise if i hadnt given you warning you would now have swallowed more water from the loire than you would care to hold but for me two days ago you would have received the goods pinched by ferté out of balazes shop and been thrown to the fishes in consequence for the entertainment of the proconsul and his friends you must admit that ive been a good friend to you before now  and if you have paul friche retorted the hag obstinately i paid you well for your friendship both yesterday and the day before didnt i  you did assented friche imperturbably thats why i want to serve you again tonight  dont listen to him petite mère interposed one of two out of the crowd he is a whitelivered skunk to talk to you like that  very well very well quoth paul friche and he spat vigorously on the ground in token that henceforth he divested himself from any responsibility in this matter dont listen to me lose a benefit of twenty perhaps forty francs for the sake of a bit of fun very well very well he continued as he turned and slouched out of the group to the further end of the room where he sat down on a barrel he drew the stump of a clay pipe out of the pocket of his breeches stuffed it into his mouth stretched his long legs out before him and sucked away at his pipe with complacent detachment i didnt know he added with biting sarcasm by way of a parting shot that you and lemoine had come into a fortune recently and that forty or fifty francs are nothing to you now  forty or fifty come come protested lemoine feebly   ii  yvonnes fate was hanging in the balance the attitude of the small crowd was no less threatening than before but immediate action was withheld while the lemoines obviously debated in their minds what was best to be done the instinct to have at an aristo with all the accumulated hatred of many generations was warring with the innate rapacity of the breton peasant  forty or fifty reiterated paul friche emphatically cant you see that the wench is an aristo escaped out of le bouffay or the entrepôt he added contemptuously  i know that she is an aristo said the woman thats why i want to throw her out  and get nothing for your pains retorted friche roughly if you wait for her friends we may all of us get as much as twenty francs each to hold our tongues  twenty francs each the murmur was repeated with many a sigh of savage gluttony by every one in the roomand repeated again and againespecially by the women  you are a fool paul friche  commented lemoine  a fool am i retorted the giant then let me tell you that tis you who are a fool and worse i happen to know he added as he once more rose and rejoined the group in the centre of the room i happen to know that you and every one here is heading straight for a trap arranged by the committee of public safety whose chief emissary came into nantes awhile ago and is named chauvelin it is a trap which will land you all in the criminal dock first and on the way to cayenne or the guillotine afterwards this place is surrounded with marats and orders have been issued to them to make a descent on this place as soon as papa lemoines customers are assembled there are two members of the accursed company amongst us at the present moment  he was standing right in the middle of the room immediately beneath the hanging lamp at his wordsspoken with such firm confidence as one who knows and is therefore empowered to speaka sudden change came over the spirit of the whole assembly everything was forgotten in the face of this new dangertwo marats the sleuthhounds of the proconsulhere present as spies and as informants every face became more haggardevery cheek more livid there was a quick and furtive scurrying toward the front door  two marats here shouted one man who was bolder than the rest where are they  paul friche who towered above his friends stood at this moment quite close to a small man dressed like the others in ragged breeches and shirt and wearing the broadbrimmed hat usually affected by the breton peasantry  two marats two spies screeched a woman where are they  here is one replied paul friche with a loud laugh and with his large grimy hand he lifted the hat from his neighbours head and threw it on the ground and there he added as with long bony finger he pointed to the front door where another mana squarebuilt youngster with towcoloured hair somewhat resembling a shaggy dogwas endeavouring to effect a surreptitious exit there is the other and he is on the point of slipping quietly away in order to report to his captain what he has seen and heard at the rat mort one moment citizen he added and with a couple of giant strides he too had reached the door his large rough hand had come down heavily on the shoulder of the youth with the towcoloured hair and had forced him to veer round and to face the angry gesticulating crowd  two marats two spies shouted the men now well soon settle their little business for them  marat yourself cried the small man who had first been denounced by friche i am no marat as a good many of you here know maman lemoine he added pleading you know me am i a marat  but the lemoinesman and wifeat the first suggestion of police had turned a deaf ear to all their customers their own safety being in jeopardy they cared little what happened to anybody else they had retired behind their counter and were in close consultation together no doubt as to the best means of escape if indeed the man paul friche spoke the truth  i know nothing about him the woman was saying but he certainly was right last night about those two men who came ferreting in hereand last week too  am i a marat maman lemoine shouted the small man as he hammered his fists upon the counter for ten years and more i have been a customer in this place and  am i a marat shouted the youth with the towcoloured hair addressing the assembly indiscriminately some of you here know me well enough jean paul you knowledouble you too  of course of course i know you well enough jacques leroux came with a loud laugh from one of the crowd who said you were a marat  am i a marat maman lemoine reiterated the small man at the counter  oh leave me alone with your quarrels shouted the woman lemoine in reply settle them among yourselves  then if jacques leroux is not a marat now came in a bibulous voice from a distant comer of the room and this compeer here is known to maman lemoine where are the real marats who according to this fellow friche whom we none of us know are spying upon us  yes where are they suggested another show em to us paul friche or whatever your accursed name happens to be  tell us where you come from yourself screamed the woman with the shrill treble it seems to me quite possible that youre a marat yourself  this suggestion was at once taken up  marat yourself shouted the crowd and the two men who a moment ago had been accused of being spies in disguise shouted louder than the rest marat yourself   iii  after that pandemonium reigned  the words police and marats had aroused the terror of all these nighthawks who were wont to think themselves immune inside their lair and terror is at all times an evil counsellor in the space of a few seconds confusion held undisputed sway every one screamed waved arms stamped feet struck out with heavy bare fists at his nearest neighbour every ones hand was against every one else  spy marat informer were the three words that detached themselves most clearly from out the babel of vituperations freely hurled from end to end of the room  the children screamed the womens shrill or hoarse treble mingled with the cries and imprecations of the men  paul friche had noted that the turn of the tide was against him long before the first naked fist had been brandished in his face agile as a monkey he had pushed his way through to the bar and placing his two hands upon it with a swift leap he had taken up a sitting position in the very middle of the table amongst the jugs and bottles which he promptly seized and used as missiles and weapons whilst with his dangling feet encased in heavy sabots he kicked out vigorously and unceasingly against the shins of his foremost assailants  he had the advantage of position and used it cleverly in his right hand he held a pewter mug by the handle and used it as a swivel against his aggressors with great effect  the loire for youyou blackmailer liar traitor shouted some of the women who bolder than the men thrust shaking fists at paul friche as closely as that pewter mug would allow  break his jaw before he can yell for the police admonished one of the men from the rear before he can save his own skin  but those who shouted loudest had only their fists by way of weapon and paul friche had mugs and bottles and those sabots of his kicked out with uncomfortable agility  break my jaw will you he shouted every time that a blow from the mug went home a spy am i very well then heres for you jacques leroux go and nurse your cracked skull at home you want a row he added hitting at a youth who brandished a heavy fist in his face well you shall have it and as much of it as you like as much of it as will bring the patrols of police comfortably about your ears  bang went the pewter mug crashing against a mans hard skull bang went paul friches naked fist against the chest of another he was a hard hitter and swift  the lemoines from behind their bar shouted louder than the rest doing as much as their lungs would allow them in the way of admonishing entreating protestingcursing every one for a set of fools who were playing straight into the hands of the police  now then now then children stop that bellowing will you there are no spies here paul friche was only having his little joke we all know one another what  camels added lemoine more forcibly theyll bring the patrols about our ears for sure  paul friche was not by any means the only man who was being vigorously attacked after the first two or three minutes of this kingdom of pandemonium it was difficult to say who was quarrelling with whom old grudges were revived old feuds taken up there where they had previously been interrupted accusations of spying were followed by abuse for some past wrong of blacklegging or cheating a confrère the temperature of the room became suffocating all these violent passions seething within these four walls seemed to become tangible and to mingle with the atmosphere already surcharged with the fumes of alcohol of tobacco and of perspiring humanity there was many a blackeye already many a contusion more than one knifesurreptitiously drawnwas already stained with red   iv  there was also a stampede for the door one man gave the signal seeing that his mates were wasting precious time by venting their wrath against paul friche and then quarrelling among themselves he hoped to effect an escape ere the police came to stop the noise no one believed in the place being surrounded why should it be the marats were far too busy hunting up rebels and aristos to trouble much about the rat mort and its customers but it was quite possible that a brawl would bring a patrol along and then ware the police correctionnelle and the possibility of deportation or worse retreat was undoubtedly safer while there was time one man first then one or two more on his heels and those among the women who had children in their arms or clinging to their skirts they turned stealthily to the dooralmost ashamed of their cowardice ashamed lest they were seen abandoning the field of combat  it was while confusion reigned unchecked that yvonnewho was cowering frankly terrified at last in the corner of the room became aware that the door close beside herthe door situated immediately opposite the front entrancewas surreptitiously opened she turned quickly to lookfor she was like a terrorstricken little animal nowone that scents and feels and fears danger from every quarter round the door was being pushed open very slowly by what was still to yvonne an unseen hand somehow that opening door fascinated her for the moment she forgot the noise and the confusion around her  then suddenly with a great effort of will she checked the scream which had forced itself up to her throat  father was all that she contrived to say in a hoarse and passionate murmur  fortunately as he peered cautiously round the room m le duc caught sight of his daughter she was staring at himwideeyed her lips bloodless her cheeks the colour of ashes he looked but the ghost now of that proud aristocrat who little more than a week ago was the centre of a group of courtiers round the person of the heir to the english throne starved emaciated livid he was the shadow of his former self and there was a haunted look in his purplerimmed eyes which spoke with pathetic eloquence of sleepless nights and of a soul tortured with remorse  just for the moment no one took any notice of himevery one was shrieking every one was quarrelling and m le duc placing a finger to his lips stole cautiously round to his daughter the next instant they were clinging to one another these two who had endured so much togetherhe the father who had wrought such an unspeakable wrong and she the child who was so lonely so forlorn and almost happy in finding some one who belonged to her some one to whom she could cling  father dear what shall we do yvonne murmured for she felt the last shred of her fictitious courage oozing out of her in face of this awful lawlessness which literally paralysed her thinking faculties  sh dear whispered m le duc in reply we must get out of this loathsome place while this hideous row is going on i heard it all from the filthy garret up above where those devils have kept me these three days the door was not locked i crept downstairs no one is paying heed to us we can creep out come  but at the suggestion yvonnes spirits which had been stunned by the events of the past few moments revived with truly mercurial rapidity  no no dear she urged we must stay here you dont know i have had a messagefrom my own dear milormy husband  he sent a friend to take me out of the hideous prison where that awful pierre adet was keeping mea friend who assured me that my dear milor was watching over me  he brought me to this placeand begged me not to be frightened  but to wait patiently  and i must wait dear  i must wait  she spoke rapidly in whispers and in short jerky sentences m le duc listened to her wideeyed a deep line of puzzlement between his brows sorrow remorse starvation misery had in a measure numbed his mind the thought of help of hope of friends could not penetrate into his brain  a message he murmured inanely a message no no my girl you must trust no one pierre adet pierre adet is full of evil trickshe will trap you  he means to destroy us both  he has brought you here so that you should be murdered by these ferocious devils  impossible father dear she said still striving to speak bravely we have both of us been all this while in the power of pierre adet he could have had no object in bringing me here tonight  but the father who had been an insentient tool in the schemes of that miserable intriguer who had been the means of bringing his only child to this terrible and deadly passthe man who had listened to the lying counsels and proposals of his own most bitter enemy could only groan now in terror and in doubt  who can probe the depths of that abominable villains plans he murmured vaguely  in the meanwhile the little group who had thought prudence the better part of valour had reached the door the foremost man amongst them opened it and peered cautiously out into the darkness he turned back to those behind him put a finger to his lip and beckoned to them to follow him in silence  yvonne let us go whispered the duc who had seized his daughter by the hand  but father  let us go he reiterated pitiably i shall die if we stay here  it wont be for long father dear she entreated if milor should come with his friend and find us gone we should be endangering his life as well as our own  i dont believe it he rejoined with the obstinacy of weakness i dont believe in your message  how could milor or anyone come to your rescue my child no one knows that you are here in this hell in nantes  yvonne clung to him with the strength of despair she too was as terrified as any human creature could be and live but terror had not altogether swept away her belief in that mysterious message in that tall guide who had led her hither in that scarlet devicethe fivepetalled flower which stood for everything that was most gallant and most brave  she desired with all her might to remain heredespite everything despite the awful brawl that was raging round her and which sickened her despite the horror of the whole thingto remain here and to wait she put her arms round her father she dragged him back every time that he tried to move but a sort of unnatural strength seemed to have conquered his former debility his attempts to get away became more and more determined and more and more febrile  come yvonne we must go he continued to murmur intermittently and with evergrowing obstinacy no one will notice us i heard the noise from my garret upstairs i crept down i knew no one would notice me comewe must go  now is our time  father dear whither could we go once in the streets of nantes what would happen to us  we can find our way to the loire he retorted almost brutally he shook himself free from her restraining arms and gripped her firmly by the hand he tried to drag her toward the door whilst she still struggled to keep him back he had just caught sight of the group of men and women at the front door their leader was standing upon the threshold and was still peering out into the darkness  but the next moment they all came to a halt what their leader had perceived through the darkness did not evidently quite satisfy him he turned and held a whispered consultation with the others m le duc strove with all his might to join in with that group he felt that in its wake would lie the road to freedom he would have struck yvonne for standing in the way of her own safety  father dear she contrived finally to say to him if you go hence you will go alone nothing will move me from here because i know that milor will come  curse you for your obstinacy retorted the duc you jeopardise my life and yours  then suddenly from the angle of the room where wrangling and fighting were at their fiercest there came a loud call  look out père lemoine your aristos are running away you are losing your last chance of those fifty francs  it was paul friche who had shouted his position on the table was giving him a commanding view over the heads of the threatening shouting perspiring crowd and he had just caught sight of m le duc dragging his daughter by force toward the door  the authors of all this pother he added with an oath and they will get away whilst we have the police about our ears  name of a name of a dog swore lemoine from behind his bar that shall not be come along maman let us bring those aristos along here quick now  it was all done in a second lemoine and his wife with the weight and authority of the masters of the establishment contrived to elbow their way through the crowd the next moment yvonne felt herself forcibly dragged away from her father  this way my girl and no screaming a bibulous voice said in her ear no screaming or ill smash some of those front teeth of yours you said some rich friends were coming along for you presently well then come and wait for them out of the crowd  indeed yvonne had no desire to struggle or to scream salvation she thought had come to her and to her father in this rough guise in another moment mayhap he would have forced her to follow him to leave milor in the lurch to jeopardise for ever every chance of safety  it is all for the best father dear she managed to cry out over her shoulder for she had just caught sight of him being seized round the shoulders by lemoine and heard him protesting loudly  ill not go ill not go let me go he shouted hoarsely my daughter yvonne let me go you devil  but lemoine had twice the vigour of the duc de kernogan nor did he care one jot about the others protests he hated all this row inside his house but there had been rows in it before and he was beginning to hope that nothing serious would come of it on the other hand paul friche might be right about these aristos there might be forty or fifty francs to be made out of them and in any case they had one or two things upon their persons which might be worth a few francsand who knows they might even have something in their pockets worth taking  this hope and thought gave lemoine additional strength and seeing that the aristo struggled so desperately he thought to silence him by bringing his heavy fist with a crash upon the old mans head  yvonne a moi shouted m le duc ere he fell back senseless  that awful cry yvonne heard it as she was being dragged through the noisome crowd it mingled in her ear with the other awful soundsthe oaths and blasphemies which filled the air with their hideousness it died away just as a formidable crash against the entrance door suddenly silenced every cry within  all hands up came with a peremptory word of command from the doorway  mercy on us murmured the woman lemoine who still had yvonne by the hand we are undone this time  there was a clatter and grounding of armsa scurrying of bare feet and sabots upon the floor the mingled sounds of men trying to fly and being caught in the act and hurled back screams of terror from the women one or two pitiable calls a few shrill cries from frightened children a few dull thuds as of human bodies falling it was all so confused so unspeakably horrible yvonne was hardly conscious near her some one whispered hurriedly  put the aristos away somewhere maman lemoine  the whole thing may only be a scare  the marats may only be here about the aristos  they will probably leave you alone if you give them up  perhaps youll get a reward put them away till some of this row subsides  ill talk to commandant fleury if i can  yvonne felt her knees giving way under her there was nothing more to hope for nownothing she felt herself lifted from the groundshe was too sick and faint to realise what was happening through the din which filled her ears she vainly tried to distinguish her fathers voice again   v  a moment or two later she found herself squatting somewhere on the ground how she got here she did not knowwhere she was she knew still less she was in total darkness a fusty close smell of food and wine gave her a wretched feeling of nauseaher head ached intolerably her eyes were hot her throat dry there was a constant buzzing in her ears  the terrible sounds of fighting and screaming and cursing the crash of broken glass and overturned benches came to her as through a partitionclose by but muffled  in the immediate nearness all was silence and darkness     chapter viii  the english adventurers   i  it was with that muffled din still ringing in her ear and with the conception of all that was going on on the other side of the partition standing like an awesome spectre of evil before her mind that yvonne woke to the consciousness that her father was dead  he lay along the last halfdozen steps of a narrow wooden staircase which had its base in the narrow cupboardlike landing on to which the lemoines had just thrust them both through a small heartshaped hole cut in the door of the partitionwall a shaft of feeble light struck straight across to the foot of the stairs it lit up the recumbent figure of the last of the ducs de kernogan killed in a brawl in a house of evil fame  weakened by starvation by the hardships of the past few days his constitution undermined by privations and mayhap too by gnawing remorse he had succumbed to the stunning blow dealt to him by a half drunken brute his cry yvonne a moi was the last despairing call of a soul racked with remorse to the daughter whom he had so cruelly wronged  when first that feeble shaft of light had revealed to her the presence of that inert form upon the steps she had struggled to her feet anddazedhad tottered up to it even before she had touched the face the hands before she had bent her ear to the halfclosed mouth and failed to catch the slightest breath she knew the full extent of her misery the look in the wideopen eyes did not terrify her but they told her the truth and since then she had cowered beside her dead father on the bottom step of the narrow stairs her fingers tightly closed over that one hand which never would be raised against her  an unspeakable sense of horror filled her soul the thought that hethe proud father the haughty aristocrat should lie like this and in such a spot dragged in and thrown downno doubt by lemoinelike a parcel of rubbish and left here to be dragged away again and thrown again like a dog into some unhallowed groundthat thought was so horrible so monstrous that at first it dominated even sorrow then came the heartrending sense of loneliness yvonne dewhurst had endured so much these past few days that awhile ago she would have affirmed that nothing could appal her in the future but this was indeed the awful and overwhelming climax to what had already been a surfeit of misery  this she yvonne cowering beside her dead father with no one to stand between her and any insult any outrage which might be put upon her with nothing now but a few laths between her and that yelling screeching mob outside  oh the loneliness the utter utter loneliness  she kissed the inert hand the pale forehead with gentle reverent fingers she tried to smooth out those lines of horror and of fear which gave such a pitiful expression to the face of all the wrongs which her father had done her she never thought for a moment it was he who had brought her to this terrible pass he who had betrayed her into the hands of her deadliest enemy he who had torn her from the protecting arms of her dear milor and flung her and himself at the mercy of a set of inhuman wretches who knew neither compunction nor pity  but all this she forgot as she knelt beside the lifeless formthe last thing on earth that belonged to herthe last protection to which she might have clung   ii  out of the confusion of sounds which camedeadened by the intervening partitionto her ear it was impossible to distinguish anything very clearly all that yvonne could do as soon as she had in a measure collected her scattered senses was to try and piece together the events of the last few minutesminutes which indeed seemed like days and even years to her  instinctively she gave to the inert hand which she held an additional tender touch at any rate her father was out of it all he was at rest and at peace as for the rest it was in gods hands having only herself to think of now she ceased to care what became of her he was out of it all and those wretches after all could not do more than kill her a complete numbness of senses and of mind had succeeded the feverish excitement of the past few hours whether hope still survived at this moment in yvonne dewhursts mind it were impossible to say certain it is that it lay dormantburied beneath the overwhelming misery of her loneliness  she took the fichu from her shoulders and laid it reverently over the dead mans face she folded the hands across the breast she could not cry she could only pray and that quite mechanically  the thought of her dear milor of his clever friend of the message which she had received in prison of the guide who had led her to this awful place was relegatedalmost as a memoryin the furthermost cell of her brain   iii  but after awhile outraged nature still full of vitality and of youth reasserted itself she felt numb and cold and struggled to her feet from somewhere close to her a continuous current of air indicated the presence of some sort of window yvonne faint with the close and sickly smell which even that current failed to disperse felt her way all round the walls of the narrow landing  the window was in the wall between the partition and the staircase it was small and quite low down it was crossed with heavy iron bars yvonne leaned up against it grateful for the breath of pure air  for awhile yet she remained unconscious of everything save the confused din which still went on inside the tavern and at first the sounds which came through the grated window mingled with those on the other side of the partition but gradually as she contrived to fill her lungs with the cold breath of heaven it seemed as if a curtain was being slowly drawn away from her atrophied senses  just below the window two men were speaking she could hear them quite distinctly nowand soon one of the voicesclearer than the otherstruck her ear with unmistakable familiarity  i told paul friche to come out here and speak to me yvonne heard that same voice say  then he should be here replied the other and if i am not mistaken  there was a pause and then the first voice was raised again  halt is that paul friche  at your service citizen came in reply  well is everything working smoothly inside  quite smoothly but your englishmen are not there  how do you know  bah i know most of the faces that are to be found inside the rat mort at this hour there are no strangers among them  the voice that had sounded so familiar to yvonne was raised now in loud and coarse laughter  name of a dog i never for a moment thought that there were any englishmen about citizen chauvelin was suffering from nightmare  it is early yet came in response from a gentle bland voice you must have patience citizen  patience bah ejaculated the other roughly as i told you before tis but little i care about your english spies tis the kernogans i am interested in what have you done with them citizen  i got that blundering fool lemoine to lock them up on the landing at the bottom of the stairs  is that safe  absolutely it has no egress save into the taproom and up the stairs to the rooms above your english spies if they came now would have to fly in and out of those top windows ere they could get to the aristos  then in satans name keep them there awhile urged the more gentle insinuating voice until we can make sure of the english spies  tshaw what foolery interjected the other who appeared to be in a towering passion bring them out at once citizen friche  bring them out  right into the middle of the rabble in the taproom commandant fleury is directing the perquisitionhe is taking down the names of all that cattle which he is arresting inside the premiseslet the cidevant duc de kernogan and his exquisite daughter figure among the vilest cutthroats of nantes  citizen let me urge on you once more  came in earnest persuasive accents from that gentle voice  nothing broke in the other savagely to hll with your english spies it is the kernogans that i want  yvonne halfcrazed with horror had heard the whole of this abominable conversation wherein she had not failed to recognise the voice of martinroget or pierreadet as she now knew him to be who the other two men were she could easily conjecture the soft bland voice she had heard twice during these past few days which had been so full of misery of terror and of surprise once she had heard it on board the ship which had taken her away from england and once again a few hours since inside the narrow room which had been her prison the third man who had subsequently arrived on the scene was that coarse and grimy creature who had seemed to be the moving evil spirit of that awful brawl in the tavern  what the conversation meant to her she could not fail to guess pierre adet had by what he said made the whole of his abominable intrigue against her palpably clear her father had been right after all it was pierre adet who through some clever trickery had lured her to this place of evil how it was all done she could not guess the message  the device  her walk across the street  the silence  the mysterious guide  which of these had been the trickery which had been concocted by her enemy which devised by her dear milor  enough that the whole thing was a trap a trap all the more hideous as she yvonne who would have given her hearts blood for her beloved was obviously the bait wherewith these friends meant to capture him and his noble chief they knew evidently of the presence of the gallant scarlet pimpernel and his band of heroes here in nantesthey seemed to expect their appearance at this abominable place tonight she yvonne was to be the decoy which was to lure to this hideous lair those noble eagles who were still out of reach  and if that was soif indeed her beloved and his valiant friends had followed her hither then some part of the message of hope must have come from them or from their chief  and milor and his friend must even now be somewhere close by watching their opportunity to come to her rescue  heedless of the awful danger which lay in wait for them  ignorant mayhap of the abominable trap which had been so cunningly set for them by these astute and ferocious brutes  yvonne a prisoner in this narrow space clinging to the bars of what was perhaps the most cruel prison in which she had yet been confined bruised her hands and arms against those bars in a wild desire to get out she longed with all her might to utter one long loud and piercing cry of warning to her dear milor not to come nigh her now to fly to run while there was yet time and all the while she knew that if she did utter such a cry he would hurry hothaste to her side one moment she would have had him nearanother she wished him an hundred miles away   iv  in the taproom a more ordered medley of sounds had followed on the wild pandemonium of awhile ago brief peremptory words of command steady tramping of feet loud harsh questions and subdued answers occasionally a moan or a few words of protest quickly suppressed came through the partition to yvonnes straining ears  your name  where do you live  your occupation  thats enough silence the next  your name  where do you live  men women and even children were being questioned classified packed off god knew whither sometimes a child would cry a man utter an oath a woman shriek then would come harsh orders delivered in a gruff voice more swearing the grounding of arms and more often than not a dull flat sound like a blow struck against human flesh followed by a volley of curses or a cry of pain  your name  george amédé lemoine  where do you live  in this house  your occupation  i am the proprietor of the tavern citizen i am an honest man and a patriot the republic  thats enough  but i protest  silence the next  all with dreary ceaseless monotony and yvonne like a trapped bird was bruising her wings against the bars of her cage outside the window chauvelin and martinroget were still speaking in whispers the fowlers were still watching for their prey the third man had apparently gone away what went on beyond the range of her prison windowout in the darkness of the night which yvonnes aching eyes could not pierceshe the miserable watcher the bait set here to catch the noble game could not even conjecture the window was small and her vision was further obstructed by heavy bars she could see nothinghear nothing save those two men talking in whispers now and again she caught a few words  a little while longer citizen  you lose nothing by waiting your kernogans are safe enough paul friche has assured you that the landing where they are now has no egress save through the taproom and to the floor above wait at least until commandant fleury has got the crowd together after which he will send his marats to search the house it wont be too late then to lay hands on your aristos if in the meanwhile  tis futile to wait here interrupted martinroget roughly and you are a fool citizen if you think that those englishmen exist elsewhere than in your imagination  hark broke in the gentle voice abruptly and with forceful command  and as yvonne too in instinctive response to that peremptory call was further straining her every sense in order to listen there came from somewhere not very far away right through the stillness of the night a sound which caused her pulses to still their beating and her throat to choke with the cry which rose from her breast  it was only the sound of a quaint and drawly voice saying loudly and in english  egad tony aint you getting demmed sleepy  just for the space of two or three seconds yvonne had remained quite still while this unexpected sound sent its dulcet echo on the wings of the northwesterly blast the nextstumbling in the darkshe had run to the stairs even while she heard martinroget calling loudly and excitedly to paul friche  one reverent pause beside her dead father one mute prayer commending his soul to the mercy of his maker one agonised entreaty to god to protect her beloved and his friend and then she ran swiftly up the winding steps  at the top of the stairs immediately in front of her a doorslightly ajarshowed a feeble light through its aperture yvonne pushed the door further open and slipped into the room beyond she did not pause to look round but went straight to the window and throwing open the rickety sash she peeped out for the moment she felt that she would gladly have bartered away twenty years of her life to know exactly whence had come that quaint and drawling voice she leaned far out of the window trying to see it gave on the side of the rat mort over against louise adets housethe space below seemed to her to be swarming with men there were hurried and whispered callsorders were given to stand at close attention whilst martinroget had apparently been questioning paul friche for yvonne heard the latter declare emphatically  i am certain that it came either from inside the house or from the roof and with your permission citizen i would like to make assurance doubly sure  then one of the men must suddenly have caught sight of the vague silhouette leaning out of the window for martinroget and friche uttered a simultaneous cry whilst chauvelin said hurriedly  you are right citizen something is going on inside the house  what can we do queried martinroget excitedly  nothing for the moment but wait the englishmen are caught sure enough like rats in their holes  wait ejaculated martinroget with a savage oath wait always wait while the quarry slips through ones fingers  it shall not slip through mine retorted paul friche i was a steeplejack by trade in my day it wont be the first time that i have climbed the side of a house by the gutterpipe a moi jeanpierre he added and may i be drowned in the loire if between us two we do not lay those cursed english spies low  an hundred francs for each of you called chauvelin lustily if you succeed  yvonne did not think to close the window again vigorous shouting and laughter from below testified that that hideous creature friche and his mate had put their project in immediate execution she turned and ran down the stairsfeeling now like an animal at bay by the time that she had reached the bottom she heard a prolonged hoarse cry of triumph from below and guessed that paul friche and his mate had reached the windowsill the next moment there was a crash overhead of broken windowglass and of furniture kicked from one end of the room to the other immediately followed by the sound of heavy footsteps running helterskelter down the stairs  yvonne halfcrazed with terror faint and sick fell unconscious over the body of her father   v  inside the taproom commandant fleury was still at work  your name  where do you live  your occupation  the low room was filled to suffocation the walls lined with marats the doors and windows which were wide open were closely guarded whilst in the corner of the room huddled together like bales of rubbish was the human cattle that had been driven together preparatory to being sent for a trial to paris in vindication of carriers brutalities against the city  fleury for forms sake made entries in a notebookthe whole thing was a mere farcethese wretched people were not likely to get a fair trialwhat did the whole thing matter still the commandant of the marats went solemnly through the farce which carrier had invented with a view to his own justification  lemoine and his wife had protested and been silenced men had struggled and women had foughtsome of them like wild catsin trying to get away now there were only half a dozen or so more to docket fleury swore for he was tired and hot  this place is like a pesthouse he said  just then came the sound of that lusty cry of triumph from outside followed by all the clatter and the breaking of window glass  whats that queried fleury  the heavy footsteps running down the stairs caused him to look up from his work and to call briefly to a sergeant of the marats who stood beside his chair  go and see what that sacré row is about he commanded in there he added as he indicated the door of the landing with a jerk of the head  but before the man could reach the door it was thrown open from within with a vigorous kick from the point of a sabot and paul friche appeared under the lintel with the aristo wench thrown over his shoulder like a sack of potatoes his thick muscular arms encircling her knees his scarlet bonnet was cocked over one eye his face was smeared with dirt his breeches were torn at the knees his shirt hung in strips from his powerful shoulders behind him his matewho had climbed up the gutterpipe into the house in his wakewas tottering under the load of the cidevant duc de kernogans body which he had slung across his back and was holding on to by the wrists  fleury jumped to his feetthe appearance of these two men each with his burden caused him to frown with anger and to demand peremptorily what is the meaning of this  the aristos said paul friche curtly they were trying to escape  he strode into the room carrying the unconscious form of the girl as if it were a load of feathers he was a huge massivelooking giant the girls shoulders nearly touched the low ceiling as he swung forward facing the angry commandant  how did you get into the house and by whose orders demanded fleury roughly  climbed in by the window pardi retorted the man and by the orders of citizen martinroget  a corporal of the company marat takes orders only from me you should know that citizen friche  nay interposed the sergeant quickly this man is not a corporal of the company marat citizen commandant as for corporal friche why he was taken to the infirmary some hours ago with a cracked skull he  not corporal friche exclaimed fleury with an oath then who in the devils name is this man  the scarlet pimpernel at your service citizen commandant came loudly and with a merry laugh from the pseudo friche  and before either fleury or the sergeant or any of the marats could even begin to realise what was happening he had literally bounded across the room and as he did so he knocked against the hanging lamp which fell with a crash to the floor scattering oil and broken glass in every direction and by its fall plunging the place into total darkness at once there arose a confusion and medley of terrified screams of piercing shrieks from the women and the children and of loud imprecations from the men these mingled with the hasty words of command with quick orders from fleury and the sergeant with the grounding of arms and the tramping of many feet and with the fall of human bodies that happened to be in the way of the reckless adventurer and his flight  he is through the door cried the men who had been there on guard  after him then shouted fleury curse you all for cowards and for fools  the order had no need to be repeated the confusion though great had only been momentary within a second or less fleury and his sergeant had fought their way through to the door urging the men to follow  after him  quick he is heavily loaded  he cannot have got far  commanded fleury as soon as he had crossed the threshold sergeant keep order within and on your life see that no one else escapes     chapter ix  the proconsul   i  from round the angle of the house martinroget and chauvelin were already speeding along at a rapid pace  what does it all mean queried the latter hastily  the englishmanwith the wench on his back have you seen him  malediction what do you mean  have you seen him reiterated fleury hoarsely  no  he couldnt have passed you  impossible  then unless some of us here have eyes like cats that limb of satan will get away on to him my men he called once more can you see him  the darkness outside was intense the northwesterly wind was whistling down the narrow street drowning the sound of every distant footfall it tore mercilessly round the mens heads snatching the bonnets from off their heads dragging at their loose shirts and breeches adding to the confusion which already reigned  he went this way  shouted one  no that cried another  there he is came finally in chorus from several lusty throats just crossing the bridge  after him cried fleury an hundred francs to the man who first lays hands on that devil  then the chase began the englishman on ahead was unmistakable with that burden on his shoulder he had just reached the foot of the bridge where a street lanthorn fixed on a tall bracket on the corner stone had suddenly thrown him into bold relief he had less than an hundred metres start of his pursuers and with a wild cry of excitement they started in his wake  he was now in the middle of the bridgean unmistakable figure of a giant vaguely silhouetted against the light from the lanthorns on the further end of the bridgeseeming preternaturally tall and misshapen with that hump upon his back  from right and left from under the doorways of the houses in the carrefour de la poissonnerie the marats who had been left on guard in the street now joined in the chase overhead windows were thrown openthe good burghers of nantes awakened from their sleep forgetful for the nonce of all their anxieties their squalor and their miseries leaned out to see what this new kind of din might mean from everywhereit almost seemed as if some sprang out of the earthmen either of the townguard or marats on patrol duty or merely idlers and night hawks who happened to be about yielded to that primeval instinct of brutality which causes men as well as beasts to join in a pursuit against a fellow creature  fleury was in the rear of his posse martinroget and chauvelin walking as rapidly as they could by his side tried to glean some information out of the commandants breathless and scrappy narrative  what happened exactly  it was the man paul friche  with the aristo wench on his back  and another man carrying the cidevant aristo  they were the english spies  in disguise  they knocked over the lamp  and got away  name of a  no use swearing citizen martinroget retorted fleury as hotly as his agitated movements would allow you and citizen chauvelin are responsible for the affair it was you citizen chauvelin who placed paul friche inside that tavern in observationyou told him what to do  well  paul frichethe real paul frichewas taken to the infirmary some hours ago  with a cracked skull dealt him by your englishman ive no doubt  impossible reiterated chauvelin with a curse  impossible why impossible  the man i spoke to outside le bouffay  was not paul friche  he was on guard in the place with two other marats  he was not paul frichethe others were not marats  then the man who was inside the tavern  was not paul friche    who climbed the gutter pipe   malediction  and the chase continuedwaxing hotter every minute the hare had gained slightly on the houndsthere were more than a hundred hot on the trail by nowhaving crossed the bridge he was on the isle feydeau and without hesitating a moment he plunged at once into the network of narrow streets which cover the island in the rear of la petite hollande and the hôtel de le villestreux where lodged carrier the representative of the people the hounds after him had lost some ground by haltingif only for a second or twofirst at the head of the bridge then at the corners of the various streets while they peered into the darkness to see which way had gone that fleetfooted hare  down this way  no that  there he goes  it always took a few seconds to decide during which the man on ahead with his burden on his shoulder had time mayhap to reach the end of a street and to turn a corner and once again to plunge into darkness and out of sight the street lanthorns were few in this squalid corner of the city and it was only when perforce the running hare had to cross a circle of light that the hounds were able to keep hot on the trail  to the bridges for your lives now shouted fleury to the men nearest to him leave him to wander on the island he cannot come off it unless he jumps into the loire  the maratsintelligent and ferociously keen on the chasehad already grasped the importance of this order with the bridges guarded that fleetfooted englishman might run as much as he liked he was bound to be run to earth like a fox in his burrow in a moment they had dispersed along the quays some to one bridgehead some to anotherthe englishman could not double back now and if he had already crossed to the isle gloriette which was not joined to the left bank of the river by any bridge he would be equally caught like a rat in a trap  unless he jumps into the loire reiterated fleury triumphantly  the proconsul will have more excitement than he hoped for he added with a laugh he was looking forward to the capture of the english spy and in deadly terror lest he escaped but now meseems that we shall run our fox down in sight of the very gates of la villestreux  martinrogets thoughts ran on yvonne and the duc  you will remember citizen commandant he contrived to say to fleury that the cidevant kernogans were found inside the rat mort  fleury uttered an exclamation of rough impatience what did he what did anyone care at this moment for a couple of aristos more or less when the noblest game that had ever fallen to the bag of any terrorist was so near being run to earth but chauvelin said nothing he walked on at a brisk pace keeping close to commandant fleurys side in the immediate wake of the pursuit his lips were pressed tightly together and a hissing breath came through his wideopen nostrils his pale eyes were fixed into the darkness and beyond it where the most bitter enemy of the cause which he loved was fighting his last battle against fate   ii  he cannot get off the island fleury had said awhile ago well there was of a truth little or nothing now between the hunted hare and capture the bridges were well guarded the island swarming with hounds the marats at their posts and the loire an impassable barrier all round  and chauvelin the most tenacious enemy man ever had fleury keen on a reward and martinroget with a private grudge to pay off all within two hundred yards behind him  true for the moment the englishman had disappeared burden and all the gloom appeared to have swallowed him up but there was nowhere he could go mayhap he had taken refuge under a doorway in one of the narrow streets and hoped perhaps under cover of the darkness to allow his pursuers to slip past him and then to double back  fleury was laughing in the best of humours he was gradually collecting all the marats together and sending them to the bridgeheads under the command of their various sergeants let the englishman spend the night on the islands if he had a mind there was a full company of marats here to account for him as soon as he attempted to come out in the open  the idlers and night hawks as well as the municipal town guard continued to run excitedly up and down the streetssometimes there would come a lusty cry from a knot of pursuers who thought they spied the englishman through the darkness at others there would be a call of halt and feverish consultation held at a street corner as to the best policy to adopt  the town guard jealous of the marats were pining to lay hands on the english spy for the sake of the reward fleury coming across their provost called him a fool for his pains  my marats will deal with the english spies citizen he said roughly he is no concern of yours  the provost demurred an altercation might have ensued when chauvelins suave voice poured oil on the troubled waters  why not he said let the town guard continue their search on the island citizen commandant the men may succeed in digging our rat out of his hole and forcing him out into the open all the sooner your marats will have him quickly enough after that  to this suggestion the provost gave a grudging assent the reward when the english spy was caught could be fought for later on for the nonce he turned unceremoniously on his heel and left fleury cursing him for a meddlesome busybody  so long as he and his rabble does not interfere with my marats growled the commandant  will you see your sergeants citizen queried chauvelin tentatively they will have to keep very much on the alert and will require constant prodding to their vigilance if i can be of any service  no retorted fleury curtly you and citizen martinroget had best try and see the proconsul and tell him what we have done  hell be half wild with terror when he hears that the english spy is at large upon the island  you must pacify him as best you can tell him i have a score of marats at every bridge head and that i am looking personally to every arrangement there is no escape for the devil possible save by drowning himself and the wench in the loire   iii  chauvelin and martinroget turned from the quay on to the petite hollandethe great open ground with its converging row of trees which ends at the very apex of the isle of feydeau opposite to them at the further corner of the place was the hôtel de la villestreux one or two of the windows in the hotel were lighted from within no doubt the proconsul was awake trembling in the remotest angle of his lair with the spectre of assassination rampant before himaroused by the continued disturbance of the night by the feverishness of this manhunt carried on almost at his gates  even through the darkness it was easy to perceive groups of people either rushing backwards and forwards on the place or congregating in groups under the trees excitement was in the air it could be felt and heard right through the soughing of the northwesterly wind which caused the bare branches of the trees to groan and to crackle and the dead leaves which still hung on the twigs to fly wildly through the night  in the centre of the place two small lights gleaming like eyes in the midst of the gloom betrayed the presence of the proconsuls coach which stood there as always ready to take him away to a place of safetyaway from this city where he was mortally hated and dreadedwhenever the spectre of terror became more insistent than usual and drove him hence out of his stronghold the horses were pawing the frozen ground and champing their bitsthe steam from their nostrils caught the rays of the carriage lamps which also lit up with a feeble flicker the vague outline of the coachman on his box and of the postilion rigid in his saddle  the citizens of nantes were never tired of gaping at the carriagea huge cspringed baroucheat the coachmans fine caped coat of bottlegreen cloth and at the horses with their handsome harness set off with heavy brass bosses they never tired of bandying words with the successive coachmen as they mounted their box and gathered up the reins or with the postilions who loved to crack their whips and to appear smart and wellgroomed in the midst of the squalor which reigned in the terrorstricken city they were the guardians of the mighty proconsul on their skill quickness and presence of mind might depend his precious life  even when the shadow of death hangs over an entire community there will be some who will stand and gape and crack jokes at an uncommon sight  and now when the pall of night hung over the abode of the mantiger and his lair and wrapped in its embrace the hunted and the hunters there still was a knot of people standing round the carriagebetween it and the hotelgazing with lacklustre eyes on the costly appurtenances wherewith the representative of a wretched people loved to surround himself they could only see the solid mass of the carriage and of the horses but they could hear the coachman clicking with his tongue and the postilion cracking his whip and these sights broke the absolute dreary monotony of their lives  it was from behind this knot of gaffers that there rose gradually a tumult as of a man calling out in wrath and lashing himself into a fury chauvelin and martinroget were just then crossing la petite hollande from one bank of the river to the other they were walking rapidly towards the hotel when they heard the tumult which presently culminated in a hoarse cry and a volley of oaths  my coach my coach at once lalouët dont leave me curse you all for a set of cowardly oafs my coach i say  the proconsul murmured chauvelin as he hastened forward martinroget following closely on his heels  by the time that they had come near enough to the coach to distinguish vaguely in the gloom what was going on people came rushing to the same spot from end to end of the place in a moment there was quite a crowd round the carriage and the two men had much ado to push their way through by a vigorous play of their elbows  citizen carrier cried chauvelin at the top of his voice trying to dominate the hubbub one minute  i have excellent news for you the english spy  curse you for a set of blundering fools came with a husky cry from out the darkness you have let that english devil escape  i knew it  i knew it  the assassin is at large  the murderer  my coach at once  my coach lalouëtdo not leave me  chauvelin had by this time succeeded in pushing his way to the forefront of the crowd martinroget tall and powerful had effectually made a way for him through the dense gloom he could see the misshapen form of the proconsul wildly gesticulating with one arm and with the other clinging convulsively to young lalouët who already had his hand on the handle of the carriage door  with a quick resolute gesture chauvelin stepped between the door and the advancing proconsul  citizen carrier he said with calm determination on my oath there is no cause for alarm your life is absolutely safe i entreat you to return to your lodgings  to emphasise his words he had stretched out a hand and firmly grasped the proconsuls coat sleeve this gesture however instead of pacifying the apparently terrorstricken maniac seemed to have the effect of further exasperating his insensate fear with a loud oath he tore himself free from chauvelins grasp  ten thousand devils he cried hoarsely who is this fool who dares to interfere with me stand aside man  stand aside or  and before chauvelin could utter another word or martinroget come to his colleagues rescue there came the sudden sharp report of a pistol the horses reared the crowd was scattered in every direction chauvelin was knocked over by a smart blow on the head whilst a vigorous drag on his shoulder alone saved him from falling under the wheels of the coach  whilst confusion was at its highest the carriage door was closed to with a bang and there was a loud commanding cry hurled through the window at the coachman on his box  en avant citizen coachman drive for your life through the savenay gate the english assassins are on our heels  the postilion cracked his whip the horses maddened by the report by the pushing jostling crowd and the confused cries and screams around plunged forward wild with excitement their hoofs clattered on the hard road some of the crowd ran after the coach across the place shouting lustily the proconsul the proconsul  chauvelindazed and bruisedwas picked up by martinroget  the cowardly brute was all that he said between his teeth he shall rue this outrage as soon as i can give my mind to his affairs in the meanwhile  the clatter of the horses hoofs was already dying away in the distance for a few seconds longer the rattle of the coach was still accompanied by cries of the proconsul the proconsul fleury at the bridge head seeing and hearing its approach had only just time to order his marats to stand at attention a salvo should have been fired when the representative of the people the high and mighty proconsul was abroad but there was no time for that and the coach clattered over the bridge at breakneck speed whilst carrier with his head out of the window was hurling anathemas and insults at fleury for having allowed the paid spies of that cursed british government to threaten the life of a representative of the people  i go to savenay he shouted just at the last until that assassin has been thrown in the loire but when i return  look to yourself commandant fleury  then the carriage turned down the quai de la fosse and a few minutes later was swallowed up by the gloom   iv  chauvelin supported by martinroget was hobbling back across the place the crowd was still standing about vaguely wondering why it had got so excited over the departure of the proconsul and the rattle of a coach and pair across the bridge when on the island there was still an assassin at largean english spy the capture of whom would be one of the great events in the chronicles of the city of nantes  i think said martinroget that we may as well go to bed now and leave the rest to commandant fleury the englishman may not be captured for some hours and i for one am overfatigued  then go to bed an you desire citizen martinroget retorted chauvelin drily i for one will stay here until i see the englishman in the hands of commandant fleury  hark interposed martinroget abruptly what was that  chauvelin had paused even before martinrogets restraining hand had rested on his arm he stood still in the middle of the place and his knees shook under him so that he nearly fell prone to the ground  what is it reiterated martinroget with vague puzzlement it sounds like young lalouëts voice  chauvelin said nothing he had forgotten his bruises he no longer hobbledhe ran across the place to the front of the hotel whence the voice had come which was so like that of young lalouët  the youngsterit was undoubtedly hewas standing at the angle of the hotel above him a lanthorn threw a dim circle of light on his bare head with its mass of dark curls and on a small knot of idlers with two or three of the town guard amongst them the first words spoken by him which chauvelin distinguished quite clearly were  you are all mad  or else drunk the citizen proconsul is upstairs in his room he has just sent me down to hear what news there is of the english spies   v  no one made reply it seemed as if some giant and spectral hand had passed over this mass of people and with its magic touch had stilled their turbulent passions silenced their imprecations and cooled their ardourand left naught but a vague fear a subtle sense of awe as when something unexplainable and supernatural has manifested itself before the eyes of men  from far away the roll of coach wheels rapidly disappearing in the distance alone broke the silence of the night  is there no one here who will explain what all this means queried young lalouët who alone had remained selfassured and calm for he alone knew nothing of what had happened citizen fleury are you there  then as once again he received no reply he added peremptorily  hey some one there are you all louts and oafs that not one of you can speak  a timid voice from the rear ventured on explanation  the citizen proconsul was here a moment ago we all saw him and you citizen lalouët were with him  an imprecation from young lalouët silenced the timid voice for the nonce  and then another resumed the halting narrative  we all could have sworn that we saw you citizen lalouët also the citizen proconsul he got into his coach with you  you  that is  they have driven off  this is some awful and treacherous hoax cried the youngster now in a towering passion the citizen proconsul is upstairs in bed i tell you  and i have only just come out of the hotel  name of a name of a dog am i standing here or am i not  then suddenly he bethought himself of the many events of the day which had culminated in this gigantic feat of legerdemain  chauvelin he exclaimed where in the name of hll is citizen chauvelin  but chauvelin for the moment could nowhere be found dazed halfunconscious wholly distraught he had fled from the scene of his discomfiture as fast as his trembling knees would allow carrier searched the city for him high and low and for days afterwards the soldiers of the compagnie marat gave aristos and rebels a rest they were on the lookout for a small wizened figure of a manthe man with the pale keen eyes who had failed to recognise in the pseudopaul friche in the dirty outatelbows sansculottethe most exquisite dandy that had ever graced the salons of bath and of london they were searching for the man with the acute and sensitive brain who had failed to scent in the pseudocarrier and the pseudolalouët his old and arch enemy sir percy blakeney and the charming wife of my lord anthony dewhurst     chapter x  lord tony   i  a quarter of an hour later citizencommandant fleury was at last ushered into the presence of the proconsul and received upon his truly innocent head the full torrent of the despots wrath but martinroget had listened to the counsels of prudence for obvious reasons he desired to avoid any personal contact for the moment with carrier whom fear of the english spies had made into a more abject and more craven tyrant than ever before at the same time he thought it wisest to try and pacify the brute by sending him the ten thousand francsthe bribe agreed upon for his help in the undertaking which had culminated in such a disastrous failure  at the selfsame hour whilst carrierfuming and swearingwas for the hundredth time uttering that furious how which for the hundredth time had remained unanswered two men were taking leave of one another at the small postern gate which gives on the cemetery of st anne the taller and younger one of the two had just dropped a heavy purse into the hand of the other the latter stooped and kissed the kindly hand  milor he said i swear to you most solemnly that m le duc de kernogan will rest in peace in hallowed ground m le curé de vertouah he is a saint and a brave man milorcomes over whenever he can prudently do so and reads the offices for the deadover those who have died as christians and there is a piece of consecrated ground out here in the open which those fiends of terrorists have not discovered yet  and you will bury m le duc immediately admonished the younger man and apprise m le curé of what has happened  aye aye ill do that milor within the hour though m le duc was never a very kind master to me in the past i cannot forget that i served him and his family for over thirty years as coachman i drove mlle yvonne in the first ponycart she ever possessed i drove herah that was a bitter dayher and m le duc when they left kernogan never to return i drove mlle yvonne on that memorable night when a crowd of miserable peasants attacked her coach and that brute pierre adet started to lead a rabble against the château that was the beginning of things milor god alone knows what has happened to pierre adet his father jean was hanged by order of m le duc now m le duc is destined to lie in a forgotten grave i serve this abominable republic by digging graves for her victims i would be happier i think if i knew what had become of mlle yvonne  mlle yvonne is my wife old friend said the younger man softly please god she has years of happiness before her if i succeed in making her forget all that she has suffered  amen to that milor rejoined the man fervently then i pray you tell the noble lady to rest assured jeanmarieher old coachman whom she used to trust implicitly in the pastwill see that m le duc de kernogan is buried as a gentleman and a christian should be  you are not running too great a risk by this i hope my good jeanmarie quoth lord tony gently  no greater risk milor replied jeanmarie earnestly than the one which you ran by carrying my old masters dead body on your shoulders through the streets of nantes  bah that was simple enough said the younger man the hue and cry is after higher quarry tonight pray god the hounds have not run the noble game to earth  even as he spoke there came from far away through the darkness the sound of a fast trotting pair of horses and the rumble of coachwheels on the unpaved road  there they are thank god exclaimed lord tony and the tremor in his voice alone betrayed the torturing anxiety which he had been enduring ever since he had seen the last both of his adored young wife and of his gallant chief in the squalid taproom of the rat mort  with the dead body of yvonnes father on his back he had quietly worked his way out of the tavern in the wake of his chief he had his orders and for the members of that gallant league of the scarlet pimpernel there was no such word as disobedience and no such word as fail through the darkness and through the tortuous streets of nantes lord anthony dewhurstthe young and wealthy exquisite the hero of an hundred fêtes and galas in bath in londonstaggered under the weight of a burden imposed upon him only by his loyalty and a noble sense of selfprescribed disciplineand that burden the dead body of the man who had done him an unforgivable wrong without a thought of revolt he had obeyedand risked his life and worse in the obedience  the darkness of the night was his faithful handmaiden and the excitement of the chase after the other quarry had fortunately drawn every possible enemy from his track he had set his teeth and accomplished his task and even the deathly anxiety for the wife whom he idolised had been crushed under the iron heel of a grim resolve now his work was done and from far away he heard the rattle of the coach wheels which were bringing his beloved nearer and nearer to him  five minutes longer and the coach came to a halt a cheery voice called out gaily  tony are you there  percy exclaimed the young man  already he knew that all was well the gallant leader the loyal and loving friend had taxed every resource of a boundlessly fertile brain in order to win yet another wreath of immortal laurels for the league which he commanded and the very tone of his merry voice proclaimed the triumph which had crowned his daring scheme  the next moment yvonne lay in the arms of her dear milor he had stepped into the carriage even while sir percy climbed nimbly on the box and took the reins from the bewildered coachmans hands  citizen proconsul  murmured the latter who of a truth thought that he was dreaming  get off the box you old noodle quoth the pseudoproconsul peremptorily thou and thy friend the postilion will remain here in the road and on the morrow youll explain to whomsoever it may concern that the english spy made a murderous attack on you both and left you half dead outside the postern gate of the cemetery of ste anne here he added as he threw a purse down to the two menwho halfdazed and overcome by superstitious fear had indeed scrambled down one from his box the other from his horsetheres a hundred francs for each of you in there and mind you drink to the health of the english spy and the confusion of your brutish proconsul  there was no time to lose the horsesstill very freshwere fretting to start  where do we pick up hastings and ffoulkes asked sir percy blakeney finally as he turned toward the interior of the barouche the hood of which hid its occupants from view  at the comer of the rue de gigan came the quick answer it is only two hundred metres from the city gate they are on the look out for you  ffoulkes shall be postilion rejoined sir percy with a laugh and hastings sit beside me on the box and you will see how at the city gate and all along the route soldiers of the guard will salute the equipage of the allpowerful proconsul of nantes by gad he added under his breath ive never had a merrier time in all my lifenot even when  he clicked his tongue and gave the horses their headsand soon the coachman and the postilion and jeanmarie the gravedigger of the cemetery of ste anne were left gaping out into the night in the direction where the barouche had so quickly disappeared  now for le croisic and the daydream sighed the daring adventurer contentedly  and for marguerite he added wistfully   ii  under the hood of the barouche yvonne wearied but immeasurably happy was doing her best to answer all her dear milors impassioned questions and to give him a fairly clear account of that terrible chase and flight through the streets of the isle feydeau  ah milor how can i tell you what i felt when i realised that i was being carried along in the arms of the valiant scarlet pimpernel a word from him and i understood after that i tried to be both resourceful and brave when the chase after us was at its hottest we slipped into a ruined and deserted house in a room at the back there were several bundles of what looked like old clothes this is my storehouse milor said to me now that we have reached it we can just make long noses at the whole pack of bloodhounds he made me slip into some boys clothes which he gave me and whilst i donned these he disappeared when he returned i truly did not recognise him he looked horrible and his voice  after a moment or two he laughed and then i knew him he explained to me the rôle which i was to play and i did my best to obey him in everything but oh i hardly lived while we once more emerged into the open street and then turned into the great place which was fulloh fullof people i felt that at every moment we might be suspected figure to yourself my dear milor  what yvonne dewhurst was about to say next will never be recorded my lord tony had closed her lips with a kiss
