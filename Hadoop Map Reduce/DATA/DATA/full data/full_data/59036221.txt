conduct you lady to a low but loyal cottage where you may be safe till further questmilton   on a moorland slope where sheep and goats were dispersed among the rocks there lay a young lad on his back in a stout canvas cassock over his leathern coat and stout leathern leggings over wooden shoes  twilight was fast coming on only a gleam of purple light rested on the top of the eastern hills but was gradually fading away though the sky to the westward still preserved a little pale golden light by the help of the descending crescent moon  go away horned moon murmured the boy  i want to see my stars come out before hob comes to call me home and the goats are getting up already  moon moon thou mayst go quicker  thou wilt have longer time tomorrowand be higher in the sky as well as bigger and thou mightst let me see my star tonight  ah there is one high in the sunset pale and fair but not mine  thats the evening star one of the wanderers  is it the same as comes in the morning betimes when we do not have it at night  like that it shines with steady light and twinkles not  i would that i knew  there theres mine my own star far up only paling while the sun glaring blazes in the sky mine own he that from afar drives the stars in charless wain  there they come the good old twinkling team of three and the four of the wain  old billy goat knows them too  up he gets and all in his wake hahaha he calls and the nannies answer  ay and the sheep are rising up too  how white they look in the moonshine piersdeaf as he iswaking at their music  ba they call the lambs  nay thats no call of sheep or goat  tis some child crying all astray  ha  hilloa where beest thou  tarry till i come  move not or thou mayst be in the bogs and mosses  come watchto a great unwieldy collie puppylet us find her  a feeble piteous sound answered him and following the direction of the reply he strode along between the rocks and thornbushes that guarded the slope of the hill to a valley covered with thick moss veiling treacherously marshy ground in which it was easy to sink  the cry came from the further side where a mountain stream had force enough to struggle through the swamp  there were steppingstones across the brook which the boy knew and he made his way from one to the other calling out cheerily to the little figure that he began to discern in the fading light and who answered him with tones evidently girlish o come come shepherd  here i am  i am lost and lorn  they will reward thee  oh come fast  all in good time lassie  haste is no good here  i must look to my footing  presently he was by the side of the wanderer and could see that it was a maiden of ten or twelve years old who somehow even in the darkness had not the air of one of the few inhabitants of that wild mountain district  lost art thou maiden he said as he stood beside her where is thine home  i am at greystone priory replied the girl  i went out hawking today with the mother prioress and the rest  my pony fell with me when we were riding after a heron  no one saw me or heard me and my pony galloped home  i saw none of them and i have been wandering miles and miles  oh take me back good lad the mother prioress will give thee  tis too far to take thee back tonight he said  thou must come with me to hob hogward where doll will give thee supper and bed and we will have thee home in the morning  i never lay in a hogwards house she said primly  belike but there be worse spots to be harboured in  here i must carry thee over the burn it gets wider below  nay tis no use trying to leap it in the dark thou wouldst only sink in  there  and as he raised her in his arms the touch of her garment was delicate and she on her side felt that his speech gestures and touch were not those of a rustic shepherd boy but nothing was said till he had waded through the little narrow stream and set her down on a fairly firm clump of grass on the other side then she asked what art thou ladwho art thou  they call me hal was the answer but this is no time for questions  look to thy feet maid or thou wilt be in a swamphole whence i may hardly drag thee out  he held her hand for he could hardly carry her farther since she was almost as tall as himself and more plump and the rest of the conversation for some little time consisted of there  where oh i was almost down  take heed give me thy other hand  thou must leap this  oh what a place  is there much more of it not much  come bravely on  theres a good maid  oh i must get my breath  dont stand still  that means sinking  leap  leap thats right  no not that way turn to the big stair  ohh thats my brave wench  not far now  im down im down  up here this is safe  on that white stone  now heres sound ground hark  wherewith he emitted a strange wild whoop and added thats hob come out to call me  he holloaed again  we shall soon be at home now  theres mother dolls light  her light below the star above he added to himself  by this time it was too dark for the two young people to see more than dim shapes of one another but the boy knew that the hand he still held was a soft and delicate one and the girl that those which had grasped and lifted her were rough with country labours  she began to assert her dignity and say again who art thou lad  we will guerdon thee well for aiding me  the lord st john is my father  and who art thou  i  oh i am hob hogwards lad he answered in an odd offhand tone before whooping again his answer to the shouts of hob which were coming nearer  i am so hungry said the little lady in a weak famished tone hast aught to eat  i have finished my wallet mores the pity said the boy but never fear  hold out but a few steps more and mother doll will give thee bite and sup and bed  alack  is it much further  my feet they are so sore and weary  poor maiden let me bear thee on  hal took her up again but they went more slowly and were glad to see a tall figure before them and hear the cry how now hal boy where hast been  what hast thou there  a sorely weary little lady daddy hob lost from the hawking folk from the priory responded hal panting a little as he set his burthen down and hobs stronger arms received her  hal next asked whether the flock had come back under charge of piers and was answered that all were safely at home and after telling the tale hob had set out to find him  thou shouldst not stray so far he said  i heard the maid cry and went after her said hal all the way to the blackreed moss and the springs and twas hard getting over the swamp  well indeed ye were not both swallowed in it said hob god be praised for bringing you through  poor wee bairn  thou hast come far  from whence didst say  from greystone priory wearily said the girl who had her head down on hobs shoulder and seemed ready to fall asleep there  her horse fell with her and they were too bent on their sport to heed her explained the boy as he trudged along beside hob and his charge so she wandered on foot till by good hap i heard her moan  ay there will be a rare coil tonight for having missed her said hob but ive heard tell my lady prioress heeds her hawks more than her nuns  but be she who she may well have her home and mother doll shall see to her for she needs it sure poor bairn  she is asleep already  so she was with her head nestled into the shepherds neck nor did she waken when after a tramp of more than a mile the bleatings of the folded sheep announced that they were nearly  arrived and in the low doorway there shone a light and in the light stood a motherly form in a white woollen hood and dark serge dress  tired as he was hal ran on to her exclaiming all well mammy doll  ah well she answered thank the good god  i was in fear for thee my boy  whats that daddy hath  a strayed lamb  nay mammy but a strayed maiden  twas that kept me so long  i had to bear her through the burn at blackreed and drag her on as best i might and she is worn out and weary  ay said hob as he came up  how now my bit lassie as he put her into the outstretched arms of his wife who sat down on the settle to receive her still not half awake  she is wellnigh clemmed said hal  she has had no bite nor sup all day since her pony fell with her out ahawking and all were so hot on the chase that none heeded her  mother dolls exclamations of pity were profuse  there was a kettle of broth on the peat fire and after placing the girl in a corner of the settle she filled three wooden bowls two of which she placed before hal and the shepherd making signs to the heavybrowed piers to wait and getting no reply from her wornout guest she took her in her arms and fed her from a wooden spoon  though without clear waking mouthfuls were swallowed down till the bowl was filled again and set before piers  there that will be enough this day said the good dame  poor bairn  twas scurvy treatment  now will we put her to bed and in the morn we will see how to deal with her  hal insisted that the little lady should have his own beda chaff stuffed mattress covered with a woollen rug in the recess behind the projecting heartha strange luxury for a farm boy and doll yielded very unwillingly when he spoke in a tone that savoured of command  the shaggy piers had already curled himself up in a corner and gone to sleep     chapter ii  the snowstorm    yet stay fair lady rest awhile beneath the cottage wall see through the hawthorns blows the cold wind and drizzling rain doth fallold ballad   though hal had gone to sleep very tired the night before and only on a pile of hay curled up with watch having yielded his own bed to the strange guest he was awake before the sun for it was the decline of the year and the dawn was not early  he was not the first awakehob and piers were already busy on the outside and mother doll had emerged from the box bed which made almost a separate apartment and was raking together the peat so as to revive the slumbering fire  the hovel for it was hardly more was built of rough stone and thatched with reeds with large stones to keep the roof down in the high mountain blasts  there was only one room earthen floored and with no furniture save a big chest a rude table a settle and a few stools besides the big kettle and a few crocks and wooden bowls  yet whereas all was clean it had an air of comfort and civilisation beyond any of the cabins in the neighbourhood more especially as there was even a rude chimneypiece projecting far into the room and in the niche behind this lay the little girl in her clothes fast asleep  very young and childish she looked as she lay her lips partly unclosed her dark hair straying beyond her hand and her black lashes resting on her delicate brunette cheeks slightly flushed with sleep  hal could not help standing for a minute gazing at her in a sort of wondering curiosity till roused by the voice of mother doll  go thy ways my bairn to wash in the burn  heres thy comb  i must have the lassie up before the shepherd comes back though tis amost a pity to wake her  there she is stirring  best be off with thee my bonnie lad  it was spoken more in the tone of nurse to nursling than of mother to son still less that of mistress to farm boy but hal obeyed only observing take care of her  ay my pretty will not i murmured the old woman as the child turned round on her pillow put up a hand rubbed her eyes and disclosed a pair of sleepy brown orbs gazed about and demanded whats this  whos this  tis hob hogwards hut my bonnie lamb where you are full welcome here take a sup of warm milk  i mind me now said the girl sitting up and holding out her hands for the bowl  they all left me and the lad brought mea great lubber lout  nay nay mistress youll scarce say so when you see him by daya wellgrown youth as can bear himself with any  where is he asked the girl gazing round i want him to take me back  this place is not one for me  the sisters will be seeking me oh what a coil they must be in  we will have you back my bairn so soon as my goodman can go with you but now i would have you up and dressed ay and washed ere he and hal come in  then after meat and prayer you will be ready to go  to greystone priory returned the girl  yea i would have thee to know she added with a little dignity that sat drolly on her bare feet and disordered hair and cap as she rose out of bed that the sisters are accountable for me  i am the lady anne st john  my father is a lord in bedfordshire but he is gone to the wars in burgundy and bestowed me in a convent at york while he was abroad but the mother thought her house would be safer if i were away at the cell at greystone when queen margaret and the red rose came north  and is that the way they keep you safe asked the hostess who meanwhile was attending to her in a way that if the lady anne had known it was like the tendance of her own nurse at home instead of that of a rough peasant woman  oh we all like the chase and the mother had a new cast of hawks that she wanted to fly  there came out a heron and she threw off the new one and it went careering upand upand we all rode after and just as the bird was about to pounce down into a dyke went my pony imp and not one of them saw  not bertram selby the sisters nor the groom nor the rabble rout that had come out of greystone and before i could get free they were off and the pony imp of evil that he is has not learnt to know me or my voice and would not let me catch him but cantered offeither after the other horses or to the priory  i knew not where i was and halloaed myself hoarse but no one heard and i went on and on and lost my way  i did hear tell that the lady prioress minded her hawks more than her hours said mother doll  and thats sooth said the lady anne beginning to prove herself a chatterbox  the merlins have better hoods than the sisters and as to the hours no one ever gets up in the night to say nocturns or even matins but old sister scholastica and she is as strict and cross as may be  here the flow of confidence was interrupted by the return of hal who gazed eagerly though in a shamefaced way at the guest as he set down a bowl of ewe milk  she was a wellgrown girl of ten slender and bearing herself like one high bred and well trained in deportment and her face was delicately tinted on an olive skin with fine marked eyebrows and dark bright eyes and her little hunting dress of green and the hood set on far back became the dark locks that curled in rings beneath  she saw a slender lad darkhaired and darkeyed ruddy and embrowned by mountain sun and air and the bow with which he bent before her had something of the rustic lout and there was a certain shyness over him that hindered him from addressing her  so shepherd she said when wilt thou take me back to greystone  father will fix that interposed the housewife meanwhile ye had best eat your porridge  here is father in good time with the cows milk  the rugged broadshouldered shepherd made his salutation duly to the young lady and uttered the information that there was a black cloud like snow coming up over the fells to the southwest  but i must fare back to greystone said the damsel  they will be in a mighty coil what has become of me  they would be in a worse coil if they found your bones under a snow wreath  hal went to the door and spied out as if the tidings were rather pleasant to him than otherwise  the goodwife shivered and reached out to close the shutter and there being no glass to the windows all the light that came in was through the chinks  it would serve them right for not minding me better said the maiden composedly  nay it is as merry here as at greystone with sister margaret picking out ones broidery and father cuthbert making one pore over his crabbed parchments  oh does this father teach latin exclaimed hal with eager interest  of course he doth  the mother at york promised i should learn whatever became a damsel of high degree said the girl drawing herself up  i would he would teach me sighed the boy  better break thy fast and mind thy sheep said the old woman as if she feared his getting on dangerous ground and placing the bowl of porridge on the rough table she added say the benedicite lad and fall to  then as he uttered the blessing she asked the guest whether she preferred ewes milk or cows milk a luxury no one else was allowed all eating their porridge contentedly with a pinch of salt hob showing scant courtesy the less since his guests rank had been made known  by the time they had finished snowflakesan early autumn storm were drifting against the shutter and a black cloud was lowering over the hills  hob foretold a heavy fall of snow and called on hal to help him and piers fold the flock more securely sleepy watch and his old longhaired collie mother rising at the same call  lady anne sprang up at the same time insisting that she must go and help to feed the poor sheep but she was withheld much against her will by mother dolly though she persisted that snow was nothing to her and it was a fine jest to be out of the reach of the sisters who mewed her up in a cell like a messan dog  however she was much amused by watching and thinking she assisted in mother dollys preparations for ewe milk cheesemaking and byandby hal came in shaking the snow off the sheepskin he had worn over his leathern coat  hob had sent him in as the weather was too bad for him and he and anne crouched on opposite sides of the wide hearth as he dried and warmed himself and cosseted the cat which anne had tried to caress but which showed a decided preference for the older friend  our baudrons at greystone loves me better than that said anne she will come to me sooner than even to sister scholastica  my tib came with us when we came here  ay tib purr thy best as he held his fingers over her and she rubbed her smooth head against him  can she leap  baudrons leaps like a horse in the tiltyard  cannot she  there my lady pussy show what thou canst do to please the demoiselle and he held his arms forward with clasped hands so that the grey cat might spring over them and lady anne cried out with delight  again and again the performance was repeated and pussy was induced to dance after a string dangled before her to roll over and play in apparent ecstasy with a flake of wool as if it were a mouse and watch joined in the game in full amity  mother dolly busy with her distaff looked on not displeased except when she had to guard her spindle from the kittens pranks but she was less happy when the children began to talk  you have seen a tiltyard  yea indeed he answered dreamily  the poor squire was hurti did not like it  it is gruesome  oh no  it is a noble sport  i loved our tiltyard at bletso  two knights could gallop at one another in the lists as if they were out hunting  oh to hear the lances ring against the shields made ones heart leap up  where was yours  here dolly interrupted hastily hal lad gang out to the shed and bring in some more sods of turf  the fire is getting low  heres a store motheri need not go out said hal passing to a pile in the corner  it is too dark for thee to see it  but where was your castle continued the girl  i am sure you have lived in a castle  insensibly the two children had in addressing one another changed the homely singular pronoun to the more polite if less grammatical second person plural  the boy laughed nodded his head and said you are a little witch  no great witchcraft to hear that you speak as we do at home in bedfordshire not like these northern boors that might as well be scots  i am not from bedfordshire said the lad looking much amused at her perplexity  who art thou then she cried peremptorily  i  i am hal the shepherd boy as i told thee before  no shepherd boy are you  come tell me true  dolly thought it time to interfere  she heard an imaginary bleat and ordered hal out to see what was the matter hindering the girl by force from running after him for the snow was coming down in larger flakes than ever  nevertheless when her husband was heard outside she threw a cloak over her head and hurried out to speak with him that maid will make our lad betray himself ere another hour is over their heads  doth she do it wittingly asked the shepherd gravely  nay tis no guile but each child sees that the other is of gentle blood and womens wits be sharp and prying and the maid will never rest till she has wormed out who he is  he promised me never to say nor doth he know  thee  much do the hests of an old hogherd weigh against the wiles of a young maid  lord hal is a lad of his word  peace with thy lords and ladies woman thoult have the archers after him at once  she makes no secret of being of gentle blooda st john of bletso  a pestilent white rose lot  we shall have them on the scent ere many days are over our head  an unlucky chance this same snow or i should have had the wench off to greystone ere they could exchange a word  thou wouldst have been caught in the storm  ill for the maid to have fallen into a drift  well for the lad if she never came out of it muttered the gruff old shepherd  then were her tongue stilled and those of the clacking wenches at yorkyorkists every one of them  mother dollys eyes grew round  mind thee hob she said i ken thy bark is worse than thy bite but i would have thee to know that if aught befall the maid between this and greystone i shall hold theeand so will my ladyguilty of a foul deed  no fouler than was done on the striplings father muttered the shepherd  get thee in wife  who knows what folly those two may be after while thou art away  mind thee if the maid gets an inkling of who the boy is it will be the worse for her  oh murmured the goodwife i moaned once that our piers there should be deaf and wellnigh dumb but i thank god for it now  no fear of perilous word going out through him or i durst not have kept my poor sisters son  mother doll trusted that her husband would never have the heart to leave the pretty darkhaired girl in the snow but she was relieved to find hal marking down on the wide flat hearthstone with a bit of charcoal all the stars he had observed  hob calls that the plough those seven he said i call it charless wain  methinks i have seen that she said winter and summer both  ay he is a meuseful husbandman that charles  and see here  this middle mare of the team has a little foal running beside herhe made a small spot beside the mark that stood for the central star of what we call the bears tail  i never saw that  no tis only to be seen on a clear bright night  i have seen it but hob mocks at it  he thinks the only use of the wain is to find the north star up beyond there pointing by the back of the plough and go by it when you are lost  what good would finding the north star do  it would not have helped me home if you had not found me  look here lady anne  which way does greystone lie  how should i tell  which way did the sun lie when you crossed the moor  anne could not remember at first but byandby recollected that it dazzled her eyes just as she was looking for the runaway pony and hal declared that it proved that the convent must have been to the south of the spot of her fall but his astronomy though eagerly demonstrated was not likely to have brought her back to greystone still doll was thankful for the safe subject as he went on to mark out what he promised that she should see in the winterthe swarm of glowworms as he called the pleiades and our ladys rock namely distaff the northern name for orion and then he talked of the stars that so perplexed him namely the planets that never stayed in their places  byandby when mother dollys work was over the kettle was on the fire and she was able to take out her own spinning she essayed to fill up the time by telling them lengthily the old stories and ballads handed down from minstrel to minstrel from nurse to nurse and they sat entranced listening to the stories more than even hal knew she possessed and holding one another by the hand as they listened  meantime the snow had ceasedit was but a scud of early autumn on the mountainsthe sun came out with bright slanting beams before his setting there was a soft south wind and hob when he came in growled out that the thaw had set in and he should be able to take the maid back in the morning  he sat scowling and silent during supper and ordered hal about with sharp sternness sending him out to attend to the litter of the cattle before all had finished and manifestly treated him as the shepherds boy the drudge of the house and threatening him with a staff if he lingered soon following himself  mother dolly insisted on putting the little lady to bed before they should return and conventbred anne had sufficient respect for proprieties to see that it was becoming  she heard no more that night     chapter iii  over the moor    in humblest simplest habit clad but these were all to megoldsmith   hal  what is your name  she stood at the door of the hovel the rising sun lighting up her bright dark eyes and smiling in the curly rings of her hair while hal stood by and watch bounded round them  you have heard he said half smiling and half embarrassed  hal  thats no name  harry an it like you better  harry what with a little stamp of her foot  harry hogward as you see or shepherd so please you  you are no hogward nor shepherd  these folk be no kin to you i can see  come an you love me tell me true  i told you true who i am red rose though i see you be  why not trust me the same  lady i verily ken no name save harry  i would trust you verily i would but i know not myself  i guess  i guess she cried clapping her hands but at the moment dolly laid a hand on her shoulder  do not guess maiden she said  if thou wouldst not bring evil on the lad that found thee and the roof that sheltered thee guess not yea and utter not a word save that thou hast lain in a shepherds hut  forget all as though thou hadst slept in the castle on the hill that fades away with the day  she ended hastily for her husband was coming up with a rough ponys halter in his hand  he was in haste to be off lest a search for the lost child might extend to his abode and his gloomy displeasure and illmasked uneasiness reduced everyone to silence in his presence  up and away lady wench he said  no time to lose if you are to be at greystone ere night  thou hal thou lazy lubber go with piers and the sheep  i shall go with you replied hal in a grave tone of resolution i will only go within view of the convent but go with you i will  he spoke with a decided tone of authority and hob hogward muttered a little to himself but yielded  hal assisted the young lady to mount and they set off along the track of the moss driving the cows sheep and goats before them not a very considerable numbertill they came to another hut much smaller and more rude than that where they had left mother doll  piers was a wild shaggyhaired lad with a sheepskin over his shoulders and legs bare below the knee and to him the charge of the flock was committed with signs which he evidently understood and replied to with a gruff ay ay  the three went on the way over the slope of a hill partly clothed with heather holly and birch trees as it rose above the moss  hob led the pony and there was something in his grim air and manner that hindered any conversation between the two young people  only hal from time to time gathered a flower for the young lady scabious and globe flowers and once a very pink wild rose mingled with white ones  lady anne took them with a meaning smile and a merry gesture as though she were going to brush hals face with the petals  hal laughed and said you will make them shed  well and good so the disputes be shed said anne with more meaning than perhaps hal understood  and the white overcomes the red  may be the red will have its way with spring  but there hob looked round on them and growled out have done with that folly  what has a herd boy like thee to do with roses and frippery  come away from the ladys rein  thou art overheld to thrust thyself upon her  nevertheless as hal fell back the dark eyes shot a meaning glance at him and the party went on in silence except that now and then hob launched at hal an order that he endeavoured to render savagely contemptuous and harsh so that lady anne interfered to say nay the poor lad is doing no harm  scathe enough answered hob  he always will be doing ill if he can  heed him not lady it only makes him the more malapert  malapert repeated anne not able to resist a little teasing of the grim escort thats scarce a word of the dales  tis more like a manatarms  this hob would not hear and if he did it produced a rough imprecation on the pony and a sharp cut with his switch  they had crossed another burn travelled through the moss and mounted to the brow of another hill when far away against the sky on the top of yet another height were to be seen moving figures not cattle but anne recognised them at once  menatarms archers lances  a search party for me  the prioress must have sent to the wardens tower  off with thee lad said hob at once turning round upon hal ill not have thee lingering to gape at the menatarms  off i say or  he raised his stout staff as though to beat the boy who looked up in his face with a laugh as if in very little alarm at his threat smiled up in the young ladys face and as she held out her hand with farewell hal ill keep your roseleaves in my breviary he bent over and kissed the fingers  how now  this impudence passes  as if thou wert of the same blood as the damsel exclaimed hob in considerable anger bringing down his stick  away with thee illbred lubber  back to thy sheep thou lazy loiterer  get thee gone and thy whelp with thee  hal obeyed though not without a parting grin at anne and had sped away down the side of the hill among the hollies and birches which entirely concealed him and the bounding puppy  hob went on in a gruff tone the insolence of these loutish lads see you lady he is a stripling that i took up off the roadside out of mere charity and for the love of heavena mere foundling as you may say and this is the way he presumes  a foundling sayest thou said anne unable to resist teasing him a little and trying to gratify her own curiosity  ay you may say so  theres a whole sort of these orphans after all the bad luck to the land to be picked up on every wayside  on towton moor mayhap said anne demurely as she saw her surly guide start  but he was equal to the occasion and answered  ay ay towton moor twas shame to see such bloody work and there were motherless and fatherless children stray lambs to be met with weeping their little hearts out and starving all around unless some good christian took pity on them  was hal one of these asked lady anne  i tell you lady i looked into a church that was full of weeping and wailing folk women and children in deadly fear of the cruel bloodyminded york folk and the lord of march that is himself king edward now a murrain on him  dont let those folk hear you say so laughed lady anne  they would think nothing of hauling thee off for a black traitor or hanging thee up on the first tree stout enough to bear thee  she said it half mischievously but the only effect was a grunt and a stolid shrug of his shoulders nor did he vouchsafe another word for the rest of the way before they came through the valley and through the low brushwood on the bank and were in sight of the search party who set up a joyful halloo of welcome on perceiving her  a young man the best mounted and armed evidently an esquire rode forward exclaiming well met fair lady anne  great have been the mother prioresss fears for you and she has called up half the country side lest you should be fallen into the hands of robin of redesdale or some other lancastrian rogue  much she heeded me in comparison with hawk and heron responded anne  thanks for your heed master bertram  i must part from thee and thy sturdy pony  thanks for the use of it added she as the squire proceeded to take her from the pony he would have lifted her down but she only touched his hand lightly and sprang to the ground then stood patting its neck  thanks again good pony  i am much beholden to thee gaffer hob  stay a moment  nay lady it would be well to mount you behind archie  his beast is best to carry a lady  archie was an elderly man stout but active attached to the service of the convent  he had leapt down and was putting on a belt and arranging a pad for the damsel observing ill hap we lost you damsel  i saw you not fall  ay returned anne your merlin charmed you far more  master bertram the loan of your purse  i would reward the honest man who housed me  bertram laughed and said tossing up the little bag that hung to his girdle do you think fair damsel that a poor border squire carries about largesse in gold and silver  let your clown come with us to greystone and thence have what meed the prioress may bestow on him for a find that your poor servant would have given worlds to make  hearest thou hob said anne  come with us to the convent and thou shalt have thy guerdon  hob however scratched his head with a more boorish air than he had before manifested and muttered something about a cow that needed his attention and that he could not spare the time from his herd for all that the prioress was like to give him  take this then said anne disengaging a gold clasp from her neck and giving it to him  bear it to the goodwife and bid her recollect me in her prayers  i shall come and redeem it from thee sulky carle as thou art said bertram  such jewels are not for greasy porridgefed housewives hark thee have it ready for me  i shall be at thy hovel ere long as anne waved to hob when she was lifted to her seat  but hob had already turned away and anne as she held on by archies leathern belt in her gay tone was beginning to defend him by declaring that porridge and grease did not go together so the nickname was not rightly bestowed on the kindly goodwife  ay  greasy from his lords red deer said bertram or his tainted mutton  trust one of these herds and a sheep is tainted whenever he wants a good supper  beshrew me but that stout fellow looks lusty and hearty enough as if he lived well  they were good and kind and treated me well said anne  i should be dead if they had not succoured me  the marvel is you are not dead with the stench of their hovel and the foulness of their food  it was very good foodmilk meat and oaten porridge replied anne  marvellous i say cried bertram with a sudden thought  was it not said that there were some of those traitorous lancastrian folk lurking about the mountains and fells  that rogue had the bearing of a manatarms far more than of a mere herd  deemedst thou not so archie to the elderly man who rode before the young damsel  herdsmen here are good with the quarterstaff  they know how to stand against the scots and do not get bowed like our midland serfs put in anne before archie could answer which he did with something of a snarl as bertram laughed somewhat jeeringly and declared that the lady anne had become softhearted  she looked down at her roses but in the dismounting and mounting again the petals of the red rose had floated away and nothing was left of it save a slender pink bud enclosed within a dark calyx  archie hard pressed declared there are poor fellows lurking about here and there but bad blood is over among us  no need to ferret about for them  eh  not when there may be a lad among them for whose head the king and his brothers would give the weight of it in gold nobles  anne shivered a little at this but she cried out shame on you master bertram selby if you would take a price for the head of a brave foe  you to aspire to be a knight  nay lady i was but pointing out to archie and the other grooms here how they might fill their pouches if they would  i verily believe thou knowst of some lurkingplace thou art so prompt to argue  did i not see another with thee who made off when we came in view  say  was he a bloodstained clifford  i heard of the mother having married in these parts  he was hob hogwards herd boy answered anne as composedly as she could  he hied him back to mind his sheep  nor would anne allow another word to be extracted from her ere the grey walls of the priory of greystone rose before her and the lay sister at the gate shrieked for joy at seeing her riding behind archie     chapter iv  a sporting prioress    yet nothing stern was she in cell and the nuns loved their abbess wellscott   the days of the wars of the roses were evil times for the discipline of convents which together with the entire western church suffered from the feuds of the popes with the italian princes  small remote houses used as daughters or auxiliaries to the large convents were especially apt to fall into a lax state and in truth the little priory of greystone with its halfdozen of sisters had been placed under the care of the lady agnes selby because she was too highly connected to be dealt with sharply and too turbulent and unmanageable for the soberminded house at york  so there she was sent with the deeply devout and strict sister scholastica to keep the establishment in order and deal with the younger nuns and lay sisters  being not entirely out of reach of a raid from the scottish border it was hardly a place for the timid although the better sort of moss troopers generally spared monastic houses  anne st john had been sent thither at the time when queen margaret was making her attempt in the north where the city of york was lancastrian as the mother abbess feared that her presence might bring vengeance upon the sisterhood  there was no great harm in the mother agnes only she was a maiden whom nothing but family difficulties could have forced into a monastic lifea lively highspirited outofdoor creature whom the close conventionalities of castle life and even whipping could not tame and who had been the despair of her mother and of the discreet dames to whom her first childhood had been committed to say nothing of a lady abbess or two  indeed from the mother of sopwell dame julian berners she had imbibed nothing but a vehement taste for hawk horse and hound  the recluses of st mary york after being heartily scandalised by her habits were far from sorry to have a good excuse for despatching her to their outlying cell where as they observed she would know how to show a good face in case the armstrongs came over the border  she came flying down on the first rumour of lady annes return her veil turned back her pace not at all accordant with the solemn gait of a prioress her arms outstretched her face not young nor handsome but sunburnt weatherbeaten and healthy and full of delight  my child my nan here thou art  i was just mounting to seek for thee to the west while bertram sought again over the mosses where we sent yester morn  where hast thou been in the snow  a shepherd took me to his hut lady mother answered anne rather coldly  little didst thou think of our woe and grief when thy palfrey was found standing riderless at the stable door and sister scholastica told us that there he had been since nones  and she had none to send in quest but cuddie the neatherd  my palfrey fell with me when you were in full chase of hawk and heron and none ever turned a head towards me nor heard me call  poor maid  but it was such a chase as never you did watch  on and on went the heron the falcon ever mounting higher and higher till she was but a speck in the clouds and tam falconer shouting and galloping mad lest she should go down the wind  methought she would have been back to norroway the foul jade  did you capture her mother asked anne  ay she pounced at last and wellnigh staked herself on the herons beak  but we had a long ride and were wellnigh at the tyne before we had caught her  full of pranks but a noble hawk as i shall write to my brother by the next messenger that comes our way  i call it a hawk worth her meat that leads one such a gallop  what would you have done reverend mother if she had crossed the border asked bertram  ridden after her  no scot would touch a lady prioress on the chase responded mother agnes looking not at all like a reverend mother  now poor anne thou must be hungered  thou shalt eat with master bertram and me in the refectory anon  take her sister joan and make her ready to break her fast with us  anne quickly went to her chamber  it was not quite a cell the bare stone walls being hung with faded woollen tapestry the floor covered with a deerskin the small window filled with dark green glass a chest serving the double purpose of seat and wardrobe and further a bed hung with thick curtains in which she slept with the lay sister joan who further fetched a wooden bowl of water from the fountain in the court that she might wash her face and hands  she changed her soiled ridingdress for a tightfitting serge garment of dark green with long hanging sleeves assisted by joan who also arranged her dark hair in two plaits and put over it a white veil fastened over a framework to keep it from hanging too closely  all the time joan talked telling of the fright the mother had been in when the loss of the lady anne had been discovered and how it was feared that she had been seized by scottish reivers or lost in the snow on the hills or captured by the lancastrians  for there be many of the red rose rogues about on the mosses comrades tis said of that noted thief robin of redesdale  i was with good folk in a shepherds sheiling replied anne  ay ay  out on the north hill methinks  nay  beyond deadmans pool said anne  by blackreed moss  that was where the pony fell  blackreed moss  that moor belongs to the de vescis the blackest lancaster fellow of all  his daughter is the widow of the redhanded clifford who slew young earl edmund on wakefield bridge  they say her young son is in hiding in some moss in his lands for the king holds him in deadly feud for his brothers death  he was a babe and had nought to do with it said anne  he is of his fathers blood returned sister joan who in her convent was still a true north country woman  ay lady anne you from your shires know nought of how deep goes the blood feud in us of the borderland  ay lady was not mine own grandfather slain by the musgrave of leit hill and did not my father have his revenge on his son by solway firth  yea and now not a graeme can meet a musgrave but they come to blows  nay but that is not what the good fathers teach anne interposed  the fathers have neither chick nor child to take up their quarrel they know nought about blood crying for blood  if king edward caught that brat of clifford he would make him know what tis to be born of a bloody house  anne tried to say something but the lay sister pushed her along there there go you downyou know nothing about what honour requires of you  you are but a south country maid and have no notion of what is due to them one came from  joan graeme was only a lay sister her father a small farmer when not a moss trooper but all the border on both sides had the strongest ideas of persistent vendetta such as happily had never been held in the midland and southern counties where there was less infusion of celtic blood  anne was a good deal shocked at the doctrine propounded by the attendant sister a mild goodnatured woman in daily life but the conversation confirmed her suspicions and put her on her guard as she remembered hobs warning  she had liked the shepherd lad far too much and was far too grateful to him to utter a word that might give him up to the revengers of blood  at the foot of the stone stairs that led into the quadrangle she met the blackrobed heavily hooded sister scholastica on her way to the chapel  the old nun held out her arms  safely returned my child god be thanked  art thou come to join thy thanksgiving with ours at this hour of nones  nay i am bound to break my fast with the mother and master bertram  ah thou must needs be hungered  it is well  but do but utter thy thanks to him who kept thee safe from the storm and from foul doers  anne did not break away from the good sister but went as far as the chapel porch was touched with holy water and bending her knee uttered in a low voice her gratias ago then hastened across the court to the refectory where the prioress received her with a laugh and so sister scholastica laid hands on thee i thought i should have to come and rescue thee ere the grouse grew cold  bertram as a courteous squire of dames came forward bowing low and the party were soon seated at the boardliterally a board supported upon trestles only large enough to receive the prioress the squire and the recovered girl but daintily veiled in delicate white napery  it was screened off from the rest of the refectory where the few sisters had already had their mornings meal after holy communion and from it there was a slight barrier on the other side of which bertram selby ought to have been but rules sat very lightly on the prioress selby  bertram was of kin to her and she had no demur as to admitting him to her private table  he was in fact a squire of the household of the marquess of montagu brother of the kingmaker and had been despatched with letters to the south  he had made a halt at his cousins priory had been persuaded to join in flying the new hawks and then had first been detained by the snowstorm and then joined in the quest for the lost lady anne st john  no doubt had then arisen that the nevils were firm in their attachment to edward iv and as a consequence in enmity to the house of clifford and both these scions of selby had been excited at a rumour that the widow of the baron who had slain young edmund of york had married sir lancelot threlkeld of threlkeld and that her eldest son the heir of the line might be hidden somewhere on the de vesci estates  bertram had already told the prioress that his men had spied a lad accompanying the shepherd who escorted the lady and who he thought had a certain twang of south country speech and no sooner had he carved for the ladies according to the courtly duty of an esquire than the inquiry began as to who had found the maiden and where she had been lodged  prioress agnes who had already broken her fast sat meantime with the favourite hawk on her wrist and a large dog beside her feeding them alternately with the bones of the grouse  come tell us all sweet nan  where wast thou in that untimely snowstorm  in a cave starved with cold eh  i was safe in a cabin with a kind old gammer  eh  and how camst thou there  wandering thither  nay the shepherd heard me call  the shepherd  what the churl that came with thee  he carried me to the hut  anne was on her guard though bertram probed her well  was there only one shepherd  was there not a boy with her on the hillside where bertram met her  the shepherd lad in sooth  what became of him  the shepherd sent him back he had been too long away from his flock  what was his name  what was the shepherds name  who was his master  anne did not knowshe had heard no names save hob and hal she had seen no arms she had heard nothing southland  the lad was a mere herdboy ordered out to milk ewes and tend the sheep she answered briefly and with a certain sullenness and young selby at last turned on her  look thee here fair lady theres a saying abroad that the heir of the redhanded house of clifford is lurking here on the lookout to favour queen margaret and her son  couldst thou put us on the scent king edward would favour thee and make thee a great dame and have thee to his courtnay maybe give thee what is left of the barony of clifford  i know nothing of young lords sulkily growled anne who had been hitherto busy with her pets striking her hand on the table  and i tell thee bertram selby exclaimed the prioress that if thou art ware of a poor fatherless lad lurking in hiding in these parts it is not the part of an honest man to seek him out for his destruction and still less to try to make the maid he rescued betray him  well done little anne thou knowest how to hold thy tongue  reverend mother expostulated bertram if you knew what some would give to be on the scent of the wolfcub  i know not nor do i wish to know for what price a selby would sell his honour and his bowels of mercy said mother agnes  come away nan thou hast done well  bertram muttered something about having thought her a better yorkist women not understanding and mischief that might be brewing but the prioress taking anne by the hand went her way leaving bertram standing confused  oh mother sighed anne do you think he will go after him  he will think i was treacherous  i doubt me whether he will dare said the prioress  moreover it is too late in the day for a search and another snowshower seems coming up again  i cannot turn the youth my kinsman from my door and he is safer here than on his quest but he shall see no more of thee or me tonight  i may hold that edward of march has the right but that does not mean hunting down an orphan child  mother mother you are good indeed cried anne almost weeping for joy  bertram though hurt and offended was obliged by advance of evening to remain all night in the hospitium with only the chaplain to bear him company and it was reported that though he rode past blackpool no trace of shepherd or hovel was found     chapter v  mother and son    my own my own thy fellowguest i may not be but rest thee rest the lowly shepherds life is bestwordsworth   the lady threlkeld stood in the lower storey of her castle a sort of roughbuilt hall or crypt with a stone stair leading upward to the real castle hall above while this served as a place where she met her husbands retainers and the poor around and administered to their wants with her own hands assisted by the maidens of her household  among the various hungry and diseased there limped in a sturdy beggar with a wallet on his back and a broad shady hat as though on pilgrimage  he was evidently a stranger among the rest and had his leg and foot bound up leaning heavily on a stout staff  italy pilgrim what ails thee demanded the lady as he approached her  alack noble dame we poor pilgrims must ever be moving on however much it irks foot and limb over these northern stones he answered and his accent and tone were such that a thrill seemed to pass over the ladys whole person but she controlled it and only said tarry till these have received their alms then will i see to thee and thy maimed foot  give him a stool alice while he waits  the various patients who claimed the ladys assistance were attended to those who needed food were relieved and in due time the hall was cleared excepting of the lady an old female servant and hob who had sat all the time with his foot on a stool and his back against the wall more than half asleep after the toils and long journey of the night  then the lady threlkeld came to him and making him a sign not to rise said aloud good gaffer let me see what ails thy leg  then kneeling down and busying herself with the bandages she looked up piteously in his face with the partly breathed inquiry my son  well my lady and grown into a stalwart lad was hobs answer with an eye on the door and in a voice as low as his gruff tones would permit  and wherefore  what is it she asked anxiously  be they on the track of my poor boy  they may be answered hob wherefore i deemed it well to shift our quarters  as hap would have it the lad fell upon a little wench lost in the mosses and there was nothing for it but to bring her home for the night  i would have had her away as soon as day dawned and no questions asked but the witches or the foul fiend himself must needs bring up a snowstorm and there was nothing for it but to let her bide in the cot all day giving tongue as none but womenfolk can do and behold she is the child of the lord st john of bletso  nay what should bring her north  she wonnes at greystone with the wild prioress selby who lost her out hawking  her father is a black yorkist  i saw him up to his stirrups in blood at st albans  but sure my boy did not make himself known to her exclaimed the lady  i trow not  he has been well warned and is a lad of his word but the two bairns left to themselves could scarce help finding out that each was of gentle blood and breeding and how much more my goodwife cannot tell  i took the maid back so soon as it was safe yester morn and sent back my young lord much against his will halfway to greystone  and well was it i did so for he was scarce over the ridge when a plump of spears came in sight on the search for him and led by the young squire of selby  ah and if the damsel does but talk even if she knows nought the foe will draw their conclusions said the lady clasping her hands oh would that i had sent him abroad with his little brothers  nay then might he have fallen into the hands of bletso himself and they say burgundy is all for the yorkists now said hob  this is what i have done gracious lady i bade my good woman carry off all she could from the homestead and burn the rest and for him we wot on i sent him and his flock off westward appointing each of them the same trystingplaceon the slope beneath derwent hill my lady whence i thought if it were your will and the good knight sir lancelots we might go nigher to the sea and the firth where the selby clan have no call being at deadly feud with the ridleys  so if the maidens tongue goes fast and the prioress follows up the quest with young selby they will find nought for their pains  thou art a good guardian hob  ah where would my boy be save for thee  and thou sayest he is even now at the very border of the forest ground  sure there can be no cause that i should not go and see him  my heart hungers for my children  oh let me go with thee  sir lancelot began hob  he is away at the wardens summons  he will scarce be back for a week or more  i will i must go with thee good hob  not in your own person good madam stipulated hob  as thou knowest there are those in sir lancelots following who might be too apt to report of secret visits and that were as ill as the priory folk  it was then decided that the lady should put on the disguise of a countrywoman bringing eggs and meat to sell at the castle and meet hob near the postern whence a path led to penrith  hob having received a lump of oatcake and a draught of very small ale limped out of the court and so soon as he could find a convenient spot behind the gorse bushes divested himself of his bandages and changed the side of his shepherds plaid to one much older and more weatherbeaten also his pilgrims hat for one in his poucha blue bonnet more like the national scottish headgear hiding the hat in the gorse  then he lay down and waited where he could see a window whence a red kerchief was to be fluttered to show when the lady would be ready for him to attend her  he waited long for she had first to disarm suspicion by presiding at the general meal of the household and showing no undue haste  at last though not till after he had more than once fallen asleep and feared that he had missed the signal or that his wife and hal might be tempted to some imprudence while waiting he beheld the kerchief waving in the sunset light of the afternoon and presently shrouded in such a black and white shepherds maud as his own and in a russet gown with a basket on her arm his lady came forth and joined him  his first thought was how would she return again when the darkness was begun but her only answer was heed not that  my child i must see  indeed she was almost too breathless and eager with haste as he guided her over the rough and difficult path or rather track to answer his inquiries as to what was to be done next  her view however agreed with his that they must lurk in the borders of the woodland for a day or two till sir lancelots return when he would direct them to a place where he could put them under the protection of one of the tenants of his manor  it was a long walk longer than hob had perhaps felt when he had undertaken to conduct the lady through it for ladies though inured to many dangers in those days were unaccustomed to travelling on their own feet but the mothers heart seemed to heed no obstacle though moments came when she had to lean heavily on her companion and he even had to lift her over brooks or pools but happily the sun had not set when they made their way through the tangles of the wood and at last saw before them the fitful glow of a fire of dead leaves branches and twigs while the bark of a dog greeted the rustling they made  sweetheart my faithful then shouted hob and in another moment there was a cry ha  halloa  master hobbeest there  his voicemy sons gasped the lady and sank for a moment of overwhelming joy against the faithful retainer while the shaggy dog leapt upon them both  ay lad hereand some one else  the boy crashed through the underwood and stood on the path in a moments hesitation  mother and son were face to face  the years that had passed had changed the lad from almost a babe into a wellgrown strong boy but the mother was little altered and as she held out her arms no word was wasted ere he sprang into them and his face was hidden on her neck as when he knew his way into her embrace of old  when the intense rapturous hold was loosed they were aware of goodwife dolly looking on with clasped hands and streaming eyes giving thanks for the meeting of her dear lady and the charge whom she and her husband had so faithfully kept  when the mother and son had leisure to look round and there was a pleased survey of the boys height and strength goodwife dolly came forward to beg the lady to come to her fire and rest under the gipsy tent which she and nephew piersher real herdboy a rough shaggy almost dumb and imbecile ladhad raised with branches skins and canvas to protect their few articles of property  there was a smouldering fire over which doll had prepared a rabbit which the dog had caught and which she had intended for hals supper and that of her husband if he came home in time  while the lady lavished thanks upon her for all she had done for the boy she was intent on improving the rude meal so as to strengthen her mistress after her long walk and for the return  the lady however could see and think of nothing but her son while he returned her tearful gaze with open eyes gathering up his old recollections of her  mother he saidwith a halfwondering tone as the recollections of six years old came back to him more fully and then he nestled again in her arms as if she were far more real to him than at first mother  and then as she sobbed over him the little one  the babe is well when last i heard of her in a convent at york thou rememberest her  aymy little sister  ay he said with a considering interrogative sound i mind her well and old bunce too that taught me to ride  but hob interrupted the reminiscences by bringing up the pony on which anne had ridden and insisting that the lady should not tarry longer  he indicating hal might walk beside her through the wood and thus prolong their interview but as she well knew it was entirely unsafe to remain any longer away from the castle  there were embraces and sobbing thanks exchanged between the lady and her sons old nurse and then hal at a growling hint from hob came forward and awkwardly helped her to her saddle  he walked by her side through the wood holding her rein while hob going before did his best in the twilight to clear away the tangled branches and brambles that fell across the path and were near of striking the lady across the face as she rode  on the way she talked to her son about his remembrances anxious to know how far his dim recollections went of the old paternal castle in bedfordshire of his infant sister and brother and his father  of him he had little recollection only of being lifted in his arms kissed and blessed and seeing him ride away with his troop clanking in their armour  after that he remembered nothing save the being put into a homelier dress and travelling on nurse dollys lap in a wain up and down it seemed to him for ever till at last clearer recollections awoke in him and he knew himself as hal the shepherds boy with the sheep around him and the blue starry sky above him  dost thou remember what thou wast called in those times asked his mother  i was always hal  the little one was meg he said  even so my boy my dear boy  but knowst thou no more than this  methinks methinks there were servingmen that called me the young lord  ay so  but nurse said i must forget all that  mother dear when that maiden came and talked of tilts and lances meseemed that i recollected somewhat  was then my father a knight  alack alack my child that thou shouldst not know  memories came back with that maidens voice and thine said hal in a bewildered tone  my father  was he then slain when he rode farther  ah  i may tell thee now thou art old enough to guard thyself she said  thy father whom our blessed lord assoilzie was the lord clifford slain by savage hands on towton field for his faith to king harry  thou my poor boy art the baron of clifford though while this cruel house of york be in power thou must keep in hiding from them in this mean disguise  woe worth the day  and am i then a barona lord said the boy  great lords have books  were there not some big ones on the hall window seats  did not brother eldred begin to teach me my letters  i would that i could go on to learn more  oh i would that thou couldst have all knightly training and learn to use sword and lance like thy gallant father  nay but i saw a poor man fall off his horse and lie hurt i do not want those hard cruel ways  and my father was slain  must a lord go to battle  boy boy thou wilt not belie thy clifford blood cried the lady in consternation which was increased when he said i have no mind to go out and kill folks or be killed  i had rather mark the stars and tend my sheep  alack alack  this comes of keeping company with the sheep  that my son and my lords son should be infected with their sheepish nature  never fear madam said hob  when occasion comes and strength is grown his blood will show itself  if i could only give him knightly breeding sighed the lady  sir lancelot may find the way  i cannot see him grow up a mere shepherd boy  content you madam said hob  never did i see a shepherd boy with the wisdom and the thought there is in that curly pate  wisdom thought muttered the lady  those did not save our good king only made him a saint  i had rather hear the boy talk of sword and lance than prate of books and stars  and that wench whom to our misfortune thou didst find  what didst tell her  i told her nought mother for i had nought to tell  she scented mystery though said hob  she saw he was no herd boy  nay  though he holds himself like a lout untrained  would that i could have thee in hand my son to make thee meet to tread in thy brave fathers steps  but now comrade of sheep thou art and i fear me thou wilt ever be  but that maid i trust that she perceived nothing in thy bearing or speech  she will not betray whatever she perceived said hal stoutly  the wood was by this time nearly past and the moment of parting had come  the lady had decided on going on foot to the little grey stone church whose low square tower could be seen rising like another rock thither she could repair in her plaid and byandby throw it off and return in her own character to the castle as though she had gone forth to worship there  when lifted off the shaggy pony she threw her arms round hal kissed him passionately and bade him never breathe a word of it but never to forget that a baron he was and bound to be a good brave knight fit to avenge his fathers death  hal came to understand from dollys explanations that his recent abode had been on the estate of his grandfather baron de vesci at londesborough but his mother had since married sir lancelot threlkeld and had intimated that her boy should be removed thither as soon as might be expedient and therefore the house on the yorkshire moor had been broken up     chapter vi  a cautious stepfather    thou tree of covert and of rest for this young bird that was distrestwordsworth   a baronbound to be a good knight and to avenge my fathers death what does it all mean murmured hal to himself as he lay on his back in the morning sunshine on the hillside the wood behind him and before him a distance of undulating ground ending in the straight mysterious bluegrey line that hob hogward had told him was the sea  baron  lord clifford like my father  he was a man in steel armour i remember how it rang and how his gorgetyes that was the thing round his throathow it hurt me when he lifted me up to kiss me and how they blamed me for crying out  ay and he lived in a castle with dark dull narrow chambers all save the hall where there was ever a tramping and a clamouring and smells of hot burning meat and horses and all sorts of things and they sat and sat over their meat and wine and drank health to king harry and the red rose i mind now how they shouted and roared and how i wanted to go and hide on the stairs and my father would have me shout with them and drink confusion to york out of his cup and shook me and cuffed me when i cried  oh must one be like that to be a knight  i had rather live on these free green hills with the clear blue sky above me and my good old ewe for my comradeand he fell to caressing the face of an old sheep which had come up to him a white mountain bleached sheep with fine and delicate limbs  yes i love thee good gentle little ewe and thee faithful watch as a young collie pressed up to him thrusting a long nose into his hand far better than those great baying hounds or the fierceeyed hawks that only want to kill  if i be a baron must it be in that sort avenge avenge what does that mean  is it as in goodwife dollys ballads going forth to kill  why should i  i had rather let them be  hark  yea watch as the dog pricked his ears and raised his graceful head then sprang up and uttered a deepmouthed bark  the sheep darted away to her companions and hal rose to his feet as the dog began to wave his tail and hob came forward accompanied by a tall gravelooking gentleman  here he be sir  hal come thou and ask the blessing of thy knightly stepfather  hal obeyed the summons and coming forward put a knee to the ground while sir lancelot threlkeld uttered the conventional blessing adding fair son i am glad to see thee  would that we might be better acquainted but i fear it is not safe for thee to come and be trained for knighthood in my poor house  thou art a well grown lad i rejoice to see and strong and hearty i have no doubt  ay sir he is strong enow i wis we have done our best for him responded hob while hal stood shy and shamefaced but there was something about his bearing that made sir lancelot observe ay ay he shows what he comes of more than his mother made me fear  only thou must not slouch my fair son  raise thy head more  put thy shoulders back  so so  nay  poor hal tried to obey the colour mounting in his face but he only became more and more stiff when he tried to be upright and his expression was such that sir lancelot cried out put not on the visage of one of thine own sheep  ah how shalt thou be trained to be a worthy knight  i cannot take thee to mine house for i have men there who might inform king edward that thy mother harboured thee and unless i could first make interest with montagu or salisbury that would be thy death if not mine  the boy had nothing to say to this and stood shy by while his stepfather explained his designs to hal  it was needful to remove the young baron as far as possible from the suspicion of the greater part of sir lancelot threlkelds household and the present resting place within a walk of his castle was therefore unsafe besides that freebooters might be another danger so near the outskirts of the wood since the northern districts of moor and wood were by no means clear of the remnants of the contending armies people who were generally of the party opposite to that which they intended to rob  but on the banks of the derwent not far from its fall into the sea sir lancelot had granted a tenure to an old retainer of the de vescis who had followed his mistress in her misfortunes and on his lands hob hogward might be established as a guardian of the herds with his family which would excite no suspicion  moreover he could train the young baron in martial exercises the only other way of fitting him for his station unless he could be sent to france or burgundy like his brother but besides that the journey was a difficulty it was always uncertain whether there would be revengeful exiles of one or other side in the service of their king who might wreak the wrongs of their party on cliffords eldest son  there was reported to be a hermit on the coast who if he was a scholar might teach the young gentleman  to sir lancelots surprise his stepsons face lighted up more at this suggestion than at that of being trained in arms  hob had done nothing in that way not even begun to teach him the quarterstaff though he avouched that when there was cause the young lord was no craven no more than any clifford ever waswitness when he drove off the great hound which some said was a wolf when it fell upon the flock or when none could hold him from climbing down the giants cliff after the lamb that had fallen  no fear but he had heart enough to make his hand keep his own or other folks heads  that is well said sir lancelot looking at the lad who stood twisting his hands in the speechless silence induced by being the subject of discussion but it would be better as my lady saith if he could only learn not to bear himself so like a clown  however there was no more time for simon bunce the old manatarms whom sir lancelot had appointed to meet him there came in sight through the trees riding an old grey warhorse much resembling himself in the battered and yet strong and effective air of both springing down the old man bent very low before the young baron raising his cap as he gave thanks to heaven for permitting him to see his masters son  then after obeisance to his present master he and hob eagerly shook hands as old comrades and fellowsoldiers who had thought never to meet again  then turning again to the young noble he poured out his love devotion and gratitude for being able to serve his beloved lords noble son while poor hal stood under the discomfort of being surrounded with friends who knew exactly what to say and do to him their superior while he himself was entirely at a loss how to show himself gracious or grateful as he knew he ought to do  it was a relief when sir lancelot said enough good simon  forget his nobility for the present while he goes with thee to derwentside as herd boy to halbert halstead here only thou must forget both their names and know them only as hal and hob  with a gesture of obedience simon listened to the further directions and how he was to explain that these south country folks had been sent up in charge of an especial flock of my ladys which she wished to have on the comparatively sheltered valley of the derwent  perhaps further directions as to the training of the young baron were added later but hal did not hear them  he was glad to be dismissed to find piers and gather the sheep together in preparation for the journey to their new quarters  yet he did not fail to hear the sigh with which his stepfather noted that his parting salutation was far too much in the character of the herd boy     chapter vii  on derwent banks    when under cloud of fear he lay a shepherd clad in homely greywordsworth   simon bunce came himself to conduct his new tenants to their abode it was a pleasant spot a ravine down which the clear stream rushed on its course to mingle its waters with those of the ocean  the rocks and brushwood veiled the approach to an open glade where stood a rude stone hovel rough enough but possessing two rooms a hearth and a chimney and thus superior to the hut that had been left on the moor  there were sheds for the cattle around and the grass was fresh and green so that the sheep the goat and the cow began eagerly feeding as did the pony which hal and piers were unloading  on one side stretched the open moor rising into the purple hills just touched with snow  on the other was the wooded valley of the derwent growing wider ever before it debouched amid rocks into the sea  the goodwife at once discovered that there had been recent habitation and asked what had become of the former dwellers there  the woman fretted for company said simon and vowed she was in fear of the scots so i even let her have her way and go down to the town  the town in north country parlance only meant a small village and hob asked where it lay  it was near the junction of the two streams where simon lived himself in a slightly fortified farmhouse just high up enough to be fairly safe from flood tides  he did not advise his newly arrived tenants to be much seen at this place where there were people who might talk  they were almost able to provide for their daily needs themselves excepting for meal and for ale and he would himself see to this being supplied from a more distant farm on the coast which hob and piers might visit from time to time with the pony  goodwife dolly inquired whether they might safely go to church from which she had been debarred all the time they had been on the move so ill for both us and the lad she said  simon looked doubtful  if thou canst not save thy soul without he said thou mightst go on some feast day when there is such a concourse of folk that thou mightst not be noticed and come away at once without halting for idle clavers as they call them here  thats what the women folk are keen for with their churchgoing said hob with a grin  now husband thou knowst said dolly injured though she was more than aware he spoke with intent to tease her  have i not lived all this while with none to speak to save thee and the blessed lads and never murmured  though thy tongue be sore for want of speech laughed hob thou beest a good wife dolly and maybe thy faithfulness will tell as much in the saving of thy soul as going to church  nay but said hal with eagerness is there not a priest  the priest comes of a white rose housei trust not him  ay goodwife beware of showing thyself to him  i give him my dues that he may have no occasion against me or sir lancelot but i would not have him pry into knowledge that concerns him not  did not sir lancelot say somewhat of a scholarly hermit who might learn me in what i ought to know asked the boy  never you fear sir  here are hob halstead and i able to train any young noble in what behoves him most to know  yea in arms and sports  they must be learnt i know but a noble needs booklore too said the boy  cannot this same hermit help me sir lancelot  simon bunce interrupted sharply  sir lancelot knows nought of the hermit  he ishe isa holy man  a priest broke in dolly a priest  no such thing dame no clerk at all i tell thee  and ye lads had best not molest him  he is for ever busy with his prayers and wants none near him  hal was disappointed for his mind was far less set on the exercises of a young knight than on the desire to acquire knowledge that study which seemed to be thrown away on the unwilling ears of anne st john  hob had been awakened by contact with his lady and her husband as well as with the old comrade simon bunce to perceive that if there were any chance of the young lord cliffords recovering his true position he must not be allowed to lounge and slouch about like piers and he was continually calling him to order making him sit and stand upright as he had seen the young pages forced to do at the castle learn how to handle a sword and use the long stick which was the substitute for a lance and to mount and sit on the old pony as a knight should do till poor hal had no peace and was glad to get away upon the moor with piers and the sheep where there was no one to criticise him or predict that nothing would ever make him do honour to his name if he were proved ten times a baron  it was still worse when bunce came over and brought a taller horse and such real weapons as he deemed that the young lord might be taught to use and there were doleful auguries and sharp reproofs designed in comically respectful phrases till he was almost beside himself with being thus tormented and ready to wish never to hear of being a baron  his relief was to wander away upon the moors watch the lights and shadows on the wondrous mountains or dream on the banks of the river by which he could make his way to the seashore a place of endless wonder and contemplation as he marvelled why the waters flowed in and retreated again watched the white crests and the glassy rolls of the waves felt his mind and aspiration stretched as by something illimitable even as when he looked up to the sky and saw star beyond star differing from one another in brightness there were those white birds too differing from all the nightjars and plovers he had seen on the moor floating now over the waves now up aloft and away as if they were soaring into the very skies  oh would that he could follow them and rise with them to know what were those great grey or white clouds and what was above or below in those blue vastnesses  and whence came all those strange things that the water spread at his feet the long brown wet streamers or the delicate red tracery that could be seen in the clear pools where were sometimes those lumps like raw flesh when closed but which opened into flowers  or the things like the snails on the heath yet not snails and all the strange creatures that hopped and danced in the water  why would no one explain such things to him  nay what a pity everyone treated it as mere childish folly in him to be thus interested  they did not quite dare to beat him for itthat was one use of being a baron  indeed one day when simon bunce struck him sharply and hard over the shoulders for dragging home a great piece of seaweed with numerous curious creatures upon it goodwife dolly rushed out and made such an outcry that the esquire was fain to excuse himself by declaring that it was time that my lord should know how to bide a buffet and answer it  he was ready and glad to meet the stroke in return  come on sir  and hob put a stout headless lance in the boys hand while simon stood up straight before him  hob adjusted the weapon in his inert hand and told him how and where to strike  but it is not in sooth i dont want to hurt master simon said the child as they laughed and yet with displeasure as his blow fell weak and uncertain  is it a mouses tail cried simon in derision  come sir try again said hob  strike as you did when the black bull came down  why cannot you do the like now when you are tingling from bunces stroke  ah then i thought the bull would fall on piers said hal  come on think so now sir  one blow to do my heart good and show you have the arm of your forebears  thus incited with hob calling out to him to take heart of grace while simon made a feint of trying to beat mother dolly hal started forward and dealt a blow sufficient to make simon cry out ha well struck sir if you had had a better grip of your lance  i even feel it through my buff coat  he spoke as though it had been a kiss but oh and alack why were these rough and dreary exercises all that these guardiansyea and even sir lancelot and his motherthought worth his learning when there was so much more that awoke his delight and interest  was it really childish to heed these things  yet even to his young undeveloped brain it seemed as if there must be mysteries in sky and sea the unravelling of which would make life more worth having than the giving and taking of blows which was all they heeded     chapter viii  the hermit    no hermit eer so welcome crost a childs lone path in woodland lostkeble   hal had wandered farther than his wont rather hoping to be out of call if simon arrived to give him a lesson in chivalrous sports  he found himself on the slope of one of the gorges down which smaller streams rushed in wet weather to join the derwent  there was a sound of tinkling water and leaning forward hal saw that a tiny thread of water dropped between the ferns and the stones  therewith a low soft chant in a manly voice mingling with the drip of the water  the words were strange to him             lucis creator optime           lucem dierum proferens   but they were very sweet and in leaning forward to look between the rowan branches and hear and see more his foot slipped and with watch barking round him he rolled helplessly down the rock and found himself before a tall lighthaired man in a dark dress who gave a hand to raise him asking kindly art hurt my child  oh no sir  off off watch as the dog was about to resent anyones touching his master  holy sir thanks great thanks as a long fair hand helped him to his feet and brushed his soiled garment  unhurt i see said that sweet voice  hast thou lost thy way good dog thou lovest thy master  art thou astray  no sir thank you i know my way home  thou art the boy who lives with the shepherd at derwentside on bunces ground  ay hob hogwards herd boy said hal  oh sir are you the holy hermit of the derwent vale  a hermit for the nonce i am was the answer with something of a smile responsive to the eager face  oh sir if you be not too holy to look at me or speak to me  if you would help me to some better knowledgenot only of sword and singlestick  better knowledge my child  of thy god said the hermit a sweet look of joy spreading over his face  goodwife dolly has told me of him and taught me my pater and credo but we have lived far off and she has not been able to go to church for weeks and years  but what i long after is to tell me what means all thisyonder sea and all the stars up above  and they will call me a simpleton for marking such as these and only want me to heed how to shoot an arrow or give a stroke hard enough to hurt another do such rude doings alone fit for a bull or a ram as meseems go to the making of a knight fair sir  they go to the knights keeping of his own for others whom he ought to defend said the hermit sadly i would have thee learn and practise them  but for the rest thou knowest sure who made the stars  oh yes  nurse dolly told me  she saw it all in a mystery play long long agowhen a hand came out and put in the stars and sun and moon  knowest thou whose hand was figured there my child  the hand of god said hal removing his cap  they be sparks to show his glory  but why do some move about among the othersone big one moves from the bulls face one winter to halfway beyond it  and is the morning star the evening one  ah thou shouldst know ptolemy and the almagest said the hermit smiling to understand the circuits of those wandering starscoeli enarrant gloriam dei  that is latin said the boy startled  are you a priest sir  no not ii am not worthy was the answer but in some things i may aid thee and i shall be blessed in so doing  canst say thy prayers  oh yes nurse makes me say them when i lie down and when i get up credo and pater  she says the old parson used to teach them our own tongue for them but she has wellnigh forgot  can you tell me holy man  that will i with all my heart responded the hermit laying his long delicate hand on hals head  blessed be he who has sent thee to me  the boy sat at the hermits feet listening with the eagerness of one whose soul and mind had alike been under starvation and how time went neither knew till there was a rustling and a step  watch sprang up but in another moment simon bunce cap in hand stood before the hut beginning with how now sir  the hermit raised his hand as if to make a sign saying thou seest i have a guest good friend  bunce started back with oh the young lord  sworn to silence i trust  i bade him not meddle with you sir  it was against his will i trow said the hermit  he fell over the rock by the waterfall but since he is here i will answer for him that he does no hurt by word or deed  never holy sir eagerly exclaimed hal  hob hogward knows that i can keep my mouth shut  and may i come again  simon was shaking his head but the hermit took on him to say gladly will i welcome thee my fair child whensoever thou canst find thy way to the weary old anchoret  go thy way now  or hast thou lost it  no sir i ken the woodland and can soon be at home replied hal then putting a knee to the ground may i have your blessing holy man  alack i told thee i am no priest said the hermit but for such as i am i bless thee with all my soul thou fatherless lad and he laid his hand on the young lads wondering brow then bade him begone since simon and himself had much to say to one another  hal summoned watch and turned to a path through the wood leading towards the coast wondering as he walked how the hermit seemed to know himhim whose presence had been so sedulously concealed  could it be that so very holy a man had something of the spirit of prophecy  he kept his promise of silence and indeed his guardians were so much accustomed to his long wanderings that he encountered no questions only one of hobs growls that he should always steal away whenever there was a chance of master bunces coming to try to make a man of him  however bunce himself arrived shortly after and informed hob that since young folks always pried where they were least wanted and my lord had stumbled incontinently on the anchorets den it was the holy mans will that he might come there whenever he chose  a pity and shame it was but it would make him more than ever a mere priestling ever hankering after books and trash  were it not better to ask my lady and sir lancelot if they would have it so  i could walk over to threlkeld  no no no on your life not exclaimed simon striking his staff on the ground in his vehemence  never a word to the threlkeld or any of his kin  let well alone  i only wish the lad had never gone aroaming there  but holy men must not be gainsaid even if it does make a poor craven scholar out of his fathers son  and thus began a time of great contentment to the lord clifford there were few days on which he did not visit the hermitage  it was a small log hut but raised with some care and made weatherproof with moss and clay in the crevices and there was an inner apartment with a little oil lamp burning before a rough wooden cross where hal if the hermit were not outside was certain to find him saying his prayers  food was supplied by simon himself and since hals admission was often carried by him and the hermit seemed to spend his time either in prayer or in a gentle dreamy state of meditation though he always lighted up into animation at the arrival of the boy whom he had made his friend  hal had thought him old at first on the presumption that all hermits must be aged nor was it likely that age should be estimated by one living such a life but the light hair untouched with grey the smooth cheeks and the graceful figure did not belong to more than a year or two above forty  and he had no air of ill health yet this calm solitary residence in the wooded valley seemed to be infinite rest to him  hal had no knowledge nor experience to make him wonder and accepted the great quiet and calm of the hermit as the token of his extreme holiness and power of meditation  he himself was always made welcome with watch by his side and encouraged to talk and ask questions which the hermit answered with what seemed to the boy the utmost wisdom but older heads would have seen not to be that of a clever man but of one who had been fairly educated for the time had had experience of courts and camps and referred all the inquiries and wonderments which were far beyond him direct to almighty power  the mind of the boy advanced much in this intercourse with the first cultivated person he had encountered and who made a point of actually teaching and explaining to him all those mysteries of religion which poor old dolly only blindly accepted and imparted as blindly to her nursling  of actual instruction nothing was attempted  a little portuary or abbreviated manual of the service was all that the hermit possessed treasured with his small crucifix in his bosom and of course it was in latin  the hours of the church he knew by heart and never failed to observe them training his young pupil in the repetition and english meaning of such as occurred during his visits  he also told much of the history of the world as he knew it and of the church and the saints to the eager mind that absorbed everything and reflected on it coming with fresh questions that would have been too deep and perplexing for his friend if he had not always determined everything with such is the will of god  somewhat to the surprise of simon bunce and hob hogward hal improved greatly not only in speech but in bearing he showed no such dislike or backwardness in chivalrous exercises as previously and when once sir lancelot threlkeld came over to see him he was absolutely congratulated on looking so much more like a young knight  ay said bunce taking all the merit to himself theres nought like having an old squire trained in the wars in france to show a stripling how to hold a lance  hal had been too well tutored to utter a word of him to whom his improvement was really due not by actual training but partly by unconscious example in dignified grace and courtesy of demeanour and partly by the rather sad assurances that it was well that a man born to his station if he ever regained it should be able to defend himself and others and not be a helpless burthen on their hands tales of the seven champions of christendom and of king arthur and his knights likewise had their share in the moulding of the youthful lord clifford  his great desire was to learn to read but it was not encouraged by the hermit nor was there any book available save the portuary crookedly and contractedly written on vellum so as to be illegible to anyone unfamiliar with writing with latin or the service however the anchoret yielded to his importunity so far as to let him learn the alphabet traced on the door in charcoal and identify the more sacred words in the bookwhich indeed were all in gold red and blue  he did not advance more than this for his teacher was apt to go off in a musing dream of meditation repeating over and over in low sweet tones the holy phrases and not always rousing himself when his pupil made a remark or asked a question  yet he was always concerned at his own inattention when awakened and would apologise in a tone of humility that always made hal feel grieved and ashamed of having been importunate  for there was a dignity and gentleness about the hermit that always made the boy feel the contrast with his own roughness and uncouthness and reverence him as something from a holier world  nurse i do think he is a saint one day said hal  nay nay my laddie saints dont come down from heaven in these days of evil  i would thou could see him when one comes upon him at his prayers his face is like the angel at the cross i saw so long ago in the castle chapel  dost thou remember that chapel  thou wert a babe when we quitted it  i had well nigh forgotten it but the good hermits face brought all back again and the voice of the father when he said the service  that thou shouldst mind so long  this hermit is no priest thou sayst  no he said he was not worthy but sure all saints were not priests nurse  nay it is easy to be more worthy than the jack priests i have known  though i would they would let me go to church  but look thee here hal if he be such a saint as thou sayst maybe thou couldst get him to bestow a blessing on poor piers and give him his hearing and voice  hal was sure that his own special saint was holy enough for anything and accordingly asked permission of him to bring his silent companion for blessing and healing  the mild blue eye lighted for a moment  is the poor child then afflicted with the kings evil the hermit asked  nay he is sound enough in skin and limb  it is that he can neither hear nor speak and if you holy sir would lay thine hand on him and sign him with the rood and pray mayhap your holiness  peace peace cried the hermit impetuously lifting up his hand dost not know that i am a sinner like unto the restnay a greater sinner in that a burthen was laid on me that i had not the soul to rise to so that the sin and wickedness of thousands have been caused by my craven faint heart for well nigh two score years  o miserere domine  he threw himself on the ground with clasped hands and hal standing by in awestruck amazement heard no more save sobs mingled with the supplications of the fiftyfirst psalm  he was obliged at last to go away without having been able to recall the attention of his friend from his agony of prayer  with the reticence that had grown upon him he did not mention at home the full effect of his request but when he thought it over he was all the more convinced that his friend was a great saint  had he not always heard that saints believed themselves great sinners and went through many penances  and why did he speak as if he could have cured the kings evil  he asked dolly what it was and she replied that it was the sickness that only the kings touch could heal     chapter ix  henry of windsor    my crown is in my heart not on my head not deckd with diamonds and indian stones nor to be seen  my crown is calld contentshakespeare   summer had faded and an early frost had tinted the fernleaves with gold here and there and made the hermit wrap himself close in a cloak lined with thick brown fur  simon who was accustomed very respectfully to take the command of him insisted that he should have a fire always burning on a rock close to his door and that piers if not hal should always take care that it never went out smothering it with peat as every shepherd boy knew how to do so as to keep it alight or in case of need to conceal it with turf  one afternoon as hal lay on the grass whiling away the time by alternately playing with watch and trying to unravel the mysteries of a flower of goldenrod until the hermit should have finished his prayers and be ready to attend to him piers came through the wood evidently sent on a message and made him understand that he was immediately wanted at home  hal turned to take leave of his host but the hermits eyes were raised in such rapt contemplation as to see nought and indeed it might be matter of doubt whether he had ever perceived the presence of his visitor  hal directed piers to arrange the fire and hurried away becoming conscious as he came in sight of the cottage that there were horses standing before it and guessing at once that it must be a visit from sir lancelot threlkeld  it was simon bunce however who with demonstrations of looking for him came out to meet him as he emerged from the brushwood and said in a gruff whisper clutching his shoulder hard not a word to give a clue  mum  more than your life hangs on it  no more could pass to explain the clue intended whether to the presence of the young lord clifford himself which was his first thought or to the inhabitant of the hermitage  for sir lancelots cheerful voice was exclaiming here he is my lady  heres your son  how now my young lord  thou hast learnt to hold up thy head ay and to bow in better sort as bending with due grace hal paused for a second ere hurrying forward to kneel before his mother who raised him in her arms and kissed him with fervent affection my son mine own dear boy how art thou grown  thou hast well nigh a knightly bearing she exclaimed  master bunce hath done well by thee  good blood will out my lady quoth simon well pleased at her praise  he hath had no training but thine said sir lancelot looking full at simon  none sir knight unless it be honest halsteads here  methought i heard somewhat of the hermit in the glen put in the lady  he is a saint declared two or three voices as if this precluded his being anything more  a saint repeated the lady  anchorets are always saints  what doth he  prayeth answered simon  never doth a man come in but he is at his prayers  tis always one hour or another  ay said sir lancelot interrogatively  sayest thou so  is he an old man  simon put in his word before hal could speak men get so knocked about in these wars that theres no guessing their age  i myself should deem that the poor rogue had had some clouts on the head that dazed him and made him fit for nought save saying his prayers  here sir lancelot beckoned simon aside and walked him away so as to leave the mother and son alone together  lady threlkeld questioned closely as to the colour of the eyes and hair and the general appearance of the hermit and hal replied without suspicion that the eyes were blue the hair he thought of a light colour the frame tall and slight graceful though stooping he had thought at first that the hermit must be old very old but had since come to a different conclusion  his dress was a plain brown gown like a countrymans  there was nobody like him no one whom hal so loved and venerated and he could not help as he stood by his mother pouring out to her all his feeling for the hermit and the wise patient words that now and then dropped from him such as patience is the armour and conquest of the godly or shall a man complain for the punishment of his sins  yet said hal what sins could the anchoret have  never did i know that a man could be so holy here on earth  i deemed that was only for the saints in heaven  the lady kissed the boy and said i trow thou hast enjoyed a great honour my child  but she did not say what it was and when her husband summoned her she joined him to repair to penrith where they were keeping an autumn retirement at a monastery and had contrived to leave their escort and make this expedition on their way  simon examined hal closely on what he had said to his mother sighed heavily and chided him for prating when he had been warned against it but that was what came of dealing with children and womenfolk  what can be the hurt asked hal  sir lancelot knows well who i am  no lack of prudence in him would put men on my track  hear him cried simon he thinks there is no nobler quarry in the woods than his lordship  the hermit  oh simon who is he  but simon began to shout for hob hogward and would not hear any further questions before he rode away as far as hal could see in the opposite direction to the hermitage  but when he repaired thither the next day he was startled by hearing voices and the stamp of horses and as he reconnoitred through the trees he saw half a dozen roughlooking men with bows and arrows buff coats and steel guarded capsoutlaws and robbers as he believed  his first thought was that they meant harm to the gentle hermit and his impulse was to start forward to his protection or assistance but as he sprang into sight one of the strangers cried out how now heres a shepherd thrusting himself in  back lad or twill be the worse for you  the hermit the hermit  do not meddle with him  hes a saint shouted hal  but even as he spoke he became aware of simon who called out hold sir back giles this is one well nigh in as much need of hiding as him yonder  well come since you be come my lord for we cannot get him there away without a message to you and tis well he should be off ere the sleuthhounds can get on the scent  what  where  who demanded the bewildered boy breaking off as at that moment his friend appeared at the door of the hovel no longer in the brown anchorets gown but in riding gear partially defended by slight armour and with a cap on his head which made him look much younger than he had before done  child art thou there  it is well i could scarce have gone without bidding thee farewell he said in his sweet voice thou the dear companion of my loneliness  o sir sir and are you going away  yea so they will have it  these good fellows are come to guard me  oh may i not go with thee  nay my fair son  thou art beneath thy mothers wing while i am like one who was hunted as a partridge on the mountains  whither oh whither gasped hal  that i know not  it is in the breasts of these good men who are charged by my brave wife to have me in their care  oh sir sir what shall i do without you  you that have helped me and taught me and opened mine eyes to all i need to know  hush hush it is a better master than i could ever be that thou needest  but as tokens of impatience manifested themselves among the rude escort take thou this giving him the little service book as he knelt to receive it scarce knowing why  one day thou wilt be able to read it  poor child whose lot it is to be fatherless and landless for me and mine i would i could do more for thee  oh you have done all sobbed hal  nay now but this be our covenant my boy  if thou and if mine own son both come to your own thou wilt be a true and loyal man to him even as thy father was to me and may god almighty make it go better with you both  i will i will  i swear by all that is holy gasped hal clifford with a flash of perception as he knelt  come my liege we have far to go ere night  no time for more parting words and sighs  hal scarcely knew more except that the hands were laid on his head and the voice he had learnt to love so well said the blessing of god the father be upon thee thou fatherless boy and may he reward thee sevenfold for what thy father was who died for his faithfulness to me a sinner  fare thee well my boy  as the hand that hal was fervently kissing was withdrawn from him he sank upon his face weeping as one heartbroken  he scarce heard the sounds of mounting and the trampling of feet and when he raised his head he was alone the woods and rocks were forsaken  he sprang up and ran along at his utmost speed on the trampled path but when he emerged from it he could only see a dark party containing a horseman or two so far on the way that it was hopeless to overtake them  he turned back slowly to the deserted hut and again threw himself on the ground weeping bitterly  he knew now that his friend and master had been none other than the fugitive king henry of windsor     chapter x  the scholar of the mountains   not in proud pomp nor courtly state him his own thoughts did elevate most happy in the shy recesswordsworth   the departure of king henry was the closing of the whole intellectual and religious world that had been opened to the young lord clifford to the men of his own court practical men of the world there were times when poor henry seemed almost imbecile and no doubt his attack of melancholy insanity the saddest of his ancestral inheritances had shattered his powers of decision and action but he was one who saw far on holy ground and he was a wellread man in human learning besides having the ordinary experience of having lived in the outer world so that in every way his companionship was delightful to a thoughtful boy wakening to the instincts of his race  to think of being left to the society of the sheep of dumb piers and his peasant parents was dreariness in the extreme to one who had begun to know something like conversation and to have his countless questions answered or at any rate attended to  add to this he had a deep personal love and reverence for his saint long before the knowing him as his persecuted king and thus his sorrow might well be profound as well as rendered more acute by the terror lest his even unconscious description to his mother might have been treason  he wept till he could weep no longer and lay on the ground in his despair till darkness was coming on and piers came and pulled him up indicating by gestures and uncouth sounds that he must go home goodwife dolly was anxiously looking out for him  laddie there thou beest at last  i had begun to fear me whether the robber gang had got a hold of thee  only hob said he saw master simon with them  have they mishandled thee mine own lad nurses darling  thou lookest quite distraught  all hals answer was to hide his head in her lap and weep like a babe though she could with all her caresses elicit nothing from him but that his hermit was gone  no no the outlaws had not hurt him but they had taken him away and he would never come back  ay ay thou didst love him and he was a holy man no doubt but one of these days thou shalt have a true knight and that is better for a young baron to look to than a saint fitter for heaven than for earth come now stand up and eat thy supper  dont let hob come in and find thee crying like a swaddled babe  with which worldly consolations and exhortations goodwife dolly brought him to rise and accept his bowl of pottage though he could not swallow much and soon put it aside and sought his bed  it was not till late the next day that simon bunce was seen riding his rough pony over the moor  hal repaired to him at once with the breathless inquiry where is he  in safe hands  never you fear sir  but best know nought  o simon was i  did i do him any scatheii never knewi only told my lady mother it was a saint  ay ay lad mores the pity that he is more saint than king  if my lady guessed aught she would be loyal as became your fathers wife and methinks she would not press you hard for fear she should be forced to be aware of the truth  but sir lancelot  as far as i can gather explained simon sir lancelot is one that hath kept well with both sides and so is able to be a protector but down came orders from york and his crew that king harry is reported to be lurking in some of these moors and the countess clifford being his wife he fell under suspicion of harbouring him nay there was some perilous talk in his own household so that as i understand the matter he saw the need of being able to show that he knew nothing or if he found that the king was living within these lands of sending him a warning ere avowing that he had been there so i read what was said to me  he knew nothing from me  neither he nor my lady mother eagerly said hal  when i mind me i am sure my mother cut me short when i described the hermit too closely lest no doubt she should guess who he was  belike  it would be like my lady who is a loyal lancastrian at heart though much bent on not offending her husband lest his protection should be withdrawn from you  bettero a thousand times betterhe gave me up than the king  hush  what good would that do  a boy like you  unless they took you in hand to make you a traitor and offered you your lands if you would swear allegiance to king edward as he calls himself  never though i were cut into quarters averred hal with a fierce gesture clasping his staff  but the king  where and what have they done with him  best not to know my lord said simon  in sooth i myself do not know whither he is gone only that he is with friends  but whowhat were they  they looked like outlaws  so they were many a good fellow is of robin of redesdales train there are scores of them haunting the fells and woods all red rose men keeping a watch on the king replied simon  we had made up our minds that he had been long enough in one place and that he must have taken shelter the winter through when i got notice of these notions of sir lancelot and forthwith sent word to them to have him away before worse came of it  oh why did you not let me go with him  i would have saved him waited on him fought for him  fine fightingwhen theres no getting you to handle a lance except as if you wanted to drive a puddock with a reed  though you have been better of late little as your hermit seemed the man to teach you  he said it was right and became a man  would i were with him  he my true king  let me go to him when you know where good simon  i that am his true and loving liegeman should be with him  ay when you are a man to keep his head and your own  but i could wait on him  would you have us bested to take care of two instead of one and my lady moreover in a pother about her son and sir lancelot stirred to make a hue and cry all the more  no no sir bide in peace in the safe homestead where you are sheltered and learn to be a man minding your exercises as well as may be till the time shall come  when i shall be a man and a knight and do deeds of derringdo in his cause cried hal  and the stimulus drove him on to continual calls to hob in simons default to jousts with sword or spear represented generally by staves and when these could not be had he was making arrows and practising with them so as to become a terror to the wild ducks and other neighbours on the wolds the great geese and strange birds that came in from the sea in the cold weather  when it was not possible to go far afield in the frosts and snows he conned king henrys portuary trying to identify the written words with those he knew by heart and sometimes trying to trace the shapes of the letters on the snow with a stick visiting too the mountains and looking into the limpid grey waters of the lakes striving hard to guess why when the sea rose in tides they were still  more than ever too did the starry skies fill him with contemplation and wonder as he dwelt on the scraps alike of astronomy astrology and devotion which he had gathered from his oracle in the hermitage and longed more and more for the time to return when he should again meet his teacher his saint and his king  alas that time was never to come  the outlawed partisans of the red rose had secret communications which spread intelligence rapidly throughout the country and long before sir lancelot and his lady knew and thus it was that simon bunce learnt through the outlaws that poor king henry had been betrayed by treachery and seized by john talbot at waddington hall in lancashire  deep were the curses that the outlaws uttered and fierce were the threats against the talbot if ever he should venture himself on the cumbrian moors and still hotter was their wrath more bitter the tears of the shepherd lord when the further tidings were received that the earl of warwick had brought the gentle harmless prince to whom he had repeatedly sworn fealty into london with his feet tied to the stirrups of a sorry jade and men crying before him behold the traitor  the very certainty that the meek and patient king would bear all with rejoicing in the shame and reproach that led him in the steps of his master only added to the misery of hal as he heard the tale and he lay on the ground before his hut grinding his teeth with rage and longing to take revenge on warwick edward talbothe knew not whom and grasping at the rocks as if they were the stones of the tower which he longed to tear down and liberate his beloved saint  nor from that time was there any slackness in acquiring or practising all skill in chivalrous exercises     chapter xi  the red rose    that edward is escaped from your brother and fled as he hears since to burgundyshakespeare   years passed on and still henry clifford continued to be the shepherd  matters were still too unsettled and there were too many yorkists in the north keeping up the deadly hatred of the family against that of clifford for it to be safe for him to show himself openly  he was a tall wellmade strong youth and his stepfather spoke of his going to learn war in burgundy but not only was his mother afraid to venture him there but he could not bear to leave england while there was a hope of working in the cause of the captive king though the red rose hung withered on the branches  reports of misunderstandings between king edward and the earl of warwick came from time to time and that queen margaret and her son were busy beyond seas which kept up hope and in the meantime hal grew in the knowledge of all country lore of herd and wood and added to it all his own earnest love of the outofdoor world of sun moon and stars sea and hills beast and bird  the hermit king who had been a welleducated wellread man in his earlier days had given him the framework of such natural science as had come down to the fifteenth century backed by the deepest faith in scriptural descriptions and these inferences and this philosophy were enough to lead a far acuter and more able intellect with greater opportunities of observation much further into the fields of the mystery of nature than ever the king had gone  he said nothing for never had he met one who understood a word he said apart from fortune telling excepting the royal teacher after whom he longed but he watched he observed and he dreamt and came to conclusions that his kings namesake cousin enrique of portugal the discoverer in his observatory at st vincent might have profited by  brother brian a friar for whose fidelity simon bunces outlaw could absolutely answer and who was no friar tuck in spite of his rough life gave dolly much comfort religiously carried on some of the education for which hal longed and tried to teach him astrology  some of the yearnings of his young soul were thus gratified but they were the more extended as he grew nearer manhood and many a day he stood with eyes stretched over the sea to the dim line of the horizon with arms spread for a moment as if he would join the flight of the seagulls floating far far away then clasped over his breast in a sort of despair at being bound to one spot then pressed the tighter in the strong purpose of fighting for his imprisoned king when the time should come  for this he diligently practised with bow and arrow when alone or only with piers and learnt all the feats of arms that simon runce or giles spearman could teach him  spearman was evidently an accomplished knight or esquire he had fought in france as well as in the home wars and knew all the refinements of warfare in an age when the extreme weight of the armour rendered training and skill doubly necessary  spearman was evidently not his real name and it was evident that he had some knowledge of hals real rank though he never hazarded mention of other name or title  the great drawback was the want of horses the little mountain ponies did not adequately represent the warhorses trained to charge under an enormous load and the buff jerkins and steel breastplates of the outlaws were equally far from showing how to move under mail and plates of milan steel nor would sir lancelot threlkeld lend or give what was needful indeed he was more cautious than ever and seemed really alarmed as well as surprised to see how tall and manly his stepson was growing and how like his father  he would not hear of a visit to threlkeld under any disguise though lady clifford was in failing health nor would he do anything to forward the young lords knightly training in effect he only wanted to keep as quiet and unobserved as possible for everything was in a most unsettled and dangerous condition and there was no knowing what course was the safest for one by no means prepared to lose life or lands in any cause  the great earl of warwick on whom the fate of england had hitherto hinged was reported to have never forgiven king edward for his marriage with dame elizabeth grey and to be meditating insurrection encouraged by this there was a great rising in yorkshire of the peasants under robin of redesdale and a message was brought to giles spearman and his followers to join them but he and brother brian demurred and news soon came that the marquess of montagu had defeated the rising and beheaded redesdale  sir lancelot congratulated his stepson on having been too late to take up arms and maintained that the only safe policy was to do nothing a plan which suited age much better than youth  he still lived with hob and piers and slept at the hut but he went further and further afield among the hills and mosses often with no companion save watch so that he might without interruption watch the clear streams and wonder what filled their fountains and why the sea was never full or stand on the seashore studying the tides and trying to construct a theory about them  king henry was satisfied with hitherto shalt thou come and no farther but he who gave that decree must have placed some cause or rule in nature thus to affect them  could it be the moon  the waves assuredly obeyed the changes of the moon and hal was striving to keep a record in strokes marked by a stick on soft earth or rows of pebbles so as to establish a rule  aye aye quoth hob  poor fellow he is not much wiser than the hermit  see how he plays with pebbles and stones  youll make nought of him fine grown lad as he is  why hell sit dazed and moonstruck half a day and all the night staring up at the stars as if he would count them  so spoke the stout shepherd to simon bunce pointing to the young man who lay at his length upon the grass calculating the proportions of the stones that marked the relations of hours of the flood tide and those of the height of the moon  above and beyond was a sundial cut out in the turf from his own observations after the hints that the hermit and the friar had given him  ha now my lord i have rare news for you  the unwonted title did not strike hals unaccustomed ears and he continued moving his lips high noon spring tide  there dye see said hob he heeds nothing  that i and my goodwife should have bred up a mooncalf  here hal dont you know simon  hear his tidings  tidings enow  king henry is freed king edward is fled  my lord of warwick has turned against him for good and all  king henry is proclaimed in all the marketplaces  i heard it with my own ears at penrith  and throwing up his cap into the air while the example was followed by hob with god save king henry and you my lord of clifford  the sound was echoed by a burst of voices and out of the brake suddenly stood the whole band of outlaws headed by giles spearman but hal still stood like one dazed  king harry the hermit free and on his throne he murmured as one in a dream  ay all things be upset and reversed said spearman with a hand on his shoulder  no herd boy now but my lord of clifford  come to his kingdom repeated hal  my own king harry the hermit i would fain go and see him  so you shall my brave youth and carry him your homage and mine said spearman  he will know me for poor giles musgrave who upheld his standard in many a bloody field  we will off to sir lancelot at threlkeld now  spite of his policy of holes and corners he will not now refuse to own you for what you are aye and fit you out as becomes a knight  god grant he may muttered bunce without his hum and ha and swaying this way and that till he never moves at all  betwixt his caution and this lads moonstruck ways you have a fair course before you sir giles  see whats the lad doing now  the lad was putting into his pouch the larger white pebbles that had represented tens in his calculation and murmuring the numbers they stood for  he will understand he said almost to himself but he showed himself ready to go with the party to threlkeld merely pausing at hobs cottage to pick up a few needful equipments  in the skin of a rabbit carefully prepared and next wrapped in a silken kerchief and kept under his chaff pillow was the hermits portuary which was carefully and silently transferred by hal to his own bosom sir giles musgrave objected to watch in city or camp and hal was obliged to leave him to goodwife dolly and to piers  with each it was a piteous parting for dolly had been as a mother to him for almost all his boyhood and had supplied the tenderness that his mothers fears and sir lancelots precautions had prevented his receiving at threlkeld  he was truly as a son to her and she sobbed over him declaring that she never would see him again even if he came to his own which she did not believe was possible and who would see to his clean shirts  never fear goodwife said giles musgrave he shall be looked to as mine own son  and whats that to a gentle lad that has always been tended as becomes him  heed not mother  be comforted  i must have gone to the wars anyway  if so be i thrive ill send for thee to mine own castle to reign there as i remember of old  here now  comfort piers as thou only canst do  piers poor fellow wept bitterly only able to understand that something had befallen his comrade of seven years which would take him away from field and moor  he clung to hal and both lads shed tears till hob roughly snatched piers away and threw him to his aunt with threats that drew indignant though useless interference from hal though simon bunce was muttering as lief take one lad as the other while dollys angry defence of her nurslings wisdom broke the sadness of the parting     chapter xii  a prudent reception    so doth my heart misgive me in these conflicts what may befall him to his harm and oursshakespeare   through the woods the party went to the fortified house of threlkeld where the gateway was evidently prepared to resist any passing attack by stout gates and a little watchtower  sir giles blew a long blast on his buglehorn and had to repeat it twice before a porter looked cautiously out at a wicket opening in the heavy door and demanded who comes  open porter open in the name of king harry to the lords of clifford and of peelholm  the porter fell back observing sir pardon while i have speech with my master sir lancelot threlkeld  some delay and some sounds of conversation were heard then on a renewed and impatient blast on sir giless horn sir lancelot threlkeld himself came to the wicket and his thin anxious voice might be heard demanding what madness is this  the madness is past soundness is come responded sir giles  king harry is on his throne the traitors are fled and your own fair son comes forth in his proper person to uphold the lawful sovereign but he would fain first see his lady mother and take her blessing with him  and by his impatience destroy himself after all the burthen of care and peril he hath been to me all these years lamented sir lancelot but come in fair lad  open the gates porter  i give you welcome lord musgrave of peelholm  but who are these he added looking at the troop of buffcoated archers in the rear  they are bold champions of the red rose returned sir giles who have lived with me in the wolds and now are on the way to maintain our kings quarrel  sir lancelot however would not hear of admitting the outlaws young clifford and the lord of peelholm should be welcome or more truly he could not help receiving them but the archers must stay outside their entertainment in beef and ale being committed to bunce and the chief warder while the two noblemen were conducted to the castle hall  for the first time in his life clifford was received in his mothers home and accepted openly as he knelt before her to ask her blessing  a fine active handsome youth was he with bright keen eyes closecurled black locks and hardy complexion telling of his outofdoor life and a free use of his limbs and upright carriage though still with more of the grace of the free mountain than of the training of pagedom and squiredom  nor could he speak openly and freely to her not knowing how much he might say of his past intercourse with king henry and of her endeavour to discover it and he sat beside her neither of them greatly at ease at the long table which by the array of silver cups of glasses and the tall salt cellar separating the nobility and their followers recalled to him dim recollections of the scenes of his youth  he asked for his sisterhe knew his little brother had died in the netherlandsand he heard that she had been in the priory of st helens and was now in the household of my lady of hungerford who had promised to find a good match for her  there was but one son of the union with the knight of threlkeld and him hal had never seen nor was he at home being a page in the household of the earl of westmoreland according to the prevailing fashion of the castles of the great feudal nobles becoming schools of arms courtesy and learning for the young gentlemen around  indeed lady clifford surveyed her eldest son with a sigh that such breeding was denied him as she observed one or two little deficiencies in what would be called his table mannersnot very important but revealing that he had grown up in the byre instead of the castle where there was a very strict and punctilious code which figured in catechisms for the young  she longed to keep him and train him for his station but in the first place sir lancelot still held that it could not safely be permitted since he had little confidence in the adherence of the house of nevil to the red rose and moreover hal himself utterly refused to remain concealed in cumberland instead of carrying his service to the king he loved  in fact when he heard the proposal of leaving him in the north he stood up and with far more energy than had been expected from him said go i must to my lawful kings banner and my fathers cause to king harry i carry my homage and whatever my hand can do  such an expression of energy lighted his hitherto dreamy eyes that all beholders turned their glances on his face with a look of wonder sir lancelot again objected that he would be rushing to his ruin  be it so replied hal  it is my duty  the time seems to me to be come added musgrave that my young lord should put himself forward though it may be only in a losing cause  not so much for the sake of success as to make himself a man and a noble  but what can he do persisted threlkeld he has none of the training of a knight  how can you tilt in plate armour you who have never bestridden a charger  these are not the days of du guesclin when a lad came in from the byre and bore down all foes before him  the objection was of force for the defensive armour of the fifteenth century had reached a pitch of cumbrousness that required long practice for a man to be capable of moving under it  so please you sir said hal i am not wholly unskilled  the good sir giles and simon bunce have taught me enough to strike a blow with a good will for a good cause  with horse and arms as befits him began musgrave  i know not that a horse is here that could be depended on began threlkeld  armour too requires to be fitted and proved  he spoke in a hesitating voice that showed his unwillingness and hal exclaimed my longbow is mine own and so are my feet  sir giles will you own me as an archer in your troop where i will strive not to disgrace you or my name  bravely spoken young lord said sir giles heartily right willingly will i be your godfather in chivalry since you find not one nigher home  so may it best be observed his mother since he is bent on going thus his name and rank may be kept back till it be plain whether the enmity of my lords of warwick and montagu still remain against our poor house  there was no desire on either side to object when the lord musgrave of peelholm decided on departing early on the morrow  their host was evidently not sorry to speed them on their way and his reluctant hospitality made them anxious to cumber him no longer than needful and his mind was relieved when it was decided that the heir of the de vescis and cliffords should be known as harry of derwentdale  only when all was preparation in the morning and a hearty service had been said in the chapel the lady called her son aside and looking up into his dark eyes said in a low voice be not angered with my lord husbands prudence my son  remember it is only by caution that he has saved thine head or mine or thy sisters  ay ay mother i know he said more impatiently than perhaps he knew  it was by the same care that he preserved us all when edgecotefield was fought  chafe not at him  thou mayst be thankful even now mayhap to find a shelter preserved while that rogue and robber nevil holds our lands  i am more like to have to protect thee lady mother and bring thee to thy true home again said hal  meantime my child take this purse and equip thyself at york or whenever thou canst  nay thou needst not shrug and refuse  how like thy father the gesture though i would it were more gracious and seemly  but this is mine mine own none of my husbands though he would be willing  it comes from the de vesci lands and those will be thine after me and thine if thou winnest not back thy clifford inheritance  and oh my son crave of sir giles to teach thee how to demean thyself that they may not say thou art but a churl  i trust to be no churl in heart if i be in manners said hal looking down on his small clinging mother  only be cautious my son  remember that you are the last of the name and it is your part to bring it to honour  which i shall scarce do by being cautious he said with something of a smile  that was not my fathers way  ah me you have his spirit in you and how did it end  my lord of clifford said a voice from the court you are waited for  and remember cried his mother with a last embrace there will be safety here whenever thou shalt need it  with gods grace i am more like to protect you and your husband said the lad bending for another kiss and hurrying away     chapter xiii  fellow travellers    and sickerlie she was of great disport and full pleasant and amiable of port of small hounds had she that she fed with roasted flesh and milk and wastel breadchaucer   sir giles musgrave of peelholm was an old campaigner and when hal came out beyond the gate of the threlkeld fortalice he found him reviewing his troop a very disorderly collection as sir lancelot pronounced with a sneer looking out on them and strongly advising his stepson not to cast in his lot with them but to wait and see what would befall and whether the nevils were in earnest in their desertion of the house of york  hal restrained himself with difficulty enough to take a courteous leave of his mothers husband to whose prudence and forbearance he was really much beholden though with his spirit newly raised and burning for his king it was hard to have patience with neutrality  he found sir giles employed in examining his followers and rigidly sending home all not properly equipped with bow sheaf of arrows strong knife or pike buff coat headpiece and stout shoes also a wallet of provisions for three days or a certain amount of coin  he would have no marauding on the way and refused to take any mere lawless camp follower thus disposing of a good many disreputable looking fellows who had flocked in his wake  sir lancelots steward seconded him heartily by hunting back his masters retainers and there remained only about fiveandtwentymostly in fact yeomen or their sonsmen who had been in arms for queen margaret and had never made their submission but lived on unmolested in the hills really outlawed but not coming in collision with the authorities enough to have their condition inquired into  they had sometimes attacked yorkist parties sometimes resisted scottish raids or even made a foray in return and they were well used to arms  these all had full equipments and some more coin in their pouches than they cared to avow  three or four of them brought an ox calf or sheep or a rough pony loaded with provisions and driven by a herd boy or a son eager to see life and the wars  simon bunce well armed was of this party  hob hogward though he had come to see what became of his young lord was pronounced too stiff and aged to join the band which might now really be called a troop not a mere lawless crowd of rough lads  there were three trained menatarms the regular retainers of sir giles who held a little peel tower on the borders where nobody durst molest him and these marshalled the little band in fair order  it was no season for roses but a feather was also the cognisance of henry vi and every ones barretcap mounted a feather generally borrowed from the goodwifes poultry yard at home but sometimes picked up on the moors and showing the barred black and brown patterns of the hawks or the owls plumage  it was a herons feather that hal assumed on the counsel of sir giles who told him it was an old badge of the cliffords and it became well his bright dark hair and brown face  on they went a new and wonderful march to hal who had only looked with infant eyes on anything beyond the fells and had very rarely been into a little moorland church or seen enough people together for a market day in penrith  sir giles directed their course along the sides of the hills till he should gain further intelligence and know how they would be received  for the most part the people were well inclined to king henry though unwilling to stir on his behalf in fear of edwards cruelty  however it was as they had come down from the hills intending to obtain fresh provisions at one of the villages and hal was beginning to recognise the moors he had known in earlier childhood that they perceived a party on the old roman road before them which the outlaws keen eyes at once discovered to be somewhat of their own imputed trade  there seemed to be a waggon upset persons bound and a buzz of men like wasps around a honeycomb preying on it something like womens veiled forms could be seen  ha  mere robbery  this must not be  upon them  form  charge were the brief commands of the leader and the compact body ran at a rapid but a regulated pace down the little slope that gave them an advantage of ground with some concealment by a brake of gorse  halt  pikes forward was the next order  the little band were already close upon the robbers in whom they began to recognise some of those whom sir giles had dismissed as mere ruffians unequipped a few days before  it was with a yell of indignation that the troop fell on them sir giles with a sharp blow severing the bridle of a horse that a man was leading but there was a cry back we are for king harry these be yorkists  nay nay came back the voices of the overthrown  help help for king harry and queen margaret  these be rank thieves who have set on us  holy women are here  these exclamations came broken and in utter confusion mingled with cries for mercy and asseverations on the part of the thieves and fierce shouts from sir giless men  all was hubbub barking dogs shouting men and hal scarcely knew anything till he was aware of two or three shrouded nuns as it seemed standing by their ponies of merchantmen or carters trying to quiet and harness frightened mules of waggons overturned of a general confusion over which arose lord musgraves powerful authoritative voice  kit of clumber  why should i not hang you for thieving on yonder tree with your fellow thieves  yorkists sir  it was all in the good cause responded a sullen voice as a grim red and scarred face was seen on a ruffian held by two of the archers  no yorkists we sir began a stout figure coming forward from the waggon  we be peaceable merchants and this is a holy dame the  the prioress selby of greystone interrupted one of the nuns coming forward with a hawk on her wrist  sir giles of musgrave i am beholden to you  i was on my way to take the young damsel of bletso to her father the lord st john with earl warwick in london he sent us an escort but they being arrant cravens as it seems we thought it well to join company with these same merchants and thus we became a bait for the outlaws of the border  lady lady burst from one of the prisoners i swear that we kenned not holy dames to be of the company  sir my lord we thought to serve the cause of king harry and how any man is to guess which side is earl warwicks is past an honest man  an honest man whose cause is his own pouch returned sir giles miscreants all  but i trow we are scarce yet out of the land of misrule  so if the lady prioress will say a word for such a sort of sorners ill een let you go on your way  they have had a warning the poor rogues and that will suffice for this time  nay now fellows let my wimple alone  youll not find another lord to let you off so easy nor another prioress to stand your friend  get off i say  an archer enforced her words with a blow and by some means rough or otherwise a certain amount of order was restored the ruffians slinking off among the gorse bushes their flight hastened by the pointing of pikes and levelling of arrows at them  while the merchants diving into their packages produced horns of ale which a younger man offered to their defenders the chief of the party a portly fellow interrupted certain civilities between the prioress and sir giles by praying them to partake of a cup of malmsey and adding an entreaty that they might be allowed to join company with so brave an escort explaining that he was a poor merchant of london and the hans towns who had been beguiled into an expedition to scotland to the young king james who was said to have a fair taste  he waved his hands as if his sufferings had been beyond description  went for wool and came back shorn said the prioress laughing well my lord musgrave what say you to letting us join companyas i see your band is afoot it will be no great delay and the more the safer as well as the merrier  here let me present to you my young maid the lady anne of bletso whom i in person am about to deliver to her father  and let me present privately to both ladies said sir giles the young squire harry of derwentdale who hath been living as a shepherd in the hills during the york rule  ha my lord methinks this may not be the first meeting between lady anne and you though she would not know who the herd boy was who found her a stray lambkin on the moor  the young people looked at each other with eyes of recognition and as hal made his best bow he said forsooth lady i did not know myself till afterwards  your shepherd and his wife gave me to understand that i should do hurt by inquiring too much said the young lady smiling and holding out her hand which hal did not know whether to kiss or to shake  i hope the kind old goodwife is well who cosseted me so lovingly  she fares well indeed lady only grieved at parting with me  there now said the prioress since we are quit of the robbers methinks we cannot do better than halt awhile for master lorimers folk to mend the tackling of their gear while we make our noonday meal and provide for our further journey  allow me to be your hostess for the nonce my lords  and between the ladys sumpter mules and the merchants stores a far more sumptuous meal was produced than would have otherwise been the share of the lancastrian party     chapter xiv  the journey    twas sweet to see these holy maids  like birds escaped to greenwood shadesscott   the prioress agnes selby of greystone was a person who would have made a much fitter lady of a castle than head of a nunnery  she would have worked for and with her lord defended his lands for him governed his house and managed her sons with untiring zest and energy  but a vow of her parents had consigned her to a monastic life at york where she could only work off her vigour by teasing the more devout and grave sisters and when honourably banished to the more remote greystone in field sports and in fortifying her convent against scots or lancastrians who somewhat to her disappointment never did attack her  no complaint or scandal had ever attached itself to her name and she let mother scholastica manage the nuns and regulate the devotions while greystone was known as a place where a thirsty warrior might be refreshed where tales and ballads of border raids were welcome and where good hawk or hound was not despised  it had occurred to the lord st john of bletso that the little daughter whom he had left at york might be come to a marriageable age and he had listened to the proposal of one of the cousins of the house of nevil for a contract between her and his son sending an escort northwards to fetch her properly accompanied  she had been all these years at greystone and the prioress immediately decided that this would be an excellent opportunity of seeing the southern world and going on a round of pilgrimages which would make the expedition highly decorous  the ever restless spirit within her rose in delight and the sisterhood of york were ready to acquiesce having faith in mother agnes good sense to guide her and her pupil to his castle in bedfordshire by the help of father martin through any tangles of the white and red roses that might await her as well to her real principle for avoiding actual evil though she might startle monastic proprieties  there was no doubt but that conversation when she could have it was as great a joy to her as ever was galloping after a deer and there she sat with her beautiful hound by her side and her hawk on a pole exchanging sentiments of speculation as to warwicks change of front with sir giles musgrave father martin and master ralph lorimer while discussing a pasty certainly very superior to anything that had come out of the penrith stores  young clifford and lady anne sat on the grass near too shy for the present to renew their acquaintance but looking up at one another under their eyelashes and the first time their eyes met the girl breaking into a laugh but it was not till towards the end of the refection that they were startled into intercourse by a general growling and leaping up of the great hound and of the two big ungainly dogs chained to the waggon as wet lean bristling but ecstatic watch dashed in among them and fell on his master  for four days unless he was tied up at first the good dog must have been tracking him  off off cried the prioress holding back her deerhound by main strength  off florimond he sets thee a pattern of faithfulness  be quiet and learn thy devoir  o sir i cannot send him back entreated hal also embracing and caressing the shaggy neck  send him back  nay indeed  as saith the reverend mother it were well if some earls and lords minded his example said sir giles  here  watch i mind thee well added anne  heres a slice of pasty to reward thee  oh thou art very hungry as the big mouth bolted it whole  nearly famished poor rogue said hal administering a bone  how far hast thou run mine own lad  art fain to come with thy master and see the hermit  thou must een go growled simon bunce unless the ladys dog make an end of thee  tis ever the worthless that turn up  i would florimond would show himself as true said the prioress dont show thy teeth sir  i can honour watch yet love thee  tis jealousy as upsets faith said the merchant  the hound is a knightly beast with his proud head but he brooks not to see a woodville creep in  nay or a beaufort suggested sir giles  no treason lord musgrave said the prioress laughing  ah madam responded sir giles what is treason  whatever is against him that has the best of it observed master lorimer  well that it is not the business of a poor dealer in horsegear and leatherwork  he asks not which way his bridles are to turn  how now tray and blackchaps  never growl and gird  you have no part in the fray  for they were chained and could only champ bark and howl while florimond and watch turned one another over and had to be pulled forcibly back by hal on the one hand and on the other by the mother agnes who would let nobody touch florimond except herself  after this the two dogs subsided into armed neutrality and gradually became devoted friends  the curiously composed cavalcade moved on their way southward  the prioress was mounted on the fine chestnut horse that sir giles had rescued  she was attended by a nun sister mabel and a lay sister both as hardy as herself and riding sturdy mountain ponies but her chaplain a thin delicatelooking man with a bad cough only ventured upon a sturdy ass anne st john had a pretty little white palfrey and two menatarms  there were two grooms countrymen who had run away on the onset of the thieves but came sneaking back again to be soundly rated by the prioress who threatened to send them home again or have them well scourged but finally laughed and forgave them  the merchant master lorimerwho dealt primarily in all sorts of horse furniture but added thereto leatherwork for knights and men atarms and all that did not too closely touch the armourers trade had three sturdy attendants having lost one in an attack by the scottish borderers and he had four huge flemish horses who sped along the better for their loads having been lightened by sales in edinburgh where he had hardly obtained skins enough to make up for the weight  his headquarters he said were at barnet since tanning and leatherdressing necessary to his work though a separate guild literally stank in the nostrils of the citizens of london  to these were added sir giles musgraves twenty archers making a very fair troop wherewith to proceed and the prioress decided on not going to york  she was not particularly anxious for an interview with the abbess of her order and it would have considerably lengthened the journey which both musgrave and lorimer were anxious to make as short as possible  they preferred likewise to keep to the country that was still chiefly open and wild with all its destiny in manufactories yet to come though there were occasionally such towns villages and convents on the way where provisions and lodging could be obtained  every fresh scene of civilisation was a new wonder to hal clifford and scarcely less so to anne st john though her life in the moorland convent had begun when she was not quite so young as he had been when taken to the hills of londesborough  he had only been two or three times in the church at threlkeld which was simple and bare and the full display of a monastic church was an absolute amazement making him kneel almost breathless with awe recollecting what the royal hermit had told him  he was too illiterate to follow the service but the music and the majestic flow of the chants overwhelmed him and he listened with hands clasped over his face not daring to raise his eyes to the dazzling gold of the altar lighted by innumerable wax tapers  the prioress was amused  art dazed my friend  this is but a poor country cell we will show you something much finer when we get to derby  hal drew a long breath  is that meant to be like the saints in heaven he said  is that the way they sing there  i should hope they pronounce their latin better responded the prioress who it may be feared was rather a lightminded woman  at any rate there was a chill upon hal which prevented him from directing any of his remarks or questions to her for the future  the chaplain told him something of what he wanted to know but he met with the most sympathy from the lady anne  which think you is the fittest temple and worship he said as they rode out together after hearing an early morning service gone through in haste and partaking of a hurried meal  the sun was rising over the hills of derbyshire dyeing them of a red purple standing out sharply against a flaming sky flecked here and there with rosy clouds and fading into blue that deepened as it rose higher  the elms and beeches that bordered the monastic fields had begun to put on their autumn livery and yellow leaves here and there were like sparks caught from the golden light  hal drew off his cap as in homage to the glorious sight  ah it is fine said anne it is like the sunrise upon our own moors when one breathes freely and the clouds grow white instead of grey  ah said hal i used to go out to the high ground and say the prayer the hermit taught mejam lucis it began  he said it was about the morning light  i know that jam lucis said anne the sisters sing it at prime and sister scholastica makes us think how it means about light coming and our being kept from ill and she hummed the chant of the first verse  i think this blue sky and royal sun and the moon and stars at night are gods great hall of praise said hal still keeping his cap off as he had done through annes chant of praise  verily it is  it is the temple of god almighty creator of heaven and earth as the credo says replied anne but maybe we come nearer still to him in god the son when we are in church  i do not know  the dark vaulted roof and the dimness seem to crush me down said the mountain lad though the singing lifts me sometimes though at others it comes like a wailing gust all mournful and sad  if i could only understand  my royal hermit would tell me when i can come to him  do you think now he is a king again he will be able to take heed to you  i know he cares for me said hal with confidence  ah yea but will the folk about him care to let him talk to you  i have heard say that he was but a puppet in their hands  yea you are a great lord that is true but will that great masterful earl warwick let you to him or say all these thoughts of his and yours are but fancies for babes  simon bunce did mutter such things and that one of us was as great an innocent as the other said hal but i trust my hermits love  ay you know you are going to someone you love and who loves you sighed anne but how will it be with me  your father suggested hal  my father  what knows he of me or i of him  i tell thee harry clifford he left me at york when i was not eight years old and i have never seen him since  he gave a charge on his lands to a goldsmith at york to pay for my upbringing and i verily believe thought no more of me than if i had been a messan dog  he wedded a lady in flanders and had a son or twain but i have never seen them nor my stepdame and now gilbert there who brought the letter to the mother prioress says she is dead and the little heir whose birth makes me nobody is at a monastery school at ghent  but my lord of redgrave must needs make overtures to my father for me whether for his son or himself gilbert cannot say  so my father sends to bring me back for a betrothal  the good prioress goes with me  she saith that if it be the old lord who is a fierce old rogue with as ill a name as tiptoft himself the butcher she will make my lord st john know the reason why  but what will he care  it would be hard not to hear my lady prioress said hal looking back at the determined black figure gesticulating as she talked to sir giles  anne laughed half sadly so you think  but you have never seen the grim faces at bletso  they will say she is but a woman and a nun and what are her words to alliance with a friend of the lord of warwick  ah it is a heartless hope when i come to that castle  nay anne if my king gives me my place then  lady anne  lady anne called sir giles musgrave the mother prioress thinks it not safe for you to keep so much in the front there might be illdoers in the thickets  anne perforce reined in but hal fed on the idea that had suddenly flashed on him     chapter xv  bletso    matter of marriage was the charge he gave meshakespeare   the cavalcade journeyed on not very quickly as the riders accommodated themselves to those on foot  they avoided the towns when they came into the more inhabited country the prioress preferring the smaller hostels for pilgrims and travellers and it may be suspected monasteries to the nunneries where she said the ladies had nothing to talk about but wonder at her journey and advice to stay in shelter till after the winter weather  meantime it was a fine autumn still and with bright colours on the woods where deer hare rabbit or partridge tempted the hounds not to say their mistress but she kept them well in leash and her falcon with hood and jesses she being too well nurtured not to be well aware of the strict laws of the chase except when some goodnatured monk gave her leave and accompanied hergenerally augustinians who were more of country squires than ecclesiastics  watch needed no leashhe kept close to his master except when occasionally tempted to a little amateur shepherding from which hal could easily call him off  the great staghounds evidently despised him and the curs of the waggon hated him and snarled whenever he came near them but the prioress respected him and could well believe that the hermit king had loved him  he had just the virtues to suit the good king harry she said dutifulness and harmlessness  the prioress was the life of the party with her droll descriptions of the ways of the nuns who received her while the males of the party had to be content with the hostel outside  sir giles and master lorimer riding on each side of her might often be heard laughing with her  the young people were much graver especially as there were fewer and fewer days journeys to bletso and annes unknown future would begin with separation from all she had ever known unless the mother prioress should be able to remain with her  and to harry clifford the loss of her presence grew more and more to be dreaded as each days companionship drew them nearer together in sympathy and he began to build fanciful hopes of the kings influence upon the plans of lord st john unless the contract of betrothal had been actually made and therewith came a certain zest in looking to his probable dignity such as he had never felt before  the last days journey had come  the escort who had acted as guides were in familiar fields and lanes and one the leader rode up to lady anne and pointed to the grey outline among the trees of her home while he sent the other to hurry forward and announce her  anne shivered a little and hal kept close to her  he had made the journey on foot because he had chosen to be reckoned among musgraves archers till he had received full knightly training and besides he had more freedom to attach himself to annes bridle rein and be at hand to help through difficult passages  now he came up close to her and she held out her hand  he pressed it warmly  you will not forget  never never  that red rose in the snowi have the leaf in my breviary  and goodwife dolly tell her ill never forget how she cosseted the wildered lamb  poor mother dolly when shall i see her  oh you will be able to have her to share your state and watch too i take none with me  if we are all in king harrys cause there will be hope of meeting and then if  ah  i see a horseman coming  is it my father  it was a horseman who met them taking off his cap of maintenance and bowing low to the prioress and the young lady but it was the seneschal of the castle not the father whom anne so dreaded but an old gentleman walter wenlock with whom there was a greeting as of an old friend  my lord had gone with the earl of warwick to queen margaret in france and had sent a messenger with a letter to meet his daughter at york and tell her to go to the house of the poor clares in london instead of coming home and there await him  the route that had been taken by the party accounted for their not having met the messenger and it was plain that they must go on to london  the evening was beginning to draw in and a nights lodging was necessary  anne assumed a little dignity  my good friends who have guarded me i hope you will do me the honour to rest for the night in my fathers castle  the seneschal bowed acquiescence but the poor man was evidently sorely perplexed by such an extensive invitation on the part of his young lady on his peace establishment though the prioress did her best to assist anne to set him at ease  here is sir giles musgrave the lord of peelholm on the borders a staunch friend of king harry with a band of stout archers and this gentleman from the north is with him  it had been agreed that the clifford name should not be mentioned till the way had been felt with warwick one of whose cousins had been granted the lands of the black lord clifford  the seneschal bent before musgrave courteously saying he was happy to welcome so good and brave a knight and he prayed his followers to excuse if their fare was scant and homely being that he was unprovided for the honour  no matter sir returned musgrave we are used to soldiers fare  and proceeded anne master lorimer must lie here and his wains  master lorimer said the prioress with whom belikelorimer of barnetsir seneschal has had dealings and she put forward the merchant who had been falling back to his waggon  yea said walter wenlock frankly holding out his hand  we have bought your wares and made proof of them good sir  i am glad to welcome you though i never saw you to the face before  great thanks good seneschal  all that i would ask would be licence for my wains to stand in your court tonight while my fellows and i sup and lodge at the hostel  the hospitality of bletso could not suffer this and both anne and the seneschal were urgent that all should remain wenlock reflecting that if the store for winter consumption were devoured even to the hog waiting to be killed he could obtain fresh supplies from the tenants so he ushered all into the court and summoned steward cooks and scullions to do their best  it was not a castle only a castellated house which would not have been capable of long resistance in time of danger but the court and stables gave ample accommodation for the animals and the waggons and the men were bestowed in the great open hall reaching to the top of the house where all would presently sup  in the meantime the seneschal conducted the ladies and their two attendants to a tiny chamber where an enormous bed was being made ready by the stewards wife and her son and in which all four ladies would sleep the prioress and anne one way the other two foot to foot with them  they had done so before so were not surprised and the lack of furniture was a matter of course  their mails were brought up a pitcher of water and a bowl and they made their preparations for supper  anne was in high spirits at the dreaded meeting and still more dreaded parting having been deferred and she skipped about the room trying to gather up her old recollections  yes i remember that bit of tapestry and the man that stands there among the sheep  is it king david think you mother about to throw his stone at the lion and the bear  lion and bear child  tis the three goddesses and paris choosing the fairest to give the golden apple  methought that was the lions mane but i see a face  what would the lady venus say to have her golden locks taken for a lions mane  i like black hair said anne  better not fix thy mind on any hue  we poor women have no choice save what fathers make for us  o good my mother peace  they are all in france and theres no need to spoil this breathing time with thinking of what is coming good old wenlock  i used to ride on his shoulder  im right glad to see him again  i must tell him in his ear to put hal well above the salt  may not i tell him in his ear who he is  safer not my maid till we know what king harry can do for him better that his name should not get abroad till he can have his own  a great bell brought all down and anne was pleased to see that her seneschal made no question about placing harry clifford beside the prioress who sat next to the lord of peelholm who sat next to the young daughter of the house in the seat of honour  the nuns master lorimer and one of the archers who was a border squire besides master wenlock occupied the high table on the dais and the archers grooms and the rest of the household were below  the fare was not scanty nor unsubstantial but evidently hastily prepared being chiefly broiled slices of beef on which salting had begun but there was a lack of bread even of barley though there was no want of drink  however the prioress was goodhumoured and forestalled all excuses by jests about travellers meals and surprises in the way of guests and both she and sir giles were anxious for wenlocks news of the state of things  he knew much more of the course of affairs than they in their northern homes and on their journey  the realm is divided he said  those who hold to king harry as you gentles do are in high joy but there be many spoken with respect who cannot face about so fast and hold still for york though they mislike the queens kindred  of such are the merchantmen of london  is it so asked lorimer  if king edward be as deep in debt to them as to me for housings and bridle reins methinks he should not be in good odour in their nostrils  yea said wenlock but if he be gone a beggar to burgundy what becomes of their debt  i would not give much for it were he restored a score of times said the prioress what would he do but plunge deeper  there would be hope though of getting an order on the royal demesne or the crown jewels or the taxes said lorimer  nay i hold one even now that will be but waste if he come not back  and this poor king spendeth nothing save on priests and masses said wenlock  hal started forward eager to hear of his king and musgrave said a holy man is he  too holy for a king said the seneschal  he looked like a woolsack across a horse when my lord of warwick led him down cheapside and only the rabble cried out long live king harry but some scoffed and said they saw a mere gross monk with a baby face where they had been wont to see a comely prince full of manhood with a sword instead of beads  his son will please them said musgrave  he was a goodly child full of spirit when last i saw him  if so be he have not too much of the frenchwoman his mother in him said wenlock  a losing lot as poor as any rats and as proud as very peacocks  she was gracious enough and won all hearts on the border replied musgrave  come come put in the prioress you may have the chance yet to break a lance on her behalf  no fear but she is royal enough to shine down king edwards lowborn love the widow grey  ay there lay the cause of discontent said lorimer the upstart ways of her kin were not to be borne  to hear dick woodville chaffer about the blazoning of his horsegear when he was wedding the fourscoreyearold duchess of norfolk one would have thought he was an emperor at the very least  widow grey has done something for her husbands cause said the seneschal in bringing him at last a fair son all in his exile and she in sanctuary at westminster  the london citizens are ever touched through all the fat about their hearts by whatever would sound well in the mouth of a balladmonger  my king my king what of him sighed hal in the prioresss ear and she made the inquiry for him what said you of king henry sir seneschal  how did he fare in his captivity  not so ill methinks said the seneschal  he had the range of the tower and st peters in the fetters to pray in which was what he heeded most also he had a messan dog and a tame bird  indeed men said he had laid on much flesh since he had been mewed up there and my lord who went with my lord of warwick to fetch him said his garments were scarce so cleanly as befitted  twas hard to make him understand  first he clasped his hands and bowed his head crying out that he forgave those who came to slay him and when he found it was all the other way he stood like one dazed let his hand be kissed and they say is still in the hands of my lord archbishop of york just as if he were the waxen image of st john in a procession  the earl and the queen will have to do the work said the prioress and they will no more hold together than a couple of wild hawks will hunt in company  how long do you give them to tear out one anothers eyes  son and daughter may keep them together said musgrave  hatred of the woodvilles is more like a poor band though it be said the prioress  these are stirring times  ill not go back to my anchoress lodge in the north till i see what works out of them meantime to our beds sweet anne since tis an early start tomorrow  the prioress who had become warmly interested in hal and had divined the feeling between him and anne thought that if she could obtain access to the archbishop of york warwicks brother george she could deal with him to procure cliffords restitution in name and in blood and at least his de vesci inheritance if dick nevil who had grasped the clifford lands could not be induced to give them up  i have seen george nevil she said when i was instituted to greystone  he is of kindlier mood than his brothers and more a valiant trencherman and hunter than aught else  if i had him on the moors and could show him some sport with a red deer i could turn him round my finger     chapter xvi  the hermit in the tower    thy pity hath been balm to heal their wounds thy mildness hath allayed their swelling griefs thy mercy dried their ever flowing tearsshakespeare   early in the morning while the wintry sun was struggling with mists and grass and leaves were dark with frost the prioress was in her saddle  perhaps the weather might have constrained a longer stay but that it was clear to her keen eyes that however welcome wenlock might make his young lady there was little provision and no welcome for thoroughgoing lancastrians like sir giless troop who had besides a doubtful robin hoodlike reputation and as neither she nor anne wished to ride forward without them they decided to go on all together as before  and a very wet and slightly snowy journey they had meeting in snow and parting in snow as hal said as he marched by annes bridle rein leading her pony so as to leave her hands free to hold cloak and hood close about her  she sighed and put one hand on his but a gust of wind took that opportunity of getting under her cloak and sending it fluttering over her back so that he had to catch it and return it to her grasp  let us take that as a prophecy that storms shall not hinder our further meeting  it may be  it may be  who knows what my king may do for us  only a storm can bring us together  but that may  her breath was blown away again before the sentence was finished if it was meant to be finished and master lorimer came to insist on the ladies taking shelter in his covered waggon where the prioress was already installed  through rain and sleet they reached chipping barnet in due time on the third days journey and here they were to part from the merchants wains  he had sent forward and ample cheer was provided at the handsome timbered and gabled house at the porch of which stood his portly wife with son daughter and soninlaw ready to welcome the party bringing them in to be warmed and dried before sitting down to the excellent meal which it had been mistress lorimers pride and pleasure to provide  there was a small nunnery at barnet but not very near and the prioress agnes did not think herself bound to make her way thither in the dark and snow so she remained most devoutly waited on by her hostess and discussed the very last tidings which had been brought that morning by the foreman whom mistress lorimer had sent to bring the news to her husband  it was probable that the lord of bletso was with warwick and the queen as he had not been heard of at his home  the king was in the royal apartments of the tower under the charge of the chancellor the earl of oxford a steady partisan of the red rose was constable of the kingdom and was guarding the tower  on hearing this musgrave decided to repair at once to the earl one of the few men in whom there was confidence since he had never changed his allegiance and to take his counsel as to the recognition of young clifford  on the way to the tower they would leave the prioress and her suite at the sister minoresses till news could be heard of the baron st john  so for the last time the travellers rode forth in slightly improved weather  harrys heart beat high with the longing soon to be in the presence of him who had opened so many doors of life to his young mind whom he so heartily loved and who it might be could give him that which he began to feel would be the joy of his life  the archers who had been lodged in the warehouses were drawn up in a compact body and master lorimer who had a shop in cheapside decided on accompanying them partly to be at the scene of action and partly to facilitate their entrance  so hal walked by the side of anne st johns bridlerein with a very full heart swelling with sensations he did not understand and which kept him absolutely silent untrained as he was in the conventionalities which would have made speech easier to him  nor had anne much more command of tongue and all she did was to keep her hand upon the shoulder of her squire but there was much involuntary meaning in the yearning grasp of those fingers and both fed on the hopes the prioress had given them  christmas was close at hand and fatted cattle on their way to market impeded the way so that hals time was a good deal taken up in steering the pony along and in preventing watch from getting into a battle with the savage dogs that guarded them  penrith market where once he had been had never shown him anything like such a concourse and he could hear muttered exclamations from the archers who walked by sir giless orders in a double line on each side the horses their pikes keeping off the blundering approach of bullocks or sheep  by the halidome if the scots were among them they might victual their whole kingdom till domesday  the tall spire of old st pauls and the four turrets of the tower began to rise on them and were pointed out by master lorimer for even sir giles had only once in his life visited the city and no one else of the whole band from the north had ever been there  the road was bordered by the high walls of monasteries overshadowed by trees and at the deep gateway of one of these lorimer called a halt  it was the house of the minoresses or poor clares where the ladies were to remain  the six weeks companionship would come to an end and the prioress was heartily sorry for it  i shall scarce meet such good company at the clares she said laughing as she took leave of lord musgrave mayhap when i go back to my hills i shall remember your goodwifes offer of hospitality master lorimer  master lorimer bowed low expressed his delight in the prospect and kissed the prioresss hand but the heavy door was already being opened and with an expressive look of drollery and resignation the good lady withdrew her hand hastily brought her benedictine hood and veil closely over her face and rode into the court followed by her suite  anne had time to let her hand be kissed by sir giles and hal who felt as if a world had closed on him as the heavy doors clanged together behind the sisters  but the previous affection of his young life lay before him as sir giles rode on to the fortified aldgate and after a challenge from the guard answered by a watchword from lorimer and an inquiry for whom the knight held they were admitted and went on through an increasing crowd trailing boughs of holly and mistletoe to the north gateway of the tower  here they parted with lorimer with friendly greetings and promises to come and see his stall at cheapside  there was a manatarms with the star of the de veres emblazoned on his breast and a red rosette on his steel cap but he would not admit the newcomers till sir giles had given his name and it had been sent in by another of the garrison to the earl of oxford  presently after some waiting in the rain and looking up with awe at the massive defences two knights appeared with outstretched hands of welcome  down went the drawbridge up went the portcullis the horses clattered over the moat and the reception was hearty indeed well met my lord of musgrave  i knew you would soon be where red roses grew  welcome sir giles  methought you had escaped after the fight at hexham  glad indeed to meet you brave sir john and you good lord of holmdale  is all well with the king  as well as ever it will be  the constable is nigh at hand  you have brought us a stout band of archers i see  we will find a use for them if march chooses to show his presumptuous nose here again  and hither comes my lord constable  it rejoices his heart to hear of such staunch following  the earl of oxford a stern grave man of early middle age was coming across the courtyard and received sir giles with the heartiness that became the welcome of a proved and trustworthy ally after a few words musgrave turned and beckoned to hal who advanced shy and colouring  ha young lord clifford  i am glad to see you  i knew your father well rest his soul  the king spoke to me of the son of a loyal house living among the moors  the king was very good to me faltered hal crimson with eagerness  ay ay  i sent not after you having enough to do here and besides till we have the strong hand and can do without that heady kinsman of warwick it will be ill for you to disturb the rogue whats his nameto whom your lands have been granted and who might turn against the cause and maybe make a speedy end of you if he knew you present  be known for the present as sir giles counsels  better not put his name forward he added to musgrave  i care not for lands said hal only to see the king  see him you shall my young lord and if he be not in one of his trances he will be right glad to see you and remember you  but he is scarce half a man added oxford turning to musgrave  cares for nought but his prayers  keeps his hours like a monk  we can hardly bring him to sit in the council and when he is there he sits scarce knowing what we say  tis my belief when the queen and prince come that we shall have to make the prince rule in his name and let him alone to his prayers  he will be in the church  tis nones or some hour as they call it and he makes one stretch out to another  they entered the low archway of st peter ad vincula and there hal perceived a figure in a dark mantle just touched with gold kneeling near the chancel step almost crouching  did he not know the attitude though the back was broader than of old  he paused as did his companions but there was one who did not pause and would not be left outside  watch unseen had pattered up and was rearing up jumping and fawning  there was a call of watch here sirrah but watch  watch  good dog  is it thou indeed was exclaimed at the same moment and with watch springing up king henry stood on his feet looking round with his dazed glance  my king my hermit father  forgive  down watch cried hal falling down at his feet with one arm holding down watch who tried to lick his face and the kings hand by turns  is it thou my child my shepherd said henry his hands on the lads head  bless thee  oh bless thee much loved child of my wanderings  i have longed after thee and prayed for thee and now god hath given thee to me at this shrine  kneel and give the lord thy best thanks my lad  ah how tall thou art  i should not have known thee hal but for watch  it is well muttered oxford to musgrave  i have not seen him so well nor so cheery all this day  the lad will waken him up and do him good     chapter xvii  a captive king    and we see far on holy ground if duly purged our mental viewkeble   the king held harry clifford by the hand as he left st peters church  my child my shepherd boy he said and he called watch after him and interested himself in establishing a kind of suspicious peace between the shaggy collie and his own minion a small white curlyhaired dog which belonged to a family that had been brought by queen margaret from provence  his attendant knight sir nicolas romford told sir giles musgrave that he had really never seemed so happy since his deliverance and sir nicolas had waited on him ever since his capture six years previously  he led the youth along to the royal rooms asking on the way after his sheep and the goodwife who had sent him presents of eggs then showing him the bullfinch that greeted his return with loving chirps and when released from its cage came and sat upon his shoulder and played with his hair a better pet than a fierce hawk eh hal he said  he laughed when he found that harry thought he had spent all this time in a dark underground dungeon with fetters on his feet  oh no he said they were kindly jailors  they dealt better with me than with my master  sir sir that terrible ride through cheapside said harry  we heard of it at derwentside and we longed to have our pikes at the throats of the villain traitors  the king looked as if he hardly remembered that cruel procession when he was set upon a sorry jade with his feet tied to the stirrups and shouts of behold the traitor around him  then with a sweet smile of sudden recollection he said ah i recall it and how i rejoiced to be led in the steps of my lord and how the cries sounded we will not have this man to reign over us  gratias ago unworthy me who by my own fault could not reign  harry was silenced awestruck and byandby the king took him to see his old chamber in the white tower up a winding stone stair it was not much inferior to the royal lodgings except in the matter of dais canopy and tapestry and the window looked out into the country so that the king said he had loved it and it had many a happy thought connected with it  hal followed him in a sort of silent wonder if not awe not daring to answer him in monosyllables  this was not quite the hermit of derwentdale  it was a broader mannot with the breadth of full strength but of inactivity and advance of years though the fiftieth year was only lately completedand the royal robe of crimson touched with gold suited him far less thaft the brown serge of the anchoret  the face was no longer thin sunburnt and worn but pale and his checks slightly puffed and the eyes and smile with more of the strange look of innocent happiness than of old and of that which seemed to bring back to his young visitor the sense of peace and wellbeing that the saintly hermit had always given him  there was consultation that evening between lord oxford and sir giles musgrave  it was better they agreed to let young clifford remain with the king as much as possible but without divulging his name the king knew it and indeed had known it when he received the boy at his hermitage but he seemed to have forgotten it as he had much besides  oxford said that though he could be roused into actual fulfilment of such forms as were required of him and understood what was set before him his memory and other powers seemed to have been much impaired and it was held wiser not to call on him more than could be helped till the queen and her son should come to supply the energy that was wanting  they would make the gay and brilliant appearance that the londoners had admired in edward of york and which could not be obtained from poor henry  his memory for actual matters was much impaired  never for two days together could he recollect that his son and warwicks daughter were married and it was always by an effort that he remembered that the prince of wales was not the eightyearsold child whom he had last seen  as to young clifford he sometimes seemed to think the tall nineteenyearsold stripling was just where he had left the child of twelve or thirteen and if he perceived the age was so far confused that it was not quite certain that he might not mix him up with his own son though the knight in constant attendance was sure that he was clear on that point and only looked on hal as the child of his teaching and prayers  but harry clifford could not persuade him to enter into that which more and more lay near the youthful heart the rescuing anne st john from the suitor of whom little that was hopeful was heard and the obtaining her from his father  of course this could not be unless harry could win his fathers property and no longer be under the attaint in blood so as to be able to lay claim to the lands of the de vescis through his mother but though the king listened with kindly interest to the story of the childrens adventure on the londesborough moor and the subsequent meeting in westmorland the rescue from the outlaws and the journey together it was all like a romance to himhe would nod his head and promise to do what he could if he could but he never remembered it for two days together and if hal ventured on anything like pressure the only answer was patience my son patience must have her work  it is the will of god it will be right  and when hal began to despair and work himself up and seek to do more with one so impracticable lord oxford and sir giles warned him not to force his real name and claims too much for he did not need too many enemies nor to have lord st john and the nevil who held his lands both anxious to sweep him from their path  nor was anything heard from or of the prioress of greystone and whenever the name of george nevil the chancellor and archbishop of york was heard hals heart burnt with anxiety and fear that the lady had forgotten him though as dick nevil who held the lands of clifford was known to be in his suite it was probable that she was acting out of prudence  the turmoil of anxious impatience seemed to be quelled when hal sat on a stool before the king with watch leaning against his knee  the instruction or meditation seemed to be taken up much where it had been left six years before with the same unanswerable questions only the youth had thought out a great deal more and the hermit had advanced in a wisdom which was not that of the rough practical world  part of cliffords day was spent in the tiltyard where his two friends as well as himself were anxious that he should acquire proficiency and ease such as would become his station when he recovered it and a martinet old squire of oxford proved himself nearly as hard a master as ever simon bunce had been  one very joyous day came to henry in his regal capacity  christmas day had been quietly spent  there was much noisy revelling in the city and the guards in the castle had their feastings but warwick was daily expected to return from france and neither his brother nor the archbishop thought that there was much policy in making a public spectacle of a puppet king  but there was one ceremony from which henry would not be debarred he would make the public offering on the epiphany in westminster abbey  he had done so ever since he was old enough to totter up to the altar and hold the offerings and his heart was set on doing so once more  so a large and quiet creamcoloured flemish horse was brought for him he was robed in purple and ermine with a coronal around the cap that covered his hair fast becoming white  his train in full array followed him and the streets were thronged but there was an ominous lack of applause and even a few audible jeers at the monk dressed up like the jackdaw in peacocks plumes and comparisons with edward in sooth a king worth looking at  henry seemed not to heed or hear  his blue eyes looked upward his face was set in peaceful contemplation his lips were moving and those who were near enough caught murmurs of vidimus enim stellam ejus in oriente et venimus adorare eum  truly the one might be a king to suit the kingdoms of this world the other had a soul near the kingdom of heaven  the dean and choir received him at the west door and with the same rapt countenance he paced up to the sanctuary and knelt before the chair appropriated to him while the grand epiphany celebration was gone through in all its glory and beauty of sound and sight and with the king kneeling with clasped hands and a radiant look of happiness almost transfiguring that worn face  when the offertory anthem was sung he rose up and advanced to the altar  a salver of gold coins was presented to him which he took and solemnly laid on the altar but paused for a moment and removed his crown with both hands placing it likewise on the altar and kneeling for a moment ere he turned to take the vase whence breathed the fragrant odour of frankincense and presenting this and afterwards kneeling and bowing low with clasped hands he again took the salver in which the myrrh was laid  this again he placed on the altar and remained kneeling in intense devotion through the remainder of the service only looking up at the sursum corda when those near enough to see his countenance said that they never knew before the full import of those words nor how the heart could be uplifted  it was the first time that hal clifford had ever joined in the full ceremonial of the church or in such splendid accompaniment for though there had been the rightful ritual at st peters in the tower the space had been confined and the clergy few and the whole even on christmas day had been more or less a training to him to enter into what he now saw and heard  he had in these last weeks gathered much of the meaning of all this from the king who perhaps never fully disentangled the fullgrown youth from the boy he had taught at derwentdale but who perhaps for that very cause really suited better the strange mixture of ignorance simplicity observation and aspiration of the shepherd lord  the king did not help more but less than he had done before in hals researches and wonderings about natural objects he had forgotten the philosophies he had once read and the supposed circuits of moon planets and stars only perplexed and worried his brain  it was much more satisfactory to refer all to he hath made them fast for ever and ever he hath given them a law which shall not be broken and he could not understand hals desire to find out what that law was and far less his calculations about the tides  he had scarcely ever seen the sea and as to its motions hitherto shalt thou come and no farther was sufficient explanation and when hal tried to show him the correspondence between spring tides and full moons he either waved him away or fell asleep  but on the spiritual side of his mind there was no torpor  he loved to explain the sense of the prayers to his willing pupil and to tell him the gospel story dwelling on whatever could waken or carry on the christian life and between the tiltyard and the oratory hal spent a strange life  that question which had occurred to him on the journey hal ventured to lay before his kingwas it really and truly better and more acceptable worship that came to breathe through him when alone with god under the open vault of heaven with endless stars above and beyond or was the best that which was beautified and guided by priests with all that mans devices could lavish upon its embellishment  such though in more broken and hesitating words was the herd boys difficulty and henry put his head back and after having once said adam had the one god directed the other he shut his eyes and hal feared he would put it aside as he had with the moon and the tides but after some delay he leant forward and said my son if man had always been innocent that worship as adam and eve had it mightnay wouldhave sufficed them  the more innocent man is the better his heart rises  but sin came into the world and expiation was needed not only here on earth but before the just god in heaven above  therefore doth he who hath once offered himself in sacrifice for us eternally present his offering in heaven before the mercyseat and we endeavour as much as our poor feeble efforts can to take part in what he does above and bring it home to our senses by all that can represent to us the glories of heaven  there was much in this that went beyond hal who knitted his brow and would have asked further but the king fell into a state of contemplation and noticed nothing until presently he broke out into a thanksgiving blessed be my lord who hath granted me once more to follow in the steps of the kings of the east though but as in a dream and lay my crown and my prayer before him  once more i thank thee o my true king of kings and lord of lords  oh do not say once more exclaimed hal  again and again i trust sir  it is no dream  it is real  the king smiled and shook his head  it is all a dream to me he said the pageants and the whole  they will not last  oh no  it is all but an empty show  hal looked up anxiously and the king went on well do i remember the day when scarce able to walk and weighed down by my robes i tottered up to the altar and was well pleased to make my offering and how my lord of warwick who was then took me in his arms and showed me my great fathers figure on his grave and told me i was bound to be such a king as he  alas was it mine own error that i so failed        henry born at monmouth shall short live and gain all      henry born at windsor shall long live and lose all   oh sir sir do not speak of that old saw  still the king smiled  it has come true my child  all is lost and it may be well for my soul that thus it should be and that i should go into the presence of my god freed from the load of what was gained unjustly  i know not whether if my hand had been stronger i should have striven to have borne up the burthen of these two realms but they never ought to have been mine and if the sins of the forefathers be visited on the children to the third and fourth generation no marvel that my brain and mine arm could but sink under the weight  would that i had yielded at once and spared the bloodshed and sacrilege  miserere mei  my son was a temptation oh my poor boy is he to be the heir to all that has come on me have pity on him good lord  nay sir your brave son will come home to comfort you and help you and make all well  i know not  i know not  i cannot believe that i shall see him again or that the visitation of these crimes is not still to come my son my sweet son i can only pray that he might give up his soul sackless and freer of guilt than his father can be when i remember all that i ought to have hindered when i could think and use my will now now all is but confusion  god has taken away my judgment even as he did with my french grandsire and i can only let others act as they will and pray for them and for myself  he had never spoken at such length nor so clearly and whenever he was required to come forward he merely walked rode sat or signed rolls as he was told to do and continually made mistakes as to the persons brought to him generally calling them by their fathers names if he recognised them at all but still to his nearest attendants and especially to his beloved herd boy he was the same gentle affectionate being never so happy as at his prayers and sometimes speaking of holy things as one almost inspired     chapter xviii  at the minoresses    the bird that hath been limed in a bush with trembling wings misdoubteth every bush                                       shakespeare   one day soon after that twelfth day hal accompanied sir giles musgrave to the shop or stall of master lorimer in cheapside a wide space open by day but closed by shutters at night where all sorts of gilded and emblazoned leatherworks for man or horse were displayed and young prentices called what dye lack  saddle of the newest make  buff coat fit to keep out the spear of black douglas himself  tis master lorimer himself i lack said musgrave with a good humoured smile and the merchant appeared from a room in the rear something between a countinghouse and a bedroom where he welcomed his former companions and insisted on their tasting the good sherris sack that had been sent with his last cargo of spanish leather  i would i could send a flask to our good prioress he said to cheer her heart  i went to the minoresses as she bade me to settle some matters of account with her and after some ado sister mabel came down to the parlour and told me the prioress is very sick with a tertian fever and they misdoubt her recovering  and the young lady of st john  she is well enough but sadly woeful as to the mother prioress and likewise as to what they hear of the lord redgrave  it is the old man not his son a hard and stark old man as i remember  he would have bargained with me for the coats of the poor rogues slain at st albans and right evil was his face as he spoke thereof he being then for queen margaret but then he went over to king edward and glutted himself with slaughter at towton and here he calls himself red rose again  illluck to the poor young maid if she falls to him  it was terrible news for hal and musgrave could not but gratify him by riding by the minories to endeavour to hear further tidings of the prioress  it was a grand building in fine pointed architecture for the clares though once poor in imitation of st clara and st francis had been dispensed collectively from their vow of poverty and though singly incapable of holding property had a considerable accumulation en masse  they were themselves a strict order but they often gave lodgings to ladies either in retreat or for any cause detained near london  sir giles and harry were only admitted to the outer court whence the portress went with their message of inquiry  they waited a long time and then the greystone lay sister who had been the companion of their journey came back in company with the portress  benedicite dear gentles she said oh you are a sight for sair een  and how fares the good mother prioress asked the lord of peelholm  alack she is woefully ill when the fever takes her and she is wasted away so that you would scarce know her but this is one of the better days and if you sir will come into the parlour she will see you  she was arraying herself as i came down  she was neither to have nor to hold when she heard you were there and said a north country face would be better to her than all the sisters potions  they were accordingly conducted through a graceful cloister overgrown with trailing ivy to a bare room with mullioned windows and frescoes on the walls with the history of st francis relieving beggars preaching to the birds c and with a stout open work barrier cutting off half the room  presently the prioress tottered in leaning heavily on the arms of sister mabel and of anne st john while her own lay sister and another placed a seat for her but before she would sit down she would go up to the opening and turning back her veil put out a hand to be grasped  right glad am i to see you good sir giles and young harry  are you going back to the wholesome winds of our moors  not yet holy mother  it grieves me to see you faring so ill  ah a breeze from the north would bring life back to my old bones aye giles this place has made an old woman of me  and truly her bright ruddy face was faded to a purple hue and her cheeks hung haggard and almost withered but as her visitors expressed their grief and sympathy she went on in her own tone  and tell me somewhat of how things are going  how doth richard of warwick comport himself to the king  hath your king zest enough to reign is my white rose king still abroad in burgundy  and as sir giles replied to each inquiry in turn and told all he could of political matters she exclaimed ah that is better than the hearing whether the black hen hath laid an egg or the skein of yellow silk matches i am weary o i am weary  moreover young hal i know as matters are that could i see george nevil face to face i could do somewhat with him and i laid my plans to obtain a meeting but therewith what with vexation and weariness and lack of air comes this sickness and i am laid aside and can do nought but pray and lay my plans to meet him some day in the fields and show him what a hawk can do then shame him into listening to my tale  but i must be a sound woman first  and maybe his brother warwick being a sturdy gentleman who loves a brave man will be better to deal with  i am a sinful woman and maybe my devotions here will help me to be more worthy to be heard  moreover i hoped you had done somewhat in thine own cause with thy king and earl oxford she proceeded  thou hast an esquires coat hast thou any hope of thy lands  i must strive to earn them by deeds said hal  and  well spoken lad  tis the manly way but methought you hadst interest with this king of thine or hath he only a royal memory for services  he is good to me  yea most good began harry  ay he loves the boy said sir giles no question about that but his memory for all that is about him hath failed and there is nothing for it save to wait for the queen and the prince who will bear the boys fathers services in mind  and wherefore tarries the french woman  this maids father is to come over with her  he is forming her english court i trow she can have few beside from england  when he comes said harry with a look into annes eyes that made them droop and her cheeks burn then shall we put it to the touch then shall i know whether i have mine own and what is more than mine own  thine own whispered anne  oh better live in the sheepfolds with thee than with this baron  i shudder at the thought  this and a few more such words were an aside while the prioress continued her conversation with sir giles and went on to say that she was sure she should never recover till she was out of these walls and away from london smoke and london smells and she naughtily added in a whisper the weary talk of these good nuns who had never flown a hawk or chased a deer in their lives and thought florimond a mere wolf if not the evil one himself and kept the poor hound chained up like a malefactor in gyves till she was fain to send him away with master lorimer to keep for her  she would not go back to her priory till annes fate was settled being in hopes of doing something yet for the poor wench but meantime she should die if she stayed there much longer and she meant to set forth on pilgrimage in good time before she had scandalised the good ladies enough to make them gossip to the dames of st helens who would be only too glad to have a story against the benedictines  a ride over the kentish downs was the only cure for her or for anne who had been pining ever since they had been mewed up here though looking across at the girl whose head was leaning against the bars sir giles seemed to have brought a remedy to judge by those cheeks  would that we could hope it would be an effectual and lasting remedy sighed sir giles but unless this poor king could be roused to insist or the earl of warwick fell out with his cousin i do not see much chance for the lad  is it warwick who is his chief foe or king edward asked the prioress  king edward doubtless for his fathers slaughter of young rutland at wakefield  that bodes ill said the lady  by all i gather king edward is a tiger when once roused but at other times is like that same tiger purring and slow to move  but theres a bell that warns us to vespers  they are mightily more strict here than ever we are at greystone  ah you wont tell tales sir giles  youll soon hear of me at st thomass shrine at canterbury  the knight took his leave  it was impossible not to like and pity the prioress though the life among devout nuns was clearly beyond her powers  the dreamy peaceful days of the tower of london were stirred by the arrival of the great earl of warwick the kingmaker as people already called him  he took up his residence in his own mighty establishment at warwick house near st pauls and the day after his arrival he came clanking over london bridge with a great following of knights and squires to pay his respects to king henry  henry clifford was not disposed to meet him and only watched from a window when the drawbridge was lowered and the sturdy man with grizzled hair and marked determined features rode into the gateway where he was received by the earl of oxford  the interview was long and when it was finished the two earls made the round of the defences and oxford drew up his garrison on the tower green to be inspected  when warwick had taken his leave hal was summoned to the constables hall  we must be jogging my young master he said  there are rumours of king edward making another attempt for his crown and my lord of warwick would have me go and watch the eastern seaboard  and you had best go with me  the king began hal  you will come back to the king byandby if so be he misses you but he was more dazed than ever today and perhaps it was well for warwick brought with him dick nevil who has got your lands of clifford and might be tempted to put you out of the way in one of the dungeons that lie so handy  no one save the king knows who i am said hal and he forgets from day to day all save that i am the herd boy and i think it cheers him to have me with him  i will stay beside him even as a varlet  nay my lord that may not be  tis true he loves thee but he will forget anon and i may not suffer the risk  too many know or guess  harry clifford repeated that he recked not of the risk when he could serve and comfort his beloved king and indeed his mind was made up on the subject  he had taken measures for remaining as one of the menatarms of the garrison but king henry himself surprised him by saying my young lord of clifford fare thee well  thou goest forth tomorrow with the constable of oxford  take my blessing with thee my child  thou hast been granted to me to make life very sweet to me of late and i thank god for it but the time is come that thou must part from me  oh sir never  none was ever so dear to me  for weal or woe i will be with you  suffer me to be your meanest varlet and serve you as none other can do  henry shook his head  it may not be my child let not thy blood also be on my head  go with oxford and his men  thou hast learnt to draw sword and use lance  thou wilt be serving me still if again there be which heaven forefend stricken fields in my cause or my sons  sir if i must fight let no less holy hand than thine lay knighthood on my shoulder sobbed hal kneeling  henry smiled  i have wellnigh forgotten the fashion  but if it will please thee my son give me thy sword oxford  in the name of god and st george of england i dub thee knight  for the church for the honour of god for a good cause fight  arise sir henry clifford      chapter xix  a strange easter eve    and spare o spare the meek usurpers holy headgray   once more at the close of morning service while it was still dark did harry clifford the newmade knight kneel before king henry and feel his hand in blessing on his head  then he went forth to join musgrave and the troop that the earl of oxford was leading from the tower to raise the counties of east anglia and watch the coast against a descent of king edward from the low countries  as they passed the walls enclosing the minories convent and hal gazed at it wistfully the wide gateway was opened and out came a party of blackhooded nuns mounted on ponies and mules evidently waiting till oxfords band had gone by  harry drew sir giless attention and they lingered as they became certain that they beheld the prioress selby of greystone hawk hound and all riding forth nearly smothered in her hood and not so upright as of old  ay here i am she said as he reined up and bowed his greeting here i am on my pilgrimage  i got father ridley the benedictine head to order me forth  methinks he was glad being a north countryman to send me out before i either died on the poor clares hands or gave them a fuller store of tales against us of st bennets  not but that they are good women too godly and devout for a poor wild north country selby like me who cannot live without air             o the oak and the ash and the bonny ivy tree           they flourish best at home in the north countree   flori flori whither away  ah thou hast found thine old friend birds of a feather  eh the young folk have foregathered likewise watch  and thou sir knight whither are you away  on our way to norfolk in case the duke of york should show himself on the coast  and yours reverend mother  to canterbury first by easy journeys  we sleep tonight at the tabard where we shall meet other pilgrims  here alack our way severs from yours  farewell holy mother may you find health on your pilgrimage  every breath i take in is health said the mother who had already manoeuvred an opening in her veil and gasped to throw it back as soon as she should attain an unfrequented place  there are so many coming and going here that all the air is used up by their greasy nostrils  well good luck and gods blessing go with you and you young hal i may say so far whichever side ye be but still i hold that york has the right and yours may be a saint but not a king  hal had meantime forgathered as the prioress said with anne marching in spite of his new honours close to her stirrup and venturing to whisper to her that he was now her knight and her colours which he was to wear for her were only a tiny scrap of ribbon from her glove which he cut off with his dagger and kissed saying he should wear it next his heart though he might not do so openly  their love was more implied than ever it had been before and she repeated her confidence that the kind prioress would never leave her till she had done her utmost for them both  but you my good stripling i am ashamed to see you  i have done nothing for you  i sent a humble message to ask to see the archbishop but had no answer and byandby when i stirred again who should come to sec me but young bertram selby and kinswoman said he you had best keep quiet  the archbishop hath asked me whether rumours were sooth that yours was scarce a regular priory the squire stood up for me and said as became one of the family that an outlying cell where there were ill neighbours of scots thieves borderers and the like could scarce look to be as trim as a city nunnery and that none had ever heard harm of mother agnes but then one of his priests took on him to whisper in his ear and he demanded whether we had not gone so far as to hide traitors from justice to which bertram returned a stout denial as well he might though he thought it well to give me warning but for the present there was no use in attempting anything more  the archbishop was exceedingly busy with the work of his office and the defence of london in case of edwards threatened return but he had not yet come and no one thought there was a reasonable doubt that warwick the kingmaker would not be victorious and he had carried his son inlaw the duke of clarence with him  after the cause of the red rose was won there was no fear but that the services of clifford would be remembered  so harry clifford parted with anne promising himself and her that there should be fresh clifford services winning a recognition of the de vesci inheritance if of no more  the ladies went on their way in the track which chaucer has made memorable laying their count to meet queen margaret and her son and win their ears beforehand and wondering that they came not  kentish breezes soon revived the prioress and she went through many strange devotions at the shrine of becket which it might be feared did not improve her spiritual so much as her bodily health while annes chiefly resolved themselves into prayers that harry clifford might be guarded and restored and that she herself might be saved from the dreaded lord redgrave  they did not set out on the return to london till they had inhaled plenty of sea breezes by visiting the shrine of st mildred in the isle of thanet and st eanswith at folkestone till lent had begun and the first fresh tidings that they met were that edward had landed in yorkshire but his fleet had been dispersed by storms and the people did not rise to join him so that he was fain to proclaim that he only came to assert his right to his fathers inheritance of the dukedom of york  at the minoresses convent they found that a messenger had arrived bidding anne go to meet her father at his castle in bedfordshire  he was coming over with the queen whenever she could obtain a convoy from king louis of france  lord redgrave was with him and the marriage should take place as soon as they arrived  never fear child said the prioress many is the slip between the cup and the lip  further tidings came that edward had thrown off his first plea that he had passed warwicks brother montagu at pontefract and that men from his own hereditary estates were flocking to his royal banner warwick was calling up his men in all directions and both armies were advancing on london  then it was known that false fleeting perjured clarence had deserted his fatherinlaw and returned to his brother and worthless as he individually was it boded ill for lancaster though still hope continued in the uniform success of the kingmaker  warwick was about twenty miles in advance of edward till that king actually passed him and reached the town of warwick itself still the earl wrote to his brother that if he could only hold out london for fortyeight hours all would be well  once more poor king henry was set on horseback and paraded through the streets  brother martin went out with the chaplain of the poor clares to gaze upon him and they came back declaring that he was more than ever like the image carried in a procession seeming quite as helpless and indifferent except said brother martin when he passed a church and then a heavenly look came over his still features as he bowed his head but none of the crowd who came out to gaze cried save king harry or god bless him  there were two or three thousand yorkists in the various sanctuaries of london and they were preparing to rise in favour of their king edward and only a few hundred were mustering in st pauls churchyard for the red rose  the poor clares were in much terror though nunneries and religious houses and indeed noncombatants in general were usually respected by each side in these wars but the prioress of greystone was not sorry that the summons to her protegee called her party off on the way to bedfordshire and they all set forward together intending to make master lorimers household at chipping barnet their first stage as they had engaged to do  their intention had been notified to lorimers people in his london shop who had sent on word to their master and the good man came out to meet them full of surprise at the valour of the ladies in attempting the journey  but they could not possibly go further king edward was at st albans and was on his way to london and the earl of warwick was coming up from dunstable with the earls of somerset and oxford  for ladies even of religious orders to ride on between the two hosts was manifestly impossible and he and his wife were delighted to entertain the lady prioress till the roads should be safe  the prioress was nothing loth  she always enjoyed the freedom of a secular household and she was glad to remain within hearing of the last news in this great crisis of york and lancaster  i marvel if there will be a battle she said  never have i had the good luck to see or hear one  oh  mother are you not afraid cried sister mabel  afraid  what should i be afraid of silly maid  do you think the menatarms are wolves to snap you up  and murmured anne we shall know how it goes with my lord of oxfords people  these were the last days of lent and were carefully kept in the matter of food by the household but the religious observances were much disturbed by the tidings that poured in  king henry and archbishop nevil had taken refuge in the house of bishop kemp of london urswick the recorder with the consent of the aldermen had opened the gates to edward and the good friday services at barnet the psalms and prayers in the church were disturbed by menatarms galloping to and fro and reports coming in continually  there could be no going out to gather flowers to deck the church the next day for king edward was on the london side and warwick with his army had reached the low hills of hadley and their tents their banners and the glint of their armour might be seen over the heathy slope between them and the lanes and fields surrounded by hedges that fenced in the valley of barnet  the little town itself though lying between the two armies remained unoccupied by either party and only menatarms came down into it not as plunderers but to buy food  warwicks cannon however thundered all night a very awful sound to such unaccustomed ears but they were so directed that the charges flew far away from barnet under a false impression as to the situation of the yorkist forces  mistress lorimer had heard them before but accompanied every report with a pious prayer sister mabel screamed at each then joined in the prioress was greatly excited and walked about with master lorimer now on the roof trying to see now at the gate trying to hear  anne fancied it meant victory to hals party but knelt tried to pray while she listened and the dogs barked incessantly  and that hal must be in the army above the little town they guessed for in the evening watch came floundering into the courtyard hungry and muddy but full of affectionate recognition of his old friends and the quarters he had learnt to know  florimond who happened to be loose had a romp with him in their old fashion and to the vexation and alarm of his mistress they both ran off together and must have gone hunting on the heath for there was no response to her silver whistle     chapter xx  barnet    a dead hush fell but when the dolorous day grew drearier toward twilight falling came a bitter wind clear from the north and blew the mist asidetennyson   and sir henry clifford  still he was hal of derwentdale for the perilous usurper sir richard nevil was known to be continually with warwick and musgrave was convinced that the concealment was safest  the youth then remained with the peelholm men and became a good deal more practised in warlike affairs and accustomed to campaigning during the three months when oxford was watching the eastern coast on this easter night he lay down on the hillside with watch beside him his shepherds plaid round him his heart rising as he thought himself near upon gaining fame and honour wherewith to win his early love and winning victory and safety for his beloved king or rather his hermit  for as his hermit did that mild unearthly face always come before him  he could not think of it wearing that golden crown which seemed alien to it but rather as he lay on his back after his old habit looking up at the stars either he saw and recognised the northern crown or his dazed and sleepy fancy wove a radiant coronet of stars above that meek countenance that he knew and loved so well and as at intervals the cannon boomed and wakened him he looked on at the bright northern cross and dreamily linked together the cross and crown  easter sunday morning came dawning but no one looked to see the sun dance even if the morning had not been dull and grey a thick fog covering everything but through it came a dull and heavy sound and the clang of armour  even by their own force the radiant star of the de veres could hardly be seen on the banner as the earl of oxford rode up and down putting his men in battle array  hal was on foot as an archer meaning to deserve the spurs that he had not yet worn the hosts were close to one another and at first only the continual rain of arrows darkened the air but as the sun rose and the two armies saw one another oxfords star was to be seen carried into the very midst of the opposing force under lord hastings  on on with cries of victory the knights rode the archers ran across the heath carrying all before them never doubting that the day was theirs but not knowing where they were till trumpets sounded halt was called and they were drawn up together as best they might round their leading star  but as they advanced behold there was an unexpected shout of treason  arrows came thickly on them menatarms bearing warwicks ragged staff came thundering headlong upon them  treason treason echoed on all sides and with that sound in his ears harry clifford was cut down and fell under a huge horse and man and lay senseless under a gorsebush  he knew no more but that horses and men seemed for ever trampling over him and treading him down and then all was lost to himfor how long he knew not but for one second he was roused so far as to hear a furious growling and barking of watch but with dazed senses he thought it was over the sheep tried to raise himself could not thought himself dying and sank back again  the next thing he knew was here master lorimer you know this gear better than i unfasten this buff coat  there he can breathe drink this my lad  it was the prioresss voice  he felt a jolt as of a waggon and opened his eyes  it was dark but he knew he was under the tilt of lorimers waggon which was moving on  the prioress was kneeling over him on one side lorimer on the other and his head was on a soft lapnay a warm tear dropped on his face a sweet though stifled voice said is he truly better  then came sounds of hushing yet of reassurance and when there was a halt and clearer consciousness began to revive while kind hands were busy about him and a cordial was poured down his throat by the light of a lantern cautiously shown hal found speech to say as he felt a long soft tongue on his face watch watch is it thou man  ay watch it is said the prioress  well may you thank him  it is to him you owe all and to my good florimond  but whathowwhere am i asked hal trying to look round but feeling sharp thrills and shoots of pain at every motion  lie still till they bring their bandages and i will tell you gently nan gentlythy sobs shake him  but as he managed to hold and press annes hand the prioress went on you are in good lorimers warehouse  safer thus though it is too odorous for the men of york do not respect sanctuary in the hour of victory  the word roused hal further  the victory was ours he said  we had driven hastings banner off the field  say was there a cry of treason  even so my son  so far as master lorimer understands lord oxfords banner of the beaming star was mistaken for the sun of york and the men of warwick turned on you as you came back from the chase but all was utter confusion  no one knows who was staunch and who not and the fields and lanes are full of blood and slaughtered men and edwards royal banner is set up on the market cross and trumpets were sounding round it  and here come master lorimer and the goodwife to bind these wounds  but sir giles musgrave still asked hal  belike fled with lord oxford and his men who all made off at the cry of treason was the answer  lorimer returned with his wife and various appliances and likewise with fresh tidings  there was no doubt that the brothers warwick and montagu had been slain  they had been foundwarwick under a hedge impeded by his heavy armour and montagu on the field itself   each body had been thrown over a horse and shown at the market cross and they would be carried to london on the morrow  and so end said lorimer two brave and openhanded gentlemen as ever lived with whom i have had many friendly dealings  one thing more hal longed to hearnamely how he had been saved  he remembered that watch had come back to him with florimond the evening before  they had probably been hunting together and the hound who had always been very fond of him on the journey had accompanied watch to his side before going back to his chain in barnet but he had lost sight of them in the morning and regretted that he could not find watch to provide for his safety  he knew he said by the presence of florimond who must be in barnet  and he also had a dim recollection of being licked by watchs tongue as he lay and likewise of hearing a furious barking yelling and growling whether of one or both dogs he was not sure  it seemed that towards the evening when the battlecries had grown fainter and the sun was going down florimond had burst in on his mistress panting and bloodstainedbut not with his own blood as was soon ascertainedand made vehement demonstrations by which as a true doglover the prioress perceived that he wanted her to follow him  and anne who thought she saw a piece of hals plaid caught in his collar was neither to have nor to hold as the mother said till master lorimer was found and entreated to follow the hound ay and to take them with him  he demurred much as to their safety but the prioress declared that it was the part of the religious to take care of the wounded and not inconsistent with her vow  see the sisters of st katharines of the tower  and though her interpretation was a broad one and would have shocked alike her own abbess and her of the minoresses he was fain to accept it in such a cause but he commanded his waggoners to bring the wain in the rear both as an excuse and a possible protection for the ladies and it might be a conveyance for the wounded  florimond who had sprung about barked fawned and made entreating sounds all this time longer in narrative than in reality led them not through the central field of slaughter but somewhat to the left among the heathwhere in fact oxford had lost his way in the fog and his own allies had charged him but had not followed far beyond the place of hals fall discovering the fatal error that spread confusion through their ranks where everyone distrusted his fellow leader  there after a weary and perilous way diversified by the horrid shouts of plunderers of the slain happily not near at hand and when lorimer but for the ladies would have given up the quest as useless they were greeted by watchs bark and found him lying with his fine head alert and ready over his senseless master  there was no doubt but that the two good creatures both powerful and formidable animals must have saved him from the spoilers and then been sagacious enough to let the hound go down to fetch assistance while the sheepdog remained as his masters faithful guardian  how honoured and caressed they were can hardly be described but all will know  the joy and gratitude of knowing of annes devotion and the pleasure of his good dogs faithfulness helped hal through the painful process of having his hurts dealt with  surgeons even barbers were fully occupied and lorimer did not wish to have it known that a lancastrian was in his house  his wife and her old nurse as well as the prioress had some knowledge of simple practical surgery and hals disasters proved to be a severe cut on the head a slash on the shoulder various bruises and a broken rib and thighbone all which were within their capabilities with assistance from the masters stronger hand  no one could tell whether the savage nature of the york brothers might not slake their revenge in a general massacre of their antagonists so lorimer caused hals bed to be made in the waggon in the warehouse where he was safe from detection until the victorious army should have quitted barnet     chapter xxi  tewkesbury    the last shoot of that ancient tree was budding fair as fair might be   its buds they crop   its branches lop then leave the sapless stem to die                         sophocles anstice   harry clifford lay fevered and knowing little of what passed for several days only murmuring sometimes of his flock at home sometimes of the royal hermit and sometimes in distress of the men atarms with whom he had been thrown and whose habits and language had plainly been a great shock to his innocent mind trained by the company of the sheep and the hermit  he took the prioresss hand for goodwife dollys but he generally knew anne who could soothe him better than any other  master lorimer was fully occupied by combatants who came to have their equipments renewed or repaired and he spent the days in his shop in london but rode home in the long evenings with his budget of news  king henry was in the tower again as passive as ever but on the very day of the battle of barnet queen margaret had landed at weymouth with her son and the war would be renewed in somersetshire  search for prisoners being over at barnet hal was removed to the guest chamber of his hosts where he lay in a huge square bed and in the better air began to recover understand what was going on round him and be anxious for his friends especially sir giles musgrave and simon bunce  the ladies still attended to him as lorimer pronounced the journey to be absolutely unsafe while so many soldiers disbanded or on their way to the queens army were roaming about and the burgundians brought by edward might not be respectful to an english prioress  it was safer to wait for tidings from lord st john which were certain to come either from bletso or the minoresses  so may had begun when lorimer hurried home with the tidings that a messenger had come in haste from king edward from the battlefield of tewkesbury with the tidings of a complete victory  prince edward the fair and spirited hope of lancaster was slain somerset and his friends had taken sanctuary in the abbey church queen margaret and the young wife of the prince in a small convent and beyond all had been flight and slaughter  for a few days no more was known but then came fuller and sadder tidings  the young prince had been brutally slain by his cousins edward george and richard excited as they were to tigerlike ferocity by the late revolt  the nobles in the sanctuary who had for one night been protected by a cord drawn in front of them by a priest had in the morning been dragged out and beheaded  among them was annes father lord st john of bletso and on the field the heralds had recognised the corpse of her suitor lord redgrave  to expect that anne felt any acute sorrow for a father whom she had never seen since she was six years old and who then had never seemed to care for her was not possible  and what was to be her fate  her young brother the heir of bletso was in flanders with his foreign mother and she knew not what might be her own claims through her own mother though the prioress and master lorimer knew that it could be ascertained through the seneschal at bletso if he had not perished with his lord or the agents at york through whom annes pension had been paid  if she were an heiress she would become a ward of the crown a dreary prospect for it meant to be disposed of to some unknown minion of the court     chapter xxii  the nutbrown maid    all my wellfare to trouble and care   should change if you were gone for in my mynde of all mankind   i love but you alonenutbrown maid   anne st john in her doul or deep mourning sat by hals couch or daybed in tears as he lay in the deep bay of the mullioned window and told him of the consultation that had been held  ah dear lady he said now am i grieved that i have not mine own to endow you with  well would i remain the landless shepherd were it not for you  nay she said looking up through her tears and wherefore should i not share your shepherds lot  you  nan sweet nan tenderly nurtured in the convent while i have ever lived as a rough hardy shepherd  and i have ever been a moorland maid she answered bred to no soft ways  i know not how to be the lady of a castlei shall be a much better herdsmans wife like your good old dolly whom i have always loved and envied  you never saw us snowed up in winter with all things scarce and hardly able to milk a goat  have not we been snowed up at greystone for five weeks at a time  ay but with thick walls round and a stack of peat at hand said hal his heart beating violently as more and more he felt that the maiden did not speak in jest but in full earnestness of love  verily one would deem you took me for a fine dainty dame such as i saw at the minoresses shivering at the least gust of fresh wind and not daring to wet their satin shoes if there had been a shower of rain in the cloisters  were we not all stifled within the walls and never breathed till we were out of them  nay hal there is none to come between us now  take me to your moors and hills  i will be your good housewife and shepherdess and make you such a home  and you will teach me of the stars and of the flowers and all the holy lore of your good royal hermit  ah my hermit my master how fares it with him  would that i could go and see  which do you love bestme or the hermit asked anne archly lifting up her head which was lying on his shoulder  i love you mine own love and sweetheart with all my heart he said regaining her hand but my king and master with my soul and oh that i had any strength to give him  i love him as my master in holy things and as my true prince and what would i not give to know how it is with him and how he bears these dreadful tidings  he bent his head choking with sobs as he spoke and anne wept with him her momentary jealousy subdued by the picture of the lonely prisoner his friends slain in his cause and his only child cut off in early prime but she tried the comfort of hoping that his queen would be with him  thus talking now of love now of grief now of the future now of the past the prioress found them and as she was inclined to blame anne for letting her patient weep the maiden looked up to her and said dear mother we are disputingi want this same hal to wed me so soon as he can stand and walk  then i would go home with him to derwentside and take care of him  the prioress burst out laughing  make porridge milk the ewes and spin their wool  eh  meet work for a barons daughter  so i tell her said harry  she knows not how hard the life is  do i not said anne  have i not spent a night and day the happiest my childhood knew in your hut  has it not been a dream of joy ever since  ay a summers dream said hal  tell her the folly of it  i verily believe he does not want me  if he had not a lame leg i trow he would be trying to be mewed up with his king  it would be my duty murmured hal nor should i love thee the less  tis a duty beyond your reach said the prioress  master lorimer hears that none have access to king henry god help him and he sits as in a trance as though he understood and took heed of nothingnot even of this last sore battle  god aid him  aye and his converse is with him said hal with a gush of tears  he minds nought of earth not even earthly griefs  but we we are of earth still and have our years before us said anne and i will not spend mine the dreary lady of a dull castle either i will back and take my vows in your priory reverend mother if hal there disdains to have me  nan nan when you know that all i dread is to have you mewed behind a wall of snow as thick as the walls of the tower and freezing to the bone  with you behind it telling all the tales  mother prithee prove to him that i am not made of sugar like the clares but that i love a fresh wind and the open moorlands  the prioress laughed and took her away but in private the maiden convinced her that the proposal however wild was in full earnest and not in utter ignorance of the way of life that was preferred  afterwards the good lady discussed it with the lorimers  for my part she said i see nought to gainsay the children having their way  they are equal in birth and breeding and love one another heartily and the times may turn about to bring them to their own proper station  but the hardness and the roughness of the life objected mistress lorimer for a dainty conventbred lady  my conventgod forgive meis not like the poor clares  we knew there what cold and hunger mean as well as what free air and mountains are  moreover though the maid thinks not of it i do not believe the life will be so bare and comfortless  the lads mother hath not let him want and there is a heritage through the vescis that must come to him even if he never can claim the lands of clifford  and now that all lancaster is gone king edward may be less vindictive against the red rose said lorimer  there must be a dowry secured to the maid said the prioress  let them only lie quiet for a time till the remains of the late tempest have blown over and all will be well with them  ay and master lorimer the lady threlkeld as well as myself will fully acquit ourselves of the heavy charges you have been put to for your hospitality to us  master lorimer disclaimed all save his delight in the honour paid to his poor house and appealed to his wife who seconded him courteously though perhaps the expenses of a wounded knight three nuns a noble damsel and their horses were felt by her enough to make the promise gratifying  while the elders talked a horseman was heard in the court asking whether the young demoiselle of bletso were lodged there  it was the seneschal wenlock who had come with what might be called the official report of his lords death and to consider of the disposal of the young lady being glad to find the prioress of greystone to whom she had originally been committed by her father  before summoning her he explained to the prioress that a small estate which had belonged to her mother devolved upon her  the proceeds of the property were not large but they had been sufficient to keep her at the convent on the moderate charges of the time anne was only eighteen and at no time of their lives were women even widows reckoned able to dispose of themselves  she would naturally become a ward of the crown and lord redgrave having been killed the seneschal was about to go and inform king edward of the situation  but said the prioress suppose you found her already betrothed to a gentleman of equal birth and with claims to an even greater inheritance  would you not be silent till the match was concluded and the king had no chance of breaking it  if it were well for the maids honour and fortune said the seneschal  if you reverend mother have found a fair marriage for her it might be better to let well alone  then the prioress set forth the situation and claims of young clifford and the certainty that even if it were more prudent not to advance them at present yet the ruin of the house of nevil removed one great barrier and at least the vesci inheritance held by his mother must come to him and she was the more likely to make a portion over to him when she found that he had married nobly  the seneschal acquiesced even though the prioress confessed that the betrothal had not actually taken place  in fact he was relieved that the maiden whom he had known as a fair child should be off his hands and secured from the greed of some yorkist partisan needing a reward  when anne her dark eyes and hair shaded by her mourning veil came down and had heard his greeting with such details of her fathers death and the state of the family as he could give her she rose and said sir there have been passages between sir harry clifford and myself and i would wed none other than him  nor did the seneschal gainsay her  all that he desired was that what was decided upon should be done quickly before heralds or lawyers brought to the knowledge of the woodvilles that there was any sort of prize to be had in the damsel of st john and he went off early the next morning back to bletso that he might seem to know nothing of the matter  the prioress laughed at men being so much more afraid than women she was willing to bear all the consequences but then the plantagenets were not in the habit of treating ladies as traitors however all agreed that it would be wiser to be out of reach of london as soon as possible and master lorimer who had become deeply interested in this romance of true love arranged to send one of his wains to york in which the bride and bridegroom might travel unsuspected until the latter should be able to ride and all were out of reach of pursuit  the prioress would go thus far with them and then  and then she said sighing i shall have to dree my penance for all my friskings  but oh what kindly friskings cried anne throwing herself into those tender arms  little they will reck of kindness out of rule sighed the prioress if only they will send me back to greystone then shall i hear of thee and thou hadst better take florimond poor hound or the sisters at york may put him to penance too  henry clifford was able to walk again though still lame when in the early morning of ascension day he and anne st john were married in the hall of master lorimers house by a trusty priest of barnet and in the afternoon when the thanksgiving worship at the church had been gone through they started in the waggon for the first stage of the journey to be overtaken at the haltingplace by the prioress and master lorimer who had had to ride into london to finish some business  and he brought tidings that rendered that weddingday one of mournful if peaceful remembrances  for he had seen borne from the tower along cheapside the bier on which lay the body of king henry his hands clasped on his breast his white face upturned with that heavenly expression which hal knew so well enhanced into perfect peace every toil every grief at an end  whether blood dropped as the procession moved along lorimer could not certainly tell  whether so it was or whoever shed it there was no marring the absolute rest and joy that had crowned the meek usurpers holy head after his dreary halfcentury of suffering under the retribution of the ancestral sins of two lines of forefathers  all had been undergone in a deep and holy trust and faith such as could render even his hereditary insanity an actual shield from the poignancy of grief  tears were shed not bitter nor vengeful  such thoughts would have seemed out of place with the memory of the gentle countenance of love goodwill and peace and as harry and anne joined in the service that the prioress had requested to have in the early daylight before starting hal felt that to the hermit saint of his boyhood he verily owed his own self     chapter xxiii  brougham castle    and now am i an earlis son and not a banished mannutbrown maid   that journey northward in the long summer days was a honeymoon to the young couple  the prioress left them as much to themselves as possible trying to rejoice fully in their gladness and not to think what might have been hers but for that vow of her parents keeping her hours diligently in preparation for the stricter rule awaiting her  when they parted she sent florimond with them to be restored if she were allowed to return to greystone and anne parted with her with many tears as the truest mother and friend she had ever known  by this time harry was able to ride and the two with a couple of menatarms hired as escort made their way over the moors harrys head throbbing with gladness as with a shout of joy he hailed his own mountainheads helvellyn and saddleback in all their purple cloudlike majesty  they agreed first to go to dollys homestead drawn as much by affection as by prudence  delight it was to hal to point out the rocks and bushes of his home but when he came in sight of piers and the sheep the dumb boy broke out into a cry of terror and rushed away headlong nor did he turn till he felt watchs very substantial paws bounding on him in ecstasy  watch was indeed a forerunner for dolly and her husband could scarcely be induced by his solid presence and caresses to come out and see for themselves that the tall knight and lady were no ghostly shades nor bewildered travellers but that this was their own nursling hal whom simon bunce had reported to be lying dead under a gorsebush at barnet and further that the lovely brunette lady was the little lost child whom dolly had mothered for a night  while the happy goodwife was regaling them with the best she had to offer hob set forth to announce their arrival at threlkeld being not certain what the cautious sir lancelot would deem advisable since the lancaster race had perished and york was in the ascendant  there was a long time to wait but finally sir lancelot himself came riding through the wood no longer afraid to welcome his stepson at the castle and the more willing since the bride newly arrived was no maiden of low degree but a damsel of equal birth and with unquestioned rights  so all was well and the lady no longer had to embrace her son in fear and trembling but to see him a handsome and thoughtful young man well able to take his place in her halls  since he had been actually in arms against king edward it was not thought safe to assert his claims to his fathers domains but the lady gave up to him a portion of her own inheritance from the vescis where he and anne were able to live in barden tower in yorkshire not far from bolton abbey  so hals shepherd days were over though he still loved country habits and ways  hob came to be once more his attendant dolly was annes bowerwoman and simon bunce sir harrys squire though he never ceased blaming himself for having left his master dead as he thought when even a poor hound was more trusty  florimond was restored to the prioress who was reinstated at greystone a graver woman than before she had set forth the better for having watched deeper devotion at the minoresses and still more for the terrible realities of the battle of barnet  at bolton abbey harry found monks who encouraged his craving for information on natural science and could carry him on much farther in these researches than his hermit though he always maintained that the royal anchorite and prisoner saw farther into heavenly things than any other whom he had known and that his soul and insight rose the higher with his outward troubles and bodily decay  so peacefully went the world with them till henry was oneandthirty and then the tidings of bosworth field came north  the great tragedy of plantagenet was complete and the ambitious and bloodstained house of york who had avenged the usurpation of henry of lancaster had perished chiefly by the hands of each other and the distantly related descendant of john of gaunt henry tudor triumphed  the threlkelds were not slow to recollect that it was time for the cliffords to show their heads moreover that the st johns of bletso were related to the tudors  though now an aged woman she descended from her hills called upon her son and his wife with their little nineyearold son to come with her and pay homage to the new sovereign in their own names and rode with them to westminster  there a very different monarch from the saint of harrys memory received and favoured him  the lands of westmoreland were granted to him as his right and on their return master lorimer coming by special invitation the family were welcomed at brougham castle the cradle of their race where harry clifford no longer an outlaw began the career thus described             love had he found in huts where poor men lie             his daily teachers had been woods and rills           the silence that is in the starry sky             the sleep that is among the lonely hills            in him the savage virtue of the race             revenge and all ferocious thoughts were dead           nor did he change but kept in lofty place             the wisdom that adversity had bred            glad were the vales and every cottage hearth             the shepherd lord was honoured more and more           and ages after he was laid in earth             the good lord clifford was the name he bore    finis
