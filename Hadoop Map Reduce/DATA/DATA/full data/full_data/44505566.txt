44505566	mrs lirripers legacy   chapter imrs lirriper relates how she went on and went over   ah  its pleasant to drop into my own easychair my dear though a little palpitating what with trotting upstairs and what with trotting down and why kitchen stairs should all be corner stairs is for the builders to justify though i do not think they fully understand their trade and never did else why the sameness and why not more conveniences and fewer draughts and likewise making a practice of laying the plaster on too thick i am well convinced which holds the damp and as to chimneypots putting them on by guesswork like hats at a party and no more knowing what their effect will be upon the smoke bless you than i do if so much except that it will mostly be either to send it down your throat in a straight form or give it a twist before it goes there  and what i says speaking as i find of those new metal chimneys all manner of shapes theres a row of em at miss wozenhams lodginghouse lower down on the other side of the way is that they only work your smoke into artificial patterns for you before you swallow it and that id quite as soon swallow mine plain the flavour being the same not to mention the conceit of putting up signs on the top of your house to show the forms in which you take your smoke into your inside  being here before your eyes my dear in my own easychair in my own quiet room in my own lodginghouse number eightyone norfolk street strand london situated midway between the city and st jamessif anything is where it used to be with these hotels calling themselves limited but called unlimited by major jackman rising up everywhere and rising up into flagstaffs where they cant go any higher but my mind of those monsters is give me a landlords or landladys wholesome face when i come off a journey and not a brass plate with an electrified number clicking out of it which its not in nature can be glad to see me and to which i dont want to be hoisted like molasses at the docks and left there telegraphing for help with the most ingenious instruments but quite in vainbeing here my dear i have no call to mention that i am still in the lodgings as a business hoping to die in the same and if agreeable to the clergy partly read over at saint clements danes and concluded in hatfield churchyard when lying once again by my poor lirriper ashes to ashes and dust to dust  neither should i tell you any news my dear in telling you that the major is still a fixture in the parlours quite as much so as the roof of the house and that jemmy is of boys the best and brightest and has ever had kept from him the cruel story of his poor pretty young mother mrs edson being deserted in the second floor and dying in my arms fully believing that i am his born gran and him an orphan though what with engineering since he took a taste for it and him and the major making locomotives out of parasols broken iron pots and cottonreels and them absolutely a getting off the line and falling over the table and injuring the passengers almost equal to the originals it really is quite wonderful and when i says to the major major cant you by any means give us a communication with the guard the major says quite huffy no madam its not to be done and when i says why not the major says that is between us who are in the railway interest madam and our friend the right honourable vicepresident of the board of trade and if youll believe me my dear the major wrote to jemmy at school to consult him on the answer i should have before i could get even that amount of unsatisfactoriness out of the man the reason being that when we first began with the little model and the working signals beautiful and perfect being in general as wrong as the real and when i says laughing what appointment am i to hold in this undertaking gentlemen jemmy hugs me round the neck and tells me dancing you shall be the public gran and consequently they put upon me just as much as ever they like and i sit a growling in my easychair  my dear whether it is that a grown man as clever as the major cannot give half his heart and mind to anythingeven a playthingbut must get into right down earnest with it whether it is so or whether it is not so i do not undertake to say but jemmy is far outdone by the serious and believing ways of the major in the management of the united grand junction lirriper and jackman great norfolk parlour line for says my jemmy with the sparkling eyes when it was christened we must have a whole mouthful of name gran or our dear old public and there the young rogue kissed me wont stump up  so the public took the sharesten at ninepence and immediately when that was spent twelve preference at one and sixpenceand they were all signed by jemmy and countersigned by the major and between ourselves much better worth the money than some shares i have paid for in my time  in the same holidays the line was made and worked and opened and ran excursions and had collisions and burst its boilers and all sorts of accidents and offences all most regular correct and pretty  the sense of responsibility entertained by the major as a military style of stationmaster my dear starting the down train behind time and ringing one of those little bells that you buy with the little coalscuttles off the tray round the mans neck in the street did him honour but noticing the major of a night when he is writing out his monthly report to jemmy at school of the state of the rolling stock and the permanent way and all the rest of it the whole kept upon the majors sideboard and dusted with his own hands every morning before varnishing his boots i notice him as full of thought and care as full can be and frowning in a fearful manner but indeed the major does nothing by halves as witness his great delight in going out surveying with jemmy when he has jemmy to go with carrying a chain and a measuringtape and driving i dont know what improvements right through westminster abbey and fully believed in the streets to be knocking everything upside down by act of parliament  as please heaven will come to pass when jemmy takes to that as a profession  mentioning my poor lirriper brings into my head his own youngest brother the doctor though doctor of what i am sure it would be hard to say unless liquor for neither physic nor music nor yet law does joshua lirriper know a morsel of except continually being summoned to the county court and having orders made upon him which he runs away from and once was taken in the passage of this very house with an umbrella up and the majors hat on giving his name with the doormat round him as sir johnson jones kcb in spectacles residing at the horse guards  on which occasion he had got into the house not a minute before through the girl letting him on the mat when he sent in a piece of paper twisted more like one of those spills for lighting candles than a note offering me the choice between thirty shillings in hand and his brains on the premises marked immediate and waiting for an answer  my dear it gave me such a dreadful turn to think of the brains of my poor dear lirripers own flesh and blood flying about the new oilcloth however unworthy to be so assisted that i went out of my room here to ask him what he would take once for all not to do it for life when i found him in the custody of two gentlemen that i should have judged to be in the featherbed trade if they had not announced the law so fluffy were their personal appearance  bring your chains sir says joshua to the littlest of the two in the biggest hat rivet on my fetters  imagine my feelings when i pictered him clanking up norfolk street in irons and miss wozenham looking out of window  gentlemen i says all of a tremble and ready to drop please to bring him into major jackmans apartments  so they brought him into the parlours and when the major spies his own curly brimmed hat on him which joshua lirriper had whipped off its peg in the passage for a military disguise he goes into such a tearing passion that he tips it off his head with his hand and kicks it up to the ceiling with his foot where it grazed long afterwards  major i says be cool and advise me what to do with joshua my dead and gone lirripers own youngest brother  madam says the major my advice is that you board and lodge him in a powder mill with a handsome gratuity to the proprietor when exploded  major i says as a christian you cannot mean your words madam says the major by the lord i do and indeed the major besides being with all his merits a very passionate man for his size had a bad opinion of joshua on account of former troubles even unattended by liberties taken with his apparel  when joshua lirriper hears this conversation betwixt us he turns upon the littlest one with the biggest hat and says come sir  remove me to my vile dungeon  where is my mouldy straw  my dear at the picter of him rising in my mind dressed almost entirely in padlocks like baron trenck in jemmys book i was so overcome that i burst into tears and i says to the major major take my keys and settle with these gentlemen or i shall never know a happy minute more which was done several times both before and since but still i must remember that joshua lirriper has his good feelings and shows them in being always so troubled in his mind when he cannot wear mourning for his brother  many a long year have i left off my widows mourning not being wishful to intrude but the tender point in joshua that i cannot help a little yielding to is when he writes one single sovereign would enable me to wear a decent suit of mourning for my muchloved brother  i vowed at the time of his lamented death that i would ever wear sables in memory of him but alas how shortsighted is man how keep that vow when penniless  it says a good deal for the strength of his feelings that he couldnt have been seven year old when my poor lirriper died and to have kept to it ever since is highly creditable  but we know theres good in all of usif we only knew where it was in some of usand though it was far from delicate in joshua to work upon the dear childs feelings when first sent to school and write down into lincolnshire for his pocket money by return of post and got it still he is my poor lirripers own youngest brother and mightnt have meant not paying his bill at the salisbury arms when his affection took him down to stay a fortnight at hatfield churchyard and might have meant to keep sober but for bad company  consequently if the major had played on him with the garden engine which he got privately into his room without my knowing of it i think that much as i should have regretted it there would have been words betwixt the major and me  therefore my dear though he played on mr buffle by mistake being hot in his head and though it might have been misrepresented down at wozenhams into not being ready for mr buffle in other respects he being the assessed taxes still i do not so much regret it as perhaps i ought  and whether joshua lirriper will yet do well in life i cannot say but i did hear of his coming out at a private theatre in the character of a bandit without receiving any offers afterwards from the regular managers  mentioning mr baffle gives an instance of there being good in persons where good is not expected for it cannot be denied that mr buffles manners when engaged in his business were not agreeable  to collect is one thing and to look about as if suspicious of the goods being gradually removing in the dead of the night by a back door is another over taxing you have no control but suspecting is voluntary  allowances too must ever be made for a gentleman of the majors warmth not relishing being spoke to with a pen in the mouth and while i do not know that it is more irritable to my own feelings to have a lowcrowned hat with a broad brim kept on in doors than any other hat still i can appreciate the majors besides which without bearing malice or vengeance the major is a man that scores up arrears as his habit always was with joshua lirriper so at last my dear the major lay in wait for mr buffle and it worrited me a good deal  mr buffle gives his rap of two sharp knocks one day and the major bounces to the door  collector has called for two quarters assessed taxes says mr buffle  they are ready for him says the major and brings him in here  but on the way mr buffle looks about him in his usual suspicious manner and the major fires and asks him do you see a ghost sir  no sir says mr buffle  because i have before noticed you says the major apparently looking for a spectre very hard beneath the roof of my respected friend  when you find that supernatural agent be so good as point him out sir  mr buffle stares at the major and then nods at me  mrs lirriper sir says the major going off into a perfect steam and introducing me with his hand  pleasure of knowing her says mr buffle  ahumjemmy jackman sir says the major introducing himself  honour of knowing you by sight says mr buffle jemmy jackman sir says the major wagging his head sideways in a sort of obstinate fury presents to you his esteemed friend that lady mrs emma lirriper of eightyone norfolk street strand london in the county of middlesex in the united kingdom of great britain and ireland  upon which occasion sir says the major jemmy jackman takes your hat off  mr buffle looks at his hat where the major drops it on the floor and he picks it up and puts it on again  sir says the major very red and looking him full in the face there are two quarters of the gallantry taxes due and the collector has called  upon which if you can believe my words my dear the major drops mr buffles hat off again  this mr buffle begins very angry with his pen in his mouth when the major steaming more and more says take your bit out sir  or by the whole infernal system of taxation of this country and every individual figure in the national debt ill get upon your back and ride you like a horse which its my belief he would have done and even actually jerking his neat little legs ready for a spring as it was  this says mr buffle without his pen is an assault and ill have the law of you  sir replies the major if you are a man of honour your collector of whatever may be due on the honourable assessment by applying to major jackman at the parlours mrs lirripers lodgings may obtain what he wants in full at any moment  when the major glared at mr buffle with those meaning words my dear i literally gasped for a teaspoonful of salvolatile in a wineglass of water and i says pray let it go no farther gentlemen i beg and beseech of you  but the major could be got to do nothing else but snort long after mr buffle was gone and the effect it had upon my whole mass of blood when on the next day of mr buffles rounds the major spruced himself up and went humming a tune up and down the street with one eye almost obliterated by his hat there are not expressions in johnsons dictionary to state  but i safely put the street door on the jar and got behind the majors blinds with my shawl on and my mind made up the moment i saw danger to rush out screeching till my voice failed me and catch the major round the neck till my strength went and have all parties bound  i had not been behind the blinds a quarter of an hour when i saw mr buffle approaching with his collectingbooks in his hand  the major likewise saw him approaching and hummed louder and himself approached  they met before the airy railings  the major takes off his hat at arms length and says mr buffle i believe  mr buffle takes off his hat at arms length and says that is my name sir  says the major have you any commands for me mr buffle  says mr buffle not any sir  then my dear both of em bowed very low and haughty and parted and whenever mr buffle made his rounds in future him and the major always met and bowed before the airy railings putting me much in mind of hamlet and the other gentleman in mourning before killing one another though i could have wished the other gentleman had done it fairer and even if less polite no poison  mr buffles family were not liked in this neighbourhood for when you are a householder my dear youll find it does not come by nature to like the assessed and it was considered besides that a onehorse pheayton ought not to have elevated mrs buffle to that height especially when purloined from the taxes which i myself did consider uncharitable  but they were not liked and there was that domestic unhappiness in the family in consequence of their both being very hard with miss buffle and one another on account of miss buffles favouring mr buffles articled young gentleman that it was whispered that miss buffle would go either into a consumption or a convent she being so very thin and off her appetite and two closeshaved gentlemen with white bands round their necks peeping round the corner whenever she went out in waistcoats resembling black pinafores  so things stood towards mr buffle when one night i was woke by a frightful noise and a smell of burning and going to my bedroom window saw the whole street in a glow  fortunately we had two sets empty just then and before i could hurry on some clothes i heard the major hammering at the attics doors and calling out dress yourselvesfire  dont be frightenedfire  collect your presence of mindfire  all rightfire most tremenjously  as i opened my bedroom door the major came tumbling in over himself and me and caught me in his arms  major i says breathless where is it  i dont know dearest madam says the majorfire  jemmy jackman will defend you to the last drop of his bloodfire  if the dear boy was at home what a treat this would be for himfire and altogether very collected and bold except that he couldnt say a single sentence without shaking me to the very centre with roaring fire  we ran down to the drawingroom and put our heads out of window and the major calls to an unfeeling young monkey scampering by be joyful and ready to split where is itfire the monkey answers without stopping o heres a lark  old buffles been setting his house alight to prevent its being found out that he boned the taxes  hurrah  fire  and then the sparks came flying up and the smoke came pouring down and the crackling of flames and spatting of water and banging of engines and hacking of axes and breaking of glass and knocking at doors and the shouting and crying and hurrying and the heat and altogether gave me a dreadful palpitation  dont be frightened dearest madam says the major fire  theres nothing to be alarmed atfire dont open the street door till i come backfire  ill go and see if i can be of any servicefire  youre quite composed and comfortable aint youfire fire fire  it was in vain for me to hold the man and tell him hed be galloped to death by the enginespumped to death by his over exertionswetfeeted to death by the slop and messflattened to death when the roofs fell inhis spirit was up and he went scampering off after the young monkey with all the breath he had and none to spare and me and the girls huddled together at the parlour windows looking at the dreadful flames above the houses over the way mr buffles being round the corner  presently what should we see but some people running down the street straight to our door and then the major directing operations in the busiest way and then some more people and thencarried in a chair similar to guy fawkesmr buffle in a blanket  my dear the major has mr buffle brought up our steps and whisked into the parlour and carted out on the sofy and then he and all the rest of them without so much as a word burst away again full speed leaving the impression of a vision except for mr buffle awful in his blanket with his eyes a rolling  in a twinkling they all burst back again with mrs buffle in another blanket which whisked in and carted out on the sofy they all burst off again and all burst back again with miss buffle in another blanket which again whisked in and carted out they all burst off again and all burst back again with mr buffles articled young gentleman in another blankethim a holding round the necks of two men carrying him by the legs similar to the picter of the disgraceful creetur who has lost the fight but where the chair i do not know and his hair having the appearance of newly played upon  when all four of a row the major rubs his hands and whispers me with what little hoarseness he can get together if our dear remarkable boy was only at home what a delightful treat this would be for him  my dear we made them some hot tea and toast and some hot brandyandwater with a little comfortable nutmeg in it and at first they were scared and low in their spirits but being fully insured got sociable  and the first use mr buffle made of his tongue was to call the major his preserver and his best of friends and to say my for ever dearest sir let me make you known to mrs buffle which also addressed him as her preserver and her best of friends and was fully as cordial as the blanket would admit of also miss buffle  the articled young gentlemans head was a little light and he sat a moaning robina is reduced to cinders robina is reduced to cinders  which went more to the heart on account of his having got wrapped in his blanket as if he was looking out of a violinceller case until mr buffle says robina speak to him  miss buffle says dear george and but for the majors pouring down brandyandwater on the instant which caused a catching in his throat owing to the nutmeg and a violent fit of coughing it might have proved too much for his strength when the articled young gentleman got the better of it mr buffle leaned up against mrs buffle being two bundles a little while in confidence and then says with tears in his eyes which the major noticing wiped we have not been an united family let us after this danger become so take her george  the young gentleman could not put his arm out far to do it but his spoken expressions were very beautiful though of a wandering class  and i do not know that i ever had a much pleasanter meal than the breakfast we took together after we had all dozed when miss buffle made tea very sweetly in quite the roman style as depicted formerly at covent garden theatre and when the whole family was most agreeable as they have ever proved since that night when the major stood at the foot of the fire escape and claimed them as they came downthe young gentleman headforemost which accounts  and though i do not say that we should be less liable to think ill of one another if strictly limited to blankets still i do say that we might most of us come to a better understanding if we kept one another less at a distance  why theres wozenhams lower down on the other side of the street  i had a feeling of much soreness several years respecting what i must still ever call miss wozenhams systematic underbidding and the likeness of the house in bradshaw having far too many windows and a most umbrageous and outrageous oak which never yet was seen in norfolk street nor yet a carriage and four at wozenhams door which it would have been far more to bradshaws credit to have drawn a cab  this frame of mind continued bitter down to the very afternoon in january last when one of my girls sally rairyganoo which i still suspect of irish extraction though family represented cambridge else why abscond with a bricklayer of the limerick persuasion and be married in pattens not waiting till his black eye was decently got round with all the company fourteen in number and one horse fighting outside on the roof of the vehiclei repeat my dear my ill regulated state of mind towards miss wozenham continued down to the very afternoon of january last past when sally rairyganoo came banging i can use no milder expression into my room with a jump which may be cambridge and may not and said hurroo missis  miss wozenhams sold up  my dear when i had it thrown in my face and conscience that the girl sally had reason to think i could be glad of the ruin of a fellowcreeter i burst into tears and dropped back in my chair and i says i am ashamed of myself  well  i tried to settle to my tea but i could not do it what with thinking of miss wozenham and her distresses  it was a wretched night and i went up to a front window and looked over at wozenhams and as well as i could make it out down the street in the fog it was the dismallest of the dismal and not a light to be seen  so at last i save to myself this will not do and i puts on my oldest bonnet and shawl not wishing miss wozenham to be reminded of my best at such a time and lo and behold you i goes over to wozenhams and knocks  miss wozenham at home i says turning my head when i heard the door go  and then i saw it was miss wozenham herself who had opened it and sadly worn she was poor thing and her eyes all swelled and swelled with crying  miss wozenham i says it is several years since there was a little unpleasantness betwixt us on the subject of my grandsons cap being down your airy  i have overlooked it and i hope you have done the same  yes mrs lirriper she says in a surprise i have  then my dear i says i should be glad to come in and speak a word to you  upon my calling her my dear miss wozenham breaks out a crying most pitiful and a not unfeeling elderly person that might have been better shaved in a nightcap with a hat over it offering a polite apology for the mumps having worked themselves into his constitution and also for sending home to his wife on the bellows which was in his hand as a writingdesk looks out of the back parlour and says the lady wants a word of comfort and goes in again  so i was able to say quite natural wants a word of comfort does she sir  then please the pigs she shall have it  and miss wozenham and me we go into the front room with a wretched light that seemed to have been crying too and was sputtering out and i says now my dear tell me all and she wrings her hands and says o mrs lirriper that man is in possession here and i have not a friend in the world who is able to help me with a shilling  it doesnt signify a bit what a talkative old body like me said to miss wozenham when she said that and so ill tell you instead my dear that id have given thirty shillings to have taken her over to tea only i durstnt on account of the major  not you see but what i knew i could draw the major out like thread and wind him round my finger on most subjects and perhaps even on that if i was to set myself to it but him and me had so often belied miss wozenham to one another that i was shamefaced and i knew she had offended his pride and never mine and likewise i felt timid that that rairyganoo girl might make things awkward  so i says my dear if you could give me a cup of tea to clear my muddle of a head i should better understand your affairs  and we had the tea and the affairs too and after all it was but forty pound andthere shes as industrious and straight a creeter as ever lived and has paid back half of it already and wheres the use of saying more particularly when it aint the point  for the point is that when she was a kissing my hands and holding them in hers and kissing them again and blessing blessing blessing i cheered up at last and i says why what a waddling old goose i have been my dear to take you for something so very different  ah but i too says she how have i mistaken you  come for goodness sake tell me i says what you thought of me  o says she i thought you had no feeling for such a hard handtomouth life as mine and were rolling in affluence  i says shaking my sides and very glad to do it for i had been a choking quite long enough only look at my figure my dear and give me your opinion whether if i was in affluence i should be likely to roll in it  that did it  we got as merry as grigs whatever they are if you happen to know my deari dont and i went home to my blessed home as happy and as thankful as could be  but before i make an end of it think even of my having misunderstood the major  yes  for next forenoon the major came into my little room with his brushed hat in his hand and he begins my dearest madam and then put his face in his hat as if he had just come into church  as i sat all in a maze he came out of his hat and began again  my esteemed and beloved friend and then went into his hat again  major i cries out frightened has anything happened to our darling boy  no no no says the major but miss wozenham has been here this morning to make her excuses to me and by the lord i cant get over what she told me  hoity toity major i says you dont know yet that i was afraid of you last night and didnt think half as well of you as i ought  so come out of church major and forgive me like a dear old friend and ill never do so any more  and i leave you to judge my dear whether i ever did or will and how affecting to think of miss wozenham out of her small income and her losses doing so much for her poor old father and keeping a brother that had had the misfortune to soften his brain against the hard mathematics as neat as a new pin in the three back represented to lodgers as a lumberroom and consuming a whole shoulder of mutton whenever provided  and now my dear i really am a going to tell you about my legacy if youre inclined to favour me with your attention and i did fully intend to have come straight to it only one thing does so bring up another  it was the month of june and the day before midsummer day when my girl winifred madgersshe was what is termed a plymouth sister and the plymouth brother that made away with her was quite right for a tidier young woman for a wife never came into a house and afterwards called with the beautifullest plymouth twinsit was the day before midsummer day when winifred madgers comes and says to me a gentleman from the consuls wishes particular to speak to mrs lirriper  if youll believe me my dear the consols at the bank where i have a little matter for jemmy got into my head and i says good gracious i hope he aint had any dreadful fall  says winifred he dont look as if he had maam  and i says show him in  the gentleman came in dark and with his hair cropped what i should consider too close and he says very polite madame lirrwiper  i says yes sir  take a chair  i come says he frrwom the frrwench consuls  so i saw at once that it wasnt the bank of england   we have rrweceived says the gentleman turning his rs very curious and skilful frrwom the mairrwie at sens a communication which i will have the honour to rrwead  madame lirrwiper understands frrwench  o dear no sir says i  madame lirriper dont understand anything of the sort  it matters not says the gentleman i will trrwanslate  with that my dear the gentleman after reading something about a department and a marie which lord forgive me i supposed till the major came home was mary and never was i more puzzled than to think how that young woman came to have so much to do with it translated a lot with the most obliging pains and it came to thisthat in the town of sons in france an unknown englishman lay a dying  that he was speechless and without motion  that in his lodging there was a gold watch and a purse containing such and such money and a trunk containing such and such clothes but no passport and no papers except that on his table was a pack of cards and that he had written in pencil on the back of the ace of hearts to the authorities  when i am dead pray send what is left as a last legacy to mrs lirriper eightyone norfolk street strand london when the gentleman had explained all this which seemed to be drawn up much more methodical than i should have given the french credit for not at that time knowing the nation he put the document into my hand  and much the wiser i was for that you may be sure except that it had the look of being made out upon grocery paper and was stamped all over with eagles  does madame lirrwiper says the gentleman believe she rrwecognises her unfortunate compatrrwiot  you may imagine the flurry it put me into my dear to be talked to about my compatriots  i says excuse me  would you have the kindness sir to make your language as simple as you can  this englishman unhappy at the point of death  this compatrrwiot afflicted says the gentleman  thank you sir i says i understand you now  no sir i have not the least idea who this can be  has madame lirrwiper no son no nephew no godson no frrwiend no acquaintance of any kind in frrwance  to my certain knowledge says i no relation or friend and to the best of my belief no acquaintance  pardon me  you take locataires says the gentleman  my dear fully believing he was offering me something with his obliging foreign mannerssnuff for anything i knewi gave a little bend of my head and i says if youll credit it no i thank you  i have not contracted the habit  the gentleman looks perplexed and says lodgers  oh says i laughing  bless the man  why yes to be sure  may it not be a former lodger says the gentleman  some lodger that you pardoned some rrwent  you have pardoned lodgers some rrwent  hem  it has happened sir says i but i assure you i can call to mind no gentleman of that description that this is at all likely to be  in short my dear we could make nothing of it and the gentleman noted down what i said and went away  but he left me the paper of which he had two with him and when the major came in i says to the major as i put it in his hand major heres old moores almanac with the hieroglyphic complete for your opinion  it took the major a little longer to read than i should have thought judging from the copious flow with which he seemed to be gifted when attacking the organmen but at last he got through it and stood a gazing at me in amazement  major i says youre paralysed  madam says the major jemmy jackman is doubled up  now it did so happen that the major had been out to get a little information about railroads and steamboats as our boy was coming home for his midsummer holidays next day and we were going to take him somewhere for a treat and a change  so while the major stood a gazing it came into my head to say to him major i wish youd go and look at some of your books and maps and see whereabouts this same town of sens is in france  the major he roused himself and he went into the parlours and he poked about a little and he came back to me and he says sens my dearest madam is seventyodd miles south of paris  with what i may truly call a desperate effort major i says well go there with our blessed boy  if ever the major was beside himself it was at the thoughts of that journey  all day long he was like the wild man of the woods after meeting with an advertisement in the papers telling him something to his advantage and early next morning hours before jemmy could possibly come home he was outside in the street ready to call out to him that we was all a going to france  young rosycheeks you may believe was as wild as the major and they did carry on to that degree that i says if you two children aint more orderly ill pack you both off to bed  and then they fell to cleaning up the majors telescope to see france with and went out and bought a leather bag with a snap to hang round jemmy and him to carry the money like a little fortunatus with his purse  if i hadnt passed my word and raised their hopes i doubt if i could have gone through with the undertaking but it was too late to go back now  so on the second day after midsummer day we went off by the morning mail  and when we came to the sea which i had never seen but once in my life and that when my poor lirriper was courting me the freshness of it and the deepness and the airiness and to think that it had been rolling ever since and that it was always a rolling and so few of us minding made me feel quite serious  but i felt happy too and so did jemmy and the major and not much motion on the whole though me with a swimming in the head and a sinking but able to take notice that the foreign insides appear to be constructed hollower than the english leading to much more tremenjous noises when bad sailors  but my dear the blueness and the lightness and the coloured look of everything and the very sentryboxes striped and the shining rattling drums and the little soldiers with their waists and tidy gaiters when we got across to the continentit made me feel as if i dont know whatas if the atmosphere had been lifted off me  and as to lunch why bless you if i kept a mancook and two kitchenmaids i couldnt got it done for twice the money and no injured young woman a glaring at you and grudging you and acknowledging your patronage by wishing that your food might choke you but so civil and so hot and attentive and every way comfortable except jemmy pouring wine down his throat by tumblersfull and me expecting to see him drop under the table  and the way in which jemmy spoke his french was a real charm  it was often wanted of him for whenever anybody spoke a syllable to me i says noncomprenny youre very kind but its no usenow jemmy and then jemmy he fires away at em lovely the only thing wanting in jemmys french being as it appeared to me that he hardly ever understood a word of what they said to him which made it scarcely of the use it might have been though in other respects a perfect native and regarding the majors fluency i should have been of the opinion judging french by english that there might have been a greater choice of words in the language though still i must admit that if i hadnt known him when he asked a military gentleman in a gray cloak what oclock it was i should have took him for a frenchman born  before going on to look after my legacy we were to make one regular day in paris and i leave you to judge my dear what a day that was with jemmy and the major and the telescope and me and the prowling young man at the inn door but very civil too that went along with us to show the sights  all along the railway to paris jemmy and the major had been frightening me to death by stooping down on the platforms at stations to inspect the engines underneath their mechanical stomachs and by creeping in and out i dont know where all to find improvements for the united grand junction parlour but when we got out into the brilliant streets on a bright morning they gave up all their london improvements as a bad job and gave their minds to paris  says the prowling young man to me will i speak inglis no  so i says if you can young man i shall take it as a favour but after halfanhour of it when i fully believed the man had gone mad and me too i says be so good as fall back on your french sir knowing that then i shouldnt have the agonies of trying to understand him which was a happy release  not that i lost much more than the rest either for i generally noticed that when he had described something very long indeed and i says to jemmy what does he say jemmy  jemmy says looking with vengeance in his eye he is so jolly indistinct and that when he had described it longer all over again and i says to jemmy well jemmy whats it all about jemmy says he says the building was repaired in seventeen hundred and four gran  wherever that prowling young man formed his prowling habits i cannot be expected to know but the way in which he went round the corner while we had our breakfasts and was there again when we swallowed the last crumb was most marvellous and just the same at dinner and at night prowling equally at the theatre and the inn gateway and the shop doors when we bought a trifle or two and everywhere else but troubled with a tendency to spit  and of paris i can tell you no more my dear than that its town and country both in one and carved stone and long streets of high houses and gardens and fountains and statues and trees and gold and immensely big soldiers and immensely little soldiers and the pleasantest nurses with the whitest caps a playing at skippingrope with the bunchiest babies in the flattest caps and clean tablecloths spread everywhere for dinner and people sitting out of doors smoking and sipping all day long and little plays being acted in the open air for little people and every shop a complete and elegant room and everybody seeming to play at everything in this world  and as to the sparkling lights my dear after dark glittering high up and low down and on before and on behind and all round and the crowd of theatres and the crowd of people and the crowd of all sorts its pure enchantment  and pretty well the only thing that grated on me was that whether you pay your fare at the railway or whether you change your money at a moneydealers or whether you take your ticket at the theatre the lady or gentleman is caged up i suppose by government behind the strongest iron bars having more of a zoological appearance than a free country  well to be sure when i did after all get my precious bones to bed that night and my young rogue came in to kiss me and asks what do you think of this lovely lovely paris gran  i says jemmy i feel as if it was beautiful fireworks being let off in my head  and very cool and refreshing the pleasant country was next day when we went on to look after my legacy and rested me much and did me a deal of good  so at length and at last my dear we come to sens a pretty little town with a great twotowered cathedral and the rooks flying in and out of the loopholes and another tower atop of one of the towers like a sort of a stone pulpit  in which pulpit with the birds skimming below him if youll believe me i saw a speck while i was resting at the inn before dinner which they made signs to me was jemmy and which really was  i had been a fancying as i sat in the balcony of the hotel that an angel might light there and call down to the people to be good but i little thought what jemmy all unknown to himself was a calling down from that high place to some one in the town  the pleasantestsituated inn my dear  right under the two towers with their shadows a changing upon it all day like a kind of a sundial and country people driving in and out of the courtyard in carts and hooded cabriolets and such like and a market outside in front of the cathedral and all so quaint and like a picter  the major and me agreed that whatever came of my legacy this was the place to stay in for our holiday and we also agreed that our dear boy had best not be checked in his joy that night by the sight of the englishman if he was still alive but that we would go together and alone  for you are to understand that the major not feeling himself quite equal in his wind to the height to which jemmy had climbed had come back to me and left him with the guide  so after dinner when jemmy had set off to see the river the major went down to the mairie and presently came back with a military character in a sword and spurs and a cocked hat and a yellow shoulderbelt and long tags about him that he must have found inconvenient  and the major says the englishman still lies in the same state dearest madam  this gentleman will conduct us to his lodging  upon which the military character pulled off his cocked hat to me and i took notice that he had shaved his forehead in imitation of napoleon bonaparte but not like  we wont out at the courtyard gate and past the great doors of the cathedral and down a narrow high street where the people were sitting chatting at their shop doors and the children were at play  the military character went in front and he stopped at a porkshop with a little statue of a pig sitting up in the window and a private door that a donkey was looking out of  when the donkey saw the military character he came slipping out on the pavement to turn round and then clattered along the passage into a back yard  so the coast being clear the major and me were conducted up the common stair and into the front room on the second a bare room with a red tiled floor and the outside lattice blinds pulled close to darken it as the military character opened the blinds i saw the tower where i had seen jemmy darkening as the sun got low and i turned to the bed by the wall and saw the englishman  it was some kind of brain fever he had had and his hair was all gone and some wetted folded linen lay upon his head  i looked at him very attentive as he lay there all wasted away with his eyes closed and i says to the major  i never saw this face before  the major looked at him very attentive too and he says i never saw this face before  when the major explained our words to the military character that gentleman shrugged his shoulders and showed the major the card on which it was written about the legacy for me  it had been written with a weak and trembling hand in bed and i knew no more of the writing than of the face  neither did the major  though lying there alone the poor creetur was as well taken care of as could be hoped and would have been quite unconscious of any ones sitting by him then  i got the major to say that we were not going away at present and that i would come back tomorrow and watch a bit by the bedside  but i got him to addand i shook my head hard to make it strongerwe agree that we never saw this face before  our boy was greatly surprised when we told him sitting out in the balcony in the starlight and he ran over some of those stories of former lodgers of the majors putting down and asked wasnt it possible that it might be this lodger or that lodger  it was not possible and we went to bed  in the morning just at breakfasttime the military character came jingling round and said that the doctor thought from the signs he saw there might be some rally before the end  so i says to the major and jemmy you two boys go and enjoy yourselves and ill take my prayer book and go sit by the bed  so i went and i sat there some hours reading a prayer for him poor soul now and then and it was quite on in the day when he moved his hand  he had been so still that the moment he moved i knew of it and i pulled off my spectacles and laid down my book and rose and looked at him  from moving one hand he began to move both and then his action was the action of a person groping in the dark  long after his eyes had opened there was a film over them and he still felt for his way out into light  but by slow degrees his sight cleared and his hands stopped  he saw the ceiling he saw the wall he saw me  as his sight cleared mine cleared too and when at last we looked in one anothers faces i started back and i cries passionately  o you wicked wicked man  your sin has found you out  for i knew him the moment life looked out of his eyes to be mr edson jemmys father who had so cruelly deserted jemmys young unmarried mother who had died in my arms poor tender creetur and left jemmy to me  you cruel wicked man  you bad black traitor  with the little strength he had he made an attempt to turn over on his wretched face to hide it  his arm dropped out of the bed and his head with it and there he lay before me crushed in body and in mind  surely the miserablest sight under the summer sun  o blessed heaven i says a crying teach me what to say to this broken mortal  i am a poor sinful creetur and the judgment is not mine  as i lifted my eyes up to the clear bright sky i saw the high tower where jemmy had stood above the birds seeing that very window and the last look of that poor pretty young mother when her soul brightened and got free seemed to shine down from it  o man man man i says and i went on my knees beside the bed if your heart is rent asunder and you are truly penitent for what you did our saviour will have mercy on you yet  as i leaned my face against the bed his feeble hand could just move itself enough to touch me  i hope the touch was penitent  it tried to hold my dress and keep hold but the fingers were too weak to close  i lifted him back upon the pillows and i says to him  can you hear me  he looked yes  do you know me  he looked yes even yet more plainly  i am not here alone  the major is with me  you recollect the major  yes  that is to say he made out yes in the same way as before  and even the major and i are not alone  my grandsonhis godsonis with us  do you hear  my grandson  the fingers made another trial to catch my sleeve but could only creep near it and fall  do you know who my grandson is  yes  i pitied and loved his lonely mother  when his mother lay a dying i said to her my dear this baby is sent to a childless old woman  he has been my pride and joy ever since  i love him as dearly as if he had drunk from my breast  do you ask to see my grandson before you die  yes  show me when i leave off speaking if you correctly understand what i say  he has been kept unacquainted with the story of his birth  he has no knowledge of it  no suspicion of it  if i bring him here to the side of this bed he will suppose you to be a perfect stranger  it is more than i can do to keep from him the knowledge that there is such wrong and misery in the world but that it was ever so near him in his innocent cradle i have kept from him and i do keep from him and i ever will keep from him for his mothers sake and for his own  he showed me that he distinctly understood and the tears fell from his eyes  now rest and you shall see him  so i got him a little wine and some brandy and i put things straight about his bed  but i began to be troubled in my mind lest jemmy and the major might be too long of coming back  what with this occupation for my thoughts and hands i didnt hear a foot upon the stairs and was startled when i saw the major stopped short in the middle of the room by the eyes of the man upon the bed and knowing him then as i had known him a little while ago  there was anger in the majors face and there was horror and repugnance and i dont know what  so i went up to him and i led him to the bedside and when i clasped my hands and lifted of them up the major did the like  o lord i says thou knowest what we two saw together of the sufferings and sorrows of that young creetur now with thee  if this dying man is truly penitent we two together humbly pray thee to have mercy on him  the major says amen and then after a little stop i whispers him dear old friend fetch our beloved boy  and the major so clever as to have got to understand it all without being told a word went away and brought him  never never never shall i forget the fair bright face of our boy when he stood at the foot of the bed looking at his unknown father  and o so like his dear young mother then  jemmy i says i have found out all about this poor gentleman who is so ill and he did lodge in the old house once  and as he wants to see all belonging to it now that he is passing away i sent for you  ah poor man says jemmy stepping forward and touching one of his hands with great gentleness  my heart melts for him  poor poor man  the eyes that were so soon to close for ever turned to me and i was not that strong in the pride of my strength that i could resist them  my darling boy there is a reason in the secret history of this fellow creetur lying as the best and worst of us must all lie one day which i think would ease his spirit in his last hour if you would lay your cheek against his forehead and say may god forgive you  o gran says jemmy with a full heart i am not worthy  but he leaned down and did it  then the faltering fingers made out to catch hold of my sleeve at last and i believe he was atrying to kiss me when he died        there my dear  there you have the story of my legacy in full and its worth ten times the trouble i have spent upon it if you are pleased to like it  you might suppose that it set us against the little french town of sens but no we didnt find that  i found myself that i never looked up at the high tower atop of the other tower but the days came back again when that fair young creetur with her pretty bright hair trusted in me like a mother and the recollection made the place so peaceful to me as i cant express  and every soul about the hotel down to the pigeons in the courtyard made friends with jemmy and the major and went lumbering away with them on all sorts of expeditions in all sorts of vehicles drawn by rampagious carthorseswith heads and withoutmud for paint and ropes for harnessand every new friend dressed in blue like a butcher and every new horse standing on his hind legs wanting to devour and consume every other horse and every man that had a whip to crack crackcrack crackcrackcracking it as if it was a schoolboy with his first  as to the major my dear that man lived the greater part of his time with a little tumbler in one hand and a bottle of small wine in the other and whenever he saw anybody else with a little tumbler no matter who it wasthe military character with the tags or the innservants at their supper in the courtyard or townspeople a chatting on a bench or country people a starting home after marketdown rushes the major to clink his glass against their glasses and cryhola  vive somebody or vive something as if he was beside himself  and though i could not quite approve of the majors doing it still the ways of the world are the ways of the world varying according to the different parts of it and dancing at all in the open square with a lady that kept a barbers shop my opinion is that the major was right to dance his best and to lead off with a power that i did not think was in him though i was a little uneasy at the barricading sound of the cries that were set up by the other dancers and the rest of the company until when i says what are they ever calling out jemmy jemmy says theyre calling out gran bravo the military english  bravo the military english which was very gratifying to my feelings as a briton and became the name the major was known by  but every evening at a regular time we all three sat out in the balcony of the hotel at the end of the courtyard looking up at the golden and rosy light as it changed on the great towers and looking at the shadows of the towers as they changed on all about us ourselves included and what do you think we did there  my dear if jemmy hadnt brought some other of those stories of the majors taking down from the telling of former lodgers at eightyone norfolk street and if he didnt bring em out with this speech  here you are gran  here you are godfather  more of em  ill read and though you wrote em for me godfather i know you wont disapprove of my making em over to gran will you  no my dear boy says the major  everything we have is hers and we are hers  hers ever affectionately and devotedly j jackman and j jackman lirriper cries the young rogue giving me a close hug  very well then godfather  look here  as gran is in the legacy way just now i shall make these stories a part of grans legacy  ill leave em to her  what do you say godfather  hip hip hurrah says the major  very well then cries jemmy all in a bustle  vive the military english  vive the lady lirriper  vive the jemmy jackman ditto  vive the legacy  now you look out gran  and you look out godfather ill read  and ill tell you what ill do besides  on the last night of our holiday here when we are all packed and going away ill top up with something of my own  mind you do sir says i     chapter iimrs lirriper relates how jemmy topped up   well my dear and so the evening readings of those jottings of the majors brought us round at last to the evening when we were all packed and going away next day and i do assure you that by that time though it was deliciously comfortable to look forward to the dear old house in norfolk street again i had formed quite a high opinion of the french nation and had noticed them to be much more homely and domestic in their families and far more simple and amiable in their lives than i had ever been led to expect and it did strike me between ourselves that in one particular they might be imitated to advantage by another nation which i will not mention and that is in the courage with which they take their little enjoyments on little means and with little things and dont let solemn bigwigs stare them out of countenance or speechify them dull of which said solemn bigwigs i have ever had the one opinion that i wish they were all made comfortable separately in coppers with the lids on and never let out any more  now young man i says to jemmy when we brought our chairs into the balcony that last evening you please to remember who was to top up  all right gran says jemmy  i am the illustrious personage  but he looked so serious after he had made me that light answer that the major raised his eyebrows at me and i raised mine at the major  gran and godfather says jemmy you can hardly think how much my mind has run on mr edsons death  it gave me a little check  ah it was a sad scene my love i says and sad remembrances come back stronger than merry  but this i says after a little silence to rouse myself and the major and jemmy all together is not topping up  tell us your story my dear  i will says jemmy  what is the date sir says i  once upon a time when pigs drank wine  no gran says jemmy still serious once upon a time when the french drank wine  again i glanced at the major and the major glanced at me  in short gran and godfather says jemmy looking up the date is this time and im going to tell you mr edsons story  the flutter that it threw me into  the change of colour on the part of the major  that is to say you understand our brighteyed boy says i am going to give you my version of it  i shall not ask whether its right or not firstly because you said you knew very little about it gran and secondly because what little you did know was a secret  i folded my hands in my lap and i never took my eyes off jemmy as he went running on  the unfortunate gentleman jemmy commences who is the subject of our present narrative was the son of somebody and was born somewhere and chose a profession somehow  it is not with those parts of his career that we have to deal but with his early attachment to a young and beautiful lady  i thought i should have dropped  i durstnt look at the major but i know what his state was without looking at him  the father of our illstarred hero says jemmy copying as it seemed to me the style of some of his storybooks was a worldly man who entertained ambitious views for his only son and who firmly set his face against the contemplated alliance with a virtuous but penniless orphan indeed he went so far as roundly to assure our hero that unless he weaned his thoughts from the object of his devoted affection he would disinherit him  at the same time he proposed as a suitable match the daughter of a neighbouring gentleman of a good estate who was neither illfavoured nor unamiable and whose eligibility in a pecuniary point of view could not be disputed  but young mr edson true to the first and only love that had inflamed his breast rejected all considerations of selfadvancement and deprecating his fathers anger in a respectful letter ran away with her  my dear i had begun to take a turn for the better but when it come to running away i began to take another turn for the worse  the lovers says jemmy fled to london and were united at the altar of saint clements danes  and it is at this period of their simple but touching story that we find them inmates of the dwelling of a highlyrespected and beloved lady of the name of gran residing within a hundred miles of norfolk street  i felt that we were almost safe now i felt that the dear boy had no suspicion of the bitter truth and i looked at the major for the first time and drew a long breath  the major gave me a nod  our heros father jemmy goes on proving implacable and carrying his threat into unrelenting execution the struggles of the young couple in london were severe and would have been far more so but for their good angels having conducted them to the abode of mrs gran who divining their poverty in spite of their endeavours to conceal it from her by a thousand delicate arts smoothed their rough way and alleviated the sharpness of their first distress  here jemmy took one of my hands in one of his and began a marking the turns of his story by making me give a beat from time to time upon his other hand  after a while they left the house of mrs gran and pursued their fortunes through a variety of successes and failures elsewhere  but in all reverses whether for good or evil the words of mr edson to the fair young partner of his life were unchanging love and truth will carry us through all  my hand trembled in the dear boys those words were so wofully unlike the fact  unchanging love and truth says jemmy over again as if he had a proud kind of a noble pleasure in it will carry us through all  those were his words  and so they fought their way poor but gallant and happy until mrs edson gave birth to a child  a daughter i says  no says jemmy a son  and the father was so proud of it that he could hardly bear it out of his sight  but a dark cloud overspread the scene  mrs edson sickened drooped and died  ah  sickened drooped and died i says  and so mr edsons only comfort only hope on earth and only stimulus to action was his darling boy  as the child grew older he grew so like his mother that he was her living picture  it used to make him wonder why his father cried when he kissed him  but unhappily he was like his mother in constitution as well as in face and lo died too before he had grown out of childhood  then mr edson who had good abilities in his forlornness and despair threw them all to the winds  he became apathetic reckless lost  little by little he sank down down down down until at last he almost lived i think by gaming  and so sickness overtook him in the town of sens in france and he lay down to die  but now that he laid him down when all was done and looked back upon the green past beyond the time when he had covered it with ashes he thought gratefully of the good mrs gran long lost sight of who had been so kind to him and his young wife in the early days of their marriage and he left the little that he had as a last legacy to her  and she being brought to see him at first no more knew him than she would know from seeing the ruin of a greek or roman temple what it used to be before it fell but at length she remembered him  and then he told her with tears of his regret for the misspent part of his life and besought her to think as mildly of it as she could because it was the poor fallen angel of his unchanging love and constancy after all  and because she had her grandson with her and he fancied that his own boy if he had lived might have grown to be something like him he asked her to let him touch his forehead with his cheek and say certain parting words  jemmys voice sank low when it got to that and tears filled my eyes and filled the majors  you little conjurer i says how did you ever make it all out  go in and write it every word down for its a wonder  which jemmy did and i have repeated it to you my dear from his writing  then the major took my hand and kissed it and said dearest madam all has prospered with us  ah major i says drying my eyes we neednt have been afraid  we might have known it  treachery dont come natural to beaming youth but trust and pity love and constancythey do thank god
