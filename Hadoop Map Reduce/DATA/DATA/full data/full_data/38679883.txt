38679883	south sea tales  by jack london    contents  the house of mapuhi  the whale tooth  mauki  yah yah yah  the heathen  the terrible solomons  the inevitable white man  the seed of mccoy     the house of mapuhi  despite the heavy clumsiness of her lines the aorai handled easily in the light breeze and her captain ran her well in before he hove to just outside the suck of the surf the atoll of hikueru lay low on the water a circle of pounded coral sand a hundred yards wide twenty miles in circumference and from three to five feet above highwater mark on the bottom of the huge and glassy lagoon was much pearl shell and from the deck of the schooner across the slender ring of the atoll the divers could be seen at work but the lagoon had no entrance for even a trading schooner with a favoring breeze cutters could win in through the tortuous and shallow channel but the schooners lay off and on outside and sent in their small boats  the aorai swung out a boat smartly into which sprang half a dozen brownskinned sailors clad only in scarlet loincloths they took the oars while in the stern sheets at the steering sweep stood a young man garbed in the tropic white that marks the european the golden strain of polynesia betrayed itself in the sungilt of his fair skin and cast up golden sheens and lights through the glimmering blue of his eyes raoul he was alexandre raoul youngest son of marie raoul the wealthy quartercaste who owned and managed half a dozen trading schooners similar to the aorai across an eddy just outside the entrance and in and through and over a boiling tiderip the boat fought its way to the mirrored calm of the lagoon young raoul leaped out upon the white sand and shook hands with a tall native the mans chest and shoulders were magnificent but the stump of a right arm beyond the flesh of which the agewhitened bone projected several inches attested the encounter with a shark that had put an end to his diving days and made him a fawner and an intriguer for small favors  have you heard alec were his first words mapuhi has found a pearlsuch a pearl never was there one like it ever fished up in hikueru nor in all the paumotus nor in all the world buy it from him he has it now and remember that i told you first he is a fool and you can get it cheap have you any tobacco  straight up the beach to a shack under a pandanus tree raoul headed he was his mothers supercargo and his business was to comb all the paumotus for the wealth of copra shell and pearls that they yielded up  he was a young supercargo it was his second voyage in such capacity and he suffered much secret worry from his lack of experience in pricing pearls but when mapuhi exposed the pearl to his sight he managed to suppress the startle it gave him and to maintain a careless commercial expression on his face for the pearl had struck him a blow it was large as a pigeon egg a perfect sphere of a whiteness that reflected opalescent lights from all colors about it it was alive never had he seen anything like it when mapuhi dropped it into his hand he was surprised by the weight of it that showed that it was a good pearl he examined it closely through a pocket magnifying glass it was without flaw or blemish the purity of it seemed almost to melt into the atmosphere out of his hand in the shade it was softly luminous gleaming like a tender moon so translucently white was it that when he dropped it into a glass of water he had difficulty in finding it so straight and swiftly had it sunk to the bottom that he knew its weight was excellent  well what do you want for it he asked with a fine assumption of nonchalance  i want mapuhi began and behind him framing his own dark face the dark faces of two women and a girl nodded concurrence in what he wanted their heads were bent forward they were animated by a suppressed eagerness their eyes flashed avariciously  i want a house mapuhi went on it must have a roof of galvanized iron and an octagondropclock it must be six fathoms long with a porch all around a big room must be in the centre with a round table in the middle of it and the octagondropclock on the wall there must be four bedrooms two on each side of the big room and in each bedroom must be an iron bed two chairs and a washstand and back of the house must be a kitchen a good kitchen with pots and pans and a stove and you must build the house on my island which is fakarava  is that all raoul asked incredulously  there must be a sewing machine spoke up tefara mapuhis wife  not forgetting the octagondropclock added nauri mapuhis mother  yes that is all said mapuhi  young raoul laughed he laughed long and heartily but while he laughed he secretly performed problems in mental arithmetic he had never built a house in his life and his notions concerning house building were hazy while he laughed he calculated the cost of the voyage to tahiti for materials of the materials themselves of the voyage back again to fakarava and the cost of landing the materials and of building the house it would come to four thousand french dollars allowing a margin for safetyfour thousand french dollars were equivalent to twenty thousand francs it was impossible how was he to know the value of such a pearl twenty thousand francs was a lot of moneyand of his mothers money at that  mapuhi he said you are a big fool set a money price  but mapuhi shook his head and the three heads behind him shook with his  i want the house he said it must be six fathoms long with a porch all around  yes yes raoul interrupted i know all about your house but it wont do ill give you a thousand chili dollars  the four heads chorused a silent negative  and a hundred chili dollars in trade  i want the house mapuhi began  what good will the house do you raoul demanded the first hurricane that comes along will wash it away you ought to know  captain raffy says it looks like a hurricane right now  not on fakarava said mapuhi the land is much higher there on this island yes any hurricane can sweep hikueru i will have the house on fakarava it must be six fathoms long with a porch all around  and raoul listened again to the tale of the house several hours he spent in the endeavor to hammer the house obsession out of mapuhis mind but mapuhis mother and wife and ngakura mapuhis daughter bolstered him in his resolve for the house through the open doorway while he listened for the twentieth time to the detailed description of the house that was wanted raoul saw his schooners second boat draw up on the beach the sailors rested on the oars advertising haste to be gone the first mate of the aorai sprang ashore exchanged a word with the onearmed native then hurried toward raoul the day grew suddenly dark as a squall obscured the face of the sun across the lagoon raoul could see approaching the ominous line of the puff of wind  captain raffy says youve got to get to hell outa here was the mates greeting if theres any shell weve got to run the risk of picking it up later onso he says the barometers dropped to twentynineseventy  the gust of wind struck the pandanus tree overhead and tore through the palms beyond flinging half a dozen ripe cocoanuts with heavy thuds to the ground then came the rain out of the distance advancing with the roar of a gale of wind and causing the water of the lagoon to smoke in driven windrows the sharp rattle of the first drops was on the leaves when raoul sprang to his feet  a thousand chili dollars cash down mapuhi he said and two hundred chili dollars in trade  i want a house the other began  mapuhi raoul yelled in order to make himself heard you are a fool  he flung out of the house and side by side with the mate fought his way down the beach toward the boat they could not see the boat the tropic rain sheeted about them so that they could see only the beach under their feet and the spiteful little waves from the lagoon that snapped and bit at the sand a figure appeared through the deluge it was huruhuru the man with the one arm  did you get the pearl he yelled in raouls ear  mapuhi is a fool was the answering yell and the next moment they were lost to each other in the descending water  half an hour later huruhuru watching from the seaward side of the atoll saw the two boats hoisted in and the aorai pointing her nose out to sea and near her just come in from the sea on the wings of the squall he saw another schooner hove to and dropping a boat into the water he knew her it was the orohena owned by toriki the halfcaste trader who served as his own supercargo and who doubtlessly was even then in the stern sheets of the boat huruhuru chuckled he knew that mapuhi owed toriki for trade goods advanced the year before  the squall had passed the hot sun was blazing down and the lagoon was once more a mirror but the air was sticky like mucilage and the weight of it seemed to burden the lungs and make breathing difficult  have you heard the news toriki huruhuru asked mapuhi has found a pearl never was there a pearl like it ever fished up in hikueru nor anywhere in the paumotus nor anywhere in all the world mapuhi is a fool besides he owes you money remember that i told you first have you any tobacco  and to the grass shack of mapuhi went toriki he was a masterful man withal a fairly stupid one carelessly he glanced at the wonderful pearlglanced for a moment only and carelessly he dropped it into his pocket  you are lucky he said it is a nice pearl i will give you credit on the books  i want a house mapuhi began in consternation it must be six fathoms  six fathoms your grandmother was the traders retort you want to pay up your debts thats what you want you owed me twelve hundred dollars chili very well you owe them no longer the amount is squared besides i will give you credit for two hundred chili if when i get to tahiti the pearl sells well i will give you credit for another hundredthat will make three hundred but mind only if the pearl sells well i may even lose money on it  mapuhi folded his arms in sorrow and sat with bowed head he had been robbed of his pearl in place of the house he had paid a debt there was nothing to show for the pearl  you are a fool said tefara  you are a fool said nauri his mother why did you let the pearl into his hand  what was i to do mapuhi protested i owed him the money he knew i had the pearl you heard him yourself ask to see it i had not told him he knew somebody else told him and i owed him the money  mapuhi is a fool mimicked ngakura  she was twelve years old and did not know any better mapuhi relieved his feelings by sending her reeling from a box on the ear while tefara and nauri burst into tears and continued to upbraid him after the manner of women  huruhuru watching on the beach saw a third schooner that he knew heave to outside the entrance and drop a boat it was the hira well named for she was owned by levy the german jew the greatest pearl buyer of them all and as was well known hira was the tahitian god of fishermen and thieves  have you heard the news huruhuru asked as levy a fat man with massive asymmetrical features stepped out upon the beach mapuhi has found a pearl there was never a pearl like it in hikueru in all the paumotus in all the world mapuhi is a fool he has sold it to toriki for fourteen hundred chilii listened outside and heard toriki is likewise a fool you can buy it from him cheap remember that i told you first have you any tobacco  where is toriki  in the house of captain lynch drinking absinthe he has been there an hour  and while levy and toriki drank absinthe and chaffered over the pearl huruhuru listened and heard the stupendous price of twentyfive thousand francs agreed upon  it was at this time that both the orohena and the hira running in close to the shore began firing guns and signalling frantically the three men stepped outside in time to see the two schooners go hastily about and head off shore dropping mainsails and flying jibs on the run in the teeth of the squall that heeled them far over on the whitened water then the rain blotted them out  theyll be back after its over said toriki wed better be getting out of here  i reckon the glass has fallen some more said captain lynch  he was a whitebearded seacaptain too old for service who had learned that the only way to live on comfortable terms with his asthma was on hikueru he went inside to look at the barometer  great god they heard him exclaim and rushed in to join him at staring at a dial which marked twentyninetwenty  again they came out this time anxiously to consult sea and sky the squall had cleared away but the sky remained overcast the two schooners under all sail and joined by a third could be seen making back a veer in the wind induced them to slack off sheets and five minutes afterward a sudden veer from the opposite quarter caught all three schooners aback and those on shore could see the boomtackles being slacked away or cast off on the jump the sound of the surf was loud hollow and menacing and a heavy swell was setting in a terrible sheet of lightning burst before their eyes illuminating the dark day and the thunder rolled wildly about them  toriki and levy broke into a run for their boats the latter ambling along like a panicstricken hippopotamus as their two boats swept out the entrance they passed the boat of the aorai coming in in the stern sheets encouraging the rowers was raoul unable to shake the vision of the pearl from his mind he was returning to accept mapuhis price of a house  he landed on the beach in the midst of a driving thunder squall that was so dense that he collided with huruhuru before he saw him  too late yelled huruhuru mapuhi sold it to toriki for fourteen hundred chili and toriki sold it to levy for twentyfive thousand francs and levy will sell it in france for a hundred thousand francs have you any tobacco  raoul felt relieved his troubles about the pearl were over he need not worry any more even if he had not got the pearl but he did not believe huruhuru mapuhi might well have sold it for fourteen hundred chili but that levy who knew pearls should have paid twentyfive thousand francs was too wide a stretch raoul decided to interview captain lynch on the subject but when he arrived at that ancient mariners house he found him looking wideeyed at the barometer  what do you read it captain lynch asked anxiously rubbing his spectacles and staring again at the instrument  twentynineten said raoul i have never seen it so low before  i should say not snorted the captain fifty years boy and man on all the seas and ive never seen it go down to that listen  they stood for a moment while the surf rumbled and shook the house then they went outside the squall had passed they could see the aorai lying becalmed a mile away and pitching and tossing madly in the tremendous seas that rolled in stately procession down out of the northeast and flung themselves furiously upon the coral shore one of the sailors from the boat pointed at the mouth of the passage and shook his head raoul looked and saw a white anarchy of foam and surge  i guess ill stay with you tonight captain he said then turned to the sailor and told him to haul the boat out and to find shelter for himself and fellows  twentynine flat captain lynch reported coming out from another look at the barometer a chair in his hand  he sat down and stared at the spectacle of the sea the sun came out increasing the sultriness of the day while the dead calm still held the seas continued to increase in magnitude  what makes that sea is what gets me raoul muttered petulantly  there is no wind yet look at it look at that fellow there  miles in length carrying tens of thousands of tons in weight its impact shook the frail atoll like an earthquake captain lynch was startled  gracious he bellowed half rising from his chair then sinking back  but there is no wind raoul persisted i could understand it if there was wind along with it  youll get the wind soon enough without worryin for it was the grim reply  the two men sat on in silence the sweat stood out on their skin in myriads of tiny drops that ran together forming blotches of moisture which in turn coalesced into rivulets that dripped to the ground they panted for breath the old mans efforts being especially painful a sea swept up the beach licking around the trunks of the cocoanuts and subsiding almost at their feet  way past high water mark captain lynch remarked and ive been here eleven years he looked at his watch it is three oclock  a man and woman at their heels a motley following of brats and curs trailed disconsolately by they came to a halt beyond the house and after much irresolution sat down in the sand a few minutes later another family trailed in from the opposite direction the men and women carrying a heterogeneous assortment of possessions and soon several hundred persons of all ages and sexes were congregated about the captains dwelling he called to one new arrival a woman with a nursing babe in her arms and in answer received the information that her house had just been swept into the lagoon  this was the highest spot of land in miles and already in many places on either hand the great seas were making a clean breach of the slender ring of the atoll and surging into the lagoon twenty miles around stretched the ring of the atoll and in no place was it more than fifty fathoms wide it was the height of the diving season and from all the islands around even as far as tahiti the natives had gathered  there are twelve hundred men women and children here said captain lynch i wonder how many will be here tomorrow morning  but why dont it blowthats what i want to know raoul demanded  dont worry young man dont worry youll get your troubles fast enough  even as captain lynch spoke a great watery mass smote the atoll  the sea water churned about them three inches deep under the chairs a low wail of fear went up from the many women the children with clasped hands stared at the immense rollers and cried piteously chickens and cats wading perturbedly in the water as by common consent with flight and scramble took refuge on the roof of the captains house a paumotan with a litter of newborn puppies in a basket climbed into a cocoanut tree and twenty feet above the ground made the basket fast the mother floundered about in the water beneath whining and yelping  and still the sun shone brightly and the dead calm continued they sat and watched the seas and the insane pitching of the aorai captain lynch gazed at the huge mountains of water sweeping in until he could gaze no more he covered his face with his hands to shut out the sight then went into the house  twentyeightsixty he said quietly when he returned  in his arm was a coil of small rope he cut it into twofathom lengths giving one to raoul and retaining one for himself distributed the remainder among the women with the advice to pick out a tree and climb  a light air began to blow out of the northeast and the fan of it on his cheek seemed to cheer raoul up he could see the aorai trimming her sheets and heading off shore and he regretted that he was not on her she would get away at any rate but as for the atolla sea breached across almost sweeping him off his feet and he selected a tree then he remembered the barometer and ran back to the house he encountered captain lynch on the same errand and together they went in  twentyeighttwenty said the old mariner its going to be fair hell around herewhat was that  the air seemed filled with the rush of something the house quivered and vibrated and they heard the thrumming of a mighty note of sound the windows rattled two panes crashed a draught of wind tore in striking them and making them stagger the door opposite banged shut shattering the latch the white door knob crumbled in fragments to the floor the rooms walls bulged like a gas balloon in the process of sudden inflation then came a new sound like the rattle of musketry as the spray from a sea struck the wall of the house captain lynch looked at his watch it was four oclock he put on a coat of pilot cloth unhooked the barometer and stowed it away in a capacious pocket again a sea struck the house with a heavy thud and the light building tilted twisted quarter around on its foundation and sank down its floor at an angle of ten degrees  raoul went out first the wind caught him and whirled him away he noted that it had hauled around to the east with a great effort he threw himself on the sand crouching and holding his own captain lynch driven like a wisp of straw sprawled over him two of the aorais sailors leaving a cocoanut tree to which they had been clinging came to their aid leaning against the wind at impossible angles and fighting and clawing every inch of the way  the old mans joints were stiff and he could not climb so the sailors by means of short ends of rope tied together hoisted him up the trunk a few feet at a time till they could make him fast at the top of the tree fifty feet from the ground raoul passed his length of rope around the base of an adjacent tree and stood looking on the wind was frightful he had never dreamed it could blow so hard a sea breached across the atoll wetting him to the knees ere it subsided into the lagoon the sun had disappeared and a leadcolored twilight settled down a few drops of rain driving horizontally struck him the impact was like that of leaden pellets a splash of salt spray struck his face it was like the slap of a mans hand his cheeks stung and involuntary tears of pain were in his smarting eyes several hundred natives had taken to the trees and he could have laughed at the bunches of human fruit clustering in the tops then being tahitianborn he doubled his body at the waist clasped the trunk of his tree with his hands pressed the soles of his feet against the near surface of the trunk and began to walk up the tree at the top he found two women two children and a man one little girl clasped a housecat in her arms  from his eyrie he waved his hand to captain lynch and that doughty patriarch waved back raoul was appalled at the sky it had approached much nearerin fact it seemed just over his head and it had turned from lead to black many people were still on the ground grouped about the bases of the trees and holding on several such clusters were praying and in one the mormon missionary was exhorting a weird sound rhythmical faint as the faintest chirp of a far cricket enduring but for a moment but in the moment suggesting to him vaguely the thought of heaven and celestial music came to his ear he glanced about him and saw at the base of another tree a large cluster of people holding on by ropes and by one another he could see their faces working and their lips moving in unison no sound came to him but he knew that they were singing hymns  still the wind continued to blow harder by no conscious process could he measure it for it had long since passed beyond all his experience of wind but he knew somehow nevertheless that it was blowing harder not far away a tree was uprooted flinging its load of human beings to the ground a sea washed across the strip of sand and they were gone things were happening quickly he saw a brown shoulder and a black head silhouetted against the churning white of the lagoon the next instant that too had vanished other trees were going falling and crisscrossing like matches he was amazed at the power of the wind his own tree was swaying perilously one woman was wailing and clutching the little girl who in turn still hung on to the cat  the man holding the other child touched raouls arm and pointed he looked and saw the mormon church careering drunkenly a hundred feet away it had been torn from its foundations and wind and sea were heaving and shoving it toward the lagoon a frightful wall of water caught it tilted it and flung it against half a dozen cocoanut trees the bunches of human fruit fell like ripe cocoanuts the subsiding wave showed them on the ground some lying motionless others squirming and writhing they reminded him strangely of ants he was not shocked he had risen above horror quite as a matter of course he noted the succeeding wave sweep the sand clean of the human wreckage a third wave more colossal than any he had yet seen hurled the church into the lagoon where it floated off into the obscurity to leeward halfsubmerged reminding him for all the world of a noahs ark  he looked for captain lynchs house and was surprised to find it gone things certainly were happening quickly he noticed that many of the people in the trees that still held had descended to the ground the wind had yet again increased his own tree showed that it no longer swayed or bent over and back instead it remained practically stationary curved in a rigid angle from the wind and merely vibrating but the vibration was sickening it was like that of a tuningfork or the tongue of a jewsharp it was the rapidity of the vibration that made it so bad even though its roots held it could not stand the strain for long something would have to break  ah there was one that had gone he had not seen it go but there it stood the remnant broken off halfway up the trunk one did not know what happened unless he saw it the mere crashing of trees and wails of human despair occupied no place in that mighty volume of sound he chanced to be looking in captain lynchs direction when it happened he saw the trunk of the tree halfway up splinter and part without noise the head of the tree with three sailors of the aorai and the old captain sailed off over the lagoon it did not fall to the ground but drove through the air like a piece of chaff for a hundred yards he followed its flight when it struck the water he strained his eyes and was sure that he saw captain lynch wave farewell  raoul did not wait for anything more he touched the native and made signs to descend to the ground the man was willing but his women were paralyzed from terror and he elected to remain with them raoul passed his rope around the tree and slid down a rush of salt water went over his head he held his breath and clung desperately to the rope the water subsided and in the shelter of the trunk he breathed once more he fastened the rope more securely and then was put under by another sea one of the women slid down and joined him the native remaining by the other woman the two children and the cat  the supercargo had noticed how the groups clinging at the bases of the other trees continually diminished now he saw the process work out alongside him it required all his strength to hold on and the woman who had joined him was growing weaker each time he emerged from a sea he was surprised to find himself still there and next surprised to find the woman still there at last he emerged to find himself alone he looked up the top of the tree had gone as well at half its original height a splintered end vibrated he was safe the roots still held while the tree had been shorn of its windage he began to climb up he was so weak that he went slowly and sea after sea caught him before he was above them then he tied himself to the trunk and stiffened his soul to face the night and he knew not what  he felt very lonely in the darkness at times it seemed to him that it was the end of the world and that he was the last one left alive still the wind increased hour after hour it increased by what he calculated was eleven oclock the wind had become unbelievable it was a horrible monstrous thing a screaming fury a wall that smote and passed on but that continued to smite and pass ona wall without end it seemed to him that he had become light and ethereal that it was he that was in motion that he was being driven with inconceivable velocity through unending solidness the wind was no longer air in motion it had become substantial as water or quicksilver he had a feeling that he could reach into it and tear it out in chunks as one might do with the meat in the carcass of a steer that he could seize hold of the wind and hang on to it as a man might hang on to the face of a cliff  the wind strangled him he could not face it and breathe for it rushed in through his mouth and nostrils distending his lungs like bladders at such moments it seemed to him that his body was being packed and swollen with solid earth only by pressing his lips to the trunk of the tree could he breathe also the ceaseless impact of the wind exhausted him body and brain became wearied he no longer observed no longer thought and was but semiconscious one idea constituted his consciousness so this was a hurricane that one idea persisted irregularly it was like a feeble flame that flickered occasionally from a state of stupor he would return to itso this was a hurricane then he would go off into another stupor  the height of the hurricane endured from eleven at night till three in the morning and it was at eleven that the tree in which clung mapuhi and his women snapped off mapuhi rose to the surface of the lagoon still clutching his daughter ngakura only a south sea islander could have lived in such a driving smother the pandanus tree to which he attached himself turned over and over in the froth and churn and it was only by holding on at times and waiting and at other times shifting his grips rapidly that he was able to get his head and ngakuras to the surface at intervals sufficiently near together to keep the breath in them but the air was mostly water what with flying spray and sheeted rain that poured along at right angles to the perpendicular  it was ten miles across the lagoon to the farther ring of sand here tossing tree trunks timbers wrecks of cutters and wreckage of houses killed nine out of ten of the miserable beings who survived the passage of the lagoon halfdrowned exhausted they were hurled into this mad mortar of the elements and battered into formless flesh but mapuhi was fortunate his chance was the one in ten it fell to him by the freakage of fate he emerged upon the sand bleeding from a score of wounds  ngakuras left arm was broken the fingers of her right hand were crushed and cheek and forehead were laid open to the bone he clutched a tree that yet stood and clung on holding the girl and sobbing for air while the waters of the lagoon washed by kneehigh and at times waisthigh  at three in the morning the backbone of the hurricane broke by five no more than a stiff breeze was blowing and by six it was dead calm and the sun was shining the sea had gone down on the yet restless edge of the lagoon mapuhi saw the broken bodies of those that had failed in the landing undoubtedly tefara and nauri were among them he went along the beach examining them and came upon his wife lying half in and half out of the water he sat down and wept making harsh animal noises after the manner of primitive grief then she stirred uneasily and groaned he looked more closely not only was she alive but she was uninjured she was merely sleeping hers also had been the one chance in ten  of the twelve hundred alive the night before but three hundred remained the mormon missionary and a gendarme made the census the lagoon was cluttered with corpses not a house nor a hut was standing in the whole atoll not two stones remained one upon another one in fifty of the cocoanut palms still stood and they were wrecks while on not one of them remained a single nut  there was no fresh water the shallow wells that caught the surface seepage of the rain were filled with salt out of the lagoon a few soaked bags of flour were recovered the survivors cut the hearts out of the fallen cocoanut trees and ate them here and there they crawled into tiny hutches made by hollowing out the sand and covering over with fragments of metal roofing the missionary made a crude still but he could not distill water for three hundred persons by the end of the second day raoul taking a bath in the lagoon discovered that his thirst was somewhat relieved he cried out the news and thereupon three hundred men women and children could have been seen standing up to their necks in the lagoon and trying to drink water in through their skins their dead floated about them or were stepped upon where they still lay upon the bottom on the third day the people buried their dead and sat down to wait for the rescue steamers  in the meantime nauri torn from her family by the hurricane had been swept away on an adventure of her own clinging to a rough plank that wounded and bruised her and that filled her body with splinters she was thrown clear over the atoll and carried away to sea here under the amazing buffets of mountains of water she lost her plank she was an old woman nearly sixty but she was paumotanborn and she had never been out of sight of the sea in her life swimming in the darkness strangling suffocating fighting for air she was struck a heavy blow on the shoulder by a cocoanut on the instant her plan was formed and she seized the nut in the next hour she captured seven more tied together they formed a lifebuoy that preserved her life while at the same time it threatened to pound her to a jelly she was a fat woman and she bruised easily but she had had experience of hurricanes and while she prayed to her shark god for protection from sharks she waited for the wind to break but at three oclock she was in such a stupor that she did not know nor did she know at six oclock when the dead calm settled down she was shocked into consciousness when she was thrown upon the sand she dug in with raw and bleeding hands and feet and clawed against the backwash until she was beyond the reach of the waves  she knew where she was this land could be no other than the tiny islet of takokota it had no lagoon no one lived upon it  hikueru was fifteen miles away she could not see hikueru but she knew that it lay to the south the days went by and she lived on the cocoanuts that had kept her afloat they supplied her with drinking water and with food but she did not drink all she wanted nor eat all she wanted rescue was problematical she saw the smoke of the rescue steamers on the horizon but what steamer could be expected to come to lonely uninhabited takokota  from the first she was tormented by corpses the sea persisted in flinging them upon her bit of sand and she persisted until her strength failed in thrusting them back into the sea where the sharks tore at them and devoured them when her strength failed the bodies festooned her beach with ghastly horror and she withdrew from them as far as she could which was not far  by the tenth day her last cocoanut was gone and she was shrivelling from thirst she dragged herself along the sand looking for cocoanuts it was strange that so many bodies floated up and no nuts surely there were more cocoanuts afloat than dead men she gave up at last and lay exhausted the end had come nothing remained but to wait for death  coming out of a stupor she became slowly aware that she was gazing at a patch of sandyred hair on the head of a corpse the sea flung the body toward her then drew it back it turned over and she saw that it had no face yet there was something familiar about that patch of sandyred hair an hour passed she did not exert herself to make the identification she was waiting to die and it mattered little to her what man that thing of horror once might have been  but at the end of the hour she sat up slowly and stared at the corpse an unusually large wave had thrown it beyond the reach of the lesser waves yes she was right that patch of red hair could belong to but one man in the paumotus it was levy the german jew the man who had bought the pearl and carried it away on the hira well one thing was evident the hira had been lost the pearl buyers god of fishermen and thieves had gone back on him  she crawled down to the dead man his shirt had been torn away and she could see the leather money belt about his waist she held her breath and tugged at the buckles they gave easier than she had expected and she crawled hurriedly away across the sand dragging the belt after her pocket after pocket she unbuckled in the belt and found empty where could he have put it in the last pocket of all she found it the first and only pearl he had bought on the voyage she crawled a few feet farther to escape the pestilence of the belt and examined the pearl it was the one mapuhi had found and been robbed of by toriki she weighed it in her hand and rolled it back and forth caressingly but in it she saw no intrinsic beauty what she did see was the house mapuhi and tefara and she had builded so carefully in their minds each time she looked at the pearl she saw the house in all its details including the octagondropclock on the wall that was something to live for  she tore a strip from her ahu and tied the pearl securely about her neck then she went on along the beach panting and groaning but resolutely seeking for cocoanuts quickly she found one and as she glanced around a second she broke one drinking its water which was mildewy and eating the last particle of the meat a little later she found a shattered dugout its outrigger was gone but she was hopeful and before the day was out she found the outrigger every find was an augury the pearl was a talisman late in the afternoon she saw a wooden box floating low in the water when she dragged it out on the beach its contents rattled and inside she found ten tins of salmon she opened one by hammering it on the canoe when a leak was started she drained the tin after that she spent several hours in extracting the salmon hammering and squeezing it out a morsel at a time  eight days longer she waited for rescue in the meantime she fastened the outrigger back on the canoe using for lashings all the cocoanut fibre she could find and also what remained of her ahu the canoe was badly cracked and she could not make it watertight but a calabash made from a cocoanut she stored on board for a bailer she was hard put for a paddle with a piece of tin she sawed off all her hair close to the scalp out of the hair she braided a cord and by means of the cord she lashed a threefoot piece of broom handle to a board from the salmon case  she gnawed wedges with her teeth and with them wedged the lashing  on the eighteenth day at midnight she launched the canoe through the surf and started back for hikueru she was an old woman hardship had stripped her fat from her till scarcely more than bones and skin and a few stringy muscles remained the canoe was large and should have been paddled by three strong men  but she did it alone with a makeshift paddle also the canoe leaked badly and onethird of her time was devoted to bailing by clear daylight she looked vainly for hikueru astern takokota had sunk beneath the sea rim the sun blazed down on her nakedness compelling her body to surrender its moisture two tins of salmon were left and in the course of the day she battered holes in them and drained the liquid she had no time to waste in extracting the meat a current was setting to the westward she made westing whether she made southing or not  in the early afternoon standing upright in the canoe she sighted hikueru its wealth of cocoanut palms was gone only here and there at wide intervals could she see the ragged remnants of trees the sight cheered her she was nearer than she had thought the current was setting her to the westward she bore up against it and paddled on the wedges in the paddle lashing worked loose and she lost much time at frequent intervals in driving them tight then there was the bailing one hour in three she had to cease paddling in order to bail and all the time she drifted to the westward  by sunset hikueru bore southeast from her three miles away there was a full moon and by eight oclock the land was due east and two miles away she struggled on for another hour but the land was as far away as ever she was in the main grip of the current the canoe was too large the paddle was too inadequate and too much of her time and strength was wasted in bailing besides she was very weak and growing weaker despite her efforts the canoe was drifting off to the westward  she breathed a prayer to her shark god slipped over the side and began to swim she was actually refreshed by the water and quickly left the canoe astern at the end of an hour the land was perceptibly nearer then came her fright right before her eyes not twenty feet away a large fin cut the water she swam steadily toward it and slowly it glided away curving off toward the right and circling around her she kept her eyes on the fin and swam on when the fin disappeared she lay face downward in the water and watched when the fin reappeared she resumed her swimming the monster was lazyshe could see that without doubt he had been well fed since the hurricane had he been very hungry she knew he would not have hesitated from making a dash for her he was fifteen feet long and one bite she knew could cut her in half  but she did not have any time to waste on him whether she swam or not the current drew away from the land just the same a half hour went by and the shark began to grow bolder seeing no harm in her he drew closer in narrowing circles cocking his eyes at her impudently as he slid past sooner or later she knew well enough he would get up sufficient courage to dash at her she resolved to play first it was a desperate act she meditated she was an old woman alone in the sea and weak from starvation and hardship and yet she in the face of this sea tiger must anticipate his dash by herself dashing at him she swam on waiting her chance at last he passed languidly by barely eight feet away she rushed at him suddenly feigning that she was attacking him he gave a wild flirt of his tail as he fled away and his sandpaper hide striking her took off her skin from elbow to shoulder he swam rapidly in a widening circle and at last disappeared  in the hole in the sand covered over by fragments of metal roofing mapuhi and tefara lay disputing  if you had done as i said charged tefara for the thousandth time and hidden the pearl and told no one you would have it now  but huruhuru was with me when i opened the shellhave i not told you so times and times and times without end  and now we shall have no house raoul told me today that if you had not sold the pearl to toriki  i did not sell it toriki robbed me  that if you had not sold the pearl he would give you five thousand french dollars which is ten thousand chili  he has been talking to his mother mapuhi explained she has an eye for a pearl  and now the pearl is lost tefara complained  it paid my debt with toriki that is twelve hundred i have made anyway  toriki is dead she cried they have heard no word of his schooner she was lost along with the aorai and the hira will toriki pay you the three hundred credit he promised no because toriki is dead and had you found no pearl would you today owe toriki the twelve hundred no because toriki is dead and you cannot pay dead men  but levy did not pay toriki mapuhi said he gave him a piece of paper that was good for the money in papeete and now levy is dead and cannot pay and toriki is dead and the paper lost with him and the pearl is lost with levy you are right tefara i have lost the pearl and got nothing for it now let us sleep  he held up his hand suddenly and listened from without came a noise as of one who breathed heavily and with pain a hand fumbled against the mat that served for a door  who is there mapuhi cried  nauri came the answer can you tell me where is my son mapuhi  tefara screamed and gripped her husbands arm  a ghost she chattered a ghost  mapuhis face was a ghastly yellow he clung weakly to his wife  good woman he said in faltering tones striving to disguise his vice i know your son well he is living on the east side of the lagoon  from without came the sound of a sigh mapuhi began to feel elated he had fooled the ghost  but where do you come from old woman he asked  from the sea was the dejected answer  i knew it i knew it screamed tefara rocking to and fro  since when has tefara bedded in a strange house came nauris voice through the matting  mapuhi looked fear and reproach at his wife it was her voice that had betrayed them  and since when has mapuhi my son denied his old mother the voice went on  no no i have notmapuhi has not denied you he cried i am not mapuhi he is on the east end of the lagoon i tell you  ngakura sat up in bed and began to cry the matting started to shake  what are you doing mapuhi demanded  i am coming in said the voice of nauri  one end of the matting lifted tefara tried to dive under the blankets but mapuhi held on to her he had to hold on to something together struggling with each other with shivering bodies and chattering teeth they gazed with protruding eyes at the lifting mat they saw nauri dripping with sea water without her ahu creep in they rolled over backward from her and fought for ngakuras blanket with which to cover their heads  you might give your old mother a drink of water the ghost said plaintively  give her a drink of water tefara commanded in a shaking voice  give her a drink of water mapuhi passed on the command to ngakura  and together they kicked out ngakura from under the blanket a minute later peeping mapuhi saw the ghost drinking when it reached out a shaking hand and laid it on his he felt the weight of it and was convinced that it was no ghost then he emerged dragging tefara after him and in a few minutes all were listening to nauris tale and when she told of levy and dropped the pearl into tefaras hand even she was reconciled to the reality of her motherinlaw  in the morning said tefara you will sell the pearl to raoul for five thousand french  the house objected nauri  he will build the house tefara answered he ways it will cost four thousand french also will he give one thousand french in credit which is two thousand chili  and it will be six fathoms long nauri queried  ay answered mapuhi six fathoms  and in the middle room will be the octagondropclock  ay and the round table as well  then give me something to eat for i am hungry said nauri complacently and after that we will sleep for i am weary and tomorrow we will have more talk about the house before we sell the pearl it will be better if we take the thousand french in cash money is ever better than credit in buying goods from the traders     the whale tooth  it was in the early days in fiji when john starhurst arose in the mission house at rewa village and announced his intention of carrying the gospel throughout all viti levu now viti levu means the great land it being the largest island in a group composed of many large islands to say nothing of hundreds of small ones here and there on the coasts living by most precarious tenure was a sprinkling of missionaries traders bêchedemer fishers and whaleship deserters the smoke of the hot ovens arose under their windows and the bodies of the slain were dragged by their doors on the way to the feasting  the lotu or the worship was progressing slowly and often in crablike fashion chiefs who announced themselves christians and were welcomed into the body of the chapel had a distressing habit of backsliding in order to partake of the flesh of some favorite enemy eat or be eaten had been the law of the land and eat or be eaten promised to remain the law of the land for a long time to come there were chiefs such as tanoa tuiveikoso and tuikilakila who had literally eaten hundreds of their fellow men but among these gluttons ra undreundre ranked highest ra undreundre lived at takiraki he kept a register of his gustatory exploits a row of stones outside his house marked the bodies he had eaten this row was two hundred and thirty paces long and the stones in it numbered eight hundred and seventytwo each stone represented a body the row of stones might have been longer had not ra undreundre unfortunately received a spear in the small of his back in a bush skirmish on somo somo and been served up on the table of naungavuli whose mediocre string of stones numbered only fortyeight  the hardworked feverstricken missionaries stuck doggedly to their task at times despairing and looking forward for some special manifestation some outburst of pentecostal fire that would bring a glorious harvest of souls but cannibal fiji had remained obdurate the frizzleheaded maneaters were loath to leave their fleshpots so long as the harvest of human carcases was plentiful sometimes when the harvest was too plentiful they imposed on the missionaries by letting the word slip out that on such a day there would be a killing and a barbecue promptly the missionaries would buy the lives of the victims with stick tobacco fathoms of calico and quarts of trade beads natheless the chiefs drove a handsome trade in thus disposing of their surplus live meat also they could always go out and catch more  it was at this juncture that john starhurst proclaimed that he would carry the gospel from coast to coast of the great land and that he would begin by penetrating the mountain fastnesses of the headwaters of the rewa river his words were received with consternation  the native teachers wept softly his two fellow missionaries strove to dissuade him the king of rewa warned him that the mountain dwellers would surely kaikai himkaikai meaning to eatand that he the king of rewa having become lotu would be put to the necessity of going to war with the mountain dwellers that he could not conquer them he was perfectly aware that they might come down the river and sack rewa village he was likewise perfectly aware but what was he to do if john starhurst persisted in going out and being eaten there would be a war that would cost hundreds of lives  later in the day a deputation of rewa chiefs waited upon john starhurst he heard them patiently and argued patiently with them though he abated not a whit from his purpose to his fellow missionaries he explained that he was not bent upon martyrdom that the call had come for him to carry the gospel into viti levu and that he was merely obeying the lords wish  to the traders who came and objected most strenuously of all he said your objections are valueless they consist merely of the damage that may be done your businesses you are interested in making money but i am interested in saving souls the heathen of this dark land must be saved  john starhurst was not a fanatic he would have been the first man to deny the imputation he was eminently sane and practical  he was sure that his mission would result in good and he had private visions of igniting the pentecostal spark in the souls of the mountaineers and of inaugurating a revival that would sweep down out of the mountains and across the length and breadth of the great land from sea to sea and to the isles in the midst of the sea there were no wild lights in his mild gray eyes but only calm resolution and an unfaltering trust in the higher power that was guiding him  one man only he found who approved of his project and that was ra vatu who secretly encouraged him and offered to lend him guides to the first foothills john starhurst in turn was greatly pleased by ra vatus conduct from an incorrigible heathen with a heart as black as his practices ra vatu was beginning to emanate light he even spoke of becoming lotu true three years before he had expressed a similar intention and would have entered the church had not john starhurst entered objection to his bringing his four wives along with him ra vatu had had economic and ethical objections to monogamy besides the missionarys hairsplitting objection had offended him and to prove that he was a free agent and a man of honor he had swung his huge war club over starhursts head starhurst had escaped by rushing in under the club and holding on to him until help arrived but all that was now forgiven and forgotten ra vatu was coming into the church not merely as a converted heathen but as a converted polygamist as well he was only waiting he assured starhurst until his oldest wife who was very sick should die  john starhurst journeyed up the sluggish rewa in one of ra vatus canoes this canoe was to carry him for two days when the head of navigation reached it would return far in the distance lifted into the sky could be seen the great smoky mountains that marked the backbone of the great land all day john starhurst gazed at them with eager yearning  sometimes he prayed silently at other times he was joined in prayer by narau a native teacher who for seven years had been lotu ever since the day he had been saved from the hot oven by dr james ellery brown at the trifling expense of one hundred sticks of tobacco two cotton blankets and a large bottle of painkiller at the last moment after twenty hours of solitary supplication and prayer naraus ears had heard the call to go forth with john starhurst on the mission to the mountains  master i will surely go with thee he had announced  john starhurst had hailed him with sober delight truly the lord was with him thus to spur on so brokenspirited a creature as narau  i am indeed without spirit the weakest of the lords vessels narau explained the first day in the canoe  you should have faith stronger faith the missionary chided him  another canoe journeyed up the rewa that day but it journeyed an hour astern and it took care not to be seen this canoe was also the property of ra vatu in it was erirola ra vatus first cousin and trusted henchman and in the small basket that never left his hand was a whale tooth it was a magnificent tooth fully six inches long beautifully proportioned the ivory turned yellow and purple with age this tooth was likewise the property of ra vatu and in fiji when such a tooth goes forth things usually happen for this is the virtue of the whale tooth whoever accepts it cannot refuse the request that may accompany it or follow it the request may be anything from a human life to a tribal alliance and no fijian is so dead to honor as to deny the request when once the tooth has been accepted sometimes the request hangs fire or the fulfilment is delayed with untoward consequences  high up the rewa at the village of a chief mongondro by name john starhurst rested at the end of the second day of the journey in the morning attended by narau he expected to start on foot for the smoky mountains that were now green and velvety with nearness mongondro was a sweettempered mildmannered little old chief shortsighted and afflicted with elephantiasis and no longer inclined toward the turbulence of war he received the missionary with warm hospitality gave him food from his own table and even discussed religious matters with him mongondro was of an inquiring bent of mind and pleased john starhurst greatly by asking him to account for the existence and beginning of things when the missionary had finished his summary of the creation according to genesis he saw that mongondro was deeply affected the little old chief smoked silently for some time then he took the pipe from his mouth and shook his head sadly  it cannot be he said i mongondro in my youth was a good workman with the adze yet three months did it take me to make a canoea small canoe a very small canoe and you say that all this land and water was made by one man  nay was made by one god the only true god the missionary interrupted  it is the same thing mongondro went on that all the land and all the water the trees the fish and bush and mountains the sun the moon and the stars were made in six days no no i tell you that in my youth i was an able man yet did it require me three months for one small canoe it is a story to frighten children with but no man can believe it  i am a man the missionary said  true you are a man but it is not given to my dark understanding to know what you believe  i tell you i do believe that everything was made in six days  so you say so you say the old cannibal murmured soothingly  it was not until after john starhurst and narau had gone off to bed that erirola crept into the chiefs house and after diplomatic speech handed the whale tooth to mongondro  the old chief held the tooth in his hands for a long time it was a beautiful tooth and he yearned for it also he divined the request that must accompany it no no whale teeth were beautiful and his mouth watered for it but he passed it back to erirola with many apologies                               in the early dawn john starhurst was afoot striding along the bush trail in his big leather boots at his heels the faithful narau himself at the heels of a naked guide lent him by mongondro to show the way to the next village which was reached by midday here a new guide showed the way a mile in the rear plodded erirola the whale tooth in the basket slung on his shoulder for two days more he brought up the missionarys rear offering the tooth to the village chiefs but village after village refused the tooth it followed so quickly the missionarys advent that they divined the request that would be made and would have none of it  they were getting deep into the mountains and erirola took a secret trail cut in ahead of the missionary and reached the stronghold of the buli of gatoka now the buli was unaware of john starhursts imminent arrival also the tooth was beautifulan extraordinary specimen while the coloring of it was of the rarest order the tooth was presented publicly the buli of gatoka seated on his best mat surrounded by his chief men three busy flybrushers at his back deigned to receive from the hand of his herald the whale tooth presented by ra vatu and carried into the mountains by his cousin erirola a clapping of hands went up at the acceptance of the present the assembled headman heralds and flybrushers crying aloud in chorus  a woi woi woi a woi woi woi a tabua levu woi woi a mudua mudua mudua  soon will come a man a white man erirola began after the proper pause he is a missionary man and he will come today ra vatu is pleased to desire his boots he wishes to present them to his good friend mongondro and it is in his mind to send them with the feet along in them for mongondro is an old man and his teeth are not good be sure o buli that the feet go along in the boots as for the rest of him it may stop here  the delight in the whale tooth faded out of the bulis eyes and he glanced about him dubiously yet had he already accepted the tooth  a little thing like a missionary does not matter erirola prompted  no a little thing like a missionary does not matter the buli answered himself again mongondro shall have the boots go you young men some three or four of you and meet the missionary on the trail be sure you bring back the boots as well  it is too late said erirola listen he comes now  breaking through the thicket of brush john starhurst with narau close on his heels strode upon the scene the famous boots having filled in wading the stream squirted fine jets of water at every step starhurst looked about him with flashing eyes upborne by an unwavering trust untouched by doubt or fear he exulted in all he saw he knew that since the beginning of time he was the first white man ever to tread the mountain stronghold of gatoka  the grass houses clung to the steep mountain side or overhung the rushing rewa on either side towered a mighty precipice at the best three hours of sunlight penetrated that narrow gorge no cocoanuts nor bananas were to be seen though dense tropic vegetation overran everything dripping in airy festoons from the sheer lips of the precipices and running riot in all the crannied ledges at the far end of the gorge the rewa leaped eight hundred feet in a single span while the atmosphere of the rock fortress pulsed to the rhythmic thunder of the fall  from the bulis house john starhurst saw emerging the buli and his followers  i bring you good tidings was the missionarys greeting  who has sent you the buli rejoined quietly  god  it is a new name in viti levu the buli grinned of what islands villages or passes may he be chief  he is the chief over all islands all villages all passes john starhurst answered solemnly he is the lord over heaven and earth and i am come to bring his word to you  has he sent whale teeth was the insolent query  no but more precious than whale teeth is the  it is the custom between chiefs to send whale teeth the buli interrupted  your chief is either a niggard or you are a fool to come emptyhanded into the mountains behold a more generous than you is before you  so saying he showed the whale tooth he had received from erirola  narau groaned  it is the whale tooth of ra vatu he whispered to starhurst i know it well now are we undone  a gracious thing the missionary answered passing his hand through his long beard and adjusting his glasses ra vatu has arranged that we should be well received  but narau groaned again and backed away from the heels he had dogged so faithfully  ra vatu is soon to become lotu starhurst explained and i have come bringing the lotu to you  i want none of your lotu said the buli proudly and it is in my mind that you will be clubbed this day  the buli nodded to one of his big mountaineers who stepped forward swinging a club narau bolted into the nearest house seeking to hide among the woman and mats but john starhurst sprang in under the club and threw his arms around his executioners neck from this point of vantage he proceeded to argue he was arguing for his life and he knew it but he was neither excited nor afraid  it would be an evil thing for you to kill me he told the man i have done you no wrong nor have i done the buli wrong  so well did he cling to the neck of the one man that they dared not strike with their clubs and he continued to cling and to dispute for his life with those who clamored for his death  i am john starhurst he went on calmly i have labored in fiji for three years and i have done it for no profit i am here among you for good why should any man kill me to kill me will not profit any man  the buli stole a look at the whale tooth he was well paid for the deed  the missionary was surrounded by a mass of naked savages all struggling to get at him the death song which is the song of the oven was raised and his expostulations could no longer be heard but so cunningly did he twine and wreathe his body about his captors that the death blow could not be struck erirola smiled and the buli grew angry  away with you he cried a nice story to go back to the coasta dozen of you and one missionary without weapons weak as a woman overcoming all of you  wait o buli john starhurst called out from the thick of the scuffle and i will overcome even you for my weapons are truth and right and no man can withstand them  come to me then the buli answered for my weapon is only a poor miserable club and as you say it cannot withstand you  the group separated from him and john starhurst stood alone facing the buli who was leaning on an enormous knotted warclub  come to me missionary man and overcome me the buli challenged  even so will i come to you and overcome you john starhurst made answer first wiping his spectacles and settling them properly then beginning his advance  the buli raised the club and waited  in the first place my death will profit you nothing began the argument  i leave the answer to my club was the bulis reply  and to every point he made the same reply at the same time watching the missionary closely in order to forestall that cunning runin under the lifted club then and for the first time john starhurst knew that his death was at hand he made no attempt to run in bareheaded he stood in the sun and prayed aloudthe mysterious figure of the inevitable white man who with bible bullet or rum bottle has confronted the amazed savage in his every stronghold even so stood john starhurst in the rock fortress of the buli of gatoka  forgive them for they know not what they do he prayed o lord have mercy upon fiji have compassion for fiji o jehovah hear us for his sake thy son whom thou didst give that through him all men might also become thy children from thee we came and our mind is that to thee we may return the land is dark o lord the land is dark but thou art mighty to save reach out thy hand o lord and save fiji poor cannibal fiji  the buli grew impatient  now will i answer thee he muttered at the same time swinging his club with both hands  narau hiding among the women and the mats heard the impact of the blow and shuddered then the death song arose and he knew his beloved missionarys body was being dragged to the oven as he heard the words  drag me gently drag me gently  for i am the champion of my land  give thanks give thanks give thanks  next a single voice arose out of the din asking  where is the brave man  a hundred voices bellowed the answer  gone to be dragged into the oven and cooked  where is the coward the single voice demanded  gone to report the hundred voices bellowed back gone to report gone to report  narau groaned in anguish of spirit the words of the old song were true he was the coward and nothing remained to him but to go and report     mauki  he weighed one hundred and ten pounds his hair was kinky and negroid and he was black he was peculiarly black he was neither blueblack nor purpleblack but plumblack his name was mauki and he was the son of a chief he had three tambos tambo is melanesian for taboo and is first cousin to that polynesian word maukis three tambos were as follows first he must never shake hands with a woman nor have a womans hand touch him or any of his personal belongings secondly he must never eat clams nor any food from a fire in which clams had been cooked thirdly he must never touch a crocodile nor travel in a canoe that carried any part of a crocodile even if as large as a tooth  of a different black were his teeth which were deep black or perhaps better lampblack they had been made so in a single night by his mother who had compressed about them a powdered mineral which was dug from the landslide back of port adams port adams is a saltwater village on malaita and malaita is the most savage island in the solomonsso savage that no traders or planters have yet gained a foothold on it while from the time of the earliest bêchedemer fishers and sandalwood traders down to the latest labor recruiters equipped with automatic rifles and gasolene engines scores of white adventurers have been passed out by tomahawks and softnosed snider bullets so malaita remains today in the twentieth century the stamping ground of the labor recruiters who farm its coasts for laborers who engage and contract themselves to toil on the plantations of the neighboring and more civilized islands for a wage of thirty dollars a year the natives of those neighboring and more civilized islands have themselves become too civilized to work on plantations  maukis ears were pierced not in one place nor two places but in a couple of dozen places in one of the smaller holes he carried a clay pipe the larger holes were too large for such use the bowl of the pipe would have fallen through in fact in the largest hole in each ear he habitually wore round wooden plugs that were an even four inches in diameter roughly speaking the circumference of said holes was twelve and onehalf inches mauki was catholic in his tastes in the various smaller holes he carried such things as empty rifle cartridges horseshoe nails copper screws pieces of string braids of sennit strips of green leaf and in the cool of the day scarlet hibiscus flowers from which it will be seen that pockets were not necessary to his wellbeing besides pockets were impossible for his only wearing apparel consisted of a piece of calico several inches wide a pocket knife he wore in his hair the blade snapped down on a kinky lock his most prized possession was the handle of a china cup which he suspended from a ring of turtleshell which in turn was passed through the partitioncartilage of his nose  but in spite of embellishments mauki had a nice face it was really a pretty face viewed by any standard and for a melanesian it was a remarkably goodlooking face its one fault was its lack of strength it was softly effeminate almost girlish the features were small regular and delicate the chin was weak and the mouth was weak there was no strength nor character in the jaws forehead and nose in the eyes only could be caught any hint of the unknown quantities that were so large a part of his makeup and that other persons could not understand these unknown quantities were pluck pertinacity fearlessness imagination and cunning and when they found expression in some consistent and striking action those about him were astounded  maukis father was chief over the village at port adams and thus by birth a saltwater man mauki was half amphibian he knew the way of the fishes and oysters and the reef was an open book to him canoes also he knew he learned to swim when he was a year old at seven years he could hold his breath a full minute and swim straight down to bottom through thirty feet of water and at seven years he was stolen by the bushmen who cannot even swim and who are afraid of salt water thereafter mauki saw the sea only from a distance through rifts in the jungle and from open spaces on the high mountain sides he became the slave of old fanfoa head chief over a score of scattered bushvillages on the rangelips of malaita the smoke of which on calm mornings is about the only evidence the seafaring white men have of the teeming interior population for the whites do not penetrate malaita they tried it once in the days when the search was on for gold but they always left their heads behind to grin from the smoky rafters of the bushmens huts  when mauki was a young man of seventeen fanfoa got out of tobacco he got dreadfully out of tobacco it was hard times in all his villages he had been guilty of a mistake suo was a harbor so small that a large schooner could not swing at anchor in it it was surrounded by mangroves that overhung the deep water it was a trap and into the trap sailed two white men in a small ketch they were after recruits and they possessed much tobacco and trade goods to say nothing of three rifles and plenty of ammunition now there were no saltwater men living at suo and it was there that the bushmen could come down to the sea the ketch did a splendid traffic it signed on twenty recruits the first day even old fanfoa signed on and that same day the score of new recruits chopped off the two white mens head killed the boats crew and burned the ketch thereafter and for three months there was tobacco and trade goods in plenty and to spare in all the bush villages then came the manofwar that threw shells for miles into the hills frightening the people out of their villages and into the deeper bush next the manofwar sent landing parties ashore the villages were all burned along with the tobacco and trade stuff  the cocoanuts and bananas were chopped down the taro gardens uprooted and the pigs and chickens killed  it taught fanfoa a lesson but in the meantime he was out of tobacco also his young men were too frightened to sign on with the recruiting vessels that was why fanfoa ordered his slave mauki to be carried down and signed on for half a case of tobacco advance along with knives axes calico and beads which he would pay for with his toil on the plantations mauki was sorely frightened when they brought him on board the schooner he was a lamb led to the slaughter white men were ferocious creatures they had to be or else they would not make a practice of venturing along the malaita coast and into all harbors two on a schooner when each schooner carried from fifteen to twenty blacks as boats crew and often as high as sixty or seventy black recruits in addition to this there was always the danger of the shore population the sudden attack and the cutting off of the schooner and all hands truly white men must be terrible besides they were possessed of such devildevilsrifles that shot very rapidly many times things of iron and brass that made the schooners go when there was no wind and boxes that talked and laughed just as men talked and laughed  ay and he had heard of one white man whose particular devildevil was so powerful that he could take out all his teeth and put them back at will  down into the cabin they took mauki on deck the one white man kept guard with two revolvers in his belt in the cabin the other white man sat with a book before him in which he inscribed strange marks and lines he looked at mauki as though he had been a pig or a fowl glanced under the hollows of his arms and wrote in the book then he held out the writing stick and mauki just barely touched it with his hand in so doing pledging himself to toil for three years on the plantations of the moongleam soap company it was not explained to him that the will of the ferocious white men would be used to enforce the pledge and that behind all for the same use was all the power and all the warships of great britain  other blacks there were on board from unheardof far places and when the white man spoke to them they tore the long feather from maukis hair cut that same hair short and wrapped about his waist a lavalava of bright yellow calico  after many days on the schooner and after beholding more land and islands than he had ever dreamed of he was landed on new georgia and put to work in the field clearing jungle and cutting cane grass for the first time he knew what work was even as a slave to fanfoa he had not worked like this and he did not like work it was up at dawn and in at dark on two meals a day and the food was tiresome for weeks at a time they were given nothing but sweet potatoes to eat and for weeks at a time it would be nothing but rice he cut out the cocoanut from the shells day after day and for long days and weeks he fed the fires that smoked the copra till his eyes got sore and he was set to felling trees he was a good axeman and later he was put in the bridgebuilding gang once he was punished by being put in the roadbuilding gang at times he served as boats crew in the whale boats when they brought in copra from distant beaches or when the white men went out to dynamite fish  among other things he learned bechedemer english with which he could talk with all white men and with all recruits who otherwise would have talked in a thousand different dialects also he learned certain things about the white men principally that they kept their word if they told a boy he was going to receive a stick of tobacco he got it if they told a boy they would knock seven bells out of him if he did a certain thing when he did that thing seven bells invariably were knocked out of him mauki did not know what seven bells were but they occurred in bechedemer and he imagined them to be the blood and teeth that sometimes accompanied the process of knocking out seven bells one other thing he learned no boy was struck or punished unless he did wrong even when the white men were drunk as they were frequently they never struck unless a rule had been broken  mauki did not like the plantation he hated work and he was the son of a chief furthermore it was ten years since he had been stolen from port adams by fanfoa and he was homesick he was even homesick for the slavery under fanfoa so he ran away he struck back into the bush with the idea of working southward to the beach and stealing a canoe in which to go home to port adams  but the fever got him and he was captured and brought back more dead than alive  a second time he ran away in the company of two malaita boys they got down the coast twenty miles and were hidden in the hut of a malaita freeman who dwelt in that village but in the dead of night two white men came who were not afraid of all the village people and who knocked seven bells out of the three runaways tied them like pigs and tossed them into the whale boat but the man in whose house they had hiddenseven times seven bells must have been knocked out of him from the way the hair skin and teeth flew and he was discouraged for the rest of his natural life from harboring runaway laborers  for a year mauki toiled on then he was made a houseboy and had good food and easy times with light work in keeping the house clean and serving the white men with whiskey and beer at all hours of the day and most hours of the night he liked it but he liked port adams more he had two years longer to serve but two years were too long for him in the throes of homesickness he had grown wiser with his year of service and being now a houseboy he had opportunity he had the cleaning of the rifles and he knew where the key to the store room was hung he planned to escape and one night ten malaita boys and one boy from san cristoval sneaked from the barracks and dragged one of the whale boats down to the beach it was mauki who supplied the key that opened the padlock on the boat and it was mauki who equipped the boat with a dozen winchesters an immense amount of ammunition a case of dynamite with detonators and fuse and ten cases of tobacco  the northwest monsoon was blowing and they fled south in the night time hiding by day on detached and uninhabited islets or dragging their whale boat into the bush on the large islands thus they gained guadalcanar skirted halfway along it and crossed the indispensable straits to florida island it was here that they killed the san cristoval boy saving his head and cooking and eating the rest of him the malaita coast was only twenty miles away but the last night a strong current and baffling winds prevented them from gaining across daylight found them still several miles from their goal but daylight brought a cutter in which were two white men who were not afraid of eleven malaita men armed with twelve rifles mauki and his companions were carried back to tulagi where lived the great white master of all the white men and the great white master held a court after which one by one the runaways were tied up and given twenty lashes each and sentenced to a fine of fifteen dollars they were sent back to new georgia where the white men knocked seven bells out of them all around and put them to work but mauki was no longer houseboy he was put in the roadmaking gang the fine of fifteen dollars had been paid by the white men from whom he had run away and he was told that he would have to work it out which meant six months additional toil further his share of the stolen tobacco earned him another year of toil  port adams was now three years and a half away so he stole a canoe one night hid on the islets in manning straits passed through the straits and began working along the eastern coast of ysabel only to be captured twothirds of the way along by the white men on meringe lagoon after a week he escaped from them and took to the bush there were no bush natives on ysabel only saltwater men who were all christians the white men put up a reward of fivehundred sticks of tobacco and every time mauki ventured down to the sea to steal a canoe he was chased by the saltwater men four months of this passed when the reward having been raised to a thousand sticks he was caught and sent back to new georgia and the roadbuilding gang now a thousand sticks are worth fifty dollars and mauki had to pay the reward himself which required a year and eight months labor so port adams was now five years away  his homesickness was greater than ever and it did not appeal to him to settle down and be good work out his four years and go home the next time he was caught in the very act of running away his case was brought before mr haveby the island manager of the moongleam soap company who adjudged him an incorrigible the company had plantations on the santa cruz islands hundreds of miles across the sea and there it sent its solomon islands incorrigibles and there mauki was sent though he never arrived the schooner stopped at santa anna and in the night mauki swam ashore where he stole two rifles and a case of tobacco from the trader and got away in a canoe to cristoval malaita was now to the north fifty or sixty miles away but when he attempted the passage he was caught by a light gale and driven back to santa anna where the trader clapped him in irons and held him against the return of the schooner from santa cruz the two rifles the trader recovered but the case of tobacco was charged up to mauki at the rate of another year the sum of years he now owed the company was six  on the way back to new georgia the schooner dropped anchor in marau sound which lies at the southeastern extremity of guadalcanar mauki swam ashore with handcuffs on his wrists and got away to the bush the schooner went on but the moongleam trader ashore offered a thousand sticks and to him mauki was brought by the bushmen with a year and eight months tacked on to his account again and before the schooner called in he got away this time in a whale boat accompanied by a case of the traders tobacco but a northwest gale wrecked him upon ugi where the christian natives stole his tobacco and turned him over to the moongleam trader who resided there the tobacco the natives stole meant another year for him and the tale was now eight years and a half  well send him to lord howe said mr haveby bunster is there and well let them settle it between them it will be a case i imagine of mauki getting bunster or bunster getting mauki and good riddance in either event  if one leaves meringe lagoon on ysabel and steers a course due north magnetic at the end of one hundred and fifty miles he will lift the pounded coral beaches of lord howe above the sea lord howe is a ring of land some one hundred and fifty miles in circumference several hundred yards wide at its widest and towering in places to a height of ten feet above sea level inside this ring of sand is a mighty lagoon studded with coral patches lord howe belongs to the solomons neither geographically nor ethnologically it is an atoll while the solomons are high islands and its people and language are polynesian while the inhabitants of the solomons are melanesian  lord howe has been populated by the westward polynesian drift which continues to this day big outrigger canoes being washed upon its beaches by the southeast trade that there has been a slight melanesian drift in the period of the northwest monsoon is also evident  nobody ever comes to lord howe or ontongjava as it is sometimes called thomas cook  son do not sell tickets to it and tourists do not dream of its existence not even a white missionary has landed on its shore its five thousand natives are as peaceable as they are primitive yet they were not always peaceable the sailing directions speak of them as hostile and treacherous but the men who compile the sailing directions have never heard of the change that was worked in the hearts of the inhabitants who not many years ago cut off a big bark and killed all hands with the exception of the second mate the survivor carried the news to his brothers the captains of three trading schooners returned with him to lord howe they sailed their vessels right into the lagoon and proceeded to preach the white mans gospel that only white men shall kill white men and that the lesser breeds must keep hands off the schooners sailed up and down the lagoon harrying and destroying there was no escape from the narrow sandcircle no bush to which to flee the men were shot down at sight and there was no avoiding being sighted the villages were burned the canoes smashed the chickens and pigs killed and the precious cocoanut trees chopped down for a month this continued when the schooner sailed away but the fear of the white man had been seared into the souls of the islanders and never again were they rash enough to harm one  max bunster was the one white man on lord howe trading in the pay of the ubiquitous moongleam soap company and the company billeted him on lord howe because next to getting rid of him it was the most outoftheway place to be found that the company did not get rid of him was due to the difficulty of finding another man to take his place he was a strapping big german with something wrong in his brain semimadness would be a charitable statement of his condition he was a bully and a coward and a thricebigger savage than any savage on the island  being a coward his brutality was of the cowardly order when he first went into the companys employ he was stationed on savo when a consumptive colonial was sent to take his place he beat him up with his fists and sent him off a wreck in the schooner that brought him  mr haveby next selected a young yorkshire giant to relieve bunster the yorkshire man had a reputation as a bruiser and preferred fighting to eating but bunster wouldnt fight he was a regular little lambfor ten days at the end of which time the yorkshire man was prostrated by a combined attack of dysentery and fever then bunster went for him among other things getting him down and jumping on him a score or so of times afraid of what would happen when his victim recovered bunster fled away in a cutter to guvutu where he signalized himself by beating up a young englishman already crippled by a boer bullet through both hips  then it was that mr haveby sent bunster to lord howe the fallingoff place he celebrated his landing by mopping up half a case of gin and by thrashing the elderly and wheezy mate of the schooner which had brought him when the schooner departed he called the kanakas down to the beach and challenged them to throw him in a wrestling bout promising a case of tobacco to the one who succeeded three kanakas he threw but was promptly thrown by a fourth who instead of receiving the tobacco got a bullet through his lungs  and so began bunsters reign on lord howe three thousand people lived in the principal village but it was deserted even in broad day when he passed through men women and children fled before him even the dogs and pigs got out of the way while the king was not above hiding under a mat the two prime ministers lived in terror of bunster who never discussed any moot subject but struck out with his fists instead  and to lord howe came mauki to toil for bunster for eight long years and a half there was no escaping from lord howe for better or worse bunster and he were tied together bunster weighed two hundred pounds mauki weighed one hundred and ten bunster was a degenerate brute but mauki was a primitive savage while both had wills and ways of their own  mauki had no idea of the sort of master he was to work for he had had no warnings and he had concluded as a matter of course that bunster would be like other white men a drinker of much whiskey a ruler and a lawgiver who always kept his word and who never struck a boy undeserved bunster had the advantage he knew all about mauki and gloated over the coming into possession of him the last cook was suffering from a broken arm and a dislocated shoulder so bunster made mauki cook and general houseboy  and mauki soon learned that there were white men and white men on the very day the schooner departed he was ordered to buy a chicken from samisee the native tongan missionary but samisee had sailed across the lagoon and would not be back for three days mauki returned with the information he climbed the steep stairway the house stood on piles twelve feet above the sand and entered the living room to report the trader demanded the chicken mauki opened his mouth to explain the missionarys absence but bunster did not care for explanations he struck out with his fist the blow caught mauki on the mouth and lifted him into the air clear through the doorway he flew across the narrow veranda breaking the top railing and down to the ground  his lips were a contused shapeless mass and his mouth was full of blood and broken teeth  thatll teach you that back talk dont go with me the trader shouted purple with rage peering down at him over the broken railing  mauki had never met a white man like this and he resolved to walk small and never offend he saw the boat boys knocked about and one of them put in irons for three days with nothing to eat for the crime of breaking a rowlock while pulling then too he heard the gossip of the village and learned why bunster had taken a third wifeby force as was well known the first and second wives lay in the graveyard under the white coral sand with slabs of coral rock at head and feet they had died it was said from beatings he had given them the third wife was certainly illused as mauki could see for himself  but there was no way by which to avoid offending the white man who seemed offended with life when mauki kept silent he was struck and called a sullen brute when he spoke he was struck for giving back talk when he was grave bunster accused him of plotting and gave him a thrashing in advance and when he strove to be cheerful and to smile he was charged with sneering at his lord and master and given a taste of stick bunster was a devil  the village would have done for him had it not remembered the lesson of the three schooners it might have done for him anyway if there had been a bush to which to flee as it was the murder of the white men of any white man would bring a manofwar that would kill the offenders and chop down the precious cocoanut trees then there were the boat boys with minds fully made up to drown him by accident at the first opportunity to capsize the cutter only bunster saw to it that the boat did not capsize  mauki was of a different breed and escape being impossible while bunster lived he was resolved to get the white man the trouble was that he could never find a chance bunster was always on guard day and night his revolvers were ready to hand he permitted nobody to pass behind his back as mauki learned after having been knocked down several times bunster knew that he had more to fear from the goodnatured even sweetfaced malaita boy than from the entire population of lord howe and it gave added zest to the programme of torment he was carrying out and mauki walked small accepted his punishments and waited  all other white men had respected his tambos but not so bunster  maukis weekly allowance of tobacco was two sticks bunster passed them to his woman and ordered mauki to receive them from her hand but this could not be and mauki went without his tobacco in the same way he was made to miss many a meal and to go hungry many a day he was ordered to make chowder out of the big clams that grew in the lagoon this he could not do for clams were tambo six times in succession he refused to touch the clams and six times he was knocked senseless bunster knew that the boy would die first but called his refusal mutiny and would have killed him had there been another cook to take his place  one of the traders favorite tricks was to catch maukis kinky locks and bat his head against the wall another trick was to catch mauki unawares and thrust the live end of a cigar against his flesh this bunster called vaccination and mauki was vaccinated a number of times a week once in a rage bunster ripped the cup handle from maukis nose tearing the hole clear out of the cartilage  oh what a mug was his comment when he surveyed the damage he had wrought  the skin of a shark is like sandpaper but the skin of a ray fish is like a rasp in the south seas the natives use it as a wood file in smoothing down canoes and paddles bunster had a mitten made of ray fish skin the first time he tried it on mauki with one sweep of the hand it fetched the skin off his back from neck to armpit bunster was delighted he gave his wife a taste of the mitten and tried it out thoroughly on the boat boys the prime ministers came in for a stroke each and they had to grin and take it for a joke  laugh damn you laugh was the cue he gave  mauki came in for the largest share of the mitten never a day passed without a caress from it there were times when the loss of so much cuticle kept him awake at night and often the halfhealed surface was raked raw afresh by the facetious mr bunster mauki continued his patient wait secure in the knowledge that sooner or later his time would come and he knew just what he was going to do down to the smallest detail when the time did come  one morning bunster got up in a mood for knocking seven bells out of the universe he began on mauki and wound up on mauki in the interval knocking down his wife and hammering all the boat boys at breakfast he called the coffee slops and threw the scalding contents of the cup into maukis face by ten oclock bunster was shivering with ague and half an hour later he was burning with fever it was no ordinary attack it quickly became pernicious and developed into blackwater fever the days passed and he grew weaker and weaker never leaving his bed mauki waited and watched the while his skin grew intact once more he ordered the boys to beach the cutter scrub her bottom and give her a general overhauling they thought the order emanated from bunster and they obeyed but bunster at the time was lying unconscious and giving no orders this was maukis chance but still he waited  when the worst was past and bunster lay convalescent and conscious but weak as a baby mauki packed his few trinkets including the china cup handle into his trade box then he went over to the village and interviewed the king and his two prime ministers  this fella bunster him good fella you like too much he asked  they explained in one voice that they liked the trader not at all the ministers poured forth a recital of all the indignities and wrongs that had been heaped upon them the king broke down and wept mauki interrupted rudely  you savve meme big fella marster my country you no like m this fella white marster me no like m plenty good you put hundred cocoanut two hundred cocoanut three hundred cocoanut along cutter him finish you go sleep m good fella altogether kanaka sleep m good fella bime by big fella noise along house you no savve hear m that fella noise you altogether sleep strong fella too much  in like manner mauki interviewed the boat boys then he ordered bunsters wife to return to her family house had she refused he would have been in a quandary for his tambo would not have permitted him to lay hands on her  the house deserted he entered the sleeping room where the trader lay in a doze mauki first removed the revolvers then placed the ray fish mitten on his hand bunsters first warning was a stroke of the mitten that removed the skin the full length of his nose  good fella eh mauki grinned between two strokes one of which swept the forehead bare and the other of which cleaned off one side of his face laugh damn you laugh  mauki did his work throughly and the kanakas hiding in their houses heard the big fella noise that bunster made and continued to make for an hour or more  when mauki was done he carried the boat compass and all the rifles and ammunition down to the cutter which he proceeded to ballast with cases of tobacco it was while engaged in this that a hideous skinless thing came out of the house and ran screaming down the beach till it fell in the sand and mowed and gibbered under the scorching sun mauki looked toward it and hesitated then he went over and removed the head which he wrapped in a mat and stowed in the stern locker of the cutter  so soundly did the kanakas sleep through that long hot day that they did not see the cutter run out through the passage and head south closehauled on the southeast trade nor was the cutter ever sighted on that long tack to the shores of ysabel and during the tedious headbeat from there to malaita he landed at port adams with a wealth of rifles and tobacco such as no one man had ever possessed before but he did not stop there he had taken a white mans head and only the bush could shelter him so back he went to the bush villages where he shot old fanfoa and half a dozen of the chief men and made himself the chief over all the villages when his father died maukis brother ruled in port adams and joined together saltwater men and bushmen the resulting combination was the strongest of the ten score fighting tribes of malaita  more than his fear of the british government was maukis fear of the allpowerful moongleam soap company and one day a message came up to him in the bush reminding him that he owed the company eight and onehalf years of labor he sent back a favorable answer and then appeared the inevitable white man the captain of the schooner the only white man during maukis reign who ventured the bush and came out alive this man not only came out but he brought with him seven hundred and fifty dollars in gold sovereignsthe money price of eight years and a half of labor plus the cost price of certain rifles and cases of tobacco  mauki no longer weighs one hundred and ten pounds his stomach is three times its former girth and he has four wives he has many other thingsrifles and revolvers the handle of a china cup and an excellent collection of bushmens heads but more precious than the entire collection is another head perfectly dried and cured with sandy hair and a yellowish beard which is kept wrapped in the finest of fibre lavalavas when mauki goes to war with villages beyond his realm he invariably gets out this head and alone in his grass palace contemplates it long and solemnly at such times the hush of death falls on the village and not even a pickaninny dares make a noise the head is esteemed the most powerful devildevil on malaita and to the possession of it is ascribed all of maukis greatness     yah yah yah  he was a whiskeyguzzling scotchman and he downed his whiskey neat beginning with his first tot punctually at six in the morning and thereafter repeating it at regular intervals throughout the day till bedtime which was usually midnight he slept but five hours out of the twentyfour and for the remaining nineteen hours he was quietly and decently drunk during the eight weeks i spent with him on oolong atoll i never saw him draw a sober breath in fact his sleep was so short that he never had time to sober up it was the most beautiful and orderly perennial drunk i have ever observed  mcallister was his name he was an old man and very shaky on his pins his hand trembled as with a palsy especially noticeable when he poured his whiskey though i never knew him to spill a drop he had been twentyeight years in melanesia ranging from german new guinea to the german solomons and so thoroughly had he become identified with that portion of the world that he habitually spoke in that bastard lingo called bechdemer thus in conversation with me sun he come up meant sunrise kaikai he stop meant that dinner was served and belly belong me walk about meant that he was sick at his stomach he was a small man and a withered one burned inside and outside by ardent spirits and ardent sun he was a cinder a bit of a clinker of a man a little animated clinker not yet quite cold that moved stiffly and by starts and jerks like an automaton a gust of wind would have blown him away he weighed ninety pounds  but the immense thing about him was the power with which he ruled oolong atoll was one hundred and forty miles in circumference one steered by compass course in its lagoon it was populated by five thousand polynesians all strapping men and women many of them standing six feet in height and weighing a couple of hundred pounds oolong was two hundred and fifty miles from the nearest land twice a year a little schooner called to collect copra the one white man on oolong was mcallister petty trader and unintermittent guzzler and he ruled oolong and its six thousand savages with an iron hand he said come and they came go and they went they never questioned his will nor judgment he was cantankerous as only an aged scotchman can be and interfered continually in their personal affairs when nugu the kings daughter wanted to marry haunau from the other end of the atoll her father said yes but mcallister said no and the marriage never came off when the king wanted to buy a certain islet in the lagoon from the chief priest mcallister said no the king was in debt to the company to the tune of 180000 cocoanuts and until that was paid he was not to spend a single cocoanut on anything else  and yet the king and his people did not love mcallister in truth they hated him horribly and to my knowledge the whole population with the priests at the head tried vainly for three months to pray him to death the devildevils they sent after him were aweinspiring but since mcallister did not believe in devildevils they were without power over him with drunken scotchmen all signs fail they gathered up scraps of food which had touched his lips an empty whiskey bottle a cocoanut from which he had drunk and even his spittle and performed all kinds of deviltries over them but mcallister lived on his health was superb he never caught fever nor coughs nor colds dysentery passed him by and the malignant ulcers and vile skin diseases that attack blacks and whites alike in that climate never fastened upon him he must have been so saturated with alcohol as to defy the lodgment of germs i used to imagine them falling to the ground in showers of microscopic cinders as fast as they entered his whiskeysodden aura no one loved him not even germs while he loved only whiskey and still he lived  i was puzzled i could not understand six thousand natives putting up with that withered shrimp of a tyrant it was a miracle that he had not died suddenly long since unlike the cowardly melanesians the people were highstomached and warlike in the big graveyard at head and feet of the graves were relics of past sanguinary historyblubberspades rusty old bayonets and cutlasses copper bolts rudderirons harpoons bomb guns bricks that could have come from nowhere but a whalers tryingout furnace and old brass pieces of the sixteenth century that verified the traditions of the early spanish navigators ship after ship had come to grief on oolong not thirty years before the whaler blennerdale running into the lagoon for repair had been cut off with all hands in similar fashion had the crew of the gasket a sandalwood trader perished there was a big french bark the toulon becalmed off the atoll which the islanders boarded after a sharp tussle and wrecked in the lipau passage the captain and a handful of sailors escaping in the longboat then there were the spanish pieces which told of the loss of one of the early explorers all this of the vessels named is a matter of history and is to be found in the south pacific sailing directory but that there was other history unwritten i was yet to learn in the meantime i puzzled why six thousand primitive savages let one degenerate scotch despot live  one hot afternoon mcallister and i sat on the veranda looking out over the lagoon with all its wonder of jeweled colors at our backs across the hundred yards of palmstudded sand the outer surf roared on the reef it was dreadfully warm we were in four degree south latitude and the sun was directly overhead having crossed the line a few days before on its journey south there was no windnot even a catspaw the season of the southeast trade was drawing to an early close and the northwest monsoon had not yet begun to blow  they cant dance worth a damn said mcallister  i had happened to mention that the polynesian dances were superior to the papuan and this mcallister had denied for no other reason than his cantankerousness but it was too hot to argue and i said nothing besides i had never seen the oolong people dance  ill prove it to you he announced beckoning to the black new hanover boy a labor recruit who served as cook and general house servant hey you boy you tell m one fella king come along me  the boy departed and back came the prime minister perturbed ill at ease and garrulous with apologetic explanation in short the king slept and was not to be disturbed  king he plenty strong fella sleep was his final sentence  mcallister was in such a rage that the prime minister incontinently fled to return with the king himself they were a magnificent pair the king especially who must have been all of six feet three inches in height his features had the eaglelike quality that is so frequently found in those of the north american indian he had been molded and born to rule his eyes flashed as he listened but right meekly he obeyed mcallisters command to fetch a couple of hundred of the best dancers male and female in the village and dance they did for two mortal hours under that broiling sun they did not love him for it and little he cared in the end dismissing them with abuse and sneers  the abject servility of those magnificent savages was terrifying how could it be what was the secret of his rule more and more i puzzled as the days went by and though i observed perpetual examples of his undisputed sovereignty never a clew was there as to how it was  one day i happened to speak of my disappointment in failing to trade for a beautiful pair of orange cowries the pair was worth five pounds in sydney if it was worth a cent i had offered two hundred sticks of tobacco to the owner who had held out for three hundred when i casually mentioned the situation mcallister immediately sent for the man took the shells from him and turned them over to me fifty sticks were all he permitted me to pay for them the man accepted the tobacco and seemed overjoyed at getting off so easily as for me i resolved to keep a bridle on my tongue in the future and still i mulled over the secret of mcallisters power i even went to the extent of asking him directly but all he did was to cock one eye look wise and take another drink  one night i was out fishing in the lagoon with oti the man who had been mulcted of the cowries privily i had made up to him an additional hundred and fifty sticks and he had come to regard me with a respect that was almost veneration which was curious seeing that he was an old man twice my age at least  what name you fella kanaka all the same pickaninny i began on him this fella trader he one fella you fella kanaka plenty fella too much you fella kanaka just like m dogplenty fright along that fella trader he no eat you fella he no get m teeth along him what name you too much fright  spose

fright  old otis pride had been touched for he suddenly stripped down his lavalava and showed me the unmistakable scar of a bullet before i could speak his line ran out suddenly he checked it and attempted to haul in but found that the fish had run around a coral branch casting a look of reproach at me for having beguiled him from his watchfulness he went over the side feet first turning over after he got under and following his line down to bottom the water was ten fathoms i leaned over and watched the play of his feet growing dim and dimmer as they stirred the wan phosphorescence into ghostly fires ten fathomssixty feetit was nothing to him an old man compared with the value of a hook and line after what seemed five minutes though it could not have been more than a minute i saw him flaming whitely upward he broke surface and dropped a ten pound rock cod into the canoe the line and hook intact the latter still fast in the fishs mouth  it may be i said remorselessly you no fright long ago you plenty fright now along that fella trader  yes plenty fright he confessed with an air of dismissing the subject for half an hour we pulled up our lines and flung them out in silence then small fishsharks began to bite and after losing a hook apiece we hauled in and waited for the sharks to go their way  i speak you true oti broke into speech then you savve we fright now  i lighted up my pipe and waited and the story that oti told me in atrocious bechdemer i here turn into proper english otherwise in spirit and order of narrative the tale is as it fell from otis lips  it was after that that we were very proud we had fought many times with the strange white men who live upon the sea and always we had beaten them a few of us were killed but what was that compared with the stores of wealth of a thousand thousand kinds that we found on the ships and then one day maybe twenty years ago or twentyfive there came a schooner right through the passage and into the lagoon it was a large schooner with three masts she had five white men and maybe forty boats crew black fellows from new guinea and new britain and she had come to fish bechedemer she lay at anchor across the lagoon from here at pauloo and her boats scattered out everywhere making camps on the beaches where they cured the bechedemer this made them weak by dividing them for those who fished here and those on the schooner at pauloo were fifty miles apart and there were others farther away still  our king and headmen held council and i was one in the canoe that paddled all afternoon and all night across the lagoon bringing word to the people of pauloo that in the morning we would attack the fishing camps at the one time and that it was for them to take the schooner we who brought the word were tired with the paddling but we took part in the attack on the schooner were two white men the skipper and the second mate with half a dozen black boys the skipper with three boys we caught on shore and killed but first eight of us the skipper killed with his two revolvers we fought close together you see at hand grapples  the noise of our fighting told the mate what was happening and he put food and water and a sail in the small dingy which was so small that it was no more than twelve feet long we came down upon the schooner a thousand men covering the lagoon with our canoes also we were blowing conch shells singing war songs and striking the sides of the canoes with our paddles what chance had one white man and three black boys against us no chance at all and the mate knew it  white men are hell i have watched them much and i am an old man now and i understand at last why the white men have taken to themselves all the islands in the sea it is because they are hell here are you in the canoe with me you are hardly more than a boy you are not wise for each day i tell you many things you do not know when i was a little pickaninny i knew more about fish and the ways of fish than you know now i am an old man but i swim down to the bottom of the lagoon and you cannot follow me what are you good for anyway i do not know except to fight i have never seen you fight yet i know that you are like your brothers and that you will fight like hell also you are a fool like your brothers you do not know when you are beaten you will fight until you die and then it will be too late to know that you are beaten  now behold what this mate did as we came down upon him covering the sea and blowing our conches he put off from the schooner in the small boat along with the three black boys and rowed for the passage there again he was a fool for no wise man would put out to sea in so small a boat the sides of it were not four inches above the water twenty canoes went after him filled with two hundred young men we paddled five fathoms while his black boys were rowing one fathom he had no chance but he was a fool he stood up in the boat with a rifle and he shot many times he was not a good shot but as we drew close many of us were wounded and killed but still he had no chance  i remember that all the time he was smoking a cigar when we were forty feet away and coming fast he dropped the rifle lighted a stick of dynamite with the cigar and threw it at us he lighted another and another and threw them at us very rapidly many of them i know now that he must have split the ends of the fuses and stuck in match heads because they lighted so quickly also the fuses were very short sometimes the dynamite sticks went off in the air but most of them went off in the canoes and each time they went off in a canoe that canoe was finished of the twenty canoes the half were smashed to pieces the canoe i was in was so smashed and likewise the two men who sat next to me the dynamite fell between them the other canoes turned and ran away then that mate yelled yah yah yah at us also he went at us again with his rifle so that many were killed through the back as they fled away and all the time the black boys in the boat went on rowing you see i told you true that mate was hell  nor was that all before he left the schooner he set her on fire and fixed up all the powder and dynamite so that it would go off at one time there were hundreds of us on board trying to put out the fire heaving up water from overside when the schooner blew up so that all we had fought for was lost to us besides many more of us being killed sometimes even now in my old age i have bad dreams in which i hear that mate yell yah yah yah in a voice of thunder he yells yah yah yah but all those in the fishing camps were killed  the mate went out of the passage in his little boat and that was the end of him we made sure for how could so small a boat with four men in it live on the ocean a month went by and then one morning between two rain squalls a schooner sailed in through our passage and dropped anchor before the village the king and the headmen made big talk and it was agreed that we would take the schooner in two or three days in the meantime as it was our custom always to appear friendly we went off to her in canoes bringing strings of cocoanuts fowls and pigs to trade but when we were alongside many canoes of us the men on board began to shoot us with rifles and as we paddled away i saw the mate who had gone to sea in the little boat spring upon the rail and dance and yell yah yah yah  that afternoon they landed from the schooner in three small boats filled with white men they went right through the village shooting every man they saw also they shot the fowls and pigs we who were not killed got away in canoes and paddled out into the lagoon looking back we could see all the houses on fire late in the afternoon we saw many canoes coming from nihi which is the village near the nihi passage in the northeast they were all that were left and like us their village had been burned by a second schooner that had come through nihi passage  we stood on in the darkness to the westward for pauloo but in the middle of the night we heard women wailing and then we ran into a big fleet of canoes they were all that were left of pauloo which likewise was in ashes for a third schooner had come in through the pauloo passage you see that mate with his black boys had not been drowned he had made the solomon islands and there told his brothers of what we had done in oolong and all his brothers had said they would come and punish us and there they were in the three schooners and our three villages were wiped out  and what was there for us to do in the morning the two schooners from windward sailed down upon us in the middle of the lagoon the trade wind was blowing fresh and by scores of canoes they ran us down and the rifles never ceased talking we scattered like flying fish before the bonita and there were so many of us that we escaped by thousands this way and that to the islands on the rim of the atoll  and thereafter the schooners hunted us up and down the lagoon in the nighttime we slipped past them but the next day or in two days or three days the schooners would be coming back hunting us toward the other end of the lagoon and so it went we no longer counted nor remembered our dead true we were many and they were few but what could we do i was in one of the twenty canoes filled with men who were not afraid to die we attacked the smallest schooner they shot us down in heaps they threw dynamite into the canoes and when the dynamite gave out they threw hot water down upon us and the rifles never ceased talking and those whose canoes were smashed were shot as they swam away and the mate danced up and down upon the cabin top and yelled yah yah yah  every house on every smallest island was burned not a pig nor a fowl was left alive our wells were defiled with the bodies of the slain or else heaped high with coral rock we were twentyfive thousand on oolong before the three schooners came today we are five thousand after the schooners left we were but three thousand as you shall see  at last the three schooners grew tired of chasing us back and forth so they went the three of them to nihi in the northeast and then they drove us steadily to the west their nine boats were in the water as well they beat up every island as they moved along they drove us drove us drove us day by day and every night the three schooners and the nine boats made a chain of watchfulness that stretched across the lagoon from rim to rim so that we could not escape back  they could not drive us forever that way for the lagoon was only so large and at last all of us that yet lived were driven upon the last sand bank to the west beyond lay the open sea there were ten thousand of us and we covered the sand bank from the lagoon edge to the pounding surf on the other side no one could lie down there was no room we stood hip to hip and shoulder to shoulder two days they kept us there and the mate would climb up in the rigging to mock us and yell yah yah yah till we were well sorry that we had ever harmed him or his schooner a month before we had no food and we stood on our feet two days and nights the little babies died and the old and weak died and the wounded died and worst of all we had no water to quench our thirst and for two days the sun beat down on us and there was no shade many men and women waded out into the ocean and were drowned the surf casting their bodies back on the beach and there came a pest of flies some men swam to the sides of the schooners but they were shot to the last one and we that lived were very sorry that in our pride we tried to take the schooner with the three masts that came to fish for bechedemer  on the morning of the third day came the skippers of the three schooners and that mate in a small boat they carried rifles all of them and revolvers and they made talk it was only that they were weary of killing us that they had stopped they told us and we told them that we were sorry that never again would we harm a white man and in token of our submission we poured sand upon our heads and all the women and children set up a great wailing for water so that for some time no man could make himself heard then we were told our punishment we must fill the three schooners with copra and bechedemer and we agreed for we wanted water and our hearts were broken and we knew that we were children at fighting when we fought with white men who fight like hell and when all the talk was finished the mate stood up and mocked us and yelled yah yah yah after that we paddled away in our canoes and sought water  and for weeks we toiled at catching bechedemer and curing it in gathering the cocoanuts and turning them into copra by day and night the smoke rose in clouds from all the beaches of all the islands of oolong as we paid the penalty of our wrongdoing for in those days of death it was burned clearly on all our brains that it was very wrong to harm a white man  by and by the schooners full of copra and bechedemer and our trees empty of cocoanuts the three skippers and that mate called us all together for a big talk and they said they were very glad that we had learned our lesson and we said for the tenthousandth time that we were sorry and that we would not do it again also we poured sand upon our heads then the skippers said that it was all very well but just to show us that they did not forget us they would send a devildevil that we would never forget and that we would always remember any time we might feel like harming a white man after that the mate mocked us one more time and yelled yah yah yah then six of our men whom we thought long dead were put ashore from one of the schooners and the schooners hoisted their sails and ran out through the passage for the solomons  the six men who were put ashore were the first to catch the devildevil the skippers sent back after us  a great sickness came i interrupted for i recognized the trick the schooner had had measles on board and the six prisoners had been deliberately exposed to it  yes a great sickness oti went on it was a powerful devildevil the oldest man had never heard of the like those of our priests that yet lived we killed because they could not overcome the devildevil the sickness spread i have said that there were ten thousand of us that stood hip to hip and shoulder to shoulder on the sandbank when the sickness left us there were three thousand yet alive also having made all our cocoanuts into copra there was a famine  that fella trader oti concluded he like m that much dirt he like m clam he die kaikai meat he stop stink m any amount he like m one fella dog one sick fella dog plenty fleas stop along him we no fright along that fella trader we fright because he white man we savve plenty too much no good kill white man that one fella sick dog trader he plenty brother stop along him white men like m you fight like hell we no fright that damn trader some time he made kanaka plenty cross along him and kanaka want m kill m kanaka he think devildevil and kanaka he hear that fella mate sing out yah yah yah and kanaka no kill m  oti baited his hook with a piece of squid which he tore with his teeth from the live and squirming monster and hook and bait sank in white flames to the bottom  shark walk about he finish he said i think we catch m plenty fella fish  his line jerked savagely he pulled it in rapidly hand under hand and landed a big gasping rock cod in the bottom of the canoe  sun he come up i make m that dam fella trader one present big fella fish said oti     the heathen  i met him first in a hurricane and though we had gone through the hurricane on the same schooner it was not until the schooner had gone to pieces under us that i first laid eyes on him without doubt i had seen him with the rest of the kanaka crew on board but i had not consciously been aware of his existence for the petite jeanne was rather overcrowded in addition to her eight or ten kanaka seamen her white captain mate and supercargo and her six cabin passengers she sailed from rangiroa with something like eightyfive deck passengerspaumotans and tahitians men women and children each with a trade box to say nothing of sleeping mats blankets and clothes bundles  the pearling season in the paumotus was over and all hands were returning to tahiti the six of us cabin passengers were pearl buyers two were americans one was ah choon the whitest chinese i have ever known one was a german one was a polish jew and i completed the half dozen  it had been a prosperous season not one of us had cause for complaint nor one of the eightyfive deck passengers either all had done well and all were looking forward to a restoff and a good time in papeete  of course the petite jeanne was overloaded she was only seventy tons and she had no right to carry a tithe of the mob she had on board beneath her hatches she was crammed and jammed with pearl shell and copra even the trade room was packed full with shell it was a miracle that the sailors could work her there was no moving about the decks they simply climbed back and forth along the rails  in the night time they walked upon the sleepers who carpeted the deck ill swear two deep oh and there were pigs and chickens on deck and sacks of yams while every conceivable place was festooned with strings of drinking cocoanuts and bunches of bananas on both sides between the fore and main shrouds guys had been stretched just low enough for the foreboom to swing clear and from each of these guys at least fifty bunches of bananas were suspended  it promised to be a messy passage even if we did make it in the two or three days that would have been required if the southeast trades had been blowing fresh but they werent blowing fresh after the first five hours the trade died away in a dozen or so gasping fans the calm continued all that night and the next dayone of those glaring glassy calms when the very thought of opening ones eyes to look at it is sufficient to cause a headache  the second day a man diedan easter islander one of the best divers that season in the lagoon smallpoxthat is what it was though how smallpox could come on board when there had been no known cases ashore when we left rangiroa is beyond me there it was thoughsmallpox a man dead and three others down on their backs  there was nothing to be done we could not segregate the sick nor could we care for them we were packed like sardines there was nothing to do but rot and diethat is there was nothing to do after the night that followed the first death on that night the mate the supercargo the polish jew and four native divers sneaked away in the large whale boat they were never heard of again in the morning the captain promptly scuttled the remaining boats and there we were  that day there were two deaths the following day three then it jumped to eight it was curious to see how we took it the natives for instance fell into a condition of dumb stolid fear the captainoudouse his name was a frenchmanbecame very nervous and voluble he actually got the twitches he was a large fleshy man weighing at least two hundred pounds and he quickly became a faithful representation of a quivering jellymountain of fat  the german the two americans and myself bought up all the scotch whiskey and proceeded to stay drunk the theory was beautifulnamely if we kept ourselves soaked in alcohol every smallpox germ that came into contact with us would immediately be scorched to a cinder and the theory worked though i must confess that neither captain oudouse nor ah choon were attacked by the disease either the frenchman did not drink at all while ah choon restricted himself to one drink daily  it was a pretty time the sun going into northern declination was straight overhead there was no wind except for frequent squalls which blew fiercely for from five minutes to half an hour and wound up by deluging us with rain after each squall the awful sun would come out drawing clouds of steam from the soaked decks  the steam was not nice it was the vapor of death freighted with millions and millions of germs we always took another drink when we saw it going up from the dead and dying and usually we took two or three more drinks mixing them exceptionally stiff also we made it a rule to take an additional several each time they hove the dead over to the sharks that swarmed about us  we had a week of it and then the whiskey gave out it is just as well or i shouldnt be alive now it took a sober man to pull through what followed as you will agree when i mention the little fact that only two men did pull through the other man was the heathenat least that was what i heard captain oudouse call him at the moment i first became aware of the heathens existence but to come back  it was at the end of the week with the whiskey gone and the pearl buyers sober that i happened to glance at the barometer that hung in the cabin companionway its normal register in the paumotus was 2990 and it was quite customary to see it vacillate between 2985 and 3000 or even 3005 but to see it as i saw it down to 2962 was sufficient to sober the most drunken pearl buyer that ever incinerated smallpox microbes in scotch whiskey  i called captain oudouses attention to it only to be informed that he had watched it going down for several hours there was little to do but that little he did very well considering the circumstances he took off the light sails shortened right down to storm canvas spread life lines and waited for the wind his mistake lay in what he did after the wind came he hove to on the port tack which was the right thing to do south of the equator ifand there was the rubif one were not in the direct path of the hurricane  we were in the direct path i could see that by the steady increase of the wind and the equally steady fall of the barometer i wanted him to turn and run with the wind on the port quarter until the barometer ceased falling and then to heave to we argued till he was reduced to hysteria but budge he would not the worst of it was that i could not get the rest of the pearl buyers to back me up who was i anyway to know more about the sea and its ways than a properly qualified captain was what was in their minds i knew  of course the sea rose with the wind frightfully and i shall never forget the first three seas the petite jeanne shipped she had fallen off as vessels do at times when hove to and the first sea made a clean breach the life lines were only for the strong and well and little good were they even for them when the women and children the bananas and cocoanuts the pigs and trade boxes the sick and the dying were swept along in a solid screeching groaning mass  the second sea filled the petite jeannes decks flush with the rails and as her stern sank down and her bow tossed skyward all the miserable dunnage of life and luggage poured aft it was a human torrent they came head first feet first sidewise rolling over and over twisting squirming writhing and crumpling up now and again one caught a grip on a stanchion or a rope but the weight of the bodies behind tore such grips loose  one man i noticed fetch up head on and square on with the starboard bitt his head cracked like an egg i saw what was coming sprang on top of the cabin and from there into the mainsail itself ah choon and one of the americans tried to follow me but i was one jump ahead of them the american was swept away and over the stern like a piece of chaff ah choon caught a spoke of the wheel and swung in behind it but a strapping raratonga vahine womanshe must have weighed two hundred and fiftybrought up against him and got an arm around his neck he clutched the kanaka steersman with his other hand and just at that moment the schooner flung down to starboard  the rush of bodies and sea that was coming along the port runway between the cabin and the rail turned abruptly and poured to starboard away they wentvahine ah choon and steersman and i swear i saw ah choon grin at me with philosophic resignation as he cleared the rail and went under  the third seathe biggest of the threedid not do so much damage by the time it arrived nearly everybody was in the rigging on deck perhaps a dozen gasping halfdrowned and halfstunned wretches were rolling about or attempting to crawl into safety they went by the board as did the wreckage of the two remaining boats the other pearl buyers and myself between seas managed to get about fifteen women and children into the cabin and battened down little good it did the poor creatures in the end  wind out of all my experience i could not have believed it possible for the wind to blow as it did there is no describing it how can one describe a nightmare it was the same way with that wind it tore the clothes off our bodies i say tore them off and i mean it i am not asking you to believe it i am merely telling something that i saw and felt there are times when i do not believe it myself i went through it and that is enough one could not face that wind and live it was a monstrous thing and the most monstrous thing about it was that it increased and continued to increase  imagine countless millions and billions of tons of sand imagine this sand tearing along at ninety a hundred a hundred and twenty or any other number of miles per hour imagine further this sand to be invisible impalpable yet to retain all the weight and density of sand do all this and you may get a vague inkling of what that wind was like  perhaps sand is not the right comparison consider it mud invisible impalpable but heavy as mud nay it goes beyond that consider every molecule of air to be a mudbank in itself then try to imagine the multitudinous impact of mudbanks no it is beyond me language may be adequate to express the ordinary conditions of life but it cannot possibly express any of the conditions of so enormous a blast of wind it would have been better had i stuck by my original intention of not attempting a description  i will say this much the sea which had risen at first was beaten down by that wind more it seemed as if the whole ocean had been sucked up in the maw of the hurricane and hurled on through that portion of space which previously had been occupied by the air  of course our canvas had gone long before but captain oudouse had on the petite jeanne something i had never before seen on a south sea schoonera sea anchor it was a conical canvas bag the mouth of which was kept open by a huge loop of iron the sea anchor was bridled something like a kite so that it bit into the water as a kite bites into the air but with a difference the sea anchor remained just under the surface of the ocean in a perpendicular position a long line in turn connected it with the schooner as a result the petite jeanne rode bow on to the wind and to what sea there was  the situation really would have been favorable had we not been in the path of the storm true the wind itself tore our canvas out of the gaskets jerked out our topmasts and made a raffle of our running gear but still we would have come through nicely had we not been square in front of the advancing storm center that was what fixed us i was in a state of stunned numbed paralyzed collapse from enduring the impact of the wind and i think i was just about ready to give up and die when the center smote us the blow we received was an absolute lull there was not a breath of air the effect on one was sickening  remember that for hours we had been at terrific muscular tension withstanding the awful pressure of that wind and then suddenly the pressure was removed i know that i felt as though i was about to expand to fly apart in all directions it seemed as if every atom composing my body was repelling every other atom and was on the verge of rushing off irresistibly into space but that lasted only for a moment destruction was upon us  in the absence of the wind and pressure the sea rose it jumped it leaped it soared straight toward the clouds remember from every point of the compass that inconceivable wind was blowing in toward the center of calm the result was that the seas sprang up from every point of the compass there was no wind to check them they popped up like corks released from the bottom of a pail of water there was no system to them no stability they were hollow maniacal seas they were eighty feet high at the least they were not seas at all they resembled no sea a man had ever seen  they were splashes monstrous splashesthat is all splashes that were eighty feet high eighty they were more than eighty they went over our mastheads they were spouts explosions they were drunken they fell anywhere anyhow they jostled one another they collided they rushed together and collapsed upon one another or fell apart like a thousand waterfalls all at once it was no ocean any man had ever dreamed of that hurricane center it was confusion thrice confounded it was anarchy it was a hell pit of sea water gone mad  the petite jeanne i dont know the heathen told me afterwards that he did not know she was literally torn apart ripped wide open beaten into a pulp smashed into kindling wood annihilated when i came to i was in the water swimming automatically though i was about twothirds drowned how i got there i had no recollection i remembered seeing the petite jeanne fly to pieces at what must have been the instant that my own consciousness was buffeted out of me but there i was with nothing to do but make the best of it and in that best there was little promise the wind was blowing again the sea was much smaller and more regular and i knew that i had passed through the center fortunately there were no sharks about the hurricane had dissipated the ravenous horde that had surrounded the death ship and fed off the dead  it was about midday when the petite jeanne went to pieces and it must have been two hours afterwards when i picked up with one of her hatch covers thick rain was driving at the time and it was the merest chance that flung me and the hatch cover together a short length of line was trailing from the rope handle and i knew that i was good for a day at least if the sharks did not return three hours later possibly a little longer sticking close to the cover and with closed eyes concentrating my whole soul upon the task of breathing in enough air to keep me going and at the same time of avoiding breathing in enough water to drown me it seemed to me that i heard voices the rain had ceased and wind and sea were easing marvelously not twenty feet away from me on another hatch cover were captain oudouse and the heathen they were fighting over the possession of the coverat least the frenchman was paien noir i heard him scream and at the same time i saw him kick the kanaka  now captain oudouse had lost all his clothes except his shoes and they were heavy brogans it was a cruel blow for it caught the heathen on the mouth and the point of the chin half stunning him i looked for him to retaliate but he contented himself with swimming about forlornly a safe ten feet away whenever a fling of the sea threw him closer the frenchman hanging on with his hands kicked out at him with both feet also at the moment of delivering each kick he called the kanaka a black heathen  for two centimes id come over there and drown you you white beast i yelled  the only reason i did not go was that i felt too tired the very thought of the effort to swim over was nauseating so i called to the kanaka to come to me and proceeded to share the hatch cover with him otoo he told me his name was pronounced otoo  also he told me that he was a native of bora bora the most westerly of the society group as i learned afterward he had got the hatch cover first and after some time encountering captain oudouse had offered to share it with him and had been kicked off for his pains  and that was how otoo and i first came together he was no fighter he was all sweetness and gentleness a love creature though he stood nearly six feet tall and was muscled like a gladiator he was no fighter but he was also no coward he had the heart of a lion and in the years that followed i have seen him run risks that i would never dream of taking what i mean is that while he was no fighter and while he always avoided precipitating a row he never ran away from trouble when it started and it was ware shoal when once otoo went into action i shall never forget what he did to bill king it occurred in german samoa bill king was hailed the champion heavyweight of the american navy he was a big brute of a man a veritable gorilla one of those hardhitting roughhousing chaps and clever with his fists as well he picked the quarrel and he kicked otoo twice and struck him once before otoo felt it to be necessary to fight i dont think it lasted four minutes at the end of which time bill king was the unhappy possessor of four broken ribs a broken forearm and a dislocated shoulder blade otoo knew nothing of scientific boxing he was merely a manhandler and bill king was something like three months in recovering from the bit of manhandling he received that afternoon on apia beach  but i am running ahead of my yarn we shared the hatch cover between us we took turn and turn about one lying flat on the cover and resting while the other submerged to the neck merely held on with his hands for two days and nights spell and spell on the cover and in the water we drifted over the ocean towards the last i was delirious most of the time and there were times too when i heard otoo babbling and raving in his native tongue our continuous immersion prevented us from dying of thirst though the sea water and the sunshine gave us the prettiest imaginable combination of salt pickle and sunburn  in the end otoo saved my life for i came to lying on the beach twenty feet from the water sheltered from the sun by a couple of cocoanut leaves no one but otoo could have dragged me there and stuck up the leaves for shade he was lying beside me i went off again and the next time i came round it was cool and starry night and otoo was pressing a drinking cocoanut to my lips  we were the sole survivors of the petite jeanne captain oudouse must have succumbed to exhaustion for several days later his hatch cover drifted ashore without him otoo and i lived with the natives of the atoll for a week when we were rescued by the french cruiser and taken to tahiti in the meantime however we had performed the ceremony of exchanging names in the south seas such a ceremony binds two men closer together than blood brothership the initiative had been mine and otoo was rapturously delighted when i suggested it  it is well he said in tahitian for we have been mates together for two days on the lips of death  but death stuttered i smiled  it was a brave deed you did master he replied and death was not vile enough to speak  why do you master me i demanded with a show of hurt feelings we have exchanged names to you i am otoo to me you are charley and between you and me forever and forever you shall be charley and i shall be otoo it is the way of the custom and when we die if it does happen that we live again somewhere beyond the stars and the sky still shall you be charley to me and i otoo to you  yes master he answered his eyes luminous and soft with joy  there you go i cried indignantly  what does it matter what my lips utter he argued they are only my lips but i shall think otoo always whenever i think of myself i shall think of you whenever men call me by name i shall think of you and beyond the sky and beyond the stars always and forever you shall be otoo to me is it well master  i hid my smile and answered that it was well  we parted at papeete i remained ashore to recuperate and he went on in a cutter to his own island bora bora six weeks later he was back i was surprised for he had told me of his wife and said that he was returning to her and would give over sailing on far voyages  where do you go master he asked after our first greetings  i shrugged my shoulders it was a hard question  all the world was my answerall the world all the sea and all the islands that are in the sea  i will go with you he said simply my wife is dead  i never had a brother but from what i have seen of other mens brothers i doubt if any man ever had a brother that was to him what otoo was to me he was brother and father and mother as well and this i know i lived a straighter and better man because of otoo i cared little for other men but i had to live straight in otoos eyes because of him i dared not tarnish myself he made me his ideal compounding me i fear chiefly out of his own love and worship and there were times when i stood close to the steep pitch of hell and would have taken the plunge had not the thought of otoo restrained me his pride in me entered into me until it became one of the major rules in my personal code to do nothing that would diminish that pride of his  naturally i did not learn right away what his feelings were toward me he never criticized never censured and slowly the exalted place i held in his eyes dawned upon me and slowly i grew to comprehend the hurt i could inflict upon him by being anything less than my best  for seventeen years we were together for seventeen years he was at my shoulder watching while i slept nursing me through fever and woundsay and receiving wounds in fighting for me he signed on the same ships with me and together we ranged the pacific from hawaii to sydney head and from torres straits to the galapagos we blackbirded from the new hebrides and the line islands over to the westward clear through the louisades new britain new ireland and new hanover we were wrecked three timesin the gilberts in the santa cruz group and in the fijis and we traded and salved wherever a dollar promised in the way of pearl and pearl shell copra bechedemer hawkbill turtle shell and stranded wrecks  it began in papeete immediately after his announcement that he was going with me over all the sea and the islands in the midst thereof there was a club in those days in papeete where the pearlers traders captains and riffraff of south sea adventurers forgathered the play ran high and the drink ran high and i am very much afraid that i kept later hours than were becoming or proper no matter what the hour was when i left the club there was otoo waiting to see me safely home  at first i smiled next i chided him then i told him flatly that i stood in need of no wetnursing after that i did not see him when i came out of the club quite by accident a week or so later i discovered that he still saw me home lurking across the street among the shadows of the mango trees what could i do i know what i did do  insensibly i began to keep better hours on wet and stormy nights in the thick of the folly and the fun the thought would persist in coming to me of otoo keeping his dreary vigil under the dripping mangoes truly he made a better man of me yet he was not straitlaced and he knew nothing of common christian morality all the people on bora bora were christians but he was a heathen the only unbeliever on the island a gross materialist who believed that when he died he was dead he believed merely in fair play and square dealing petty meanness in his code was almost as serious as wanton homicide and i do believe that he respected a murderer more than a man given to small practices  concerning me personally he objected to my doing anything that was hurtful to me gambling was all right he was an ardent gambler himself but late hours he explained were bad for ones health he had seen men who did not take care of themselves die of fever he was no teetotaler and welcomed a stiff nip any time when it was wet work in the boats on the other hand he believed in liquor in moderation he had seen many men killed or disgraced by squareface or scotch  otoo had my welfare always at heart he thought ahead for me weighed my plans and took a greater interest in them than i did myself at first when i was unaware of this interest of his in my affairs he had to divine my intentions as for instance at papeete when i contemplated going partners with a knavish fellowcountryman on a guano venture i did not know he was a knave nor did any white man in papeete neither did otoo know but he saw how thick we were getting and found out for me and without my asking him native sailors from the ends of the seas knock about on the beach in tahiti and otoo suspicious merely went among them till he had gathered sufficient data to justify his suspicions oh it was a nice history that of randolph waters i couldnt believe it when otoo first narrated it but when i sheeted it home to waters he gave in without a murmur and got away on the first steamer to aukland  at first i am free to confess i couldnt help resenting otoos poking his nose into my business but i knew that he was wholly unselfish and soon i had to acknowledge his wisdom and discretion he had his eyes open always to my main chance and he was both keensighted and farsighted in time he became my counselor until he knew more of my business than i did myself he really had my interest at heart more than i did mine was the magnificent carelessness of youth for i preferred romance to dollars and adventure to a comfortable billet with all night in so it was well that i had some one to look out for me i know that if it had not been for otoo i should not be here today  of numerous instances let me give one i had had some experience in blackbirding before i went pearling in the paumotus otoo and i were on the beach in samoawe really were on the beach and hard agroundwhen my chance came to go as recruiter on a blackbird brig otoo signed on before the mast and for the next halfdozen years in as many ships we knocked about the wildest portions of melanesia otoo saw to it that he always pulled strokeoar in my boat our custom in recruiting labor was to land the recruiter on the beach the covering boat always lay on its oars several hundred feet off shore while the recruiters boat also lying on its oars kept afloat on the edge of the beach when i landed with my trade goods leaving my steering sweep apeak otoo left his stroke position and came into the stern sheets where a winchester lay ready to hand under a flap of canvas the boats crew was also armed the sniders concealed under canvas flaps that ran the length of the gunwales  while i was busy arguing and persuading the woollyheaded cannibals to come and labor on the queensland plantations otoo kept watch and often and often his low voice warned me of suspicious actions and impending treachery sometimes it was the quick shot from his rifle knocking a nigger over that was the first warning i received and in my rush to the boat his hand was always there to jerk me flying aboard once i remember on santa anna the boat grounded just as the trouble began the covering boat was dashing to our assistance but the several score of savages would have wiped us out before it arrived otoo took a flying leap ashore dug both hands into the trade goods and scattered tobacco beads tomahawks knives and calicoes in all directions  this was too much for the woollyheads while they scrambled for the treasures the boat was shoved clear and we were aboard and forty feet away and i got thirty recruits off that very beach in the next four hours  the particular instance i have in mind was on malaita the most savage island in the easterly solomons the natives had been remarkably friendly and how were we to know that the whole village had been taking up a collection for over two years with which to buy a white mans head the beggars are all headhunters and they especially esteem a white mans head the fellow who captured the head would receive the whole collection as i say they appeared very friendly and on this day i was fully a hundred yards down the beach from the boat otoo had cautioned me and as usual when i did not heed him i came to grief  the first i knew a cloud of spears sailed out of the mangrove swamp at me at least a dozen were sticking into me i started to run but tripped over one that was fast in my calf and went down the woollyheads made a run for me each with a longhandled fantail tomahawk with which to hack off my head they were so eager for the prize that they got in one anothers way in the confusion i avoided several hacks by throwing myself right and left on the sand  then otoo arrivedotoo the manhandler in some way he had got hold of a heavy war club and at close quarters it was a far more efficient weapon than a rifle he was right in the thick of them so that they could not spear him while their tomahawks seemed worse than useless he was fighting for me and he was in a true berserker rage the way he handled that club was amazing  their skulls squashed like overripe oranges it was not until he had driven them back picked me up in his arms and started to run that he received his first wounds he arrived in the boat with four spear thrusts got his winchester and with it got a man for every shot then we pulled aboard the schooner and doctored up  seventeen years we were together he made me i should today be a supercargo a recruiter or a memory if it had not been for him  you spend your money and you go out and get more he said one day it is easy to get money now but when you get old your money will be spent and you will not be able to go out and get more i know master i have studied the way of white men on the beaches are many old men who were young once and who could get money just like you now they are old and they have nothing and they wait about for the young men like you to come ashore and buy drinks for them  the black boy is a slave on the plantations he gets twenty dollars a year he works hard the overseer does not work hard he rides a horse and watches the black boy work he gets twelve hundred dollars a year i am a sailor on the schooner i get fifteen dollars a month that is because i am a good sailor i work hard the captain has a double awning and drinks beer out of long bottles i have never seen him haul a rope or pull an oar he gets one hundred and fifty dollars a month i am a sailor he is a navigator master i think it would be very good for you to know navigation  otoo spurred me on to it he sailed with me as second mate on my first schooner and he was far prouder of my command than i was myself later on it was  the captain is well paid master but the ship is in his keeping and he is never free from the burden it is the owner who is better paidthe owner who sits ashore with many servants and turns his money over  true but a schooner costs five thousand dollarsan old schooner at that i objected i should be an old man before i saved five thousand dollars  there be short ways for white men to make money he went on pointing ashore at the cocoanutfringed beach  we were in the solomons at the time picking up a cargo of ivory nuts along the east coast of guadalcanar  between this river mouth and the next it is two miles he said  the flat land runs far back it is worth nothing now next yearwho knowsor the year after men will pay much money for that land the anchorage is good big steamers can lie close up you can buy the land four miles deep from the old chief for ten thousand sticks of tobacco ten bottles of squareface and a snider which will cost you maybe one hundred dollars then you place the deed with the commissioner and the next year or the year after you sell and become the owner of a ship  i followed his lead and his words came true though in three years instead of two next came the grasslands deal on guadalcanartwenty thousand acres on a governmental nine hundred and ninetynine years lease at a nominal sum i owned the lease for precisely ninety days when i sold it to a company for half a fortune always it was otoo who looked ahead and saw the opportunity he was responsible for the salving of the doncasterbought in at auction for a hundred pounds and clearing three thousand after every expense was paid he led me into the savaii plantation and the cocoa venture on upolu  we did not go seafaring so much as in the old days i was too well off i married and my standard of living rose but otoo remained the same oldtime otoo moving about the house or trailing through the office his wooden pipe in his mouth a shilling undershirt on his back and a fourshilling lavalava about his loins i could not get him to spend money there was no way of repaying him except with love and god knows he got that in full measure from all of us the children worshipped him and if he had been spoilable my wife would surely have been his undoing  the children he really was the one who showed them the way of their feet in the world practical he began by teaching them to walk he sat up with them when they were sick one by one when they were scarcely toddlers he took them down to the lagoon and made them into amphibians he taught them more than i ever knew of the habits of fish and the ways of catching them in the bush it was the same thing at seven tom knew more woodcraft than i ever dreamed existed at six mary went over the sliding rock without a quiver and i have seen strong men balk at that feat and when frank had just turned six he could bring up shillings from the bottom in three fathoms  my people in bora bora do not like heathenthey are all christians and i do not like bora bora christians he said one day when i with the idea of getting him to spend some of the money that was rightfully his had been trying to persuade him to make a visit to his own island in one of our schoonersa special voyage which i had hoped to make a record breaker in the matter of prodigal expense  i say one of our schooners though legally at the time they belonged to me i struggled long with him to enter into partnership  we have been partners from the day the petite jeanne went down he said at last but if your heart so wishes then shall we become partners by the law i have no work to do yet are my expenses large i drink and eat and smoke in plentyit costs much i know i do not pay for the playing of billiards for i play on your table but still the money goes fishing on the reef is only a rich mans pleasure it is shocking the cost of hooks and cotton line yes it is necessary that we be partners by the law i need the money i shall get it from the head clerk in the office  so the papers were made out and recorded a year later i was compelled to complain  charley said i you are a wicked old fraud a miserly skinflint a miserable land crab behold your share for the year in all our partnership has been thousands of dollars the head clerk has given me this paper it says that in the year you have drawn just eightyseven dollars and twenty cents  is there any owing me he asked anxiously  i tell you thousands and thousands i answered  his face brightened as with an immense relief  it is well he said see that the head clerk keeps good account of it when i want it i shall want it and there must not be a cent missing  if there is he added fiercely after a pause it must come out of the clerks wages  and all the time as i afterwards learned his will drawn up by carruthers and making me sole beneficiary lay in the american consuls safe  but the end came as the end must come to all human associations  it occurred in the solomons where our wildest work had been done in the wild young days and where we were once moreprincipally on a holiday incidentally to look after our holdings on florida island and to look over the pearling possibilities of the mboli pass we were lying at savo having run in to trade for curios  now savo is alive with sharks the custom of the woollyheads of burying their dead in the sea did not tend to discourage the sharks from making the adjacent waters a hangout it was my luck to be coming aboard in a tiny overloaded native canoe when the thing capsized there were four woollyheads and myself in it or rather hanging to it the schooner was a hundred yards away  i was just hailing for a boat when one of the woollyheads began to scream holding on to the end of the canoe both he and that portion of the canoe were dragged under several times then he loosed his clutch and disappeared a shark had got him  the three remaining niggers tried to climb out of the water upon the bottom of the canoe i yelled and cursed and struck at the nearest with my fist but it was no use they were in a blind funk the canoe could barely have supported one of them under the three it upended and rolled sidewise throwing them back into the water  i abandoned the canoe and started to swim toward the schooner expecting to be picked up by the boat before i got there one of the niggers elected to come with me and we swam along silently side by side now and again putting our faces into the water and peering about for sharks the screams of the man who stayed by the canoe informed us that he was taken i was peering into the water when i saw a big shark pass directly beneath me he was fully sixteen feet in length i saw the whole thing he got the woollyhead by the middle and away he went the poor devil head shoulders and arms out of the water all the time screeching in a heartrending way he was carried along in this fashion for several hundred feet when he was dragged beneath the surface  i swam doggedly on hoping that that was the last unattached shark but there was another whether it was one that had attacked the natives earlier or whether it was one that had made a good meal elsewhere i do not know at any rate he was not in such haste as the others i could not swim so rapidly now for a large part of my effort was devoted to keeping track of him i was watching him when he made his first attack by good luck i got both hands on his nose and though his momentum nearly shoved me under i managed to keep him off he veered clear and began circling about again a second time i escaped him by the same manoeuvre the third rush was a miss on both sides he sheered at the moment my hands should have landed on his nose but his sandpaper hide i had on a sleeveless undershirt scraped the skin off one arm from elbow to shoulder  by this time i was played out and gave up hope the schooner was still two hundred feet away my face was in the water and i was watching him manoeuvre for another attempt when i saw a brown body pass between us it was otoo  swim for the schooner master he said and he spoke gayly as though the affair was a mere lark i know sharks the shark is my brother  i obeyed swimming slowly on while otoo swam about me keeping always between me and the shark foiling his rushes and encouraging me  the davit tackle carried away and they are rigging the falls he explained a minute or so later and then went under to head off another attack  by the time the schooner was thirty feet away i was about done for i could scarcely move they were heaving lines at us from on board but they continually fell short the shark finding that it was receiving no hurt had become bolder several times it nearly got me but each time otoo was there just the moment before it was too late of course otoo could have saved himself any time but he stuck by me  goodby charley im finished i just managed to gasp  i knew that the end had come and that the next moment i should throw up my hands and go down  but otoo laughed in my face saying  i will show you a new trick i will make that shark feel sick  he dropped in behind me where the shark was preparing to come at me  a little more to the left he next called out there is a line there on the water to the left masterto the left  i changed my course and struck out blindly i was by that time barely conscious as my hand closed on the line i heard an exclamation from on board i turned and looked there was no sign of otoo the next instant he broke surface both hands were off at the wrist the stumps spouting blood  otoo he called softly and i could see in his gaze the love that thrilled in his voice  then and then only at the very last of all our years he called me by that name  goodby otoo he called  then he was dragged under and i was hauled aboard where i fainted in the captains arms  and so passed otoo who saved me and made me a man and who saved me in the end we met in the maw of a hurricane and parted in the maw of a shark with seventeen intervening years of comradeship the like of which i dare to assert has never befallen two men the one brown and the other white if jehovah be from his high place watching every sparrow fall not least in his kingdom shall be otoo the one heathen of bora bora     the terrible solomons  there is no gainsaying that the solomons are a hardbitten bunch of islands on the other hand there are worse places in the world but to the new chum who has no constitutional understanding of men and life in the rough the solomons may indeed prove terrible  it is true that fever and dysentery are perpetually on the walkabout that loathsome skin diseases abound that the air is saturated with a poison that bites into every pore cut or abrasion and plants malignant ulcers and that many strong men who escape dying there return as wrecks to their own countries it is also true that the natives of the solomons are a wild lot with a hearty appetite for human flesh and a fad for collecting human heads their highest instinct of sportsmanship is to catch a man with his back turned and to smite him a cunning blow with a tomahawk that severs the spinal column at the base of the brain it is equally true that on some islands such as malaita the profit and loss account of social intercourse is calculated in homicides heads are a medium of exchange and white heads are extremely valuable very often a dozen villages make a jackpot which they fatten moon by moon against the time when some brave warrior presents a white mans head fresh and gory and claims the pot  all the foregoing is quite true and yet there are white men who have lived in the solomons a score of years and who feel homesick when they go away from them a man needs only to be carefuland luckyto live a long time in the solomons but he must also be of the right sort he must have the hallmark of the inevitable white man stamped upon his soul he must be inevitable he must have a certain grand carelessness of odds a certain colossal selfsatisfaction and a racial egotism that convinces him that one white is better than a thousand niggers every day in the week and that on sunday he is able to clean out two thousand niggers for such are the things that have made the white man inevitable oh and one other thingthe white man who wishes to be inevitable must not merely despise the lesser breeds and think a lot of himself he must also fail to be too long on imagination he must not understand too well the instincts customs and mental processes of the blacks the yellows and the browns for it is not in such fashion that the white race has tramped its royal road around the world  bertie arkwright was not inevitable he was too sensitive too finely strung and he possessed too much imagination the world was too much with him he projected himself too quiveringly into his environment therefore the last place in the world for him to come was the solomons he did not come expecting to stay a five weeks stopover between steamers he decided would satisfy the call of the primitive he felt thrumming the strings of his being at least so he told the lady tourists on the makembo though in different terms and they worshipped him as a hero for they were lady tourists and they would know only the safety of the steamers deck as she threaded her way through the solomons  there was another man on board of whom the ladies took no notice he was a little shriveled wisp of a man with a withered skin the color of mahogany his name on the passenger list does not matter but his other name captain malu was a name for niggers to conjure with and to scare naughty pickaninnies to righteousness from new hanover to the new hebrides he had farmed savages and savagery and from fever and hardship the crack of sniders and the lash of the overseers had wrested five millions of money in the form of bêchedemer sandalwood pearlshell and turtleshell ivory nuts and copra grasslands trading stations and plantations captain malus little finger which was broken had more inevitableness in it than bertie arkwrights whole carcass but then the lady tourists had nothing by which to judge save appearances and bertie certainly was a finelooking man  bertie talked with captain malu in the smoking room confiding to him his intention of seeing life red and bleeding in the solomons captain malu agreed that the intention was ambitious and honorable it was not until several days later that he became interested in bertie when that young adventurer insisted on showing him an automatic 44caliber pistol bertie explained the mechanism and demonstrated by slipping a loaded magazine up the hollow butt  it is so simple he said he shot the outer barrel back along the inner one that loads it and cocks it you see and then all i have to do is pull the trigger eight times as fast as i can quiver my finger see that safety clutch thats what i like about it it is safe it is positively foolproof he slipped out the magazine you see how safe it is  as he held it in his hand the muzzle came in line with captain malus stomach captain malus blue eyes looked at it unswervingly  would you mind pointing it in some other direction he asked  its perfectly safe bertie assured him i withdrew the magazine its not loaded now you know  a gun is always loaded  but this one isnt  turn it away just the same  captain malus voice was flat and metallic and low but his eyes never left the muzzle until the line of it was drawn past him and away from him  ill bet a fiver it isnt loaded bertie proposed warmly  the other shook his head  then ill show you  bertie started to put the muzzle to his own temple with the evident intention of pulling the trigger  just a second captain malu said quietly reaching out his hand let me look at it  he pointed it seaward and pulled the trigger a heavy explosion followed instantaneous with the sharp click of the mechanism that flipped a hot and smoking cartridge sidewise along the deck  berties jaw dropped in amazement  i slipped the barrel back once didnt i he explained it was silly of me i must say  he giggled flabbily and sat down in a steamer chair the blood had ebbed from his face exposing dark circles under his eyes his hands were trembling and unable to guide the shaking cigarette to his lips the world was too much with him and he saw himself with dripping brains prone upon the deck  really he said  really  its a pretty weapon said captain malu returning the automatic to him  the commissioner was on board the makembo returning from sydney and by his permission a stop was made at ugi to land a missionary and at ugi lay the ketch arla captain hansen skipper now the arla was one of many vessels owned by captain malu and it was at his suggestion and by his invitation that bertie went aboard the arla as guest for a four days recruiting cruise on the coast of malaita thereafter the arla would drop him at reminge plantation also owned by captain malu where bertie could remain for a week and then be sent over to tulagi the seat of government where he would become the commissioners guest captain malu was responsible for two other suggestions which given he disappears from this narrative one was to captain hansen the other to mr harriwell manager of reminge plantation both suggestions were similar in tenor namely to give mr bertram arkwright an insight into the rawness and redness of life in the solomons also it is whispered that captain malu mentioned that a case of scotch would be coincidental with any particularly gorgeous insight mr arkwright might receive  yes swartz always was too pigheaded you see he took four of his boats crew to tulagi to be floggedofficially you knowthen started back with them in the whaleboat it was pretty squally and the boat capsized just outside swartz was the only one drowned of course it was an accident  was it really bertie asked only halfinterested staring hard at the black man at the wheel  ugi had dropped astern and the arla was sliding along through a summer sea toward the wooded ranges of malaita the helmsman who so attracted berties eyes sported a ten penny nail stuck skewerwise through his nose about his neck was a string of pants buttons thrust through holes in his ears were a can opener the broken handle of a toothbrush a clay pipe the brass wheel of an alarm clock and several winchester rifle cartridges  on his chest suspended from around his neck hung the half of a china plate some forty similarly appareled blacks lay about the deck fifteen of which were boats crew the remainder being fresh labor recruits  of course it was an accident spoke up the arlas mate jacobs a slender darkeyed man who looked more a professor than a sailor johnny bedip nearly had the same kind of accident he was bringing back several from a flogging when they capsized him but he knew how to swim as well as they and two of them were drowned he used a boat stretcher and a revolver of course it was an accident  quite common them accidents remarked the skipper you see that man at the wheel mr arkwright hes a man eater six months ago he and the rest of the boats crew drowned the then captain of the arla they did it on deck sir right aft there by the mizzentraveler  the deck was in a shocking state said the mate  do i understand bertie began  yes just that said captain hansen it was an accidental drowning  but on deck  just so i dont mind telling you in confidence of course that they used an axe  this present crew of yours  captain hansen nodded  the other skipper always was too careless explained the mate he but just turned his back when they let him have it  we havent any show down here was the skippers complaint the government protects a nigger against a white every time you cant shoot first youve got to give the nigger first shot or else the government calls it murder and you go to fiji thats why theres so many drowning accidents  dinner was called and bertie and the skipper went below leaving the mate to watch on deck  keep an eye out for that black devil auiki was the skippers parting caution i havent liked his looks for several days  right o said the mate  dinner was part way along and the skipper was in the middle of his story of the cutting out of the scottish chiefs  yes he was saying she was the finest vessel on the coast but when she missed stays and before ever she hit the reef the canoes started for her there were five white men a crew of twenty santa cruz boys and samoans and only the supercargo escaped besides there were sixty recruits they were all kaikaid kaikaioh i beg your pardon i mean they were eaten then there was the james edwards a dandyrigged  but at that moment there was a sharp oath from the mate on deck and a chorus of savage cries a revolver went off three times and then was heard a loud splash captain hansen had sprung up the companionway on the instant and berties eyes had been fascinated by a glimpse of him drawing his revolver as he sprang  bertie went up more circumspectly hesitating before he put his head above the companionway slide but nothing happened the mate was shaking with excitement his revolver in his hand once he startled and halfjumped around as if danger threatened his back  one of the natives fell overboard he was saying in a queer tense voice he couldnt swim  who was it the skipper demanded  auiki was the answer  but i say you know i heard shots bertie said in trembling eagerness for he scented adventure and adventure that was happily over with  the mate whirled upon him snarling  its a damned lie there aint been a shot fired the nigger fell overboard  captain hansen regarded bertie with unblinking lackluster eyes  ii thought bertie was beginning  shots said captain hansen dreamily shots did you hear any shots mr jacobs  not a shot replied mr jacobs  the skipper looked at his guest triumphantly and said  evidently an accident let us go down mr arkwright and finish dinner  bertie slept that night in the captains cabin a tiny stateroom off the main cabin the forard bulkhead was decorated with a stand of rifles over the bunk were three more rifles under the bunk was a big drawer which when he pulled it out he found filled with ammunition dynamite and several boxes of detonators he elected to take the settee on the opposite side lying conspicuously on the small table was the arlas log bertie did not know that it had been especially prepared for the occasion by captain malu and he read therein how on september 21 two boats crew had fallen overboard and been drowned bertie read between the lines and knew better he read how the arlas whale boat had been bushwhacked at suu and had lost three men of how the skipper discovered the cook stewing human flesh on the galley fireflesh purchased by the boats crew ashore in fui of how an accidental discharge of dynamite while signaling had killed another boats crew of night attacks ports fled from between the dawns attacks by bushmen in mangrove swamps and by fleets of saltwater men in the larger passages one item that occurred with monotonous frequency was death by dysentery he noticed with alarm that two white men had so diedguests like himself on the arla  i say you know bertie said next day to captain hansen ive been glancing through your log  the skipper displayed quick vexation that the log had been left lying about  and all that dysentery you know thats all rot just like the accidental drownings bertie continued what does dysentery really stand for  the skipper openly admired his guests acumen stiffened himself to make indignant denial then gracefully surrendered  you see its like this mr arkwright these islands have got a bad enough name as it is its getting harder every day to sign on white men suppose a man is killed the company has to pay through the nose for another man to take the job but if the man merely dies of sickness its all right the new chums dont mind disease what they draw the line at is being murdered i thought the skipper of the arla had died of dysentery when i took his billet then it was too late id signed the contract  besides said mr jacobs theres altogether too many accidental drownings anyway it dont look right its the fault of the government a white man hasnt a chance to defend himself from the niggers  yes look at the princess and that yankee mate the skipper took up the tale she carried five white men besides a government agent the captain the agent and the supercargo were ashore in the two boats they were killed to the last man the mate and boson with about fifteen of the crewsamoans and tonganswere on board a crowd of niggers came off from shore first thing the mate knew the boson and the crew were killed in the first rush the mate grabbed three cartridge belts and two winchesters and skinned up to the crosstrees he was the sole survivor and you cant blame him for being mad he pumped one rifle till it got so hot he couldnt hold it then he pumped the other the deck was black with niggers he cleaned them out he dropped them as they went over the rail and he dropped them as fast as they picked up their paddles then they jumped into the water and started to swim for it and being mad he got half a dozen more and what did he get for it  seven years in fiji snapped the mate  the government said he wasnt justified in shooting after theyd taken to the water the skipper explained  and thats why they die of dysentery nowadays the mate added  just fancy said bertie as he felt a longing for the cruise to be over  later on in the day he interviewed the black who had been pointed out to him as a cannibal this fellows name was sumasai he had spent three years on a queensland plantation he had been to samoa and fiji and sydney and as a boats crew had been on recruiting schooners through new britain new ireland new guinea and the admiralties also he was a wag and he had taken a line on his skippers conduct yes he had eaten many men how many he could not remember the tally yes white men too they were very good unless they were sick he had once eaten a sick one  my word he cried at the recollection me sick plenty along him my belly walk about too much  bertie shuddered and asked about heads yes sumasai had several hidden ashore in good condition sundried and smokecured one was of the captain of a schooner it had long whiskers he would sell it for two quid black mens heads he would sell for one quid he had some pickaninny heads in poor condition that he would let go for ten bob  five minutes afterward bertie found himself sitting on the companionwayslide alongside a black with a horrible skin disease he sheered off and on inquiry was told that it was leprosy he hurried below and washed himself with antiseptic soap he took many antiseptic washes in the course of the day for every native on board was afflicted with malignant ulcers of one sort or another  as the arla drew in to an anchorage in the midst of mangrove swamps a double row of barbed wire was stretched around above her rail that looked like business and when bertie saw the shore canoes alongside armed with spears bows and arrows and sniders he wished more earnestly than ever that the cruise was over  that evening the natives were slow in leaving the ship at sundown a number of them checked the mate when he ordered them ashore never mind ill fix them said captain hansen diving below  when he came back he showed bertie a stick of dynamite attached to a fish hook now it happens that a paperwrapped bottle of chlorodyne with a piece of harmless fuse projecting can fool anybody it fooled bertie and it fooled the natives when captain hansen lighted the fuse and hooked the fish hook into the tail end of a natives loin cloth that native was smitten with so an ardent a desire for the shore that he forgot to shed the loin cloth he started forard the fuse sizzling and spluttering at his rear the natives in his path taking headers over the barbed wire at every jump bertie was horrorstricken so was captain hansen he had forgotten his twentyfive recruits on each of which he had paid thirty shillings advance they went over the side along with the shoredwelling folk and followed by him who trailed the sizzling chlorodyne bottle  bertie did not see the bottle go off but the mate opportunely discharging a stick of real dynamite aft where it would harm nobody bertie would have sworn in any admiralty court to a nigger blown to flinders the flight of the twentyfive recruits had actually cost the arla forty pounds and since they had taken to the bush there was no hope of recovering them the skipper and his mate proceeded to drown their sorrow in cold tea  the cold tea was in whiskey bottles so bertie did not know it was cold tea they were mopping up all he knew was that the two men got very drunk and argued eloquently and at length as to whether the exploded nigger should be reported as a case of dysentery or as an accidental drowning when they snored off to sleep he was the only white man left and he kept a perilous watch till dawn in fear of an attack from shore and an uprising of the crew  three more days the arla spent on the coast and three more nights the skipper and the mate drank overfondly of cold tea leaving bertie to keep the watch they knew he could be depended upon while he was equally certain that if he lived he would report their drunken conduct to captain malu then the arla dropped anchor at reminge plantation on guadalcanar and bertie landed on the beach with a sigh of relief and shook hands with the manager mr harriwell was ready for him  now you mustnt be alarmed if some of our fellows seem downcast mr harriwell said having drawn him aside in confidence theres been talk of an outbreak and two or three suspicious signs im willing to admit but personally i think its all poppycock  howhow many blacks have you on the plantation bertie asked with a sinking heart  were working four hundred just now replied mr harriwell cheerfully but the three of us with you of course and the skipper and mate of the arla can handle them all right  bertie turned to meet one mctavish the storekeeper who scarcely acknowledged the introduction such was his eagerness to present his resignation  it being that im a married man mr harriwell i cant very well afford to remain on longer trouble is working up as plain as the nose on your face the niggers are going to break out and therell be another hohono horror here  whats a hohono horror bertie asked after the storekeeper had been persuaded to remain until the end of the month  oh he means hohono plantation on ysabel said the manager the niggers killed the five white men ashore captured the schooner killed the captain and mate and escaped in a body to malaita but i always said they were careless on hohono they wont catch us napping here come along mr arkwright and see our view from the veranda  bertie was too busy wondering how he could get away to tulagi to the commissioners house to see much of the view he was still wondering when a rifle exploded very near to him behind his back at the same moment his arm was nearly dislocated so eagerly did mr harriwell drag him indoors  i say old man that was a close shave said the manager pawing him over to see if he had been hit i cant tell you how sorry i am but it was broad daylight and i never dreamed  bertie was beginning to turn pale  they got the other manager that way mctavish vouchsafed and a dashed fine chap he was blew his brains out all over the veranda you noticed that dark stain there between the steps and the door  bertie was ripe for the cocktail which mr harriwell pitched in and compounded for him but before he could drink it a man in riding trousers and puttees entered  whats the matter now the manager asked after one look at the newcomers face is the river up again  river be blowedits the niggers stepped out of the cane grass not a dozen feet away and whopped at me it was a snider and he shot from the hip now what i want to know is whered he get that snideroh i beg pardon glad to know you mr arkwright  mr brown is my assistant explained mr harriwell and now lets have that drink  but whered he get that snider mr brown insisted i always objected to keeping those guns on the premises  theyre still there mr harriwell said with a show of heat  mr brown smiled incredulously  come along and see said the manager  bertie joined the procession into the office where mr harriwell pointed triumphantly at a big packing case in a dusty corner  well then where did the beggar get that snider harped mr brown  but just then mctavish lifted the packing case the manager started then tore off the lid the case was empty they gazed at one another in horrified silence harriwell drooped wearily  then mcveigh cursed  what i contended all alongthe houseboys are not to be trusted  it does look serious harriwell admitted but well come through it all right what the sanguinary niggers need is a shaking up will you gentlemen please bring your rifles to dinner and will you mr brown kindly prepare forty or fifty sticks of dynamite make the fuses good and short well give them a lesson and now gentlemen dinner is served  one thing that bertie detested was rice and curry so it happened that he alone partook of an inviting omelet he had quite finished his plate when harriwell helped himself to the omelet one mouthful he tasted then spat out vociferously  thats the second time mctavish announced ominously  harriwell was still hawking and spitting  second time what bertie quavered  poison was the answer that cook will be hanged yet  thats the way the bookkeeper went out at cape march brown spoke up died horribly they said on the jessie that they heard him screaming three miles away  ill put the cook in irons sputtered harriwell fortunately we discovered it in time  bertie sat paralyzed there was no color in his face he attempted to speak but only an inarticulate gurgle resulted all eyed him anxiously  dont say it dont say it mctavish cried in a tense voice  yes i ate it plenty of it a whole plateful bertie cried explosively like a diver suddenly regaining breath  the awful silence continued half a minute longer and he read his fate in their eyes  maybe it wasnt poison after all said harriwell dismally  call in the cook said brown  in came the cook a grinning black boy nosespiked and earplugged  here you wiwi what name that harriwell bellowed pointing accusingly at the omelet  wiwi was very naturally frightened and embarrassed  him good fella kaikai he murmured apologetically  make him eat it suggested mctavish thats a proper test  harriwell filled a spoon with the stuff and jumped for the cook who fled in panic  that settles it was browns solemn pronouncement he wont eat it  mr brown will you please go and put the irons on him harriwell turned cheerfully to bertie its all right old man the commissioner will deal with him and if you die depend upon it he will be hanged  dont think the governmentll do it objected mctavish  but gentlemen gentlemen bertie cried in the meantime think of me  harriwell shrugged his shoulders pityingly  sorry old man but its a native poison and there are no known antidotes for native poisons try and compose yourself and if  two sharp reports of a rifle from without interrupted the discourse and brown entering reloaded his rifle and sat down to table  the cooks dead he said fever a rather sudden attack  i was just telling mr arkwright that there are no antidotes for native poisons  except gin said brown  harriwell called himself an absentminded idiot and rushed for the gin bottle  neat man neat he warned bertie who gulped down a tumbler twothirds full of the raw spirits and coughed and choked from the angry bite of it till the tears ran down his cheeks  harriwell took his pulse and temperature made a show of looking out for him and doubted that the omelet had been poisoned brown and mctavish also doubted but bertie discerned an insincere ring in their voices his appetite had left him and he took his own pulse stealthily under the table there was no question but what it was increasing but he failed to ascribe it to the gin he had taken mctavish rifle in hand went out on the veranda to reconnoiter  theyre massing up at the cookhouse was his report and theyve no end of sniders my idea is to sneak around on the other side and take them in flank strike the first blow you know will you come along brown  harriwell ate on steadily while bertie discovered that his pulse had leaped up five beats nevertheless he could not help jumping when the rifles began to go off above the scattering of sniders could be heard the pumping of browns and mctavishs winchestersall against a background of demoniacal screeching and yelling  theyve got them on the run harriwell remarked as voices and gunshots faded away in the distance  scarcely were brown and mctavish back at the table when the latter reconnoitered  theyve got dynamite he said  then lets charge them with dynamite harriwell proposed  thrusting half a dozen sticks each into their pockets and equipping themselves with lighted cigars they started for the door and just then it happened they blamed mctavish for it afterward and he admitted that the charge had been a trifle excessive but at any rate it went off under the house which lifted up cornerwise and settled back on its foundations half the china on the table was shattered while the eightday clock stopped yelling for vengeance the three men rushed out into the night and the bombardment began  when they returned there was no bertie he had dragged himself away to the office barricaded himself in and sunk upon the floor in a ginsoaked nightmare wherein he died a thousand deaths while the valorous fight went on around him in the morning sick and headachey from the gin he crawled out to find the sun still in the sky and god presumable in heaven for his hosts were alive and uninjured  harriwell pressed him to stay on longer but bertie insisted on sailing immediately on the arla for tulagi where until the following steamer day he stuck close by the commissioners house there were lady tourists on the outgoing steamer and bertie was again a hero while captain malu as usual passed unnoticed but captain malu sent back from sydney two cases of the best scotch whiskey on the market for he was not able to make up his mind as to whether it was captain hansen or mr harriwell who had given bertie arkwright the more gorgeous insight into life in the solomons     the inevitable white man  the black will never understand the white nor the white the black as long as black is black and white is white  so said captain woodward we sat in the parlor of charley roberts pub in apia drinking long abu hameds compounded and shared with us by the aforesaid charley roberts who claimed the recipe direct from stevens famous for having invented the abu hamed at a time when he was spurred on by nile thirstthe stevens who was responsible for with kitchener to kartoun and who passed out at the siege of ladysmith  captain woodward short and squat elderly burned by forty years of tropic sun and with the most beautiful liquid brown eyes i ever saw in a man spoke from a vast experience the crisscross of scars on his bald pate bespoke a tomahawk intimacy with the black and of equal intimacy was the advertisement front and rear on the right side of his neck where an arrow had at one time entered and been pulled clean through as he explained he had been in a hurry on that occasionthe arrow impeded his runningand he felt that he could not take the time to break off the head and pull out the shaft the way it had come in at the present moment he was commander of the savaii the big steamer that recruited labor from the westward for the german plantations on samoa  half the trouble is the stupidity of the whites said roberts pausing to take a swig from his glass and to curse the samoan barboy in affectionate terms if the white man would lay himself out a bit to understand the workings of the black mans mind most of the messes would be avoided  ive seen a few who claimed they understood niggers captain woodward retorted and i always took notice that they were the first to be kaikaid eaten look at the missionaries in new guinea and the new hebridesthe martyr isle of erromanga and all the rest look at the austrian expedition that was cut to pieces in the solomons in the bush of guadalcanar and look at the traders themselves with a score of years experience making their brag that no nigger would ever get them and whose heads to this day are ornamenting the rafters of the canoe houses there was old johnny simonstwentysix years on the raw edges of melanesia swore he knew the niggers like a book and that theyd never do for him and he passed out at marovo lagoon new georgia had his head sawed off by a black mary woman and an old nigger with only one leg having left the other leg in the mouth of a shark while diving for dynamited fish there was billy watts horrible reputation as a nigger killer a man to scare the devil i remember lying at cape little new ireland you know when the niggers stole half a case of tradetobaccocost him about three dollars and a half in retaliation he turned out shot six niggers smashed up their war canoes and burned two villages and it was at cape little four years afterward that he was jumped along with fifty buku boys he had with him fishing bêchedemer in five minutes they were all dead with the exception of three boys who got away in a canoe dont talk to me about understanding the nigger the white mans mission is to farm the world and its a big enough job cut out for him what time has he got left to understand niggers anyway  just so said roberts and somehow it doesnt seem necessary after all to understand the niggers in direct proportion to the white mans stupidity is his success in farming the world  and putting the fear of god into the niggers heart captain woodward blurted out perhaps youre right roberts perhaps its his stupidity that makes him succeed and surely one phase of his stupidity is his inability to understand the niggers but theres one thing sure the white has to run the niggers whether he understands them or not its inevitable its fate  and of course the white man is inevitableits the niggers fate roberts broke in tell the white man theres pearl shell in some lagoon infested by tenthousand howling cannibals and hell head there all by his lonely with half a dozen kanaka divers and a tin alarm clock for chronometer all packed like sardines on a commodious fiveton ketch whisper that theres a gold strike at the north pole and that same inevitable whiteskinned creature will set out at once armed with pick and shovel a side of bacon and the latest patent rockerand whats more hell get there tip it off to him that theres diamonds on the redhot ramparts of hell and mr white man will storm the ramparts and set old satan himself to pickandshovel work thats what comes of being stupid and inevitable  but i wonder what the black man must think of thethe inevitableness i said  captain woodward broke into quiet laughter his eyes had a reminiscent gleam  im just wondering what the niggers of malu thought and still must be thinking of the one inevitable white man we had on board when we visited them in the duchess he explained  roberts mixed three more abu hameds  that was twenty years ago saxtorph was his name he was certainly the most stupid man i ever saw but he was as inevitable as death there was only one thing that chap could do and that was shoot i remember the first time i ran into himright here in apia twenty years ago that was before your time roberts i was sleeping at dutch henrys hotel down where the market is now ever heard of him he made a tidy stake smuggling arms in to the rebels sold out his hotel and was killed in sydney just six weeks afterward in a saloon row  but saxtorph one night id just got to sleep when a couple of cats began to sing in the courtyard it was out of bed and up window water jug in hand but just then i heard the window of the next room go up two shots were fired and the window was closed i fail to impress you with the celerity of the transaction ten seconds at the outside up went the window bang bang went the revolver and down went the window whoever it was he had never stopped to see the effect of his shots he knew do you follow mehe knew there was no more cat concert and in the morning there lay the two offenders stone dead it was marvelous to me it still is marvelous first it was starlight and saxtorph shot without drawing a bead next he shot so rapidly that the two reports were like a double report and finally he knew he had hit his marks without looking to see  two days afterward he came on board to see me i was mate then on the duchess a whacking big onehundredand fiftyton schooner a blackbirder and let me tell you that blackbirders were blackbirders in those days there werent any government protection for us either it was rough work give and take if we were finished and nothing said and we ran niggers from every south sea island they didnt kick us off from well saxtorph came on board john saxtorph was the name he gave he was a sandy little man hair sandy complexion sandy and eyes sandy too nothing striking about him his soul was as neutral as his color scheme he said he was strapped and wanted to ship on board would go cabin boy cook supercargo or common sailor didnt know anything about any of the billets but said that he was willing to learn i didnt want him but his shooting had so impressed me that i took him as common sailor wages three pounds per month  he was willing to learn all right ill say that much but he was constitutionally unable to learn anything he could no more box the compass than i could mix drinks like roberts here and as for steering he gave me my first gray hairs i never dared risk him at the wheel when we were running in a big sea while fullandby and closeandby were insoluble mysteries couldnt ever tell the difference between a sheet and a tackle simply couldnt the forethroatjig and the jibjig were all one to him tell him to slack off the mainsheet and before you know it hed drop the peak he fell overboard three times and he couldnt swim but he was always cheerful never seasick and he was the most willing man i ever knew he was an uncommunicative soul never talked about himself his history so far as we were concerned began the day he signed on the duchess where he learned to shoot the stars alone can tell he was a yankeethat much we knew from the twang in his speech and that was all we ever did know  and now we begin to get to the point we had bad luck in the new hebrides only fourteen boys for five weeks and we ran up before the southeast for the solomons malaita then as now was good recruiting ground and we ran into malu on the northwestern corner theres a shore reef and an outer reef and a mighty nervous anchorage but we made it all right and fired off our dynamite as a signal to the niggers to come down and be recruited in three days we got not a boy the niggers came off to us in their canoes by hundreds but they only laughed when we showed them beads and calico and hatchets and talked of the delights of plantation work in samoa  on the fourth day there came a change fiftyodd boys signed on and were billeted in the mainhold with the freedom of the deck of course and of course looking back this wholesale signing on was suspicious but at the time we thought some powerful chief had removed the ban against recruiting the morning of the fifth day our two boats went ashore as usualone to cover the other you know in case of trouble and as usual the fifty niggers on board were on deck loafing talking smoking and sleeping saxtorph and myself along with four other sailors were all that were left on board the two boats were manned with gilbert islanders in the one were the captain the supercargo and the recruiter in the other which was the covering boat and which lay off shore a hundred yards was the second mate both boats were wellarmed though trouble was little expected  four of the sailors including saxtorph were scraping the poop rail the fifth sailor rifle in hand was standing guard by the watertank just forard of the mainmast i was forard putting in the finishing licks on a new jaw for the foregaff i was just reaching for my pipe where i had laid it down when i heard a shot from shore i straightened up to look something struck me on the back of the head partially stunning me and knocking me to the deck my first thought was that something had carried away aloft but even as i went down and before i struck the deck i heard the devils own tattoo of rifles from the boats and twisting sidewise i caught a glimpse of the sailor who was standing guard two big niggers were holding his arms and a third nigger from behind was braining him with a tomahawk  i can see it now the watertank the mainmast the gang hanging on to him the hatchet descending on the back of his head and all under the blazing sunlight i was fascinated by that growing vision of death the tomahawk seemed to take a horribly long time to come down i saw it land and the mans legs give under him as he crumpled the niggers held him up by sheer strength while he was hacked a couple of times more then i got two more hacks on the head and decided that i was dead so did the brute that was hacking me i was too helpless to move and i lay there and watched them removing the sentrys head i must say they did it slick enough they were old hands at the business  the rifle firing from the boats had ceased and i made no doubt that they were finished off and that the end had come to everything it was only a matter of moments when they would return for my head they were evidently taking the heads from the sailors aft heads are valuable on malaita especially white heads they have the place of honor in the canoe houses of the saltwater natives what particular decorative effect the bushmen get out of them i didnt know but they prize them just as much as the saltwater crowd  i had a dim notion of escaping and i crawled on hands and knees to the winch where i managed to drag myself to my feet from there i could look aft and see three heads on top the cabinthe heads of three sailors i had given orders to for months the niggers saw me standing and started for me i reached for my revolver and found they had taken it i cant say that i was scared ive been near to death several times but it never seemed easier than right then i was halfstunned and nothing seemed to matter  the leading nigger had armed himself with a cleaver from the galley and he grimaced like an ape as he prepared to slice me down but the slice was never made he went down on the deck all of a heap and i saw the blood gush from his mouth in a dim way i heard a rifle go off and continue to go off nigger after nigger went down my senses began to clear and i noted that there was never a miss every time that the rifle went off a nigger dropped i sat down on deck beside the winch and looked up perched in the crosstrees was saxtorph how he had managed it i cant imagine for he had carried up with him two winchesters and i dont know how many bandoliers of ammunition and he was now doing the one only thing in this world that he was fitted to do  ive seen shooting and slaughter but i never saw anything like that i sat by the winch and watched the show i was weak and faint and it seemed to be all a dream bang bang bang bang went his rifle and thud thud thud thud went the niggers to the deck it was amazing to see them go down after their first rush to get me when about a dozen had dropped they seemed paralyzed but he never left off pumping his gun by this time canoes and the two boats arrived from shore armed with sniders and with winchesters which they had captured in the boats the fusillade they let loose on saxtorph was tremendous luckily for him the niggers are only good at close range they are not used to putting the gun to their shoulders they wait until they are right on top of a man and then they shoot from the hip when his rifle got too hot saxtorph changed off that had been his idea when he carried two rifles up with him  the astounding thing was the rapidity of his fire also he never made a miss if ever anything was inevitable that man was it was the swiftness of it that made the slaughter so appalling the niggers did not have time to think when they did manage to think they went over the side in a rush capsizing the canoes of course saxtorph never let up the water was covered with them and plump plump plump he dropped his bullets into them not a single miss and i could hear distinctly the thud of every bullet as it buried in human flesh  the niggers spread out and headed for the shore swimming the water was carpeted with bobbing heads and i stood up as in a dream and watched it allthe bobbing heads and the heads that ceased to bob some of the long shots were magnificent only one man reached the beach but as he stood up to wade ashore saxtorph got him it was beautiful and when a couple of niggers ran down to drag him out of the water saxtorph got them too  i thought everything was over then when i heard the rifle go off again a nigger had come out of the cabin companion on the run for the rail and gone down in the middle of it the cabin must have been full of them i counted twenty they came up one at a time and jumped for the rail but they never got there it reminded me of trapshooting a black body would pop out of the companion bang would go saxtorphs rifle and down would go the black body of course those below did not know what was happening on deck so they continued to pop out until the last one was finished off  saxtorph waited a while to make sure and then came down on deck he and i were all that were left of the duchesss complement and i was pretty well to the bad while he was helpless now that the shooting was over under my direction he washed out my scalp wounds and sewed them up a big drink of whiskey braced me to make an effort to get out there was nothing else to do all the rest were dead we tried to get up sail saxtorph hoisting and i holding the turn he was once more the stupid lubber he couldnt hoist worth a cent and when i fell in a faint it looked all up with us  when i came to saxtorph was sitting helplessly on the rail waiting to ask me what he should do i told him to overhaul the wounded and see if there were any able to crawl he gathered together six one i remember had a broken leg but saxtorph said his arms were all right i lay in the shade brushing the flies off and directing operations while saxtorph bossed his hospital gang ill be blessed if he didnt make those poor niggers heave at every rope on the pinrails before he found the halyards one of them let go the rope in the midst of the hoisting and slipped down to the deck dead but saxtorph hammered the others and made them stick by the job when the fore and main were up i told him to knock the shackle out of the anchor chain and let her go i had had myself helped aft to the wheel where i was going to make a shift at steering i cant guess how he did it but instead of knocking the shackle out down went the second anchor and there we were doubly moored  in the end he managed to knock both shackles out and raise the staysail and jib and the duchess filled away for the entrance our decks were a spectacle dead and dying niggers were everywhere they were wedged away some of them in the most inconceivable places the cabin was full of them where they had crawled off the deck and cashed in i put saxtorph and his graveyard gang to work heaving them overside and over they went the living and the dead the sharks had fat pickings that day of course our four murdered sailors went the same way their heads however we put in a sack with weights so that by no chance should they drift on the beach and fall into the hands of the niggers  our five prisoners i decided to use as crew but they decided otherwise they watched their opportunity and went over the side saxtorph got two in midair with his revolver and would have shot the other three in the water if i hadnt stopped him i was sick of the slaughter you see and besides theyd helped work the schooner out but it was mercy thrown away for the sharks got the three of them  i had brain fever or something after we got clear of the land anyway the duchess lay hove to for three weeks when i pulled myself together and we jogged on with her to sydney anyway those niggers of malu learned the everlasting lesson that it is not good to monkey with a white man in their case saxtorph was certainly inevitable  charley roberts emitted a long whistle and said  well i should say so but whatever became of saxtorph  he drifted into seal hunting and became a crackerjack for six years he was high line of both the victoria and san francisco fleets the seventh year his schooner was seized in bering sea by a russian cruiser and all hands so the talk went were slammed into the siberian salt mines at least ive never heard of him since  farming the world roberts muttered farming the world well heres to them somebodys got to do itfarm the world i mean  captain woodward rubbed the crisscrosses on his bald head  ive done my share of it he said forty years now this will be my last trip then im going home to stay  ill wager the wine you dont roberts challenged youll die in the harness not at home  captain woodward promptly accepted the bet but personally i think charley roberts has the best of it     the seed of mccoy  the pyrenees her iron sides pressed low in the water by her cargo of wheat rolled sluggishly and made it easy for the man who was climbing aboard from out a tiny outrigger canoe as his eyes came level with the rail so that he could see inboard it seemed to him that he saw a dim almost indiscernible haze it was more like an illusion like a blurring film that had spread abruptly over his eyes he felt an inclination to brush it away and the same instant he thought that he was growing old and that it was time to send to san francisco for a pair of spectacles  as he came over the rail he cast a glance aloft at the tall masts and next at the pumps they were not working there seemed nothing the matter with the big ship and he wondered why she had hoisted the signal of distress he thought of his happy islanders and hoped it was not disease perhaps the ship was short of water or provisions he shook hands with the captain whose gaunt face and careworn eyes made no secret of the trouble whatever it was at the same moment the newcomer was aware of a faint indefinable smell it seemed like that of burnt bread but different  he glanced curiously about him twenty feet away a wearyfaced sailor was calking the deck as his eyes lingered on the man he saw suddenly arise from under his hands a faint spiral of haze that curled and twisted and was gone by now he had reached the deck his bare feet were pervaded by a dull warmth that quickly penetrated the thick calluses he knew now the nature of the ships distress his eyes roved swiftly forward where the full crew of wearyfaced sailors regarded him eagerly the glance from his liquid brown eyes swept over them like a benediction soothing them rapping them about as in the mantle of a great peace how long has she been afire captain he asked in a voice so gentle and unperturbed that it was as the cooing of a dove  at first the captain felt the peace and content of it stealing in upon him then the consciousness of all that he had gone through and was going through smote him and he was resentful by what right did this ragged beachcomber in dungaree trousers and a cotton shirt suggest such a thing as peace and content to him and his overwrought exhausted soul the captain did not reason this it was the unconscious process of emotion that caused his resentment  fifteen days he answered shortly who are you  my name is mccoy came the answer in tones that breathed tenderness and compassion  i mean are you the pilot  mccoy passed the benediction of his gaze over the tall heavyshouldered man with the haggard unshaven face who had joined the captain  i am as much a pilot as anybody was mccoys answer we are all pilots here captain and i know every inch of these waters  but the captain was impatient  what i want is some of the authorities i want to talk with them and blame quick  then ill do just as well  again that insidious suggestion of peace and his ship a raging furnace beneath his feet the captains eyebrows lifted impatiently and nervously and his fist clenched as if he were about to strike a blow with it  who in hell are you he demanded  i am the chief magistrate was the reply in a voice that was still the softest and gentlest imaginable  the tall heavyshouldered man broke out in a harsh laugh that was partly amusement but mostly hysterical both he and the captain regarded mccoy with incredulity and amazement that this barefooted beachcomber should possess such highsounding dignity was inconceivable his cotton shirt unbuttoned exposed a grizzled chest and the fact that there was no undershirt beneath  a worn straw hat failed to hide the ragged gray hair halfway down his chest descended an untrimmed patriarchal beard in any slop shop two shillings would have outfitted him complete as he stood before them  any relation to the mccoy of the bounty the captain asked  he was my greatgrandfather  oh the captain said then bethought himself my name is davenport and this is my first mate mr konig  they shook hands  and now to business the captain spoke quickly the urgency of a great haste pressing his speech weve been on fire for over two weeks shes ready to break all hell loose any moment thats why i held for pitcairn i want to beach her or scuttle her and save the hull  then you made a mistake captain said mccoy you should have slacked away for mangareva theres a beautiful beach there in a lagoon where the water is like a mill pond  but were here aint we the first mate demanded thats the point were here and weve got to do something  mccoy shook his head kindly  you can do nothing here there is no beach there isnt even anchorage  gammon said the mate gammon he repeated loudly as the captain signaled him to be more soft spoken you cant tell me that sort of stuff where dye keep your own boats heyyour schooner or cutter or whatever you have hey answer me that  mccoy smiled as gently as he spoke his smile was a caress an embrace that surrounded the tired mate and sought to draw him into the quietude and rest of mccoys tranquil soul  we have no schooner or cutter he replied and we carry our canoes to the top of the cliff  youve got to show me snorted the mate how dye get around to the other islands heh tell me that  we dont get around as governor of pitcairn i sometimes go when i was younger i was away a great dealsometimes on the trading schooners but mostly on the missionary brig but shes gone now and we depend on passing vessels sometimes we have had as high as six calls in one year at other times a year and even longer has gone by without one passing ship yours is the first in seven months  and you mean to tell me the mate began  but captain davenport interfered  enough of this were losing time what is to be done mr mccoy  the old man turned his brown eyes sweet as a womans shoreward and both captain and mate followed his gaze around from the lonely rock of pitcairn to the crew clustering forward and waiting anxiously for the announcement of a decision mccoy did not hurry he thought smoothly and slowly step by step with the certitude of a mind that was never vexed or outraged by life  the wind is light now he said finally there is a heavy current setting to the westward  thats what made us fetch to leeward the captain interrupted desiring to vindicate his seamanship  yes that is what fetched you to leeward mccoy went on well you cant work up against this current today and if you did there is no beach your ship will be a total loss  he paused and captain and mate looked despair at each other  but i will tell you what you can do the breeze will freshen tonight around midnightsee those tails of clouds and that thickness to windward beyond the point there thats where shell come from out of the southeast hard it is three hundred miles to mangareva square away for it there is a beautiful bed for your ship there  the mate shook his head  come in to the cabin and well look at the chart said the captain  mccoy found a stifling poisonous atmosphere in the pent cabin stray waftures of invisible gases bit his eyes and made them sting the deck was hotter almost unbearably hot to his bare feet the sweat poured out of his body he looked almost with apprehension about him this malignant internal heat was astounding it was a marvel that the cabin did not burst into flames he had a feeling as if of being in a huge bake oven where the heat might at any moment increase tremendously and shrivel him up like a blade of grass  as he lifted one foot and rubbed the hot sole against the leg of his trousers the mate laughed in a savage snarling fashion  the anteroom of hell he said hell herself is right down there under your feet  its hot mccoy cried involuntarily mopping his face with a bandana handkerchief  heres mangareva the captain said bending over the table and pointing to a black speck in the midst of the white blankness of the chart and here in between is another island why not run for that  mccoy did not look at the chart  thats crescent island he answered it is uninhabited and it is only two or three feet above water lagoon but no entrance no mangareva is the nearest place for your purpose  mangareva it is then said captain davenport interrupting the mates growling objection call the crew aft mr konig  the sailors obeyed shuffling wearily along the deck and painfully endeavoring to make haste exhaustion was evident in every movement the cook came out of his galley to hear and the cabin boy hung about near him  when captain davenport had explained the situation and announced his intention of running for mangareva an uproar broke out against a background of throaty rumbling arose inarticulate cries of rage with here and there a distinct curse or word or phrase a shrill cockney voice soared and dominated for a moment crying gawd after bein in ell for fifteen daysan now e wants us to sail this floatin ell to sea again  the captain could not control them but mccoys gentle presence seemed to rebuke and calm them and the muttering and cursing died away until the full crew save here and there an anxious face directed at the captain yearned dumbly toward the green clad peaks and beetling coast of pitcairn  soft as a spring zephyr was the voice of mccoy  captain i thought i heard some of them say they were starving  ay was the answer and so we are ive had a sea biscuit and a spoonful of salmon in the last two days were on whack you see when we discovered the fire we battened down immediately to suffocate the fire and then we found how little food there was in the pantry but it was too late we didnt dare break out the lazarette hungry im just as hungry as they are  he spoke to the men again and again the throat rumbling and cursing arose their faces convulsed and animallike with rage the second and third mates had joined the captain standing behind him at the break of the poop their faces were set and expressionless they seemed bored more than anything else by this mutiny of the crew captain davenport glanced questioningly at his first mate and that person merely shrugged his shoulders in token of his helplessness  you see the captain said to mccoy you cant compel sailors to leave the safe land and go to sea on a burning vessel she has been their floating coffin for over two weeks now they are worked out and starved out and theyve got enough of her well beat up for pitcairn  but the wind was light the pyrenees bottom was foul and she could not beat up against the strong westerly current at the end of two hours she had lost three miles the sailors worked eagerly as if by main strength they could compel the pyrenees against the adverse elements but steadily port tack and starboard tack she sagged off to the westward the captain paced restlessly up and down pausing occasionally to survey the vagrant smoke wisps and to trace them back to the portions of the deck from which they sprang the carpenter was engaged constantly in attempting to locate such places and when he succeeded in calking them tighter and tighter  well what do you think the captain finally asked mccoy who was watching the carpenter with all a childs interest and curiosity in his eyes  mccoy looked shoreward where the land was disappearing in the thickening haze  i think it would be better to square away for mangareva with that breeze that is coming youll be there tomorrow evening  but what if the fire breaks out it is liable to do it any moment  have your boats ready in the falls the same breeze will carry your boats to mangareva if the ship burns out from under  captain davenport debated for a moment and then mccoy heard the question he had not wanted to hear but which he knew was surely coming  i have no chart of mangareva on the general chart it is only a fly speck i would not know where to look for the entrance into the lagoon will you come along and pilot her in for me  mccoys serenity was unbroken  yes captain he said with the same quiet unconcern with which he would have accepted an invitation to dinner ill go with you to mangareva  again the crew was called aft and the captain spoke to them from the break of the poop  weve tried to work her up but you see how weve lost ground shes setting off in a twoknot current this gentleman is the honorable mccoy chief magistrate and governor of pitcairn island he will come along with us to mangareva so you see the situation is not so dangerous he would not make such an offer if he thought he was going to lose his life besides whatever risk there is if he of his own free will come on board and take it we can do no less what do you say for mangareva  this time there was no uproar mccoys presence the surety and calm that seemed to radiate from him had had its effect they conferred with one another in low voices there was little urging they were virtually unanimous and they shoved the cockney out as their spokesman that worthy was overwhelmed with consciousness of the heroism of himself and his mates and with flashing eyes he cried  by gawd if e will we will  the crew mumbled its assent and started forward  one moment captain mccoy said as the other was turning to give orders to the mate i must go ashore first  mr konig was thunderstruck staring at mccoy as if he were a madman  go ashore the captain cried what for it will take you three hours to get there in your canoe  mccoy measured the distance of the land away and nodded  yes it is six now i wont get ashore till nine the people cannot be assembled earlier than ten as the breeze freshens up tonight you can begin to work up against it and pick me up at daylight tomorrow morning  in the name of reason and common sense the captain burst forth what do you want to assemble the people for dont you realize that my ship is burning beneath me  mccoy was as placid as a summer sea and the others anger produced not the slightest ripple upon it  yes captain he cooed in his dovelike voice i do realize that your ship is burning that is why i am going with you to mangareva but i must get permission to go with you it is our custom it is an important matter when the governor leaves the island the peoples interests are at stake and so they have the right to vote their permission or refusal but they will give it i know that  are you sure  quite sure  then if you know they will give it why bother with getting it think of the delaya whole night  it is our custom was the imperturbable reply also i am the governor and i must make arrangements for the conduct of the island during my absence  but it is only a twentyfour hour run to mangareva the captain objected suppose it took you six times that long to return to windward that would bring you back by the end of a week  mccoy smiled his large benevolent smile  very few vessels come to pitcairn and when they do they are usually from san francisco or from around the horn i shall be fortunate if i get back in six months i may be away a year and i may have to go to san francisco in order to find a vessel that will bring me back my father once left pitcairn to be gone three months and two years passed before he could get back then too you are short of food if you have to take to the boats and the weather comes up bad you may be days in reaching land i can bring off two canoe loads of food in the morning dried bananas will be best as the breeze freshens you beat up against it the nearer you are the bigger loads i can bring off goodby  he held out his hand the captain shook it and was reluctant to let go he seemed to cling to it as a drowning sailor clings to a life buoy  how do i know you will come back in the morning he asked  yes thats it cried the mate how do we know but what hes skinning out to save his own hide  mccoy did not speak he looked at them sweetly and benignantly and it seemed to them that they received a message from his tremendous certitude of soul  the captain released his hand and with a last sweeping glance that embraced the crew in its benediction mccoy went over the rail and descended into his canoe  the wind freshened and the pyrenees despite the foulness of her bottom won half a dozen miles away from the westerly current at daylight with pitcairn three miles to windward captain davenport made out two canoes coming off to him again mccoy clambered up the side and dropped over the rail to the hot deck he was followed by many packages of dried bananas each package wrapped in dry leaves  now captain he said swing the yards and drive for dear life you see i am no navigator he explained a few minutes later as he stood by the captain aft the latter with gaze wandering from aloft to overside as he estimated the pyrenees speed you must fetch her to mangareva when you have picked up the land then i will pilot her in what do you think she is making  eleven captain davenport answered with a final glance at the water rushing past  eleven let me see if she keeps up that gait well sight mangareva between eight and nine oclock tomorrow morning ill have her on the beach by ten or by eleven at latest and then your troubles will be all over  it almost seemed to the captain that the blissful moment had already arrived such was the persuasive convincingness of mccoy  captain davenport had been under the fearful strain of navigating his burning ship for over two weeks and he was beginning to feel that he had had enough  a heavier flaw of wind struck the back of his neck and whistled by his ears he measured the weight of it and looked quickly overside  the wind is making all the time he announced the old girls doing nearer twelve than eleven right now if this keeps up well be shortening down tonight  all day the pyrenees carrying her load of living fire tore across the foaming sea by nightfall royals and topgallantsails were in and she flew on into the darkness with great crested seas roaring after her the auspicious wind had had its effect and fore and aft a visible brightening was apparent in the second dogwatch some careless soul started a song and by eight bells the whole crew was singing  captain davenport had his blankets brought up and spread on top the house  ive forgotten what sleep is he explained to mccoy im all in but give me a call at any time you think necessary  at three in the morning he was aroused by a gentle tugging at his arm he sat up quickly bracing himself against the skylight stupid yet from his heavy sleep the wind was thrumming its war song in the rigging and a wild sea was buffeting the pyrenees amidships she was wallowing first one rail under and then the other flooding the waist more often than not mccoy was shouting something he could not hear he reached out clutched the other by the shoulder and drew him close so that his own ear was close to the others lips  its three oclock came mccoys voice still retaining its dovelike quality but curiously muffled as if from a long way off weve run two hundred and fifty crescent island is only thirty miles away somewhere there dead ahead theres no lights on it if we keep running well pile up and lose ourselves as well as the ship  what d ye thinkheave to  yes heave to till daylight it will only put us back four hours  so the pyrenees with her cargo of fire was hove to bitting the teeth of the gale and fighting and smashing the pounding seas she was a shell filled with a conflagration and on the outside of the shell clinging precariously the little motes of men by pull and haul helped her in the battle  it is most unusual this gale mccoy told the captain in the lee of the cabin by rights there should be no gale at this time of the year but everything about the weather has been unusual there has been a stoppage of the trades and now its howling right out of the trade quarter he waved his hand into the darkness as if his vision could dimly penetrate for hundreds of miles it is off to the westward there is something big making off there somewherea hurricane or something were lucky to be so far to the eastward but this is only a little blow he added it cant last i can tell you that much  by daylight the gale had eased down to normal but daylight revealed a new danger it had come on thick the sea was covered by a fog or rather by a pearly mist that was foglike in density in so far as it obstructed vision but that was no more than a film on the sea for the sun shot it through and filled it with a glowing radiance  the deck of the pyrenees was making more smoke than on the preceding day and the cheerfulness of officers and crew had vanished in the lee of the galley the cabin boy could be heard whimpering it was his first voyage and the fear of death was at his heart the captain wandered about like a lost soul nervously chewing his mustache scowling unable to make up his mind what to do  what do you think he asked pausing by the side of mccoy who was making a breakfast off fried bananas and a mug of water  mccoy finished the last banana drained the mug and looked slowly around in his eyes was a smile of tenderness as he said  well captain we might as well drive as burn your decks are not going to hold out forever they are hotter this morning you havent a pair of shoes i can wear it is getting uncomfortable for my bare feet  the pyrenees shipped two heavy seas as she was swung off and put once more before it and the first mate expressed a desire to have all that water down in the hold if only it could be introduced without taking off the hatches mccoy ducked his head into the binnacle and watched the course set  id hold her up some more captain he said shes been making drift when hove to  ive set it to a point higher already was the answer isnt that enough  id make it two points captain this bit of a blow kicked that westerly current ahead faster than you imagine  captain davenport compromised on a point and a half and then went aloft accompanied by mccoy and the first mate to keep a lookout for land sail had been made so that the pyrenees was doing ten knots the following sea was dying down rapidly there was no break in the pearly fog and by ten oclock captain davenport was growing nervous all hands were at their stations ready at the first warning of land ahead to spring like fiends to the task of bringing the pyrenees up on the wind that land ahead a surfwashed outer reef would be perilously close when it revealed itself in such a fog  another hour passed the three watchers aloft stared intently into the pearly radiance what if we miss mangareva captain davenport asked abruptly  mccoy without shifting his gaze answered softly  why let her drive captain that is all we can do all the paumotus are before us we can drive for a thousand miles through reefs and atolls we are bound to fetch up somewhere  then drive it is captain davenport evidenced his intention of descending to the deck weve missed mangareva god knows where the next land is i wish id held her up that other halfpoint he confessed a moment later this cursed current plays the devil with a navigator  the old navigators called the paumotus the dangerous archipelago mccoy said when they had regained the poop this very current was partly responsible for that name  i was talking with a sailor chap in sydney once said mr konig hed been trading in the paumotus he told me insurance was eighteen per cent is that right  mccoy smiled and nodded  except that they dont insure he explained the owners write off twenty per cent of the cost of their schooners each year  my god captain davenport groaned that makes the life of a schooner only five years he shook his head sadly murmuring bad waters bad waters  again they went into the cabin to consult the big general chart but the poisonous vapors drove them coughing and gasping on deck  here is moerenhout island captain davenport pointed it out on the chart which he had spread on the house it cant be more than a hundred miles to leeward  a hundred and ten mccoy shook his head doubtfully it might be done but it is very difficult i might beach her and then again i might put her on the reef a bad place a very bad place  well take the chance was captain davenports decision as he set about working out the course  sail was shortened early in the afternoon to avoid running past in the night and in the second dogwatch the crew manifested its regained cheerfulness land was so very near and their troubles would be over in the morning  but morning broke clear with a blazing tropic sun the southeast trade had swung around to the eastward and was driving the pyrenees through the water at an eightknot clip captain davenport worked up his dead reckoning allowing generously for drift and announced moerenhout island to be not more than ten miles off the pyrenees sailed the ten miles she sailed ten miles more and the lookouts at the three mastheads saw naught but the naked sunwashed sea  but the land is there i tell you captain davenport shouted to them from the poop  mccoy smiled soothingly but the captain glared about him like a madman fetched his sextant and took a chronometer sight  i knew i was right he almost shouted when he had worked up the observation twentyone fiftyfive south onethirtysix two west there you are were eight miles to windward yet what did you make it out mr konig  the first mate glanced at his own figures and said in a low voice  twentyone fiftyfive all right but my longitudes onethirtysix fortyeight that puts us considerably to leeward  but captain davenport ignored his figures with so contemptuous a silence as to make mr konig grit his teeth and curse savagely under his breath  keep her off the captain ordered the man at the wheel three pointssteady there as she goes  then he returned to his figures and worked them over the sweat poured from his face he chewed his mustache his lips and his pencil staring at the figures as a man might at a ghost suddenly with a fierce muscular outburst he crumpled the scribbled paper in his fist and crushed it under foot mr konig grinned vindictively and turned away while captain davenport leaned against the cabin and for half an hour spoke no word contenting himself with gazing to leeward with an expression of musing hopelessness on his face  mr mccoy he broke silence abruptly the chart indicates a group of islands but not how many off there to the northard or nornorwestward about forty milesthe acteon islands what about them  there are four all low mccoy answered first to the southeast is matueruino people no entrance to the lagoon then comes tenarunga there used to be about a dozen people there but they may be all gone now anyway there is no entrance for a shiponly a boat entrance with a fathom of water vehauga and teuararo are the other two no entrances no people very low there is no bed for the pyrenees in that group she would be a total wreck  listen to that captain davenport was frantic no people no entrances what in the devil are islands good for  well then he barked suddenly like an excited terrier the chart gives a whole mess of islands off to the norwest what about them what one has an entrance where i can lay my ship  mccoy calmly considered he did not refer to the chart all these islands reefs shoals lagoons entrances and distances were marked on the chart of his memory he knew them as the city dweller knows his buildings streets and alleys  papakena and vanavana are off there to the westward or westnorwestward a hundred miles and a bit more he said one is uninhabited and i heard that the people on the other had gone off to cadmus island anyway neither lagoon has an entrance ahunui is another hundred miles on to the norwest no entrance no people  well forty miles beyond them are two islands captain davenport queried raising his head from the chart  mccoy shook his head  paros and manuhungino entrances no people nengonengo is forty miles beyond them in turn and it has no people and no entrance but there is hao island it is just the place the lagoon is thirty miles long and five miles wide there are plenty of people you can usually find water and any ship in the world can go through the entrance  he ceased and gazed solicitously at captain davenport who bending over the chart with a pair of dividers in hand had just emitted a low groan  is there any lagoon with an entrance anywhere nearer than hao island he asked  no captain that is the nearest  well its three hundred and forty miles captain davenport was speaking very slowly with decision i wont risk the responsibility of all these lives ill wreck her on the acteons and shes a good ship too he added regretfully after altering the course this time making more allowance than ever for the westerly current  an hour later the sky was overcast the southeast trade still held but the ocean was a checker board of squalls  well be there by one oclock captain davenport announced confidently by two oclock at the outside mccoy you put her ashore on the one where the people are  the sun did not appear again nor at one oclock was any land to be seen captain davenport looked astern at the pyrenees canting wake  good lord he cried an easterly current look at that  mr konig was incredulous mccoy was noncommittal though he said that in the paumotus there was no reason why it should not be an easterly current a few minutes later a squall robbed the pyrenees temporarily of all her wind and she was left rolling heavily in the trough  wheres that deep lead over with it you there captain davenport held the lead line and watched it sag off to the northeast there look at that take hold of it for yourself  mccoy and the mate tried it and felt the line thrumming and vibrating savagely to the grip of the tidal stream  a fourknot current said mr konig  an easterly current instead of a westerly said captain davenport glaring accusingly at mccoy as if to cast the blame for it upon him  that is one of the reasons captain for insurance being eighteen per cent in these waters mccoy answered cheerfully you can never tell the currents are always changing there was a man who wrote books i forget his name in the yacht casco he missed takaroa by thirty miles and fetched tikei all because of the shifting currents you are up to windward now and youd better keep off a few points  but how much has this current set me the captain demanded irately how am i to know how much to keep off  i dont know captain mccoy said with great gentleness  the wind returned and the pyrenees her deck smoking and shimmering in the bright gray light ran off dead to leeward then she worked back port tack and starboard tack crisscrossing her track combing the sea for the acteon islands which the masthead lookouts failed to sight  captain davenport was beside himself his rage took the form of sullen silence and he spent the afternoon in pacing the poop or leaning against the weather shrouds at nightfall without even consulting mccoy he squared away and headed into the northwest mr konig surreptitiously consulting chart and binnacle and mccoy openly and innocently consulting the binnacle knew that they were running for hao island by midnight the squalls ceased and the stars came out captain davenport was cheered by the promise of a clear day  ill get an observation in the morning he told mccoy though what my latitude is is a puzzler but ill use the sumner method and settle that do you know the sumner line  and thereupon he explained it in detail to mccoy  the day proved clear the trade blew steadily out of the east and the pyrenees just as steadily logged her nine knots both the captain and mate worked out the position on a sumner line and agreed and at noon agreed again and verified the morning sights by the noon sights  another twentyfour hours and well be there captain davenport assured mccoy its a miracle the way the old girls decks hold out but they cant last they cant last look at them smoke more and more every day yet it was a tight deck to begin with freshcalked in frisco i was surprised when the fire first broke out and we battened down look at that  he broke off to gaze with dropped jaw at a spiral of smoke that coiled and twisted in the lee of the mizzenmast twenty feet above the deck  now how did that get there he demanded indignantly  beneath it there was no smoke crawling up from the deck sheltered from the wind by the mast by some freak it took form and visibility at that height it writhed away from the mast and for a moment overhung the captain like some threatening portent the next moment the wind whisked it away and the captains jaw returned to place  as i was saying when we first battened down i was surprised it was a tight deck yet it leaked smoke like a sieve and weve calked and calked ever since there must be tremendous pressure underneath to drive so much smoke through  that afternoon the sky became overcast again and squally drizzly weather set in the wind shifted back and forth between southeast and northeast and at midnight the pyrenees was caught aback by a sharp squall from the southwest from which point the wind continued to blow intermittently  we wont make hao until ten or eleven captain davenport complained at seven in the morning when the fleeting promise of the sun had been erased by hazy cloud masses in the eastern sky and the next moment he was plaintively demanding and what are the currents doing  lookouts at the mastheads could report no land and the day passed in drizzling calms and violent squalls by nightfall a heavy sea began to make from the west the barometer had fallen to 2950 there was no wind and still the ominous sea continued to increase soon the pyrenees was rolling madly in the huge waves that marched in an unending procession from out of the darkness of the west sail was shortened as fast as both watches could work and when the tired crew had finished its grumbling and complaining voices peculiarly animallike and menacing could be heard in the darkness once the starboard watch was called aft to lash down and make secure and the men openly advertised their sullenness and unwillingness every slow movement was a protest and a threat the atmosphere was moist and sticky like mucilage and in the absence of wind all hands seemed to pant and gasp for air the sweat stood out on faces and bare arms and captain davenport for one his face more gaunt and careworn than ever and his eyes troubled and staring was oppressed by a feeling of impending calamity  its off to the westward mccoy said encouragingly at worst well be only on the edge of it  but captain davenport refused to be comforted and by the light of a lantern read up the chapter in his epitome that related to the strategy of shipmasters in cyclonic storms from somewhere amidships the silence was broken by a low whimpering from the cabin boy  oh shut up captain davenport yelled suddenly and with such force as to startle every man on board and to frighten the offender into a wild wail of terror  mr konig the captain said in a voice that trembled with rage and nerves will you kindly step forard and stop that brats mouth with a deck mop  but it was mccoy who went forward and in a few minutes had the boy comforted and asleep  shortly before daybreak the first breath of air began to move from out the southeast increasing swiftly to a stiff and stiffer breeze all hands were on deck waiting for what might be behind it were all right now captain said mccoy standing close to his shoulder the hurricane is to the westard and we are south of it this breeze is the insuck it wont blow any harder you can begin to put sail on her  but whats the good where shall i sail this is the second day without observations and we should have sighted hao island yesterday morning which way does it bear north south east or what tell me that and ill make sail in a jiffy  i am no navigator captain mccoy said in his mild way  i used to think i was one was the retort before i got into these paumotus  at midday the cry of breakers ahead was heard from the lookout the pyrenees was kept off and sail after sail was loosed and sheeted home the pyrenees was sliding through the water and fighting a current that threatened to set her down upon the breakers officers and men were working like mad cook and cabin boy captain davenport himself and mccoy all lending a hand it was a close shave it was a low shoal a bleak and perilous place over which the seas broke unceasingly where no man could live and on which not even sea birds could rest the pyrenees was swept within a hundred yards of it before the wind carried her clear and at this moment the panting crew its work done burst out in a torrent of curses upon the head of mccoyof mccoy who had come on board and proposed the run to mangareva and lured them all away from the safety of pitcairn island to certain destruction in this baffling and terrible stretch of sea but mccoys tranquil soul was undisturbed he smiled at them with simple and gracious benevolence and somehow the exalted goodness of him seemed to penetrate to their dark and somber souls shaming them and from very shame stilling the curses vibrating in their throats  bad waters bad waters captain davenport was murmuring as his ship forged clear but he broke off abruptly to gaze at the shoal which should have been dead astern but which was already on the pyrenees weatherquarter and working up rapidly to windward  he sat down and buried his face in his hands and the first mate saw and mccoy saw and the crew saw what he had seen south of the shoal an easterly current had set them down upon it north of the shoal an equally swift westerly current had clutched the ship and was sweeping her away  ive heard of these paumotus before the captain groaned lifting his blanched face from his hands captain moyendale told me about them after losing his ship on them and i laughed at him behind his back god forgive me i laughed at him what shoal is that he broke off to ask mccoy  i dont know captain  why dont you know  because i never saw it before and because i have never heard of it i do know that it is not charted these waters have never been thoroughly surveyed  then you dont know where we are  no more than you do mccoy said gently  at four in the afternoon cocoanut trees were sighted apparently growing out of the water a little later the low land of an atoll was raised above the sea  i know where we are now captain mccoy lowered the glasses from his eyes thats resolution island we are forty miles beyond hao island and the wind is in our teeth  get ready to beach her then wheres the entrance  theres only a canoe passage but now that we know where we are we can run for barclay de tolley it is only one hundred and twenty miles from here due nornorwest with this breeze we can be there by nine oclock tomorrow morning  captain davenport consulted the chart and debated with himself  if we wreck her here mccoy added wed have to make the run to barclay de tolley in the boats just the same  the captain gave his orders and once more the pyrenees swung off for another run across the inhospitable sea  and the middle of the next afternoon saw despair and mutiny on her smoking deck the current had accelerated the wind had slackened and the pyrenees had sagged off to the west the lookout sighted barclay de tolley to the eastward barely visible from the masthead and vainly and for hours the pyrenees tried to beat up to it ever like a mirage the cocoanut trees hovered on the horizon visible only from the masthead from the deck they were hidden by the bulge of the world  again captain davenport consulted mccoy and the chart makemo lay seventyfive miles to the southwest its lagoon was thirty miles long and its entrance was excellent when captain davenport gave his orders the crew refused duty they announced that they had had enough of hell fire under their feet there was the land what if the ship could not make it they could make it in the boats let her burn then their lives amounted to something to them they had served faithfully the ship now they were going to serve themselves  they sprang to the boats brushing the second and third mates out of the way and proceeded to swing the boats out and to prepare to lower away captain davenport and the first mate revolvers in hand were advancing to the break of the poop when mccoy who had climbed on top of the cabin began to speak  he spoke to the sailors and at the first sound of his dovelike cooing voice they paused to hear he extended to them his own ineffable serenity and peace his soft voice and simple thoughts flowed out to them in a magic stream soothing them against their wills long forgotten things came back to them and some remembered lullaby songs of childhood and the content and rest of the mothers arm at the end of the day there was no more trouble no more danger no more irk in all the world everything was as it should be and it was only a matter of course that they should turn their backs upon the land and put to sea once more with hell fire hot beneath their feet  mccoy spoke simply but it was not what he spoke it was his personality that spoke more eloquently than any word he could utter it was an alchemy of soul occultly subtile and profoundly deepa mysterious emanation of the spirit seductive sweetly humble and terribly imperious it was illumination in the dark crypts of their souls a compulsion of purity and gentleness vastly greater than that which resided in the shining deathspitting revolvers of the officers  the men wavered reluctantly where they stood and those who had loosed the turns made them fast again then one and then another and then all of them began to sidle awkwardly away  mccoys face was beaming with childlike pleasure as he descended from the top of the cabin there was no trouble for that matter there had been no trouble averted there never had been any trouble for there was no place for such in the blissful world in which he lived  you hypnotized em mr konig grinned at him speaking in a low voice  those boys are good was the answer their hearts are good they have had a hard time and they have worked hard and they will work hard to the end  mr konig had not time to reply his voice was ringing out orders the sailors were springing to obey and the pyrenees was paying slowly off from the wind until her bow should point in the direction of makemo  the wind was very light and after sundown almost ceased it was insufferably warm and fore and aft men sought vainly to sleep the deck was too hot to lie upon and poisonous vapors oozing through the seams crept like evil spirits over the ship stealing into the nostrils and windpipes of the unwary and causing fits of sneezing and coughing the stars blinked lazily in the dim vault overhead and the full moon rising in the east touched with its light the myriads of wisps and threads and spidery films of smoke that intertwined and writhed and twisted along the deck over the rails and up the masts and shrouds  tell me captain davenport said rubbing his smarting eyes what happened with that bounty crowd after they reached pitcairn the account i read said they burnt the bounty and that they were not discovered until many years later but what happened in the meantime ive always been curious to know they were men with their necks in the rope there were some native men too and then there were women that made it look like trouble right from the jump  there was trouble mccoy answered they were bad men they quarreled about the women right away one of the mutineers williams lost his wife all the women were tahitian women his wife fell from the cliffs when hunting sea birds then he took the wife of one of the native men away from him all the native men were made very angry by this and they killed off nearly all the mutineers then the mutineers that escaped killed off all the native men the women helped and the natives killed each other everybody killed everybody they were terrible men  timiti was killed by two other natives while they were combing his hair in friendship the white men had sent them to do it then the white men killed them the wife of tullaloo killed him in a cave because she wanted a white man for husband they were very wicked god had hidden his face from them at the end of two years all the native men were murdered and all the white men except four they were young john adams mccoy who was my greatgrandfather and quintal he was a very bad man too once just because his wife did not catch enough fish for him he bit off her ear  they were a bad lot mr konig exclaimed  yes they were very bad mccoy agreed and went on serenely cooing of the blood and lust of his iniquitous ancestry my greatgrandfather escaped murder in order to die by his own hand he made a still and manufactured alcohol from the roots of the tiplant quintal was his chum and they got drunk together all the time at last mccoy got delirium tremens tied a rock to his neck and jumped into the sea  quintals wife the one whose ear he bit off also got killed by falling from the cliffs then quintal went to young and demanded his wife and went to adams and demanded his wife adams and young were afraid of quintal they knew he would kill them so they killed him the two of them together with a hatchet then young died and that was about all the trouble they had  i should say so captain davenport snorted there was nobody left to kill  you see god had hidden his face mccoy said  by morning no more than a faint air was blowing from the eastward and unable to make appreciable southing by it captain davenport hauled up fullandby on the port track he was afraid of that terrible westerly current which had cheated him out of so many ports of refuge all day the calm continued and all night while the sailors on a short ration of dried banana were grumbling also they were growing weak and complaining of stomach pains caused by the straight banana diet all day the current swept the pyrenees to the westward while there was no wind to bear her south in the middle of the first dogwatch cocoanut trees were sighted due south their tufted heads rising above the water and marking the lowlying atoll beneath  that is taenga island mccoy said we need a breeze tonight or else well miss makemo  whats become of the southeast trade the captain demanded why dont it blow whats the matter  it is the evaporation from the big lagoonsthere are so many of them mccoy explained the evaporation upsets the whole system of trades it even causes the wind to back up and blow gales from the southwest this is the dangerous archipelago captain  captain davenport faced the old man opened his mouth and was about to curse but paused and refrained mccoys presence was a rebuke to the blasphemies that stirred in his brain and trembled in his larynx mccoys influence had been growing during the many days they had been together captain davenport was an autocrat of the sea fearing no man never bridling his tongue and now he found himself unable to curse in the presence of this old man with the feminine brown eyes and the voice of a dove when he realized this captain davenport experienced a distinct shock this old man was merely the seed of mccoy of mccoy of the bounty the mutineer fleeing from the hemp that waited him in england the mccoy who was a power for evil in the early days of blood and lust and violent death on pitcairn island  captain davenport was not religious yet in that moment he felt a mad impulse to cast himself at the others feetand to say he knew not what it was an emotion that so deeply stirred him rather than a coherent thought and he was aware in some vague way of his own unworthiness and smallness in the presence of this other man who possessed the simplicity of a child and the gentleness of a woman  of course he could not so humble himself before the eyes of his officers and men and yet the anger that had prompted the blasphemy still raged in him he suddenly smote the cabin with his clenched hand and cried  look here old man i wont be beaten these paumotus have cheated and tricked me and made a fool of me i refuse to be beaten i am going to drive this ship and drive and drive and drive clear through the paumotus to china but what i find a bed for her if every man deserts ill stay by her ill show the paumotus they cant fool me shes a good girl and ill stick by her as long as theres a plank to stand on you hear me  and ill stay with you captain mccoy said  during the night light baffling airs blew out of the south and the frantic captain with his cargo of fire watched and measured his westward drift and went off by himself at times to curse softly so that mccoy should not hear  daylight showed more palms growing out of the water to the south  thats the leeward point of makemo mccoy said katiu is only a few miles to the west we may make that  but the current sucking between the two islands swept them to the northwest and at one in the afternoon they saw the palms of katiu rise above the sea and sink back into the sea again  a few minutes later just as the captain had discovered that a new current from the northeast had gripped the pyrenees the masthead lookouts raised cocoanut palms in the northwest  it is raraka said mccoy we wont make it without wind the current is drawing us down to the southwest but we must watch out a few miles farther on a current flows north and turns in a circle to the northwest this will sweep us away from fakarava and fakarava is the place for the pyrenees to find her bed  they can sweep all they daall they well please captain davenport remarked with heat well find a bed for her somewhere just the same  but the situation on the pyrenees was reaching a culmination the deck was so hot that it seemed an increase of a few degrees would cause it to burst into flames in many places even the heavysoled shoes of the men were no protection and they were compelled to step lively to avoid scorching their feet the smoke had increased and grown more acrid every man on board was suffering from inflamed eyes and they coughed and strangled like a crew of tuberculosis patients in the afternoon the boats were swung out and equipped the last several packages of dried bananas were stored in them as well as the instruments of the officers captain davenport even put the chronometer into the longboat fearing the blowing up of the deck at any moment  all night this apprehension weighed heavily on all and in the first morning light with hollow eyes and ghastly faces they stared at one another as if in surprise that the pyrenees still held together and that they still were alive  walking rapidly at times and even occasionally breaking into an undignified hopskipandrun captain davenport inspected his ships deck  it is a matter of hours now if not of minutes he announced on his return to the poop  the cry of land came down from the masthead from the deck the land was invisible and mccoy went aloft while the captain took advantage of the opportunity to curse some of the bitterness out of his heart but the cursing was suddenly stopped by a dark line on the water which he sighted to the northeast it was not a squall but a regular breezethe disrupted trade wind eight points out of its direction but resuming business once more  hold her up captain mccoy said as soon as he reached the poop thats the easterly point of fakarava and well go in through the passage fulltilt the wind abeam and every sail drawing  at the end of an hour the cocoanut trees and the lowlying land were visible from the deck the feeling that the end of the pyrenees resistance was imminent weighed heavily on everybody captain davenport had the three boats lowered and dropped short astern a man in each to keep them apart the pyrenees closely skirted the shore the surfwhitened atoll a bare two cable lengths away  and a minute later the land parted exposing a narrow passage and the lagoon beyond a great mirror thirty miles in length and a third as broad  now captain  for the last time the yards of the pyrenees swung around as she obeyed the wheel and headed into the passage the turns had scarcely been made and nothing had been coiled down when the men and mates swept back to the poop in panic terror nothing had happened yet they averred that something was going to happen they could not tell why they merely knew that it was about to happen mccoy started forward to take up his position on the bow in order to con the vessel in but the captain gripped his arm and whirled him around  do it from here he said that decks not safe whats the matter he demanded the next instant were standing still  mccoy smiled  you are bucking a sevenknot current captain he said that is the way the full ebb runs out of this passage  at the end of another hour the pyrenees had scarcely gained her length but the wind freshened and she began to forge ahead  better get into the boats some of you captain davenport commanded  his voice was still ringing and the men were just beginning to move in obedience when the amidship deck of the pyrenees in a mass of flame and smoke was flung upward into the sails and rigging part of it remaining there and the rest falling into the sea the wind being abeam was what had saved the men crowded aft they made a blind rush to gain the boats but mccoys voice carrying its convincing message of vast calm and endless time stopped them  take it easy he was saying everything is all right pass that boy down somebody please  the man at the wheel had forsaken it in a funk and captain davenport had leaped and caught the spokes in time to prevent the ship from yawing in the current and going ashore  better take charge of the boats he said to mr konig tow one of them short right under the quarter when i go over itll be on the jump  mr konig hesitated then went over the rail and lowered himself into the boat  keep her off half a point captain  captain davenport gave a start he had thought he had the ship to himself  ay ay half a point it is he answered  amidships the pyrenees was an open flaming furnace out of which poured an immense volume of smoke which rose high above the masts and completely hid the forward part of the ship mccoy in the shelter of the mizzenshrouds continued his difficult task of conning the ship through the intricate channel the fire was working aft along the deck from the seat of explosion while the soaring tower of canvas on the mainmast went up and vanished in a sheet of flame forward though they could not see them they knew that the headsails were still drawing  if only she dont burn all her canvas off before she makes inside the captain groaned  shell make it mccoy assured him with supreme confidence there is plenty of time she is bound to make it and once inside well put her before it that will keep the smoke away from us and hold back the fire from working aft  a tongue of flame sprang up the mizzen reached hungrily for the lowest tier of canvas missed it and vanished from aloft a burning shred of rope stuff fell square on the back of captain davenports neck he acted with the celerity of one stung by a bee as he reached up and brushed the offending fire from his skin  how is she heading captain  norwest by west  keep her westnorwest  captain davenport put the wheel up and steadied her  west by north captain  west by north she is  and now west  slowly point by point as she entered the lagoon the pyrenees described the circle that put her before the wind and point by point with all the calm certitude of a thousand years of time to spare mccoy chanted the changing course  another point captain  a point it is  captain davenport whirled several spokes over suddenly reversing and coming back one to check her  steady  steady she isright on it  despite the fact that the wind was now astern the heat was so intense that captain davenport was compelled to steal sidelong glances into the binnacle letting go the wheel now with one hand now with the other to rub or shield his blistering cheeks  mccoys beard was crinkling and shriveling and the smell of it strong in the others nostrils compelled him to look toward mccoy with sudden solicitude captain davenport was letting go the spokes alternately with his hands in order to rub their blistering backs against his trousers every sail on the mizzenmast vanished in a rush of flame compelling the two men to crouch and shield their faces  now said mccoy stealing a glance ahead at the low shore four points up captain and let her drive  shreds and patches of burning rope and canvas were falling about them and upon them the tarry smoke from a smouldering piece of rope at the captains feet set him off into a violent coughing fit during which he still clung to the spokes  the pyrenees struck her bow lifted and she ground ahead gently to a stop a shower of burning fragments dislodged by the shock fell about them the ship moved ahead again and struck a second time she crushed the fragile coral under her keel drove on and struck a third time  hard over said mccoy hard over he questioned gently a minute later  she wont answer was the reply  all right she is swinging around mccoy peered over the side soft white sand couldnt ask better a beautiful bed  as the pyrenees swung around her stern away from the wind a fearful blast of smoke and flame poured aft captain davenport deserted the wheel in blistering agony he reached the painter of the boat that lay under the quarter then looked for mccoy who was standing aside to let him go down  you first the captain cried gripping him by the shoulder and almost throwing him over the rail but the flame and smoke were too terrible and he followed hard after mccoy both men wriggling on the rope and sliding down into the boat together a sailor in the bow without waiting for orders slashed the painter through with his sheath knife the oars poised in readiness bit into the water and the boat shot away  a beautiful bed captain mccoy murmured looking back  ay a beautiful bed and all thanks to you was the answer  the three boats pulled away for the white beach of pounded coral beyond which on the edge of a cocoanut grove could be seen a half dozen grass houses and a score or more of excited natives gazing wideeyed at the conflagration that had come to land  the boats grounded and they stepped out on the white beach  and now said mccoy i must see about getting back to pitcairn
