30857164	criticism and fiction  by william dean howells    the question of a final criterion for the appreciation of art is one that perpetually recurs to those interested in any sort of aesthetic endeavor mr john addington symonds in a chapter of the renaissance in italy treating of the bolognese school of painting which once had so great cry and was vaunted the supreme exemplar of the grand style but which he now believes fallen into lasting contempt for its emptiness and soullessness seeks to determine whether there can be an enduring criterion or not and his conclusion is applicable to literature as to the other arts our hope he says with regard to the unity of taste in the future then is that all sentimental or academical seekings after the ideal having been abandoned momentary theories founded upon idiosyncratic or temporary partialities exploded and nothing accepted but what is solid and positive the scientific spirit shall make men progressively more and more conscious of these bleibende verhaltnisse more and more capable of living in the whole also that in proportion as we gain a firmer hold upon our own place in the world we shall come to comprehend with more instinctive certitude what is simple natural and honest welcoming with gladness all artistic products that exhibit these qualities the perception of the enlightened man will then be the task of a healthy person who has made himself acquainted with the laws of evolution in art and in society and is able to test the excellence of work in any stage from immaturity to decadence by discerning what there is of truth sincerity and natural vigor in it     i  that is to say as i understand that moods and tastes and fashions change people fancy now this and now that but what is unpretentious and what is true is always beautiful and good and nothing else is so this is not saying that fantastic and monstrous and artificial things do not please everybody knows that they do please immensely for a time and then after the lapse of a much longer time they have the charm of the rococo nothing is more curious than the charm that fashion has fashion in womens dress almost every fashion is somehow delightful else it would never have been the fashion but if any one will look through a collection of old fashion plates he must own that most fashions have been ugly a few which could be readily instanced have been very pretty and even beautiful but it is doubtful if these have pleased the greatest number of people the ugly delights as well as the beautiful and not merely because the ugly in fashion is associated with the young loveliness of the women who wear the ugly fashions and wins a grace from them not because the vast majority of mankind are tasteless but for some cause that is not perhaps ascertainable it is quite as likely to return in the fashions of our clothes and houses and furniture and poetry and fiction and painting as the beautiful and it may be from an instinctive or a reasoned sense of this that some of the extreme naturalists have refused to make the old discrimination against it or to regard the ugly as any less worthy of celebration in art than the beautiful some of them in fact seem to regard it as rather more worthy if anything possibly there is no absolutely ugly no absolutely beautiful or possibly the ugly contains always an element of the beautiful better adapted to the general appreciation than the more perfectly beautiful this is a somewhat discouraging conjecture but i offer it for no more than it is worth and i do not pin my faith to the saying of one whom i heard denying the other day that a thing of beauty was a joy forever he contended that keatss line should have read some things of beauty are sometimes joys forever and that any assertion beyond this was too hazardous     ii  i should indeed prefer another line of keatss if i were to profess any formulated creed and should feel much safer with his beauty is truth truth beauty than even with my friends reformation of the more quoted verse it brings us back to the solid ground taken by mr symonds which is not essentially different from that taken in the great mr burkes essay on the sublime and the beautifula singularly modern book considering how long ago it was wrote as the great mr steele would have written the participle a little longer ago and full of a certain wellmannered and agreeable instruction in some things it is of that droll little eighteenthcentury world when philosophy had got the neat little universe into the hollow of its hand and knew just what it was and what it was for but it is quite without arrogance as for those called critics the author says they have generally sought the rule of the arts in the wrong place they have sought among poems pictures engravings statues and buildings but art can never give the rules that make an art this is i believe the reason why artists in general and poets principally have been confined in so narrow a circle they have been rather imitators of one another than of nature critics follow them and therefore can do little as guides i can judge but poorly of anything while i measure it by no other standard than itself the true standard of the arts is in every mans power and an easy observation of the most common sometimes of the meanest things in nature will give the truest lights where the greatest sagacity and industry that slights such observation must leave us in the dark or what is worse amuse and mislead us by false lights  if this should happen to be true and it certainly commends itself to acceptanceit might portend an immediate danger to the vested interests of criticism only that it was written a hundred years ago and we shall probably have the sagacity and industry that slights the observation of nature long enough yet to allow most critics the time to learn some more useful trade than criticism as they pursue it nevertheless i am in hopes that the communistic era in taste foreshadowed by burke is approaching and that it will occur within the lives of men now overawed by the foolish old superstition that literature and art are anything but the expression of life and are to be judged by any other test than that of their fidelity to it the time is coming i hope when each new author each new artist will be considered not in his proportion to any other author or artist but in his relation to the human nature known to us all which it is his privilege his high duty to interpret the true standard of the artist is in every mans power already as burke says michelangelos light of the piazza the glance of the common eye is and always was the best light on a statue goethes boys and blackbirds have in all ages been the real connoisseurs of berries but hitherto the mass of common men have been afraid to apply their own simplicity naturalness and honesty to the appreciation of the beautiful they have always cast about for the instruction of some one who professed to know better and who browbeat wholesome commonsense into the selfdistrust that ends in sophistication they have fallen generally to the worst of this bad species and have been amused and misled how pretty that quaint old use of amuse is by the false lights of critical vanity and selfrighteousness they have been taught to compare what they see and what they read not with the things that they have observed and known but with the things that some other artist or writer has done especially if they have themselves the artistic impulse in any direction they are taught to form themselves not upon life but upon the masters who became masters only by forming themselves upon life the seeds of death are planted in them and they can produce only the stillborn the academic they are not told to take their work into the public square and see if it seems true to the chance passer but to test it by the work of the very men who refused and decried any other test of their own work the young writer who attempts to report the phrase and carriage of everyday life who tries to tell just how he has heard men talk and seen them look is made to feel guilty of something low and unworthy by people who would like to have him show how shakespeares men talked and looked or scotts or thackerays or balzacs or hawthornes or dickenss he is instructed to idealize his personages that is to take the lifelikeness out of them and put the booklikeness into them he is approached in the spirit of the pedantry into which learning much or little always decays when it withdraws itself and stands apart from experience in an attitude of imagined superiority and which would say with the same confidence to the scientist i see that you are looking at a grasshopper there which you have found in the grass and i suppose you intend to describe it now dont waste your time and sin against culture in that way ive got a grasshopper here which has been evolved at considerable pains and expense out of the grasshopper in general in fact its a type its made up of wire and cardboard very prettily painted in a conventional tint and its perfectly indestructible it isnt very much like a real grasshopper but its a great deal nicer and its served to represent the notion of a grasshopper ever since man emerged from barbarism you may say that its artificial well it is artificial but then its ideal too and what you want to do is to cultivate the ideal youll find the books full of my kind of grasshopper and scarcely a trace of yours in any of them the thing that you are proposing to do is commonplace but if you say that it isnt commonplace for the very reason that it hasnt been done before youll have to admit that its photographic  as i said i hope the time is coming when not only the artist but the common average man who always has the standard of the arts in his power will have also the courage to apply it and will reject the ideal grasshopper wherever he finds it in science in literature in art because it is not simple natural and honest because it is not like a real grasshopper but i will own that i think the time is yet far off and that the people who have been brought up on the ideal grasshopper the heroic grasshopper the impassioned grasshopper the selfdevoted adventureful good old romantic cardboard grasshopper must die out before the simple honest and natural grasshopper can have a fair field i am in no haste to compass the end of these good people whom i find in the mean time very amusing it is delightful to meet one of them either in print or out of itsome sweet elderly lady or excellent gentleman whose youth was pastured on the literature of thirty or forty years ago and to witness the confidence with which they preach their favorite authors as all the law and the prophets they have commonly read little or nothing since or if they have they have judged it by a standard taken from these authors and never dreamed of judging it by nature they are destitute of the documents in the case of the later writers they suppose that balzac was the beginning of realism and that zola is its wicked end they are quite ignorant but they are ready to talk you down if you differ from them with an assumption of knowledge sufficient for any occasion the horror the resentment with which they receive any question of their literary saints is genuine you descend at once very far in the moral and social scale and anything short of offensive personality is too good for you it is expressed to you that you are one to be avoided and put down even a little lower than you have naturally fallen  these worthy persons are not to blame it is part of their intellectual mission to represent the petrifaction of taste and to preserve an image of a smaller and cruder and emptier world than we now live in a world which was feeling its way towards the simple the natural the honest but was a good deal amused and misled by lights now no longer mistakable for heavenly luminaries they belong to a time just passing away when certain authors were considered authorities in certain kinds when they must be accepted entire and not questioned in any particular now we are beginning to see and to say that no author is an authority except in those moments when he held his ear close to natures lips and caught her very accent these moments are not continuous with any authors in the past and they are rare with all therefore i am not afraid to say now that the greatest classics are sometimes not at all great and that we can profit by them only when we hold them like our meanest contemporaries to a strict accounting and verify their work by the standard of the arts which we all have in our power the simple the natural and the honest  those good people must always have a hero an idol of some sort and it is droll to find balzac who suffered from their sort such bitter scorn and hate for his realism while he was alive now become a fetich in his turn to be shaken in the faces of those who will not blindly worship him but it is no new thing in the history of literature whatever is established is sacred with those who do not think at the beginning of the century when romance was making the same fight against effete classicism which realism is making today against effete romanticism the italian poet monti declared that the romantic was the cold grave of the beautiful just as the realistic is now supposed to be the romantic of that day and the real of this are in certain degree the same romanticism then sought as realism seeks now to widen the bounds of sympathy to level every barrier against aesthetic freedom to escape from the paralysis of tradition it exhausted itself in this impulse and it remained for realism to assert that fidelity to experience and probability of motive are essential conditions of a great imaginative literature it is not a new theory but it has never before universally characterized literary endeavor when realism becomes false to itself when it heaps up facts merely and maps life instead of picturing it realism will perish too every true realist instinctively knows this and it is perhaps the reason why he is careful of every fact and feels himself bound to express or to indicate its meaning at the risk of overmoralizing in life he finds nothing insignificant all tells for destiny and character nothing that god has made is contemptible he cannot look upon human life and declare this thing or that thing unworthy of notice any more than the scientist can declare a fact of the material world beneath the dignity of his inquiry he feels in every nerve the equality of things and the unity of men his soul is exalted not by vain shows and shadows and ideals but by realities in which alone the truth lives in criticism it is his business to break the images of false gods and misshapen heroes to take away the poor silly toys that many grown people would still like to play with he cannot keep terms with jack the giantkiller or pussinboots under any name or in any place even when they reappear as the convict vautrec or the marquis de montrivaut or the sworn thirteen noblemen he must say to himself that balzac when he imagined these monsters was not balzac he was dumas he was not realistic he was romanticistic     iii  such a critic will not respect balzacs good work the less for contemning his bad work he will easily account for the bad work historically and when he has recognized it will trouble himself no further with it in his view no living man is a type but a character now noble now ignoble now grand now little complex full of vicissitude he will not expect balzac to be always balzac and will be perhaps even more attracted to the study of him when he was trying to be balzac than when he had become so in cesar birotteau for instance he will be interested to note how balzac stood at the beginning of the great things that have followed since in fiction there is an interesting likeness between his work in this and nicolas gogols in dead souls which serves to illustrate the simultaneity of the literary movement in men of such widely separated civilizations and conditions both represent their characters with the touch of exaggeration which typifies but in bringing his story to a close balzac employs a beneficence unknown to the russian and almost as universal and as apt as that which smiles upon the fortunes of the good in the vicar of wakefield it is not enough to have rehabilitated birotteau pecuniarily and socially he must make him die triumphantly spectacularly of an opportune hemorrhage in the midst of the festivities which celebrate his restoration to his old home before this happens human nature has been laid under contribution right and left for acts of generosity towards the righteous bankrupt even the king sends him six thousand francs it is very pretty it is touching and brings the lump into the readers throat but it is too much and one perceives that balzac lived too soon to profit by balzac the later men especially the russians have known how to forbear the excesses of analysis to withhold the weakly recurring descriptive and caressing epithets to let the characters suffice for themselves all this does not mean that cesar birotteau is not a beautiful and pathetic story full of shrewdly considered knowledge of men and of a good art struggling to free itself from selfconsciousness but it does mean that balzac when he wrote it was under the burden of the very traditions which he has helped fiction to throw off he felt obliged to construct a mechanical plot to surcharge his characters to moralize openly and baldly he permitted himself to sympathize with certain of his people and to point out others for the abhorrence of his readers this is not so bad in him as it would be in a novelist of our day it is simply primitive and inevitable and he is not to be judged by it     iv  in the beginning of any art even the most gifted worker must be crude in his methods and we ought to keep this fact always in mind when we turn say from the purblind worshippers of scott to scott himself and recognize that he often wrote a style cumbrous and diffuse that he was tediously analytical where the modern novelist is dramatic and evolved his characters by means of longwinded explanation and commentary that except in the case of his lowerclass personages he made them talk as seldom man and never woman talked that he was tiresomely descriptive that on the simplest occasions he went about half a mile to express a thought that could be uttered in ten paces across lots and that he trusted his readers intuitions so little that he was apt to rub in his appeals to them he was probably right the generation which he wrote for was duller than this slowerwitted aesthetically untrained and in maturity not so apprehensive of an artistic intention as the children of today all this is not saying scott was not a great man he was a great man and a very great novelist as compared with the novelists who went before him he can still amuse young people but they ought to be instructed how false and how mistaken he often is with his mediaeval ideals his blind jacobitism his intense devotion to aristocracy and royalty his acquiescence in the division of men into noble and ignoble patrician and plebeian sovereign and subject as if it were the law of god for all which indeed he is not to blame as he would be if he were one of our contemporaries something of this is true of another master greater than scott in being less romantic and inferior in being more german namely the great goethe himself he taught us in novels otherwise now antiquated and always full of german clumsiness that it was false to good artwhich is never anything but the reflection of lifeto pursue and round the career of the persons introduced whom he often allowed to appear and disappear in our knowledge as people in the actual world do this is a lesson which the writers able to profit by it can never be too grateful for and it is equally a benefaction to readers but there is very little else in the conduct of the goethean novels which is in advance of their time this remains almost their sole contribution to the science of fiction they are very primitive in certain characteristics and unite with their calm deep insight an amusing helplessness in dramatization wilhelm retired to his room and indulged in the following reflections is a mode of analysis which would not be practised nowadays and all that fancifulness of nomenclature in wilhelm meister is very drolly sentimental and feeble the adventures with robbers seem as if dreamed out of books of chivalry and the tendency to allegorization affects one like an endeavor on the authors part to escape from the unrealities which he must have felt harassingly german as he was mixed up with the shadows and illusions are honest wholesome everyday people who have the air of wandering homelessly about among them without definite direction and the mists are full of a luminosity which in spite of them we know for commonsense and poetry what is useful in any review of goethes methods is the recognition of the fact which it must bring that the greatest master cannot produce a masterpiece in a new kind the novel was too recently invented in goethes day not to be even in his hands full of the faults of apprentice work     v  in fact a great master may sin against the modesty of nature in many ways and i have felt this painfully in reading balzacs romanceit is not worthy the name of novelle pere goriot which is full of a malarial restlessness wholly alien to healthful art after that exquisitely careful and truthful setting of his story in the shabby boardinghouse he fills the scene with figures jerked about by the exaggerated passions and motives of the stage we cannot have a cynic reasonably wicked disagreeable egoistic we must have a lurid villain of melodrama a disguised convict with a vast criminal organization at his command and          so dyed double red  in deed and purpose that he lights up the faces of the horrified spectators with his glare a father fond of unworthy children and leading a life of selfdenial for their sake as may probably and pathetically be is not enough there must be an imbecile trembling dotard willing to promote even the liaisons of his daughters to give them happiness and to teach the sublimity of the paternal instinct the hero cannot sufficiently be a selfish young fellow with alternating impulses of greed and generosity he must superfluously intend a career of iniquitous splendor and be swerved from it by nothing but the most cataclysmal interpositions it can be said that without such personages the plot could not be transacted but so much the worse for the plot such a plot had no business to be and while actions so unnatural are imagined no mastery can save fiction from contempt with those who really think about it to balzac it can be forgiven not only because in his better mood he gave us such biographies as eugenie grandet but because he wrote at a time when fiction was just beginning to verify the externals of life to portray faithfully the outside of men and things it was still held that in order to interest the reader the characters must be moved by the old romantic ideals we were to be taught that heroes and heroines existed all around us and that these abnormal beings needed only to be discovered in their several humble disguises and then we should see everyday people actuated by the fine frenzy of the creatures of the poets how false that notion was few but the critics who are apt to be rather belated need now be told some of these poor fellows however still contend that it ought to be done and that human feelings and motives as god made them and as men know them are not good enough for novelreaders  this is more explicable than would appear at first glance the critics and in speaking of them one always modestly leaves ones self out of the count for some reasonwhen they are not elders ossified in tradition are apt to be young people and young people are necessarily conservative in their tastes and theories they have the tastes and theories of their instructors who perhaps caught the truth of their day but whose routine life has been alien to any other truth there is probably no chair of literature in this country from which the principles now shaping the literary expression of every civilized people are not denounced and confounded with certain objectionable french novels or which teaches young men anything of the universal impulse which has given us the work not only of zola but of tourguenief and tolstoy in russia of bjornson and ibsen in norway of valdes and galdos in spain of verga in italy till these younger critics have learned to think as well as to write for themselves they will persist in heaving a sigh more and more perfunctory for the truth as it was in sir walter and as it was in dickens and in hawthorne presently all will have been changed they will have seen the new truth in larger and larger degree and when it shall have become the old truth they will perhaps see it all     vi  in the mean time the average of criticism is not wholly bad with us to be sure the critic sometimes appears in the panoply of the savages whom we have supplanted on this continent and it is hard to believe that his use of the tomahawk and the scalpingknife is a form of conservative surgery it is still his conception of his office that he should assail those who differ with him in matters of taste or opinion that he must be rude with those he does not like it is too largely his superstition that because he likes a thing it is good and because he dislikes a thing it is bad the reverse is quite possibly the case but he is yet indefinitely far from knowing that in affairs of taste his personal preference enters very little commonly he has no principles but only an assortment of prepossessions for and against and this otherwise very perfect character is sometimes uncandid to the verge of dishonesty he seems not to mind misstating the position of any one he supposes himself to disagree with and then attacking him for what he never said or even implied he thinks this is droll and appears not to suspect that it is immoral he is not tolerant he thinks it a virtue to be intolerant it is hard for him to understand that the same thing may be admirable at one time and deplorable at another and that it is really his business to classify and analyze the fruits of the human mind very much as the naturalist classifies the objects of his study rather than to praise or blame them that there is a measure of the same absurdity in his trampling on a poem a novel or an essay that does not please him as in the botanists grinding a plant underfoot because he does not find it pretty he does not conceive that it is his business rather to identify the species and then explain how and where the specimen is imperfect and irregular if he could once acquire this simple idea of his duty he would be much more agreeable company than he now is and a more useful member of society though considering the hard conditions under which he works his necessity of writing hurriedly from an imperfect examination of far more books on a greater variety of subjects than he can even hope to read the average american criticthe ordinary critic of commerce so to speakis even now very well indeed collectively he is more than this for the joint effect of our criticism is the pretty thorough appreciation of any book submitted to it     vii  the misfortune rather than the fault of our individual critic is that he is the heir of the false theory and bad manners of the english school the theory of that school has apparently been that almost any person of glib and lively expression is competent to write of almost any branch of polite literature its manners are what we know the american whom it has largely formed is by nature very glib and very lively and commonly his criticism viewed as imaginative work is more agreeable than that of the englishman but it is like the art of both countries apt to be amateurish in some degree our authors have freed themselves from english models they have gained some notion of the more serious work of the continent but it is still the ambition of the american critic to write like the english critic to show his wit if not his learning to strive to eclipse the author under review rather than illustrate him he has not yet caught on to the fact that it is really no part of his business to display himself but that it is altogether his duty to place a book in such a light that the reader shall know its class its function its character the vast goodnature of our people preserves us from the worst effects of this criticism without principles our critic at his lowest is rarely malignant and when he is rude or untruthful it is mostly without truculence i suspect that he is often offensive without knowing that he is so now and then he acts simply under instruction from higher authority and denounces because it is the tradition of his publication to do so in other cases the critic is obliged to support his journals repute for severity or for wit or for morality though he may himself be entirely amiable dull and wicked this necessity more or less warps his verdicts  the worst is that he is personal perhaps because it is so easy and so natural to be personal and so instantly attractive in this respect our criticism has not improved from the accession of numbers of ladies to its ranks though we still hope so much from women in our politics when they shall come to vote they have come to write and with the effect to increase the amount of littledigging which rather superabounded in our literary criticism before they know what they likethat pernicious maxim of those who do not know what they ought to like and they pass readily from censuring an authors performance to censuring him they bring a stock of lively misapprehensions and prejudices to their work they would rather have heard about than known about a book and they take kindly to the public wish to be amused rather than edified but neither have they so much harm in them they too are more ignorant than malevolent     viii  our criticism is disabled by the unwillingness of the critic to learn from an author and his readiness to mistrust him a writer passes his whole life in fitting himself for a certain kind of performance the critic does not ask why or whether the performance is good or bad but if he does not like the kind he instructs the writer to go off and do some other sort of thingusually the sort that has been done already and done sufficiently if he could once understand that a man who has written the book he dislikes probably knows infinitely more about its kind and his own fitness for doing it than any one else the critic might learn something and might help the reader to learn but by putting himself in a false position a position of superiority he is of no use he is not to suppose that an author has committed an offence against him by writing the kind of book he does not like he will be far more profitably employed on behalf of the reader in finding out whether they had better not both like it let him conceive of an author as not in any wise on trial before him but as a reflection of this or that aspect of life and he will not be tempted to browbeat him or bully him  the critic need not be impolite even to the youngest and weakest author a little courtesy or a good deal a constant perception of the fact that a book is not a misdemeanor a decent selfrespect that must forbid the civilized man the savage pleasure of wounding are what i would ask for our criticism as something which will add sensibly to its present lustre     ix  i would have my fellowcritics consider what they are really in the world for the critic must perceive if he will question himself more carefully that his office is mainly to ascertain facts and traits of literature not to invent or denounce them to discover principles not to establish them to report not to create  it is so much easier to say that you like this or dislike that than to tell why one thing is or where another thing comes from that many flourishing critics will have to go out of business altogether if the scientific method comes in for then the critic will have to know something besides his own mind he will have to know something of the laws of that mind and of its generic history  the history of all literature shows that even with the youngest and weakest author criticism is quite powerless against his will to do his own work in his own way and if this is the case in the green wood how much more in the dry it has been thought by the sentimentalist that criticism if it cannot cure can at least kill and keats was long alleged in proof of its efficacy in this sort but criticism neither cured nor killed keats as we all now very well know it wounded it cruelly hurt him no doubt and it is always in the power of the critic to give pain to the authorthe meanest critic to the greatest author for no one can help feeling a rudeness but every literary movement has been violently opposed at the start and yet never stayed in the least or arrested by criticism every author has been condemned for his virtues but in no wise changed by it in the beginning he reads the critics but presently perceiving that he alone makes or mars himself and that they have no instruction for him he mostly leaves off reading them though he is always glad of their kindness or grieved by their harshness when he chances upon it this i believe is the general experience modified of course by exceptions  then are we critics of no use in the world i should not like to think that though i am not quite ready to define our use more than one sober thinker is inclining at present to suspect that aesthetically or specifically we are of no use and that we are only useful historically that we may register laws but not enact them i am not quite prepared to admit that aesthetic criticism is useless though in view of its futility in any given instance it is hard to deny that it is so it certainly seems as useless against a book that strikes the popular fancy and prospers on in spite of condemnation by the best critics as it is against a book which does not generally please and which no critical favor can make acceptable this is so common a phenomenon that i wonder it has never hitherto suggested to criticism that its point of view was altogether mistaken and that it was really necessary to judge books not as dead things but as living thingsthings which have an influence and a power irrespective of beauty and wisdom and merely as expressions of actuality in thought and feeling perhaps criticism has a cumulative and final effect perhaps it does some good we do not know of it apparently does not affect the author directly but it may reach him through the reader it may in some cases enlarge or diminish his audience for a while until he has thoroughly measured and tested his own powers if criticism is to affect literature at all it must be through the writers who have newly left the startingpoint and are reasonably uncertain of the race not with those who have won it again and again in their own way     x  sometimes it has seemed to me that the crudest expression of any creative art is better than the finest comment upon it i have sometimes suspected that more thinking more feeling certainly goes to the creation of a poor novel than to the production of a brilliant criticism and if any novel of our time fails to live a hundred years will any censure of it live who can endure to read old reviews one can hardly read them if they are in praise of ones own books  the author neglected or overlooked need not despair for that reason if he will reflect that criticism can neither make nor unmake authors that there have not been greater books since criticism became an art than there were before that in fact the greatest books seem to have come much earlier  that which criticism seems most certainly to have done is to have put a literary consciousness into books unfelt in the early masterpieces but unfelt now only in the books of men whose lives have been passed in activities who have been used to employing language as they would have employed any implement to effect an object who have regarded a thing to be said as in no wise different from a thing to be done in this sort i have seen no modern book so unconscious as general grants personal memoirs the authors one end and aim is to get the facts out in words he does not cast about for phrases but takes the word whatever it is that will best give his meaning as if it were a man or a force of men for the accomplishment of a feat of arms there is not a moment wasted in preening and prettifying after the fashion of literary men there is no thought of style and so the style is good as it is in the book of chronicles as it is in the pilgrims progress with a peculiar almost plebeian plainness at times there is no more attempt at dramatic effect than there is at ceremonious pose things happen in that tale of a mighty war as they happened in the mighty war itself without setting without artificial reliefs one after another as if they were all of one quality and degree judgments are delivered with the same unimposing quiet no awe surrounds the tribunal except that which comes from the weight and justice of the opinions it is always an unaffected unpretentious man who is talking and throughout he prefers to wear the uniform of a private with nothing of the general about him but the shoulderstraps which he sometimes forgets     xi  canon fairfaxs opinions of literary criticism are very much to my liking perhaps because when i read them i found them so like my own already delivered in print he tells the critics that they are in no sense the legislators of literature barely even its judges and police and he reminds them of mr ruskins saying that a bad critic is probably the most mischievous person in the world though a sense of their relative proportion to the whole of life would perhaps acquit the worst among them of this extreme of culpability a bad critic is as bad a thing as can be but after all his mischief does not carry very far otherwise it would be mainly the conventional books and not the original books which would survive for the censor who imagines himself a lawgiver can give law only to the imitative and never to the creative mind criticism has condemned whatever was from time to time fresh and vital in literature it has always fought the new good thing in behalf of the old good thing it has invariably fostered and encouraged the tame the trite the negative yet upon the whole it is the native the novel the positive that has survived in literature whereas if bad criticism were the most mischievous thing in the world in the full implication of the words it must have been the tame the trite the negative that survived  bad criticism is mischievous enough however and i think that much if not most current criticism as practised among the english and americans is bad is falsely principled and is conditioned in evil it is falsely principled because it is unprincipled or without principles and it is conditioned in evil because it is almost wholly anonymous at the best its opinions are not conclusions from certain easily verifiable principles but are effects from the worship of certain models they are in so far quite worthless for it is the very nature of things that the original mind cannot conform to models it has its norm within itself it can work only in its own way and by its selfgiven laws criticism does not inquire whether a work is true to life but tacitly or explicitly compares it with models and tests it by them if literary art travelled by any such road as criticism would have it go it would travel in a vicious circle and would arrive only at the point of departure yet this is the course that criticism must always prescribe when it attempts to give laws being itself artificial it cannot conceive of the original except as the abnormal it must altogether reconceive its office before it can be of use to literature it must reduce this to the business of observing recording and comparing to analyzing the material before it and then synthetizing its impressions even then it is not too much to say that literature as an art could get on perfectly well without it just as many good novels poems plays essays sketches would be written if there were no such thing as criticism in the literary world and no more bad ones  but it will be long before criticism ceases to imagine itself a controlling force to give itself airs of sovereignty and to issue decrees as it exists it is mostly a mischief though not the greatest mischief but it may be greatly ameliorated in character and softened in manner by the total abolition of anonymity  i think it would be safe to say that in no other relation of life is so much brutality permitted by civilized society as in the criticism of literature and the arts canon farrar is quite right in reproaching literary criticism with the uncandor of judging an author without reference to his aims with pursuing certain writers from spite and prejudice and mere habit with misrepresenting a book by quoting a phrase or passage apart from the context with magnifying misprints and careless expressions into important faults with abusing an author for his opinions with base and personal motives  every writer of experience knows that certain critical journals will condemn his work without regard to its quality even if it has never been his fortune to learn as one author did from a repentent reviewer that in a journal pretending to literary taste his books were given out for review with the caution remember that the clarion is opposed to mr blanks books  the final conclusion appears to be that the man or even the young lady who is given a gun and told to shoot at some passer from behind a hedge is placed in circumstances of temptation almost too strong for human nature     xii  as i have already intimated i doubt the more lasting effects of unjust criticism it is no part of my belief that keatss fame was long delayed by it or wordsworths or brownings something unwonted unexpected in the quality of each delayed his recognition each was not only a poet he was a revolution a new order of things to which the critical perceptions and habitudes had painfully to adjust themselves but i have no question of the gross and stupid injustice with which these great men were used and of the barbarization of the public mind by the sight of the wrong inflicted on them with impunity this savage condition still persists in the toleration of anonymous criticism an abuse that ought to be as extinct as the torture of witnesses it is hard enough to treat a fellowauthor with respect even when one has to address him name to name upon the same level in plain day swooping down upon him in the dark panoplied in the authority of a great journal it is impossible every now and then some idealist comes forward and declares that you should say nothing in criticism of a mans book which you would not say of it to his face but i am afraid this is asking too much i am afraid it would put an end to all criticism and that if it were practised literature would be left to purify itself i have no doubt literature would do this but in such a state of things there would be no provision for the critics we ought not to destroy critics we ought to reform them or rather transform them or turn them from the assumption of authority to a realization of their true function in the civilized state they are no worse at heart probably than many others and there are probably good husbands and tender fathers loving daughters and careful mothers among them  it is evident to any student of human nature that the critic who is obliged to sign his review will be more careful of an authors feelings than he would if he could intangibly and invisibly deal with him as the representative of a great journal he will be loath to have his name connected with those perversions and misstatements of an authors meaning in which the critic now indulges without danger of being turned out of honest company he will be in some degree forced to be fair and just with a book he dislikes he will not wish to misrepresent it when his sin can be traced directly to him in person he will not be willing to voice the prejudice of a journal which is opposed to the books of this or that author and the journal itself when it is no longer responsible for the behavior of its critic may find it interesting and profitable to give to an author his innings when he feels wronged by a reviewer and desires to right himself it may even be eager to offer him the opportunity we shall then perhaps frequently witness the spectacle of authors turning upon their reviewers and improving their manners and morals by confronting them in public with the errors they may now commit with impunity many an author smarts under injuries and indignities which he might resent to the advantage of literature and civilization if he were not afraid of being browbeaten by the journal whose nameless critic has outraged him  the public is now of opinion that it involves loss of dignity to creative talent to try to right itself if wronged but here we are without the requisite statistics creative talent may come off with all the dignity it went in with and it may accomplish a very good work in demolishing criticism  in any other relation of life the man who thinks himself wronged tries to right himself violently if he is a mistaken man and lawfully if he is a wise man or a rich one which is practically the same thing but the author dramatist painter sculptor whose book play picture statue has been unfairly dealt with as he believes must make no effort to right himself with the public he must bear his wrong in silence he is even expected to grin and bear it as if it were funny every body understands that it is not funny to him not in the least funny but everybody says that he cannot make an effort to get the public to take his point of view without loss of dignity this is very odd but it is the fact and i suppose that it comes from the feeling that the author dramatist painter sculptor has already said the best he can for his side in his book play picture statue this is partly true and yet if he wishes to add something more to prove the critic wrong i do not see how his attempt to do so should involve loss of dignity the public which is so jealous for his dignity does not otherwise use him as if he were a very great and invaluable creature if he fails it lets him starve like any one else i should say that he lost dignity or not as he behaved in his effort to right himself with petulance or with principle if he betrayed a wounded vanity if he impugned the motives and accused the lives of his critics i should certainly feel that he was losing dignity but if he temperately examined their theories and tried to show where they were mistaken i think he would not only gain dignity but would perform a very useful work     xiii  i would beseech the literary critics of our country to disabuse themselves of the mischievous notion that they are essential to the progress of literature in the way critics have imagined canon farrar confesses that with the best will in the world to profit by the many criticisms of his books he has never profited in the least by any of them and this is almost the universal experience of authors it is not always the fault of the critics they sometimes deal honestly and fairly by a book and not so often they deal adequately but in making a book if it is at all a good book the author has learned all that is knowable about it and every strong point and every weak point in it far more accurately than any one else can possibly learn them he has learned to do better than well for the future but if his book is bad he cannot be taught anything about it from the outside it will perish and if he has not the root of literature in him he will perish as an author with it but what is it that gives tendency in art then what is it makes people like this at one time and that at another above all what makes a better fashion change for a worse how can the ugly come to be preferred to the beautiful in other words how can an art decay  this question came up in my mind lately with regard to english fiction and its form or rather its formlessness how for instance could people who had once known the simple verity the refined perfection of miss austere enjoy anything less refined and less perfect  with her example before them why should not english novelists have gone on writing simply honestly artistically ever after one would think it must have been impossible for them to do otherwise if one did not remember say the lamentable behavior of the actors who support mr jefferson and their theatricality in the very presence of his beautiful naturalness it is very difficult that simplicity and nothing is so hard as to be honest as the reader if he has ever happened to try it must know the big bowwow i can do myself like anyone going said scott but he owned that the exquisite touch of miss austere was denied him and it seems certainly to have been denied in greater or less measure to all her successors but though reading and writing come by nature as dogberry justly said a taste in them may be cultivated or once cultivated it may be preserved and why was it not so among those poor islanders one does not ask such things in order to be at the pains of answering them ones self but with the hope that some one else will take the trouble to do so and i propose to be rather a silent partner in the enterprise which i shall leave mainly to senor armando palacio valdes this delightful author will however only be able to answer my question indirectly from the essay on fiction with which he prefaces one of his novels the charming story of the sister of san sulpizio and i shall have some little labor in fitting his saws to my instances it is an essay which i wish every one intending to read or even to write a novel might acquaint himself with for it contains some of the best and clearest things which have been said of the art of fiction in a time when nearly all who practise it have turned to talk about it  senor valdes is a realist but a realist according to his own conception of realism and he has some words of just censure for the french naturalists whom he finds unnecessarily and suspects of being sometimes even mercenarily nasty he sees the wide difference that passes between this naturalism and the realism of the english and spanish and he goes somewhat further than i should go in condemning it the french naturalism represents only a moment and an insignificant part of life    it is characterized by sadness and narrowness the prototype of this literature is the madame bovary of flaubert i am an admirer of this novelist and especially of this novel but often in thinking of it i have said how dreary would literature be if it were no more than this there is something antipathetic and gloomy and limited in it as there is in modern french life but this seems to me exactly the best possible reason for its being i believe with senor valdes that no literature can live long without joy not because of its mistaken aesthetics however but because no civilization can live long without joy the expression of french life will change when french life changes and french naturalism is better at its worst than french unnaturalism at its best no one as senor valdes truly says can rise from the perusal of a naturalistic book    without a vivid desire to escape from the wretched world depicted in it and a purpose more or less vague of helping to better the lot and morally elevate the abject beings who figure in it naturalistic art then is not immoral in itself for then it would not merit the name of art for though it is not the business of art to preach morality still i think that resting on a divine and spiritual principle like the idea of the beautiful it is perforce moral i hold much more immoral other books which under a glamour of something spiritual and beautiful and sublime portray the vices in which we are allied to the beasts such for example are the works of octave feuillet arsene houssaye georges ohnet and other contemporary novelists much in vogue among the higher classes of society  but what is this idea of the beautiful which art rests upon and so becomes moral the man of our time says senor valdes wishes to know everything and enjoy everything he turns the objective of a powerful equatorial towards the heavenly spaces where gravitates the infinitude of the stars just as he applies the microscope to the infinitude of the smallest insects for their laws are identical his experience united with intuition has convinced him that in nature there is neither great nor small all is equal all is equally grand all is equally just all is equally beautiful because all is equally divine but beauty senor valdes explains exists in the human spirit and is the beautiful effect which it receives from the true meaning of things it does not matter what the things are and it is the function of the artist who feels this effect to impart it to others i may add that there is no joy in art except this perception of the meaning of things and its communication when you have felt it and portrayed it in a poem a symphony a novel a statue a picture an edifice you have fulfilled the purpose for which you were born an artist  the reflection of exterior nature in the individual spirit senor valdes believes to be the fundamental of art to say then that the artist must not copy but create is nonsense because he can in no wise copy and in no wise create he who sets deliberately about modifying nature shows that he has not felt her beauty and therefore cannot make others feel it the puerile desire which some artists without genius manifest to go about selecting in nature not what seems to them beautiful but what they think will seem beautiful to others and rejecting what may displease them ordinarily produces cold and insipid works for instead of exploring the illimitable fields of reality they cling to the forms invented by other artists who have succeeded and they make statues of statues poems of poems novels of novels it is entirely false that the great romantic symbolic or classic poets modified nature such as they have expressed her they felt her and in this view they are as much realists as ourselves in like manner if in the realistic tide that now bears us on there are some spirits who feel nature in another way in the romantic way or the classic way they would not falsify her in expressing her so only those falsify her who without feeling classic wise or romantic wise set about being classic or romantic wearisomely reproducing the models of former ages and equally those who without sharing the sentiment of realism which now prevails force themselves to be realists merely to follow the fashion  the pseudorealists in fact are the worse offenders to my thinking for they sin against the living whereas those who continue to celebrate the heroic adventures of pussinboots and the hairbreadth escapes of tom thumb under various aliases only cast disrespect upon the immortals who have passed beyond these noises     xiv  the principal cause our spaniard says of the decadence of contemporary literature is found to my thinking in the vice which has been very graphically called effectism or the itch of awaking at all cost in the reader vivid and violent emotions which shall do credit to the invention and originality of the writer this vice has its roots in human nature itself and more particularly in that of the artist he has always some thing feminine in him which tempts him to coquet with the reader and display qualities that he thinks will astonish him as women laugh for no reason to show their teeth when they have them white and small and even or lift their dresses to show their feet when there is no mud in the street     what many writers nowadays wish is to produce an effect grand and immediate to play the part of geniuses for this they have learned that it is only necessary to write exaggerated works in any sort since the vulgar do not ask that they shall be quietly made to think and feel but that they shall be startled and among the vulgar of course i include the great part of those who write literary criticism and who constitute the worst vulgar since they teach what they do not know    there are many persons who suppose that the highest proof an artist can give of his fantasy is the invention of a complicated plot spiced with perils surprises and suspenses and that anything else is the sign of a poor and tepid imagination and not only people who seem cultivated but are not so suppose this but there are sensible persons and even sagacious and intelligent critics who sometimes allow themselves to be hoodwinked by the dramatic mystery and the surprising and fantastic scenes of a novel they own it is all false but they admire the imagination what they call the power of the author very well all i have to say is that the power to dazzle with strange incidents to entertain with complicated plots and impossible characters now belongs to some hundreds of writers in europe while there are not much above a dozen who know how to interest with the ordinary events of life and by the portrayal of characters truly human if the former is a talent it must be owned that it is much commoner than the latter     if we are to rate novelists according to their fecundity or the riches of their invention we must put alexander dumas above cervantes cervantes wrote a novel with the simplest plot without belying much or little the natural and logical course of events this novel which was called don quixote is perhaps the greatest work of human wit very well the same cervantes mischievously influenced afterwards by the ideas of the vulgar who were then what they are now and always will be attempted to please them by a work giving a lively proof of his inventive talent and wrote the persiles and sigismunda where the strange incidents the vivid complications the surprises the pathetic scenes succeed one another so rapidly and constantly that it really fatigues you     but in spite of this flood of invention imagine says seflor valdes the place that cervantes would now occupy in the heaven of art if he had never written don quixote but only persiles and sigismund  from the point of view of modern english criticism which likes to be melted and horrified and astonished and bloodcurdled and goose fleshed no less than to be chippered up in fiction senor valdes were indeed incorrigible not only does he despise the novel of complicated plot and everywhere prefer don quixote to persiles and sigismunda but he has a lively contempt for another class of novels much in favor with the gentilities of all countries he calls their writers novelists of the world and he says that more than any others they have the rage of effectism they do not seek to produce effect by novelty and invention in plot    they seek it in character for this end they begin by deliberately falsifying human feelings giving them a paradoxical appearance completely inadmissible     love that disguises itself as hate incomparable energy under the cloak of weakness virginal innocence under the aspect of malice and impudence wit masquerading as folly etc etc by this means they hope to make an effect of which they are incapable through the direct frank and conscientious study of character he mentions octave feuillet as the greatest offender in this sort among the french and bulwer among the english but dickens is full of it boffin in our mutual friend will suffice for all example and most drama is witness of the result of this effectism when allowed full play  but what then if he is not pleased with dumas or with the effectists who delight genteel people at all the theatres and in most of the romances what i ask will satisfy this extremely difficult spanish gentleman he would pretend very little give him simple lifelike character that is all he wants for me the only condition of character is that it be human and that is enough if i wished to know what was human i should study humanity  but senor valdes senor valdes do not you know that this small condition of yours implies in its fulfilment hardly less than the gift of the whole earth you merely ask that the character portrayed in fiction be human and you suggest that the novelist should study humanity if he would know whether his personages are human this appears to me the cruelest irony the most sarcastic affectation of humility if you had asked that character in fiction be superhuman or subterhuman or preterhuman or intrahuman and had bidden the novelist go not to humanity but the humanities for the proof of his excellence it would have been all very easy the books are full of those creations of every pattern of all ages of both sexes and it is so much handier to get at books than to get at men and when you have portrayed passion instead of feeling and used power instead of commonsense and shown yourself a genius instead of an artist the applause is so prompt and the glory so cheap that really anything else seems wickedly wasteful of ones time one may not make ones reader enjoy or suffer nobly but one may give him the kind of pleasure that arises from conjuring or from a puppetshow or a modern stageplay and leave him if he is an old fool in the sort of stupor that comes from hitting the pipe or if he is a young fool half crazed with the spectacle of qualities and impulses like his own in an apotheosis of achievement and fruition far beyond any earthly experience  but apparently senor valdes would not think this any great artistic result things that appear ugliest in reality to the spectator who is not an artist are transformed into beauty and poetry when the spirit of the artist possesses itself of them we all take part every day in a thousand domestic scenes every day we see a thousand pictures in life that do not make any impression upon us or if they make any it is one of repugnance but let the novelist come and without betraying the truth but painting them as they appear to his vision he produces a most interesting work whose perusal enchants us that which in life left us indifferent or repelled us in art delights us why simply because the artist has made us see the idea that resides in it let not the novelists then endeavor to add anything to reality to turn it and twist it to restrict it since nature has endowed them with this precious gift of discovering ideas in things their work will be beautiful if they paint these as they appear but if the reality does not impress them in vain will they strive to make their work impress others     xv  which brings us again after this long way about to jane austen and her novels and that troublesome question about them she was great and they were beautiful because she and they were honest and dealt with nature nearly a hundred years ago as realism deals with it today realism is nothing more and nothing less than the truthful treatment of material and jane austen was the first and the last of the english novelists to treat material with entire truthfulness because she did this she remains the most artistic of the english novelists and alone worthy to be matched with the great scandinavian and slavic and latin artists it is not a question of intellect or not wholly that the english have mind enough but they have not taste enough or rather their taste has been perverted by their false criticism which is based upon personal preference and not upon principle which instructs a man to think that what he likes is good instead of teaching him first to distinguish what is good before he likes it the art of fiction as jane austen knew it declined from her through scott and bulwer and dickens and charlotte bronte and thackeray and even george eliot because the mania of romanticism had seized upon all europe and these great writers could not escape the taint of their time but it has shown few signs of recovery in england because english criticism in the presence of the continental masterpieces has continued provincial and special and personal and has expressed a love and a hate which had to do with the quality of the artist rather than the character of his work it was inevitable that in their time the english romanticists should treat as senor valdes says the barbarous customs of the middle ages softening and distorting them as walter scott and his kind did that they should devote themselves to falsifying nature refining and subtilizing sentiment and modifying psychology after their own fancy like bulwer and dickens as well as like rousseau and madame de stael not to mention balzac the worst of all that sort at his worst this was the natural course of the disease but it really seems as if it were their criticism that was to blame for the rest not indeed for the performance of this writer or that for criticism can never affect the actual doing of a thing but for the esteem in which this writer or that is held through the perpetuation of false ideals the only observer of english middleclass life since jane austen worthy to be named with her was not george eliot who was first ethical and then artistic who transcended her in everything but the form and method most essential to art and there fell hopelessly below her it was anthony trollope who was most like her in simple honesty and instinctive truth as unphilosophized as the light of common day but he was so warped from a wholesome ideal as to wish at times to be like thackeray and to stand about in his scene talking it over with his hands in his pockets interrupting the action and spoiling the illusion in which alone the truth of art resides mainly his instinct was too much for his ideal and with a low view of life in its civic relations and a thoroughly bourgeois soul he yet produced works whose beauty is surpassed only by the effect of a more poetic writer in the novels of thomas hardy yet if a vote of english criticism even at this late day when all continental europe has the light of aesthetic truth could be taken the majority against these artists would be overwhelmingly in favor of a writer who had so little artistic sensibility that he never hesitated on any occasion great or small to make a foray among his characters and catch them up to show them to the reader and tell him how beautiful or ugly they were and cry out over their amazing properties  how few materials says emerson are yet used by our arts the mass of creatures and of qualities are still hid and expectant and to break new ground is still one of the uncommonest and most heroic of the virtues the artists are not alone to blame for the timidity that keeps them in the old furrows of the wornout fields most of those whom they live to please or live by pleasing prefer to have them remain there it wants rare virtue to appreciate what is new as well as to invent it and the easy things to understand are the conventional things this is why the ordinary english novel with its hackneyed plot scenes and figures is more comfortable to the ordinary american than an american novel which deals at its worst with comparatively new interests and motives to adjust ones self to the enjoyment of these costs an intellectual effort and an intellectual effort is what no ordinary person likes to make it is only the extraordinary person who can say with emerson i ask not for the great the remote the romantic     i embrace the common i sit at the feet of the familiar and the low     man is surprised to find that things near are not less beautiful and wondrous than things remote     the perception of the worth of the vulgar is fruitful in discoveries     the foolish man wonders at the unusual but the wise man at the usual     today always looks mean to the thoughtless but today is a king in disguise     banks and tariffs the newspaper and caucus methodism and unitarianism are flat and dull to dull people but rest on the same foundations of wonder as the town of troy and the temple of delphos  perhaps we ought not to deny their town of troy and their temple of delphos to the dull people but if we ought and if we did they would still insist upon having them an english novel full of titles and rank is apparently essential to the happiness of such people their weak and childish imagination is at home in its familiar environment they know what they are reading the fact that it is hash many times warmed over reassures them whereas a story of our own life honestly studied and faithfully represented troubles them with varied misgiving they are not sure that it is literature they do not feel that it is good society its characters so like their own strike them as commonplace they say they do not wish to know such people  everything in england is appreciable to the literary sense while the sense of the literary worth of things in america is still faint and weak with most people with the vast majority who ask for the great the remote the romantic who cannot embrace the common cannot sit at the feet of the familiar and the low in the good company of emerson we are all or nearly all struggling to be distinguished from the mass and to be set apart in select circles and upper classes like the fine people we have read about we are really a mixture of the plebeian ingredients of the whole world but that is not bad our vulgarity consists in trying to ignore the worth of the vulgar in believing that the superfine is better     xvii  another spanish novelist of our day whose books have given me great pleasure is so far from being of the same mind of senor valdes about fiction that he boldly declares himself in the preface to his pepita ximenez an advocate of art for arts sake i heartily agree with him that it is in very bad taste always impertinent and often pedantic to attempt to prove theses by writing stories and yet if it is true that the object of a novel should be to charm through a faithful representation of human actions and human passions and to create by this fidelity to nature a beautiful work and if the creation of the beautiful is solely the object of art it never was and never can be solely its effect as long as men are men and women are women if ever the race is resolved into abstract qualities perhaps this may happen but till then the finest effect of the beautiful will be ethical and not aesthetic merely morality penetrates all things it is the soul of all things beauty may clothe it on whether it is false morality and an evil soul or whether it is true and a good soul in the one case the beauty will corrupt and in the other it will edify and in either case it will infallibly and inevitably have an ethical effect now light now grave according as the thing is light or grave we cannot escape from this we are shut up to it by the very conditions of our being for the moment it is charming to have a story end happily but after one has lived a certain number of years and read a certain number of novels it is not the prosperous or adverse fortune of the characters that affects one but the good or bad faith of the novelist in dealing with them will he play us false or will he be true in the operation of this or that principle involved i cannot hold him to less account than this he must be true to what life has taught me is the truth and after that he may let any fate betide his people the novel ends well that ends faithfully the greater his power the greater his responsibility before the human conscience which is god in us but men come and go and what they do in their limited physical lives is of comparatively little moment it is what they say that really survives to bless or to ban and it is the evil which wordsworth felt in goethe that must long sur vive him there is a kind of thinga kind of metaphysical lie against righteousness and commonsense which is called the unmoral and is supposed to be different from the immoral and it is this which is supposed to cover many of the faults of goethe his wilhelm meister for example is so far removed within the region of the ideal that its unprincipled its evil principled tenor in regard to women is pronounced unmorality and is therefore inferably harmless but no study of goethe is complete without some recognition of the qualities which caused wordsworth to hurl the book across the room with an indignant perception of its sensuality for the sins of his life goethe was perhaps sufficiently punished in his life by his final marriage with christiane for the sins of his literature many others must suffer i do not despair however of the day when the poor honest herd of man kind shall give universal utterance to the universal instinct and shall hold selfish power in politics in art in religion for the devil that it is when neither its crazy pride nor its amusing vanity shall be flattered by the puissance of the geniuses who have forgotten their duty to the common weakness and have abused it to their own glory in that day we shall shudder at many monsters of passion of selfindulgence of heartlessness whom we still more or less openly adore for their genius and shall account no man worshipful whom we do not feel and know to be good the spectacle of strenuous achievement will then not dazzle or mislead it will not sanctify or palliate iniquity it will only render it the more hideous and pitiable  in fact the whole belief in genius seems to me rather a mischievous superstition and if not mischievous always still always a superstition from the account of those who talk about it genius appears to be the attribute of a sort of very potent and admirable prodigy which god has created out of the common for the astonishment and confusion of the rest of us poor human beings but do they really believe it do they mean anything more or less than the mastery which comes to any man according to his powers and diligence in any direction if not why not have an end of the superstition which has caused our race to go on so long writing and reading of the difference between talent and genius it is within the memory of middleaged men that the maelstrom existed in the belief of the geographers but we now get on perfectly well without it and why should we still suffer under the notion of genius which keeps so many poor little authorlings trembling in question whether they have it or have only talent  one of the greatest captains who ever lived general u s grant dw a plain taciturn unaffected soulhas told the story of his wonderful life as unconsciously as if it were all an everyday affair not different from other lives except as a great exigency of the human race gave it importance so far as he knew he had no natural aptitude for arms and certainly no love for the calling but he went to west point because as he quaintly tells us his father rather thought he would go and he fought through one war with credit but without glory the other war which was to claim his powers and his science found him engaged in the most prosaic of peaceful occupations he obeyed its call because he loved his country and not because he loved war all the world knows the rest and all the world knows that greater military mastery has not been shown than his campaigns illustrated he does not say this in his book or hint it in any way he gives you the facts and leaves them with you but the personal memoirs of u s grant written as simply and straightforwardly as his battles were fought couched in the most unpretentious phrase with never a touch of grandiosity or attitudinizing familiar homely in style form a great piece of literature because great literature is nothing more nor less than the clear expression of minds that have some thing great in them whether religion or beauty or deep experience probably grant would have said that he had no more vocation to literature than he had to war he owns with something like contrition that he used to read a great many novels but we think he would have denied the soft impeachment of literary power nevertheless he shows it as he showed military power unexpectedly almost miraculously all the conditions here then are favorable to supposing a case of genius yet who would trifle with that great heir of fame that plain grand manly soul by speaking of genius and him together who calls washington a genius or franklin or bismarck or cavour or columbus or luther or darwin or lincoln were these men secondrate in their way or is genius that indefinable preternatural quality sacred to the musicians the painters the sculptors the actors the poets and above all the poets or is it that the poets having most of the say in this world abuse it to shameless selfflattery and would persuade the inarticulate classes that they are on peculiar terms of confidence with the deity     xviii  in general grants confession of novelreading there is a sort of inference that he had wasted his time or else the guilty conscience of the novelist in me imagines such an inference but however this may be there is certainly no question concerning the intention of a correspondent who once wrote to me after reading some rather bragging claims i had made for fiction as a mental and moral means i have very grave doubts he said as to the whole list of magnificent things that you seem to think novels have done for the race and can witness in myself many evil things which they have done for me whatever in my mental makeup is wild and visionary whatever is untrue whatever is injurious i can trace to the perusal of some work of fiction worse than that they beget such highstrung and supersensitive ideas of life that plain industry and plodding perseverance are despised and matter offact poverty or everyday commonplace distress meets with no sympathy if indeed noticed at all by one who has wept over the impossibly accumulated sufferings of some gaudy hero or heroine  i am not sure that i had the controversy with this correspondent that he seemed to suppose but novels are now so fully accepted by every one pretending to cultivated taste and they really form the whole intellectual life of such immense numbers of people without question of their influence good or bad upon the mind that it is refreshing to have them frankly denounced and to be invited to revise ones ideas and feelings in regard to them a little honesty or a great deal of honesty in this quest will do the novel as we hope yet to have it and as we have already begun to have it no harm and for my own part i will confess that i believe fiction in the past to have been largely injurious as i believe the stageplay to be still almost wholly injurious through its falsehood its folly its wantonness and its aimlessness it may be safely assumed that most of the novelreading which people fancy an intellectual pastime is the emptiest dissipation hardly more related to thought or the wholesome exercise of the mental faculties than opiumeating in either case the brain is drugged and left weaker and crazier for the debauch if this may be called the negative result of the fiction habit the positive injury that most novels work is by no means so easily to be measured in the case of young men whose character they help so much to form or deform and the women of all ages whom they keep so much in ignorance of the world they misrepresent grown men have little harm from them but in the other cases which are the vast majority they hurt because they are not true not because they are malevolent but because they are idle lies about human nature and the social fabric which it behooves us to know and to understand that we may deal justly with ourselves and with one another one need not go so far as our correspondent and trace to the fiction habit whatever is wild and visionary whatever is untrue whatever is injurious in ones life bad as the fiction habit is it is probably not responsible for the whole sum of evil in its victims and i believe that if the reader will use care in choosing from this fungusgrowth with which the fields of literature teem every day he may nourish himself as with the true mushroom at no risk from the poisonous species  the tests are very plain and simple and they are perfectly infallible if a novel flatters the passions and exalts them above the principles it is poisonous it may not kill but it will certainly injure and this test will alone exclude an entire class of fiction of which eminent examples will occur to all then the whole spawn of socalled unmoral romances which imagine a world where the sins of sense are unvisited by the penalties following swift or slow but inexorably sure in the real world are deadly poison these do kill the novels that merely tickle our prejudices and lull our judgment or that coddle our sensibilities or pamper our gross appetite for the marvellous are not so fatal but they are innutritious and clog the soul with unwholesome vapors of all kinds no doubt they too help to weaken the moral fibre and make their readers indifferent to plodding perseverance and plain industry and to matteroffact poverty and commonplace distress  without taking them too seriously it still must be owned that the gaudy hero and heroine are to blame for a great deal of harm in the world that heroine long taught by example if not precept that love or the passion or fancy she mistook for it was the chief interest of a life which is really concerned with a great many other things that it was lasting in the way she knew it that it was worthy of every sacrifice and was altogether a finer thing than prudence obedience reason that love alone was glorious and beautiful and these were mean and ugly in comparison with it more lately she has begun to idolize and illustrate duty and she is hardly less mischievous in this new role opposing duty as she did love to prudence obedience and reason the stock hero whom if we met him we could not fail to see was a most deplorable person has undoubtedly imposed himself upon the victims of the fiction habit as admirable with him too love was and is the great affair whether in its old romantic phase of chivalrous achievement or manifold suffering for loves sake or its more recent development of the virile the bullying and the brutal or its still more recent agonies of selfsacrifice as idle and useless as the moral experiences of the insane asylums with his vain posturings and his ridiculous splendor he is really a painted barbarian the prey of his passions and his delusions full of obsolete ideals and the motives and ethics of a savage which the guilty author of his being does his bestor his worst in spite of his own light and knowledge to foist upon the reader as something generous and noble i am not merely bringing this charge against that sort of fiction which is beneath literature and outside of it the shoreless lakes of ditchwater whose miasms fill the air below the empyrean where the great ones sit but i am accusing the work of some of the most famous who have in this instance or in that sinned against the truth which can alone exalt and purify men i do not say that they have constantly done so or even commonly done so but that they have done so at all marks them as of the past to be read with the due historical allowance for their epoch and their conditions for i believe that while inferior writers will and must continue to imitate them in their foibles and their errors no one here after will be able to achieve greatness who is false to humanity either in its facts or its duties the light of civilization has already broken even upon the novel and no conscientious man can now set about painting an image of life without perpetual question of the verity of his work and without feeling bound to distinguish so clearly that no reader of his may be misled between what is right and what is wrong what is noble and what is base what is health and what is perdition in the actions and the characters he portrays  the fiction that aims merely to entertainthe fiction that is to serious fiction as the operabouffe the ballet and the pantomime are to the true dramaneed not feel the burden of this obligation so deeply but even such fiction will not be gay or trivial to any readers hurt and criticism should hold it to account if it passes from painting to teaching folly  i confess that i do not care to judge any work of the imagination without first of all applying this test to it we must ask ourselves before we ask anything else is it truetrue to the motives the impulses the principles that shape the life of actual men and women this truth which necessarily includes the highest morality and the highest artistry this truth given the book cannot be wicked and cannot be weak and without it all graces of style and feats of invention and cunning of construction are so many superfluities of naughtiness it is well for the truth to have all these and shine in them but for falsehood they are merely meretricious the bedizenment of the wanton they atone for nothing they count for nothing but in fact they come naturally of truth and grace it without solicitation they are added unto it in the whole range of fiction i know of no true picture of lifethat is of human naturewhich is not also a masterpiece of literature full of divine and natural beauty it may have no touch or tint of this special civilization or of that it had better have this local color well ascertained but the truth is deeper and finer than aspects and if the book is true to what men and women know of one anothers souls it will be true enough and it will be great and beautiful it is the conception of literature as something apart from life superfinely aloof which makes it really unimportant to the great mass of mankind without a message or a meaning for them and it is the notion that a novel may be false in its portrayal of causes and effects that makes literary art contemptible even to those whom it amuses that forbids them to regard the novelist as a serious or rightminded person if they do not in some moment of indignation cry out against all novels as my correspondent does they remain besotted in the fume of the delusions purveyed to them with no higher feeling for the author than such maudlin affection as the frequenter of an opiumjoint perhaps knows for the attendant who fills his pipe with the drug  or as in the case of another correspondent who writes that in his youth he read a great many novels but always regarded it as an amusement like horse racing and cardplaying for which he had no time when he entered upon the serious business of life it renders them merely contemptuous his view of the matter may be commended to the brotherhood and sisterhood of novelists as full of wholesome if bitter suggestion and i urge them not to dismiss it with high literary scorn as that of some boeotian dull to the beauty of art refuse it as we may it is still the feeling of the vast majority of people for whom life is earnest and who find only a distorted and misleading likeness of it in our books we may fold ourselves in our scholars gowns and close the doors of our studies and affect to despise this rude voice but we cannot shut it out it comes to us from wherever men are at work from wherever they are truly living and accuses us of unfaithfulness of triviality of mere stageplay and none of us can escape conviction except he prove himself worthy of his timea time in which the great masters have brought literature back to life and filled its ebbing veins with the red tides of reality we cannot all equal them we need not copy them but we can all go to the sources of their inspiration and their power and to draw from these no one need go farno one need really go out of himself  fifty years ago carlyle in whom the truth was always alive but in whom it was then unperverted by suffering by celebrity and by despair wrote in his study of diderot were it not reasonable to prophesy that this exceeding great multitude of novelwriters and such like must in a new generation gradually do one of two things either retire into the nurseries and work for children minors and semifatuous persons of both sexes or else what were far better sweep their novelfabric into the dustcart and betake themselves with such faculty as they have to understand and record what is true of which surely there is and will forever be a whole infinitude unknown to us of infinite importance to us poetry it will more and more come to be understood is nothing but higher knowledge and the only genuine romance for grown persons reality  if after half a century fiction still mainly works for children minors and semifatuous persons of both sexes it is nevertheless one of the hopefulest signs of the worlds progress that it has begun to work for grown persons and if not exactly in the way that carlyle might have solely intended in urging its writers to compile memoirs instead of building the novelfabric still it has in the highest and widest sense already made reality its romance i cannot judge it i do not even care for it except as it has done this and i can hardly conceive of a literary selfrespect in these days compatible with the old trade of makebelieve with the production of the kind of fiction which is too much honored by classification with cardplaying and horseracing but let fiction cease to lie about life let it portray men and women as they are actuated by the motives and the passions in the measure we all know let it leave off painting dolls and working them by springs and wires let it show the different interests in their true proportions let it forbear to preach pride and revenge folly and insanity egotism and prejudice but frankly own these for what they are in whatever figures and occasions they appear let it not put on fine literary airs let it speak the dialect the language that most americans knowthe language of unaffected people everywhereand there can be no doubt of an unlimited future not only of delightfulness but of usefulness for it     xix  this is what i say in my severer moods but at other times i know that of course no one is going to hold all fiction to such strict account there is a great deal of it which may be very well left to amuse us if it can when we are sick or when we are silly and i am not inclined to despise it in the performance of this office or if people find pleasure in having their blood curdled for the sake of having it uncurdled again at the end of the book i would not interfere with their amusement though i do not desire it  there is a certain demand in primitive natures for the kind of fiction that does this and the author of it is usually very proud of it the kind of novels he likes and likes to write are intended to take his readers mind or what that reader would probably call his mind off himself they make one forget life and all its cares and duties they are not in the least like the novels which make you think of these and shame you into at least wishing to be a helpfuller and wholesomer creature than you are no sordid details of verity here if you please no wretched being humbly and weakly struggling to do right and to be true suffering for his follies and his sins tasting joy only through the mortification of self and in the help of others nothing of all this but a great whirling splendor of peril and achievement a wild scene of heroic adventure and of emotional ground and lofty tumbling with a stage picture at the fall of the curtain and all the good characters in a row their left hands pressed upon their hearts and kissing their right hands to the audience in the old way that has always charmed and always will charm heaven bless it  in a world which loves the spectacular drama and the practically bloodless sports of the modern amphitheatre the author of this sort of fiction has his place and we must not seek to destroy him because he fancies it the first place in fact it is a condition of his doing well the kind of work he does that he should think it important that he should believe in himself and i would not take away this faith of his even if i could as i say he has his place the world often likes to forget itself and he brings on his heroes his goblins his feats his hairbreadth escapes his imminent deadly breaches and the poor foolish childish old world renews the excitements of its nonage perhaps this is a work of beneficence and perhaps our brave conjurer in his cabalistic robe is a philanthropist in disguise  within the last four or five years there has been throughout the whole englishspeaking world what mr grant allen happily calls the recrudescence of taste in fiction the effect is less noticeable in america than in england where effete philistinism conscious of the dryrot of its conventionality is casting about for cure in anything that is wild and strange and unlike itself but the recrudescence has been evident enough here too and a writer in one of our periodicals has put into convenient shape some common errors concerning popularity as a test of merit in a book he seems to think for instance that the love of the marvellous and impossible in fiction which is shown not only by the unthinking multitude clamoring about the book counters for fiction of that sort but by the literary elect also is proof of some principle in human nature which ought to be respected as well as tolerated he seems to believe that the ebullition of this passion forms a sufficient answer to those who say that art should represent life and that the art which misrepresents life is feeble art and false art but it appears to me that a little carefuller reasoning from a little closer inspection of the facts would not have brought him to these conclusions in the first place i doubt very much whether the literary elect have been fascinated in great numbers by the fiction in question but if i supposed them to have really fallen under that spell i should still be able to account for their fondness and that of the unthinking multitude upon the same grounds without honoring either very much it is the habit of hasty casuists to regard civilization as inclusive of all the members of a civilized community but this is a palpable error many persons in every civilized community live in a state of more or less evident savagery with respect to their habits their morals and their propensities and they are held in check only by the law many more yet are savage in their tastes as they show by the decoration of their houses and persons and by their choice of books and pictures and these are left to the restraints of public opinion in fact no man can be said to be thoroughly civilized or always civilized the most refined the most enlightened person has his moods his moments of barbarism in which the best or even the second best shall not please him at these times the lettered and the unlettered are alike primitive and their gratifications are of the same simple sort the highly cultivated person may then like melodrama impossible fiction and the trapeze as sincerely and thoroughly as a boy of thirteen or a barbarian of any age  i do not blame him for these moods i find something instructive and interesting in them but if they lastingly established themselves in him i could not help deploring the state of that person no one can really think that the literary elect who are said to have joined the unthinking multitude in clamoring about the book counters for the romances of nomans land take the same kind of pleasure in them as they do in a novel of tolstoy tourguenief george eliot thackeray balzac manzoni hawthorne mr henry james mr thomas hardy senor palacio valdes or even walter scott they have joined the unthinking multitude perhaps because they are tired of thinking and expect to find relaxation in feelingfeeling crudely grossly merely for once in a way there is no great harm in this perhaps no harm at all it is perfectly natural let them have their innocent debauch but let us distinguish for our own sake and guidance between the different kinds of things that please the same kind of people between the things that please them habitually and those that please them occasionally between the pleasures that edify them and those that amuse them otherwise we shall be in danger of becoming permanently part of the unthinking multitude and of remaining puerile primitive savage we shall be so in moods and at moments but let us not fancy that those are high moods or fortunate moments if they are harmless that is the most that can be said for them they are lapses from which we can perhaps go forward more vigorously but even this is not certain  my own philosophy of the matter however would not bring me to prohibition of such literary amusements as the writer quoted seems to find significant of a growing indifference to truth and sanity in fiction once more i say these amusements have their place as the circus has and the burlesque and negro minstrelsy and the ballet and prestidigitation no one of these is to be despised in its place but we had better understand that it is not the highest place and that it is hardly an intellectual delight the lapse of all the literary elect in the world could not dignify unreality and their present mood if it exists is of no more weight against that beauty in literature which comes from truth alone and never can come from anything else than the permanent state of the unthinking multitude  yet even as regards the unthinking multitude i believe i am not able to take the attitude of the writer i have quoted i am afraid that i respect them more than he would like to have me though i cannot always respect their taste any more than that of the literary elect i respect them for their good sense in most practical matters for their laborious honest lives for their kindness their goodwill for that aspiration towards something better than themselves which seems to stir however dumbly in every human breast not abandoned to literary pride or other forms of selfrighteousness i find every man interesting whether he thinks or unthinks whether he is savage or civilized for this reason i cannot thank the novelist who teaches us not to know but to unknow our kind yet i should by no means hold him to such strict account as emerson who felt the absence of the best motive even in the greatest of the masters when he said of shakespeare that after all he was only master of the revels the judgment is so severe even with the praise which precedes it that one winces under it and if one is still young with the world gay before him and life full of joyous promise one is apt to ask defiantly well what is better than being such a master of the revels as shakespeare was let each judge for himself to the heart again of serious youth uncontaminate and exigent of ideal good it must always be a grief that the great masters seem so often to have been willing to amuse the leisure and vacancy of meaner men and leave their mission to the soul but partially fulfilled this perhaps was what emerson had in mind and if he had it in mind of shakespeare who gave us with his histories and comedies and problems such a searching homily as macbeth one feels that he scarcely recognized the limitations of the dramatists art few consciences at times seem so enlightened as that of this personally unknown person so withdrawn into his work and so lost to the intensest curiosity of aftertime at other times he seems merely elizabethan in his coarseness his courtliness his imperfect sympathy     xx  of the finer kinds of romance as distinguished from the novel i would even encourage the writing though it is one of the hard conditions of romance that its personages starting with a parti pris can rarely be characters with a living growth but are apt to be types limited to the expression of one principle simple elemental lacking the godgiven complexity of motive which we find in all the human beings we know  hawthorne the great master of the romance had the insight and the power to create it anew as a kind in fiction though i am not sure that the scarlet letter and the blithedale romance are not strictly speaking novels rather than romances they do not play with some old superstition long outgrown and they do not invent a new superstition to play with but deal with things vital in every ones pulse i am not saying that what may be called the fantastic romancethe romance that descends from frankenstein rather than the scarlet letterought not to be on the contrary i should grieve to lose it as i should grieve to lose the pantomime or the comic opera or many other graceful things that amuse the passing hour and help us to live agreeably in a world where men actually sin suffer and die but it belongs to the decorative arts and though it has a high place among them it cannot be ranked with the works of the imaginationthe works that represent and body forth human experience its ingenuity can always afford a refined pleasure and it can often at some risk to itself convey a valuable truth  perhaps the whole region of historical romance might be reopened with advantage to readers and writers who cannot bear to be brought face to face with human nature but require the haze of distance or a far perspective in which all the disagreeable details shall be lost there is no good reason why these harmless people should not be amused or their little preferences indulged  but here again i have my modest doubts some recent instances are so fatuous as far as the portrayal of character goes though i find them admirably contrived in some respects when i have owned the excellence of the staging in every respect and the conscience with which the carpenter as the theatrical folks say has done his work i am at the end of my praises the people affect me like persons of our generation made up for the parts well trained well costumed but actors and almost amateurs they have the quality that makes the histrionics of amateurs endurable they are ladies and gentlemen the worst the wickedest of them is a lady or gentleman behind the scene  yet no doubt it is well that there should be a reversion to the earlier types of thinking and feeling to earlier ways of looking at human nature and i will not altogether refuse the pleasure offered me by the poetic romancer or the historical romancer because i find my pleasure chiefly in tolstoy and valdes and thomas hardy and tourguenief and balzac at his best     xxi  it used to be one of the disadvantages of the practice of romance in america which hawthorne more or less whimsically lamented that there were so few shadows and inequalities in our broad level of prosperity and it is one of the reflections suggested by dostoievskys novel the crime and the punishment that whoever struck a note so profoundly tragic in american fiction would do a false and mistaken thingas false and as mistaken in its way as dealing in american fiction with certain nudities which the latin peoples seem to find edifying whatever their deserts very few american novelists have been led out to be shot or finally exiled to the rigors of a winter at duluth and in a land where journeymen carpenters and plumbers strike for four dollars a day the sum of hunger and cold is comparatively small and the wrong from class to class has been almost inappreciable though all this is changing for the worse our novelists therefore concern themselves with the more smiling aspects of life which are the more american and seek the universal in the individual rather than the social interests it is worth while even at the risk of being called commonplace to be true to our welltodo actualities the very passions themselves seem to be softened and modified by conditions which formerly at least could not be said to wrong any one to cramp endeavor or to cross lawful desire sin and suffering and shame there must always be in the world i suppose but i believe that in this new world of ours it is still mainly from one to another one and oftener still from one to ones self we have death too in america and a great deal of disagreeable and painful disease which the multiplicity of our patent medicines does not seem to cure but this is tragedy that comes in the very nature of things and is not peculiarly american as the large cheerful average of health and success and happy life is it will not do to boast but it is well to be true to the facts and to see that apart from these purely mortal troubles the race here has enjoyed conditions in which most of the ills that have darkened its annals might be averted by honest work and unselfish behavior  fine artists we have among us and rightminded as far as they go and we must not forget this at evil moments when it seems as if all the women had taken to writing hysterical improprieties and some of the men were trying to be at least as hysterical in despair of being as improper other traits are much more characteristic of our life and our fiction in most american novels vivid and graphic as the best of them are the people are segregated if not sequestered and the scene is sparsely populated the effect may be in instinctive response to the vacancy of our social life and i shall not make haste to blame it there are few places few occasions among us in which a novelist can get a large number of polite people together or at least keep them together unless he carries a snapcamera his picture of them has no probability they affect one like the figures perfunctorily associated in such deadly old engravings as that of washington irving and his friends perhaps it is for this reason that we excel in small pieces with three or four figures or in studies of rustic communities where there is propinquity if not society our grasp of more urbane life is feeble most attempts to assemble it in our pictures are failures possibly because it is too transitory too intangible in its nature with us to be truthfully represented as really existent  i am not sure that the americans have not brought the short story nearer perfection in the allround sense that almost any other people and for reasons very simple and near at hand it might be argued from the national hurry and impatience that it was a literary form peculiarly adapted to the american temperament but i suspect that its extraordinary development among us is owing much more to more tangible facts the success of american magazines which is nothing less than prodigious is only commensurate with their excellence their sort of success is not only from the courage to decide which ought to please but from the knowledge of what does please and it is probable that aside from the pictures it is the short stories which please the readers of our best magazines the serial novels they must have of course but rather more of course they must have short stories and by operation of the law of supply and demand the short stories abundant in quantity and excellent in quality are forthcoming because they are wanted by another operation of the same law which political economists have more recently taken account of the demand follows the supply and short stories are sought for because there is a proven ability to furnish them and people read them willingly because they are usually very good the art of writing them is now so disciplined and diffused with us that there is no lack either for the magazines or for the newspaper syndicates which deal in them almost to the exclusion of the serials  an interesting fact in regard to the different varieties of the short story among us is that the sketches and studies by the women seem faithfuller and more realistic than those of the men in proportion to their number their tendency is more distinctly in that direction and there is a solidity an honest observation in the work of such women which often leaves little to be desired i should upon the whole be disposed to rank american short stories only below those of such russian writers as i have read and i should praise rather than blame their free use of our different local parlances or dialects as people call them i like this because i hope that our inherited english may be constantly freshened and revived from the native sources which our literary decentralization will help to keep open and i will own that as i turn over novels coming from philadelphia from new mexico from boston from tennessee from rural new england from new york every local flavor of diction gives me courage and pleasure alphonse daudet in a conversation with h h boyesen said speaking of tourguenief what a luxury it must be to have a great big untrodden barbaric language to wade into we poor fellows who work in the language of an old civilization we may sit and chisel our little verbal felicities only to find in the end that it is a borrowed jewel we are polishing the crown jewels of our french tongue have passed through the hands of so many generations of monarchs that it seems like presumption on the part of any lateborn pretender to attempt to wear them  this grief is of course a little whimsical yet it has a certain measure of reason in it and the same regret has been more seriously expressed by the italian poet aleardi       muse of an aged people in the eve      of fading civilization i was born            oh fortunate      my sisters who in the heroic dawn      of races sung to them did destiny give      the virgin fire and chaste ingenuousness      of their lands speech and reverenced their hands      ran over potent strings  it will never do to allow that we are at such a desperate pass in english but something of this divine despair we may feel too in thinking of the spacious times of great elizabeth when the poets were trying the stops of the young language and thrilling with the surprises of their own music we may comfort ourselves however unless we prefer a luxury of grief by remembering that no language is ever old on the lips of those who speak it no matter how decrepit it drops from the pen we have only to leave our studies editorial and other and go into the shops and fields to find the spacious times again and from the beginning realism before she had put on her capital letter had divined this nearathand truth along with the rest lowell almost the greatest and finest realist who ever wrought in verse showed us that elizabeth was still queen where he heard yankee farmers talk one need not invite slang into the company of its betters though perhaps slang has been dropping its s and becoming language ever since the world began and is certainly sometimes delightful and forcible beyond the reach of the dictionary i would not have any one go about for new words but if one of them came aptly not to reject its help for our novelists to try to write americanly from any motive would be a dismal error but being born americans i then use americanisms whenever these serve their turn and when their characters speak i should like to hear them speak true american with all the varying tennesseean philadelphian bostonian and new york accents if we bother ourselves to write what the critics imagine to be english we shall be priggish and artificial and still more so if we make our americans talk english there is also this serious disadvantage about english that if we wrote the best english in the world probably the english themselves would not know it or if they did certainly would not own it it has always been supposed by grammarians and purists that a language can be kept as they find it but languages while they live are perpetually changing god apparently meant them for the common people and the common people will use them freely as they use other gifts of god on their lips our continental english will differ more and more from the insular english and i believe that this is not deplorable but desirable  in fine i would have our american novelists be as american as they unconsciously can matthew arnold complained that he found no distinction in our life and i would gladly persuade all artists intending greatness in any kind among us that the recognition of the fact pointed out by mr arnold ought to be a source of inspiration to them and not discouragement we have been now some hundred years building up a state on the affirmation of the essential equality of men in their rights and duties and whether we have been right or been wrong the gods have taken us at our word and have responded to us with a civilization in which there is no distinction perceptible to the eye that loves and values it such beauty and such grandeur as we have is common beauty common grandeur or the beauty and grandeur in which the quality of solidarity so prevails that neither distinguishes itself to the disadvantage of anything else it seems to me that these conditions invite the artist to the study and the appreciation of the common and to the portrayal in every art of those finer and higher aspects which unite rather than sever humanity if he would thrive in our new order of things the talent that is robust enough to front the everyday world and catch the charm of its workworn careworn brave kindly face need not fear the encounter though it seems terrible to the sort nurtured in the superstition of the romantic the bizarre the heroic the distinguished as the things alone worthy of painting or carving or writing the arts must become democratic and then we shall have the expression of america in art and the reproach which arnold was half right in making us shall have no justice in it any longer we shall be distinguished     xxii  in the mean time it has been said with a superficial justice that our fiction is narrow though in the same sense i suppose the present english fiction is as narrow as our own and most modern fiction is narrow in a certain sense in italy the best men are writing novels as brief and restricted in range as ours in spain the novels are intense and deep and not spacious the french school with the exception of zola is narrow the norwegians are narrow the russians except tolstoy are narrow and the next greatest after him tourguenief is the narrowest great novelist as to mere dimensions that ever lived dealing nearly always with small groups isolated and analyzed in the most american fashion in fact the charge of narrowness accuses the whole tendency of modern fiction as much as the american school but i do not by any means allow that this narrowness is a defect while denying that it is a universal characteristic of our fiction it is rather for the present a virtue indeed i should call the present american work north and south thorough rather than narrow in one sense it is as broad as life for each man is a microcosm and the writer who is able to acquaint us intimately with half a dozen people or the conditions of a neighborhood or a class has done something which cannot in any bad sense be called narrow his breadth is vertical instead of lateral that is all and this depth is more desirable than horizontal expansion in a civilization like ours where the differences are not of classes but of types and not of types either so much as of characters a new method was necessary in dealing with the new conditions and the new method is worldwide because the whole world is more or less americanized tolstoy is exceptionally voluminous among modern writers even russian writers and it might be said that the forte of tolstoy himself is not in his breadth sidewise but in his breadth upward and downward the death of ivan ilyitch leaves as vast an impression on the readers soul as any episode of war and peace which indeed can be recalled only in episodes and not as a whole i think that our writers may be safely counselled to continue their work in the modern way because it is the best way yet known if they make it true it will be large no matter what its superficies are and it would be the greatest mistake to try to make it big a big book is necessarily a group of episodes more or less loosely connected by a thread of narrative and there seems no reason why this thread must always be supplied each episode may be quite distinct or it may be one of a connected group the final effect will be from the truth of each episode not from the size of the group  the whole field of human experience as never so nearly covered by imaginative literature in any age as in this and american life especially is getting represented with unexampled fulness it is true that no one writer no one book represents it for that is not possible our social and political decentralization forbids this and may forever forbid it but a great number of very good writers are instinctively striving to make each part of the country and each phase of our civilization known to all the other parts and their work is not narrow in any feeble or vicious sense the world was once very little and it is now very large formerly all science could be grasped by a single mind but now the man who hopes to become great or useful in science must devote himself to a single department it is so in everythingall arts all trades and the novelist is not superior to the universal rule against universality he contributes his share to a thorough knowledge of groups of the human race under conditions which are full of inspiring novelty and interest he works more fearlessly frankly and faithfully than the novelist ever worked before his work or much of it may be destined never to be reprinted from the monthly magazines but if he turns to his bookshelf and regards the array of the british or other classics he knows that they too are for the most part dead he knows that the planet itself is destined to freeze up and drop into the sun at last with all its surviving literature upon it the question is merely one of time he consoles himself therefore if he is wise and works on and we may all take some comfort from the thought that most things cannot be helped especially a movement in literature like that which the world is now witnessing cannot be helped and we could no more turn back and be of the literary fashions of any age before this than we could turn back and be of its social economical or political conditions  if i were authorized to address any word directly to our novelists i should say do not trouble yourselves about standards or ideals but try to be faithful and natural remember that there is no greatness no beauty which does not come from truth to your own knowledge of things and keep on working even if your work is not long remembered  at least threefifths of the literature called classic in all languages no more lives than the poems and stories that perish monthly in our magazines it is all printed and reprinted generation after generation century after century but it is not alive it is as dead as the people who wrote it and read it and to whom it meant something perhaps with whom it was a fashion a caprice a passing taste a superstitious piety preserves it and pretends that it has aesthetic qualities which can delight or edify but nobody really enjoys it except as a reflection of the past moods and humors of the race or a revelation of the authors character otherwise it is trash and often very filthy trash which the present trash generally is not     xxiii  one of the great newspapers the other day invited the prominent american authors to speak their minds upon a point in the theory and practice of fiction which had already vexed some of them it was the question of how much or how little the american novel ought to deal with certain facts of life which are not usually talked of before young people and especially young ladies of course the question was not decided and i forget just how far the balance inclined in favor of a larger freedom in the matter but it certainly inclined that way one or two writers of the sex which is somehow supposed to have purity in its keeping as if purity were a thing that did not practically concern the other sex preoccupied with serious affairs gave it a rather vigorous tilt to that side in view of this fact it would not be the part of prudence to make an effort to dress the balance and indeed i do not know that i was going to make any such effort but there are some things to say around and about the subject which i should like to have some one else say and which i may myself possibly be safe in suggesting  one of the first of these is the fact generally lost sight of by those who censure the anglosaxon novel for its prudishness that it is really not such a prude after all and that if it is sometimes apparently anxious to avoid those experiences of life not spoken of before young people this may be an appearance only sometimes a novel which has this shuffling air this effect of truckling to propriety might defend itself if it could speak for itself by saying that such experiences happened not to come within its scheme and that so far from maiming or mutilating itself in ignoring them it was all the more faithfully representative of the tone of modern life in dealing with love that was chaste and with passion so honest that it could be openly spoken of before the tenderest society bud at dinner it might say that the guilty intrigue the betrayal the extreme flirtation even was the exceptional thing in life and unless the scheme of the story necessarily involved it that it would be bad art to lug it in and as bad taste as to introduce such topics in a mixed company it could say very justly that the novel in our civilization now always addresses a mixed company and that the vast majority of the company are ladies and that very many if not most of these ladies are young girls if the novel were written for men and for married women alone as in continental europe it might be altogether different but the simple fact is that it is not written for them alone among us and it is a question of writing under cover of our universal acceptance things for young girls to read which you would be put outofdoors for saying to them or of frankly giving notice of your intention and so cutting yourself off from the pleasureand it is a very high and sweet one of appealing to these vivid responsive intelligences which are none the less brilliant and admirable because they are innocent  one day a novelist who liked after the manner of other men to repine at his hard fate complained to his friend a critic that he was tired of the restriction he had put upon himself in this regard for it is a mistake as can be readily shown to suppose that others impose it see how free those french fellows are he rebelled shall we always be shut up to our tradition of decency  do you think its much worse than being shut up to their tradition of indecency said his friend  then that novelist began to reflect and he remembered how sick the invariable motive of the french novel made him he perceived finally that convention for convention ours was not only more tolerable but on the whole was truer to life not only to its complexion but also to its texture no one will pretend that there is not vicious love beneath the surface of our society if he did the fetid explosions of the divorce trials would refute him but if he pretended that it was in any just sense characteristic of our society he could be still more easily refuted yet it exists and it is unquestionably the material of tragedy the stuff from which intense effects are wrought the question after owning this fact is whether these intense effects are not rather cheap effects i incline to think they are and i will try to say why i think so if i may do so without offence the material itself the mere mention of it has an instant fascination it arrests it detains till the last word is said and while there is anything to be hinted this is what makes a love intrigue of some sort all but essential to the popularity of any fiction without such an intrigue the intellectual equipment of the author must be of the highest and then he will succeed only with the highest class of readers but any author who will deal with a guilty love intrigue holds all readers in his hand the highest with the lowest as long as he hints the slightest hope of the smallest potential naughtiness he need not at all be a great author he may be a very shabby wretch if he has but the courage or the trick of that sort of thing the critics will call him virile and passionate decent people will be ashamed to have been limed by him but the low average will only ask another chance of flocking into his net if he happens to be an able writer his really fine and costly work will be unheeded and the lure to the appetite will be chiefly remembered there may be other qualities which make reputations for other men but in his case they will count for nothing he pays this penalty for his success in that kind and every one pays some such penalty who deals with some such material  but i do not mean to imply that his case covers the whole ground so far as it goes though it ought to stop the mouths of those who complain that fiction is enslaved to propriety among us it appears that of a certain kind of impropriety it is free to give us all it will and more but this is not what serious men and women writing fiction mean when they rebel against the limitations of their art in our civilization they have no desire to deal with nakedness as painters and sculptors freely do in the worship of beauty or with certain facts of life as the stage does in the service of sensation but they ask why when the conventions of the plastic and histrionic arts liberate their followers to the portrayal of almost any phase of the physical or of the emotional nature an american novelist may not write a story on the lines of anna karenina or madame bovary they wish to touch one of the most serious and sorrowful problems of life in the spirit of tolstoy and flaubert and they ask why they may not at one time they remind us the anglosaxon novelist did deal with such problemsde foe in his spirit richardson in his goldsmith in his at what moment did our fiction lose this privilege in what fatal hour did the young girl arise and seal the lips of fiction with a touch of her finger to some of the most vital interests of life  whether i wished to oppose them in their aspiration for greater freedom or whether i wished to encourage them i should begin to answer them by saying that the young girl has never done anything of the kind the manners of the novel have been improving with those of its readers that is all gentlemen no longer swear or fall drunk under the table or abduct young ladies and shut them up in lonely countryhouses or so habitually set about the ruin of their neighbors wives as they once did generally people now call a spade an agricultural implement they have not grown decent without having also grown a little squeamish but they have grown comparatively decent there is no doubt about that they require of a novelist whom they respect unquestionable proof of his seriousness if he proposes to deal with certain phases of life they require a sort of scientific decorum he can no longer expect to be received on the ground of entertainment only he assumes a higher function something like that of a physician or a priest and they expect him to be bound by laws as sacred as those of such professions they hold him solemnly pledged not to betray them or abuse their confidence if he will accept the conditions they give him their confidence and he may then treat to his greater honor and not at all to his disadvantage of such experiences such relations of men and women as george eliot treats in adam bede in daniel deronda in romola in almost all her books such as hawthorne treats in the scarlet letter such as dickens treats in david copperfield such as thackeray treats in pendennis and glances at in every one of his fictions such as most of the masters of english fiction have at same time treated more or less openly it is quite false or quite mistaken to suppose that our novels have left untouched these most important realities of life they have only not made them their stock in trade they have kept a true perspective in regard to them they have relegated them in their pictures of life to the space and place they occupy in life itself as we know it in england and america they have kept a correct proportion knowing perfectly well that unless the novel is to be a map with everything scrupulously laid down in it a faithful record of life in far the greater extent could be made to the exclusion of guilty love and all its circumstances and consequences  i justify them in this view not only because i hate what is cheap and meretricious and hold in peculiar loathing the cant of the critics who require passion as something in itself admirable and desirable in a novel but because i prize fidelity in the historian of feeling and character most of these critics who demand passion would seem to have no conception of any passion but one yet there are several other passions the passion of grief the passion of avarice the passion of pity the passion of ambition the passion of hate the passion of envy the passion of devotion the passion of friendship and all these have a greater part in the drama of life than the passion of love and infinitely greater than the passion of guilty love wittingly or unwittingly english fiction and american fiction have recognized this truth not fully not in the measure it merits but in greater degree than most other fiction     xxiv  who can deny that fiction would be incomparably stronger incomparably truer if once it could tear off the habit which enslaves it to the celebration chiefly of a single passion in one phase or another and could frankly dedicate itself to the service of all the passions all the interests all the facts every novelist who has thought about his art knows that it would and i think that upon reflection he must doubt whether his sphere would be greatly enlarged if he were allowed to treat freely the darker aspects of the favorite passion but as i have shown the privilege the right to do this is already perfectly recognized this is proved again by the fact that serious criticism recognizes as masterworks i will not push the question of supremacy the two great novels which above all others have moved the world by their study of guilty love if by any chance if by some prodigious miracle any american should now arise to treat it on the level of anna karenina and madame bovary he would be absolutely sure of success and of fame and gratitude as great as those books have won for their authors  but what editor of what american magazine would print such a story  certainly i do not think any one would and here our novelist must again submit to conditions if he wishes to publish such a story supposing him to have once written it he must publish it as a book a book is something by itself responsible for its character which becomes quickly known and it does not necessarily penetrate to every member of the household the father or the mother may say to the child i would rather you wouldnt read that book if the child cannot be trusted the book may be locked up but with the magazine and its serial the affair is different between the editor of a reputable english or american magazine and the families which receive it there is a tacit agreement that he will print nothing which a father may not read to his daughter or safely leave her to read herself  after all it is a matter of business and the insurgent novelist should consider the situation with coolness and commonsense the editor did not create the situation but it exists and he could not even attempt to change it without many sorts of disaster he respects it therefore with the good faith of an honest man even when he is himself a novelist with ardor for his art and impatience of the limitations put upon it he interposes his veto as thackeray did in the case of trollope when a contributor approaches forbidden ground  it does not avail to say that the daily papers teem with facts far fouler and deadlier than any which fiction could imagine that is true but it is true also that the sex which reads the most novels reads the fewest newspapers and besides the reporter does not command the novelists skill to fix impressions in a young girls mind or to suggest conjecture the magazine is a little despotic a little arbitrary but unquestionably its favor is essential to success and its conditions are not such narrow ones you cannot deal with tolstoys and flauberts subjects in the absolute artistic freedom of tolstoy and flaubert since de foe that is unknown among us but if you deal with them in the manner of george eliot of thackeray of dickens of society you may deal with them even in the magazines there is no other restriction upon you all the horrors and miseries and tortures are open to you your pages may drop blood sometimes it may happen that the editor will even exact such strong material from you but probably he will require nothing but the observance of the convention in question and if you do not yourself prefer bloodshed he will leave you free to use all sweet and peaceable means of interesting his readers  it is no narrow field he throws open to you with that little sign to keep off the grass up at one point only its vastness is still almost unexplored and whole regions in it are unknown to the fictionist dig anywhere and do but dig deep enough and you strike riches or if you are of the mind to range the gentler climes the softer temperatures the serener skies are all free to you and are so little visited that the chance of novelty is greater among them     xxv  while the americans have greatly excelled in the short story generally they have almost created a species of it in the thanksgiving story we have transplanted the christmas story from england while the thanksgiving story is native to our air but both are of anglosaxon growth their difference is from a difference of environment and the christmas story when naturalized among us becomes almost identical in motive incident and treatment with the thanksgiving story if i were to generalize a distinction between them i should say that the one dealt more with marvels and the other more with morals and yet the critic should beware of speaking too confidently on this point it is certain however that the christmas season is meteorologically more favorable to the effective return of persons long supposed lost at sea or from a prodigal life or from a darkened mind the longer darker and colder nights are better adapted to the apparition of ghosts and to all manner of signs and portents while they seem to present a wider field for the intervention of angels in behalf of orphans and outcasts the dreams of elderly sleepers at this time are apt to be such as will effect a lasting change in them when they awake turning them from the hard cruel and grasping habits of a lifetime and reconciling them to their sons daughters and nephews who have thwarted them in marriage or softening them to their meek uncomplaining wives whose hearts they have trampled upon in their reckless pursuit of wealth and generally disposing them to a distribution of hampers among the sick and poor and to a friendly reception of gentlemen with charity subscription papers  ships readily drive upon rocks in the early twilight and offer exciting difficulties of salvage and the heavy snows gather quickly round the steps of wanderers who lie down to die in them preparatory to their discovery and rescue by immediate relatives the midnight weather is also very suitable for encounter with murderers and burglars and the contrast of its freezing gloom with the light and cheer indoors promotes the gayeties which merge at all wellregulated countryhouses in love and marriage in the region of pure character no moment could be so available for flinging off the mask of frivolity or imbecility or savagery which one has worn for ten or twenty long years say for the purpose of foiling some villain and surprising the reader and helping the author out with his plot persons abroad in the alps or apennines or pyrenees or anywhere seeking shelter in the huts of shepherds or the dens of smugglers find no time like it for lying in a feigned slumber and listening to the whispered machinations of their suspicious looking entertainers and then suddenly starting up and fighting their way out or else springing from the real sleep into which they have sunk exhausted and finding it broad day and the good peasants whom they had so unjustly doubted waiting breakfast for them  we need not point out the superior advantages of the christmas season for anything one has a mind to do with the french revolution of the arctic explorations or the indian mutiny or the horrors of siberian exile there is no time so good for the use of this material and ghosts on shipboard are notoriously fond of christmas eve in our own logging camps the man who has gone into the woods for the winter after quarrelling with his wife then hears her sad appealing voice and is moved to good resolutions as at no other period of the year and in the mining regions first in california and later in colorado the hardened reprobate dying in his boots smells his mothers doughnuts and breathes his last in a soliloquized vision of the old home and the little brother or sister or the old father coming to meet him from heaven while his rude companions listen round him and dry their eyes on the butts of their revolvers  it has to be very grim all that to be truly effective and here already we have a touch in the americanized christmas story of the moralistic quality of the american thanksgiving story this was seldom written at first for the mere entertainment of the reader it was meant to entertain him of course but it was meant to edify him too and to improve him and some such intention is still present in it i rather think that it deals more probably with character to this end than its english cousin the christmas story does it is not so improbable that a man should leave off being a drunkard on thanksgiving as that he should leave off being a curmudgeon on christmas that he should conquer his appetite as that he should instantly change his nature by good resolutions he would be very likely indeed to break his resolutions in either case but not so likely in the one as in the other  generically the thanksgiving story is cheerfuller in its drama and simpler in its persons than the christmas story rarely has it dealt with the supernatural either the apparition of ghosts or the intervention of angels the weather being so much milder at the close of november than it is a month later very little can be done with the elements though on the coast a northeasterly storm has been and can be very usefully employed the thanksgiving story is more restricted in its range the scene is still mostly in new england and the characters are of new england extraction who come home from the west usually or new york for the event of the little drama whatever it may be it may be the reconciliation of kinsfolk who have quarrelled or the union of lovers long estranged or husbands and wives who have had hard words and parted or mothers who had thought their sons dead in california and find themselves agreeably disappointed in their return or fathers who for old times sake receive back their erring and conveniently dying daughters the notes are not many which this simple music sounds but they have a sabbath tone mostly and win the listener to kindlier thoughts and better moods the art is at its highest in some strong sketch of rose terry cookes or some perfectly satisfying study of miss jewetts or some graphic situation of miss wilkinss and then it is a very fine art but mostly it is poor and rude enough and makes openly shamelessly for the readers emotions as well as his morals it is inclined to be rather descriptive the turkey the pumpkin the cornfield figure throughout and the leafless woods are blue and cold against the evening sky behind the low hiproofed oldfashioned homestead the parlance is usually the yankee dialect and its western modifications  the thanksgiving story is mostly confined in scene to the country it does not seem possible to do much with it in town and it is a serious question whether with its geographical and topical limitations it can hold its own against the christmas story and whether it would not be well for authors to consider a combination with its elder rival  the two feasts are so near together in point of time that they could be easily covered by the sentiment of even a brief narrative under the agglutinated style of a thanksgivingchristmas story fiction appropriate to both could be produced and both could be employed naturally and probably in the transaction of its affairs and the development of its characters the plot for such a story could easily be made to include a totalabstinence pledge and family reunion at thanksgiving and an apparition and spiritual regeneration over a bowl of punch at christmas     xxvi  it would be interesting to know the far beginnings of holiday literature and i commend the quest to the scientific spirit which now specializes research in every branch of history in the mean time without being too confident of the facts i venture to suggest that it came in with the romantic movement about the beginning of this century when mountains ceased to be horrid and became picturesque when ruins of all sorts but particularly abbeys and castles became habitable to the most delicate constitutions when the despised gothick of addison dropped its k and arose the chivalrous and religious gothic of scott when ghosts were redeemed from the contempt into which they had fallen and resumed their place in polite society in fact the politer the society the welcomer the ghosts and whatever else was out of the common in that day the annual flourished and this artificial flower was probably the first literary blossom on the christmas tree which has since borne so much tinsel foliage and painted fruit but the annual was extremely oriental it was much preoccupied with haidees and gulnares and zuleikas with hindas and nourmahals owing to the distinction which byron and moore had given such ladies and when it began to concern itself with the actualities of british beauty the daughters of albion though inscribed with the names of real countesses and duchesses betrayed their descent from the wellknown eastern odalisques it was possibly through an american that holiday literature became distinctively english in material and washington irving with his new world love of the past may have given the impulse to the literary worship of christmas which has since so widely established itself a festival revived in popular interest by a newyorker to whom dutch associations with newyears had endeared the german ideal of christmas and whom the robust gayeties of the season in oldfashioned countryhouses had charmed would be one of those roundabout results which destiny likes and would at least be early english  if we cannot claim with all the patriotic confidence we should like to feel that it was irving who set christmas in that light in which dickens saw its aesthetic capabilities it is perhaps because all origins are obscure for anything that we positively know to the contrary the druidic rites from which english christmas borrowed the inviting mistletoe if not the decorative holly may have been accompanied by the recitations of holiday triads but it is certain that several plays of shakespeare were produced if not written for the celebration of the holidays and that then the black tide of puritanism which swept over mens souls blotted out all such observance of christmas with the festival itself it came in again by a natural reaction with the returning stuarts and throughout the period of the restoration it enjoyed a perfunctory favor there is mention of it often enough in the eighteenthcentury essayists in the spectators and idlers and tatlers but the world about the middle of the last century laments the neglect into which it had fallen irving seems to have been the first to observe its surviving rites lovingly and dickens divined its immense advantage as a literary occasion he made it in some sort entirely his for a time and there can be no question but it was he who again endeared it to the whole englishspeaking world and gave it a wider and deeper hold than it had ever had before upon the fancies and affections of our race  the might of that great talent no one can gainsay though in the light of the truer work which has since been done his literary principles seem almost as grotesque as his theories of political economy in no one direction was his erring force more felt than in the creation of holiday literature as we have known it for the last halfcentury creation of course is the wrong word it says too much but in default of a better word it may stand he did not make something out of nothing the material was there before him the mood and even the need of his time contributed immensely to his success as the volition of the subject helps on the mesmerist but it is within bounds to say that he was the chief agency in the development of holiday literature as we have known it as he was the chief agency in universalizing the great christian holiday as we now have it other agencies wrought with him and after him but it was he who rescued christmas from puritan distrust and humanized it and consecrated it to the hearts and homes of all  very rough magic as it now seems he used in working his miracle but there is no doubt about his working it one opens his christmas stories in this later daythe carol the chimes the haunted man the cricket on the hearth and all the restand with a heart highsorrowful and cloyed asks himself for the preternatural virtue that they once had the pathos appears false and strained the humor largely horseplay the character theatrical the joviality pumped the psychology commonplace the sociology alone funny it is a world of real clothes earth air water and the rest the people often speak the language of life but their motives are as disproportioned and improbable and their passions and purposes as overcharged as those of the worst of balzacs people yet all these monstrosities as they now appear seem to have once had symmetry and verity they moved the most cultivated intelligences of the time they touched true hearts they made everybody laugh and cry  this was perhaps because the imagination from having been fed mostly upon gross unrealities always responds readily to fantastic appeals there has been an amusing sort of awe of it as if it were the channel of inspired thought and were somehow sacred the most preposterous inventions of its activity have been regarded in their time as the greatest feats of the human mind and in its receptive form it has been nursed into an imbecility to which the truth is repugnant and the fact that the beautiful resides nowhere else is inconceivable it has been flattered out of all sufferance in its toyings with the mere elements of character and its attempts to present these in combinations foreign to experience are still praised by the poorer sort of critics as masterpieces of creative work  in the day of dickenss early christmas stories it was thought admirable for the author to take types of humanity which everybody knew and to add to them from his imagination till they were as strange as beasts and birds talking now we begin to feel that human nature is quite enough and that the best an author can do is to show it as it is but in those stories of his dickens said to his readers let us make believe soand so and the result was a joint juggle a childsplay in which the wholesome allegiance to life was lost artistically therefore the scheme was false and artistically therefore it must perish it did not perish however before it had propagated itself in a whole school of unrealities so ghastly that one can hardly recall without a shudder those sentimentalities at secondhand to which holiday literature was abandoned long after the original conjurer had wearied of his performance  under his own eye and of conscious purpose a circle of imitators grew up in the fabrication of christmas stories they obviously formed themselves upon his sobered ideals they collaborated with him and it was often hard to know whether it was dickens or sala or collins who was writing the christmas book had by that time lost its direct application to christmas it dealt with shipwrecks a good deal and with perilous adventures of all kinds and with unmerited suffering and with ghosts and mysteries because human nature secure from storm and danger in a welllighted room before a cheerful fire likes to have these things imaged for it and its longpuerilized fancy will bear an endless repetition of them the wizards who wrought their spells with them contented themselves with the lasting efficacy of these simple means and the apprenticewizards and journeymanwizards who have succeeded them practise the same arts at the old stand but the ethical intention which gave dignity to dickenss christmas stories of still earlier date has almost wholly disappeared it was a quality which could not be worked so long as the phantoms and hairbreadth escapes people always knew that character is not changed by a dream in a series of tableaux that a ghost cannot do much towards reforming an inordinately selfish person that a life cannot be turned white like a head of hair in a single night by the most allegorical apparition that want and sin and shame cannot be cured by kettles singing on the hob and gradually they ceased to make believe that there was virtue in these devices and appliances yet the ethical intention was not fruitless crude as it now appears  it was well once a year if not oftener to remind men by parable of the old simple truths to teach them that forgiveness and charity and the endeavor for life better and purer than each has lived are the principles upon which alone the world holds together and gets forward it was well for the comfortable and the refined to be put in mind of the savagery and suffering all round them and to be taught as dickens was always teaching that certain feelings which grace human nature as tenderness for the sick and helpless selfsacrifice and generosity selfrespect and manliness and womanliness are the common heritage of the race the direct gift of heaven shared equally by the rich and poor it did not necessarily detract from the value of the lesson that with the imperfect art of the time he made his paupers and porters not only human but superhuman and too altogether virtuous and it remained true that home life may be lovely under the lowliest roof although he liked to paint it without a shadow on its beauty there it is still a fact that the sick are very often saintly although he put no peevishness into their patience with their ills his ethical intention told for manhood and fraternity and tolerance and when this intention disappeared from the better holiday literature that literature was sensibly the poorer for the loss     xxvii  but if the humanitarian impulse has mostly disappeared from christmas fiction i think it has never so generally characterized all fiction one may refuse to recognize this impulse one may deny that it is in any greater degree shaping life than ever before but no one who has the current of literature under his eye can fail to note it there people are thinking and feeling generously if not living justly in our time it is a day of anxiety to be saved from the curse that is on selfishness of eager question how others shall be helped of bold denial that the conditions in which we would fain have rested are sacred or immutable especially in america where the race has gained a height never reached before the eminence enables more men than ever before to see how even here vast masses of men are sunk in misery that must grow every day more hopeless or embroiled in a struggle for mere life that must end in enslaving and imbruting them  art indeed is beginning to find out that if it does not make friends with need it must perish it perceives that to take itself from the many and leave them no joy in their work and to give itself to the few whom it can bring no joy in their idleness is an error that kills the men and women who do the hard work of the world have learned that they have a right to pleasure in their toil and that when justice is done them they will have it in all ages poetry has affirmed something of this sort but it remained for ours to perceive it and express it somehow in every form of literature but this is only one phase of the devotion of the best literature of our time to the service of humanity no book written with a low or cynical motive could succeed now no matter how brilliantly written and the work done in the past to the glorification of mere passion and power to the deification of self appears monstrous and hideous the romantic spirit worshipped genius worshipped heroism but at its best in such a man as victor hugo this spirit recognized the supreme claim of the lowest humanity its error was to idealize the victims of society to paint them impossibly virtuous and beautiful but truth which has succeeded to the highest mission of romance paints these victims as they are and bids the world consider them not because they are beautiful and virtuous but because they are ugly and vicious cruel filthy and only not altogether loathsome because the divine can never wholly die out of the human the truth does not find these victims among the poor alone among the hungry the houseless the ragged but it also finds them among the rich cursed with the aimlessness the satiety the despair of wealth wasting their lives in a fools paradise of shows and semblances with nothing real but the misery that comes of insincerity and selfishness  i do not think the fiction of our own time even always equal to this work or perhaps more than seldom so but as i once expressed to the longreverberating discontent of two continents fiction is now a finer art than it has been hitherto and more nearly meets the requirements of the infallible standard i have hopes of real usefulness in it because it is at last building on the only sure foundation but i am by no means certain that it will be the ultimate literary form or will remain as important as we believe it is destined to become on the contrary it is quite imaginable that when the great mass of readers now sunk in the foolish joys of mere fable shall be lifted to an interest in the meaning of things through the faithful portrayal of life in fiction then fiction the most faithful may be superseded by a still more faithful form of contemporaneous history i willingly leave the precise character of this form to the more robust imagination of readers whose minds have been nurtured upon romantic novels and who really have an imagination worth speaking of and confine myself as usual to the hither side of the regions of conjecture  the art which in the mean time disdains the office of teacher is one of the last refuges of the aristocratic spirit which is disappearing from politics and society and is now seeking to shelter itself in aesthetics the pride of caste is becoming the pride of taste but as before it is averse to the mass of men it consents to know them only in some conventionalized and artificial guise it seeks to withdraw itself to stand aloof to be distinguished and not to be identified democracy in literature is the reverse of all this it wishes to know and to tell the truth confident that consolation and delight are there it does not care to paint the marvellous and impossible for the vulgar many or to sentimentalize and falsify the actual for the vulgar few men are more like than unlike one another let us make them know one another better that they may be all humbled and strengthened with a sense of their fraternity neither arts nor letters nor sciences except as they somehow clearly or obscurely tend to make the race better and kinder are to be regarded as serious interests they are all lower than the rudest crafts that feed and house and clothe for except they do this office they are idle and they cannot do this except from and through the truth     pg editors bookmarks      a thanksgivingchristmas story
