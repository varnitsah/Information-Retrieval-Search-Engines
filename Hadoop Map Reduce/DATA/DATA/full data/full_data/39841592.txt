firm grasp and lowered him      sometimes the captain took him to palmstudded islands in the     southern seas      ’how could you have found them again’ inquired mr chalk with     the air of one propounding a poser      a small boy treading the same road      he ransacked an old lumberroom      selina vickers      he pops in and out of my office like a figure on a     cuckooclock      the others drew near and inspected it      all she says is she’s not afraid of you nor six like you      he waylaid him on several occasions to inquire into the     progress he was making      ’done with it’ repeated the girl in a startled voice      mr chalk entered leading mr stobell      he moved it out bodily and looked behind and beneath it      she stood face to face with the stern realities of life      he made out a girl’s head surmounted by a large hat      he passed his cup up for more coffee      ’this is a new client of mine’ said tredgold      mr tredgold prepared to draw up the required agreement      ’fine day gentlemen’ said the stranger as he raised his     glass      his three patrons with a hopeless attempt to appear     unconcerned were coming down the road      captain brisket waving farewells from the quay as they     embarked      mr vickers had been for a stroll with mr william russell      ’why you must have been stinting me for years’ continued mr     vickers      they were anxious for particulars      mr vickers rose and stood regarding the ignoble creature with     profound contempt      he became intent on a derelict punt      aided by mr tredgold and a peal of thunder she managed to     clamber over      she threw herself thoughtlessly into that famous old     chippendale chair      instructed their retainers to make untruthful statements as to     their whereabouts      you said to my husband ’the fair emily is yours’      the captain walked home deep in thought      mrs stobell      ’it wouldn’t be nice to be buried at sea’ remarked mr chalk      he pointed to a thin dismallooking man      there’s more in this than meets the eye      purchasing firearms with which he practised in the garden      mrs chalk stood by a pile of luggage discoursing to an     admiring circle of friends      a slight nautical roll      ’is it mutiny’ he faltered      she enacted to the great admiration of a small crowd the part     of a human semaphore      ’mr tredgold’ said a sharp voice from above      ’i never want to hear another word about that treasure as long     as i live’      he aimed hastily at a face which appeared there      ’it’s pointing towards me’ said the mate      he felt less heroic next morning      the captain and mr duckett discussed with great earnestness     the nature of the secret      ’i found ’im inside the horse and groom’ he said      selina was standing in front of mr tasker in the manner of a     small hen defending an overgrown chicken      ’i was going to ask him to give me a cup of tea’ he said      the ’fair emily’      he led the reluctant man as far from the helmsman as possible     and whispered the information      mr duckett took the helm      the ’fair emily’ had disappeared      mr chalk with the air of an old campaigner made a small fire     and prepared breakfast      her friend gazed long and mournfully at a large photograph of     mr stobell      miss vickers stood wiping her hands on her coarse apron      selina gives twopence on account      i told him that you would like to hear it      half binchester had congregated to welcome their     fellowtownsmen      ’halloa what do you want’ he inquired      ’it’ll be all right’ said brisket puffing at his cigar      then tredgold with his back to the others caught his eye and     frowned significantly      they stared solemnly up dialstone lane     chapter i     mr edward tredgold sat in the private office of tredgold and son land and estate agents gazing through the prim wire blinds at the peaceful high street of binchester tredgold senior who believed in work for the young had left early tredgold junior glad at an opportunity of sharing his father’s views had passed most of the work on to a clerk who had arrived in the world exactly three weeks after himself  binchester gets duller and duller said mr tredgold to himself wearily two skittish octogenarians one gloomy baby one gloomier nursemaid and three dogs in the last five minutes if it wasn’t for the dogs—halloa  he put down his pen and rising looked over the top of the blind at a girl who was glancing from side to side of the road as though in search of an address  a visitor continued mr tredgold critically girls like that only visit binchester and then take the first train back never to return  the girl turned at that moment and encountering the forehead and eyes gazed at them until they sank slowly behind the protection of the blind  she’s coming here said mr tredgold watching through the wire wants to see our timetable i expect  he sat down at the table again and taking up his pen took some papers from a pigeonhole and eyed them with severe thoughtfulness  a lady to see you sir said a clerk opening the door  mr tredgold rose and placed a chair  i have called for the key of the cottage in dialstone lane said the girl still standing my uncle captain bowers has not arrived yet and i am told that you are the landlord  mr tredgold bowed the next train is due at six he observed with a glance at the timetable hanging on the wall i expect he’ll come by that he was here on monday seeing the last of the furniture in are you miss drewitt  yes said the girl if you’ll kindly give me the key i can go in and wait for him  mr tredgold took it from a drawer if you will allow me i will go down with you he said slowly the lock is rather awkward for anybody who doesn’t understand it  the girl murmured something about not troubling him  it’s no trouble said mr tredgold taking up his hat it is our duty to do all we can for the comfort of our tenants that lock—  he held the door open and followed her into the street pointing out various objects of interest as they went along  i’m afraid you’ll find binchester very quiet he remarked  i like quiet said his companion  mr tredgold glanced at her shrewdly and pausing only at the jubilee horsetrough to point out beauties which might easily escape any but a trained observation walked on in silence until they reached their destination  except in the matter of windowblinds dialstone lane had not changed for generations and mr tredgold noted with pleasure the interest of his companion as she gazed at the crumbling roofs the redbrick doorsteps and the tiny lattice windows of the cottages at the last house a cottage larger than the rest one side of which bordered the old churchyard mr tredgold paused and inserting his key in the lock turned it with thoughtless ease  the lock seems all right i need not have bothered you said miss drewitt regarding him gravely  ah it seems easy said mr tredgold shaking his head but it wants knack  the girl closed the door smartly and turning the key opened it again without any difficulty to satisfy herself—on more points than one—she repeated the performance  you’ve got the knack said mr tredgold meeting her gaze with great calmness it’s extraordinary what a lot of character there is in locks they let some people open them without any trouble while others may fumble at them till they’re tired  the girl pushed the door open and stood just inside the room  thank you she said and gave him a little bow of dismissal  a vein of obstinacy in mr tredgold’s disposition which its owner mistook for firmness asserted itself it was plain that the girl had estimated his services at their true value and was quite willing to apprise him of the fact he tried the lock again and with more bitterness than the occasion seemed to warrant said that somebody had been oiling it  i promised captain bowers to come in this afternoon and see that a few odd things had been done he added may i come in now  the girl withdrew into the room and seating herself in a large armchair by the fireplace watched his inspection of doorknobs and windowfastenings with an air of grave amusement which he found somewhat trying  captain bowers had the walls panelled and these lockers made to make the room look as much like a ship’s cabin as possible he said pausing in his labours he was quite pleased to find the staircase opening out of the room—he calls it the companionladder and he calls the kitchen the pantry which led to a lot of confusion with the workmen did he tell you of the crow’snest in the garden  no said the girl  it’s a fine piece of work said mr tredgold  he opened the door leading into the kitchen and stepped out into the garden miss drewitt after a moment’s hesitation followed and after one delighted glance at the trim old garden gazed curiously at a mast with a barrel fixed near the top which stood at the end  there’s a fine view from up there said mr tredgold with the captain’s glass one can see the sea distinctly i spent nearly all last friday afternoon up there keeping an eye on things do you like the garden do you think these old creepers ought to be torn down from the house  certainly not said miss drewitt with emphasis  just what i said remarked mr tredgold  captain bowers wanted to have them pulled down but i dissuaded him i advised him to consult you first  i don’t suppose he really intended to said the girl  he did said the other grimly said they were untidy how do you like the way the house is furnished  the girl gazed at him for a few moments before replying i like it very much she said coldly  that’s right said mr tredgold with an air of relief you see i advised the captain what to buy i went with him to tollminster and helped him choose your room gave me the most anxiety i think  my room said the girl starting  it’s a dream in the best shades of pink and green said mr tredgold modestly pink on the walls and carpets and hangings green three or four bits of old furniture—the captain objected but i stood firm and for pictures i had two or three little things out of an art journal framed  is furnishing part of your business inquired the girl eyeing him in bewilderment  business said the other oh no i did it for amusement i chose and the captain paid it was a delightful experience the sordid question of price was waived for once expense was nothing to me i wish you’d just step up to your room and see how you like it it’s the one over the kitchen  miss drewitt hesitated and then curiosity combined with a cheerful idea of probably being able to disapprove of the lauded decorations took her indoors and upstairs in a few minutes she came down again  i suppose it’s all right she said ungraciously but i don’t understand why you should have selected it  i had to said mr tredgold confidentially i happened to go to tollminster the same day as the captain and went into a shop with him if you could only see the things he wanted to buy you would understand  the girl was silent  the paper the captain selected for your room continued mr tredgold severely was decorated with branches of an unknown flowering shrub on the top twig of which a hummingbird sat eating a dragonfly a rough calculation showed me that every time you opened your eyes in the morning you would see fiftyseven hummingbirdsall made in the same patterneating fiftyseven ditto dragonflies the captain said it was cheerful  i have no doubt that my uncle’s selection would have satisfied me said miss drewitt coldly  the curtains he fancied were red with small yellow tigers crouching all over them pursued mr tredgold the captain seemed fond of animals  i think that you were rather—venturesome said the girl suppose that i had not liked the things you selected  mr tredgold deliberated i felt sure that you would like them he said at last it was a hard struggle not to keep some of the things for myself i’ve had my eye on those two chippendale chairs for years they belonged to an old woman in mint street but she always refused to part with them i shouldn’t have got them only one of them let her down the other day  let her down repeated miss drewitt sharply do you mean one of the chairs in my bedroom  mr tredgold nodded gave her rather a nasty fall he said i struck while the iron was hot and went and made her an offer while she was still laid up from the effects of it it’s the one standing against the wall the other’s all right with proper care  miss drewitt after a somewhat long interval thanked him  you must have been very useful to my uncle she said slowly i feel sure that he would never have bought chairs like those of his own accord  he has been at sea all his life said mr tredgold in extenuation you haven’t seen him for a long time have you  ten years was the reply  he is delightful company said mr tredgold his life has been one long series of adventures in every quarter of the globe his stock of yarns is like the widow’s cruse and here he comes he added as a dilapidated fly drew up at the house and an elderly man with a red weatherbeaten face partly hidden in a cloud of grey beard stepped out and stood in the doorway regarding the girl with something almost akin to embarrassment  it’s not—not prudence he said at length holding out his hand and staring at her  yes uncle said the girl  they shook hands and captain bowers reaching up for a cage containing a parrot which had been noisily entreating the cabman for a kiss all the way from the station handed that flustered person his fare and entered the house again  glad to see you my lad he said shaking hands with mr tredgold and glancing covertly at his niece i hope you haven’t been waiting long he added turning to the latter  no said miss drewitt regarding him with a puzzled air  i missed the train said the captain we must try and manage better next time i—i hope you’ll be comfortable  thank you said the girl  you—you are very like your poor mother said the captain  i hope so said prudence  she stole up to the captain and after a moment’s hesitation kissed his cheek the next moment she was caught up and crushed in the arms of a powerful and affectionate bear  blest if i hardly knew how to take you at first said the captain his red face shining with gratification little girls are one thing but when they grow up into—he held her away and looked at her proudly— into handsome and dignifiedlooking young women a man doesn’t quite know where he is he took her in his arms again and kissing her forehead winked delightedly in the direction of mr tredgold who was affecting to look out of the window  my man’ll be in soon he said releasing the girl and then we’ll see about some tea he met me at the station and i sent him straight off for things to eat  your man said miss drewitt  yes i thought a man would be easier to manage than a girl said the captain knowingly you can be freer with ’em in the matter of language and then there’s no followers or anything of that kind i got him to sign articles shipshape and proper mr tredgold recommended him  no no said that gentleman hastily  i asked you before he signed on with me said the captain pointing a stumpy forefinger at him i made a point of it and you told me that you had never heard anything against him  i don’t call that a recommendation said mr tredgold  it’s good enough in these days retorted the captain gloomily a man that has got a character like that is hard to find  he might be artful and keep his faults to himself suggested tredgold  so long as he does that it’s all right said captain bowers i can’t find fault if there’s no faults to find fault with the best steward i ever had i found out afterwards had escaped from gaol he never wanted to go ashore and when the ship was in port almost lived in his pantry  i never heard of tasker having been in gaol said mr tredgold anyhow i’m certain that he never broke out of one he’s far too stupid  as he paid this tribute the young man referred to entered laden with parcels and gazing awkwardly at the company passed through the room on tiptoe and began to busy himself in the pantry mr tredgold refusing the captain’s invitation to stay for a cup of tea took his departure  very nice youngster that said the captain looking after him a little bit lighthearted in his ways perhaps but none the worse for that  he sat down and looked round at his possessions the first real home i’ve had for nearly fifty years he said with great content i hope you’ll be as happy here as i intend to be it sha’n’t be my fault if you’re not  mr tredgold walked home deep in thought and by the time he had arrived there had come to the conclusion that if miss drewitt favoured her mother that lady must have been singularly unlike captain bowers in features     chapter ii     in less than a week captain bowers had settled down comfortably in his new command a set of rules and regulations by which mr joseph tasker was to order his life was framed and hung in the pantry he studied it with care and anxious that there should be no possible chance of a misunderstanding questioned the spelling in three instances the captain’s explanation that he had spelt those words in the american style was an untruthful reflection upon a great and friendly nation  dialstone lane was at first disposed to look askance at mr tasker oldfashioned matrons clustered round to watch him cleaning the doorstep and surprised at its whiteness withdrew discomfited rumour had it that he liked work and scandal said that he had wept because he was not allowed to do the washing  the captain attributed this satisfactory condition of affairs to the rules and regulations though a slight indiscretion on the part of mr tasker necessitating the unframing of the document to add to the latter caused him a little annoyance  the first intimation he had of it was a loud knocking at the front door as he sat dozing one afternoon in his easychair in response to his startled cry of come in the door opened and a small man in a state of considerable agitation burst into the room and confronted him  my name is chalk he said breathlessly  a friend of mr tredgold’s said the captain i’ve heard of you sir  the visitor paid no heed  my wife wishes to know whether she has got to dress in the dark every afternoon for the rest of her life he said in fierce but trembling tones  got to dress in the dark repeated the astonished captain  with the blind down explained the other  captain bowers looked him up and down he saw a man of about fifty nervously fingering the little bits of fluffy red whisker which grew at the sides of his face and trying to still the agitation of his tremulous mouth  how would you like it yourself demanded the visitor whose manner was gradually becoming milder and milder how would you like a telescope a yard long pointing—  he broke off abruptly as the captain with a smothered oath dashed out of his chair into the garden and stood shaking his fist at the crow’snest at the bottom  joseph he bawled  yes sir said mr tasker removing the telescope described by mr chalk from his eye and leaning over  what are you doing with that spyglass demanded his master beckoning to the visitor who had drawn near how dare you stare in at people’s windows  i wasn’t sir replied mr tasker in an injured voice i wouldn’t think o’ such a thing—i couldn’t not if i tried  you’d got it pointed straight at my bedroom window cried mr chalk as he accompanied the captain down the garden and it ain’t the first time  i wasn’t sir said the steward addressing his master i was watching the martins under the eaves  you’d got it pointed at my window persisted the visitor  that’s where the nests are said mr tasker but i wasn’t looking in at the window besides i noticed you always pulled the blind down when you saw me looking so i thought it didn’t matter  we can’t do anything without being followed about by that telescope said mr chalk turning to the captain my wife had our house built where it is on purpose so that we shouldn’t be overlooked we didn’t bargain for a thing like that sprouting up in a backgarden  i’m very sorry said the captain i wish you’d told me of it before if i catch you up there again he cried shaking his fist at mr tasker you’ll remember it come down  mr tasker placing the glass under his arm came slowly and reluctantly down the ratlines  i wasn’t looking in at the window mr chalk he said earnestly i was watching the birds o’ course i couldn’t help seeing in a bit but i always shifted the spyglass at once if there was anything that i thought i oughtn’t—  that’ll do broke in the captain hastily go in and get the tea ready if i so much as see you looking at that glass again we part my lad mind that  i don’t suppose he meant any harm said the mollified mr chalk after the crestfallen joseph had gone into the house i hope i haven’t been and said too much but my wife insisted on me coming round and speaking about it  you did quite right said the captain and i thank you for coming i told him he might go up there occasionally but i particularly warned him against giving any annoyance to the neighbours  i suppose said mr chalk gazing at the erection with interest—i suppose there’s a good view from up there it’s like having a ship in the garden and it seems to remind you of the north pole and whales and northern lights  five minutes later mr tasker peering through the pantry window was surprised to see mr chalk ascending with infinite caution to the crow’snest his high hat was jammed firmly over his brows and the telescope was gripped tightly under his right arm the journey was evidently regarded as one of extreme peril by the climber but he held on gallantly and arrived at the top turned a tremulous telescope on to the horizon  mr tasker took a deep breath and resumed his labours he set the table and when the water boiled made the tea and went down the garden to announce the fact mr chalk was still up aloft and even at that height the pallor of his face was clearly discernible it was evident to the couple below that the terrors of the descent were too much for him but that he was too proud to say so  nice view up there called the captain  b—b—beautiful cried mr chalk with an attempt at enthusiasm  the captain paced up and down impatiently his tea was getting cold but the forlorn figure aloft made no sign the captain waited a little longer and then laying hold of the shrouds slowly mounted until his head was above the platform  shall i take the glass for you he inquired  mr chalk clutching the edge of the cask leaned over and handed it down  my—my foot’s gone to sleep he stammered  ho well you must be careful how you get down said the captain climbing on to the platform now gently  he put the telescope back into the cask and beckoning mr tasker to ascend took mr chalk in a firm grasp and lowered him until he was able to reach mr tasker’s face with his foot after that the descent was easy and mr chalk reaching ground once more spent two or three minutes in slapping and rubing and other remedies prescribed for sleepy feet  there’s few gentlemen that would have come down at all with their foot asleep remarked mr tasker pocketing a shilling when the captain’s back was turned  mr chalk still pale and shaking somewhat smiled feebly and followed the captain into the house the latter offered a cup of tea which the visitor after a faint protest accepted and taking a seat at the table gazed in undisguised admiration at the nautical appearance of the room  i could fancy myself aboard ship he declared  are you fond of the sea inquired the captain  i love it said mr chalk fervently it was always my idea from a boy to go to sea but somehow i didn’t i went into my father’s business instead but i never liked it some people are fond of a stayathome life but i always had a hankering after adventures  the captain shook his head ha he said impressively  you’ve had a few in your time said mr chalk looking at him grudgingly edward tredgold was telling me so  man and boy i was at sea fortynine years remarked the captain naturally things happened in that time it would have been odd if they hadn’t it’s all in a lifetime  some lifetimes said mr chalk gloomily i’m fiftyone next year and the only thing i ever had happen to me was seeing a man stop a runaway horse and cart  he shook his head solemnly over his monotonous career and gazing at a warclub from samoa which hung over the fireplace put a few leading questions to the captain concerning the manner in which it came into his possession when prudence came in half an hour later he was still sitting there listening with rapt attention to his host’s tales of distant seas  it was the first of many visits sometimes he brought mr tredgold and sometimes mr tredgold brought him the terrors of the crow’snest vanished before his persevering attacks and perched there with the captain’s glass he swept the landscape with the air of an explorer surveying a strange and hostile country  it was a fitting prelude to the captain’s tales afterwards and mr chalk with the stem of his long pipe withdrawn from his open mouth would sit enthralled as his host narrated picturesque incidents of hairbreadth escapes or drawing his chair to the table made rough maps for his listener’s clearer understanding sometimes the captain took him to palmstudded islands in the southern seas sometimes to the ancient worlds of china and japan he became an expert in nautical terms he walked in knots and even ordered a new carpet in fathoms—after the shopkeeper had demonstrated by means of his little boy’s arithmetic book the difference between that measurement and a furlong  i’ll have a voyage before i’m much older he remarked one afternoon as he sat in the captain’s sittingroom since i retired from business time hangs very heavy sometimes i’ve got a fancy for a small yacht but i suppose i couldn’t go a long voyage in a small one  smaller the better said edward tredgold who was sitting by the window watching miss drewitt sewing  mr chalk took his pipe from his mouth and eyed him inquiringly  less to lose explained mr tredgold with a scarcely perceptible glance at the captain look at the dangers you’d be dragging your craft into chalk there would be no satisfying you with a quiet cruise in the mediterranean  i shouldn’t run into unnecessary danger said mr chalk seriously i’m a married man and there’s my wife to think of what would become of her if anything happened to me  why you’ve got plenty of money to leave haven’t you inquired mr tredgold  i was thinking of her losing me replied mr chalk with a touch of acerbity  oh i didn’t think of that said the other yes to be sure  captain bowers was telling me the other day of a woman who wore widow’s weeds for thirtyfive years said mr chalk impressively and all the time her husband was married again and got a big family in australia there’s nothing in the world so faithful as a woman’s heart  well if you’re lost on a cruise i shall know where to look for you said mr tredgold but i don’t think the captain ought to put such ideas into your head  mr chalk looked bewildered then he scratched his left whisker with the stem of his churchwarden pipe and looked severely over at mr tredgold  i don’t think you ought to talk that way before ladies he said primly of course i know you’re only in joke but there’s some people can’t see jokes as quick as others and they might get a wrong idea of you  what part did you think of going to for your cruise interposed captain bowers  there’s nothing settled yet said mr chalk it’s just an idea that’s all i was talking to your father the other day he added turning to mr tredgold just sounding him so to speak  you take him said that dutiful son briskly it would do him a world of good me too  he said he couldn’t afford either the time or the money said mr chalk the thing to do would be to combine business with pleasure—to take a yacht and find a sunken galleon loaded with gold pieces i’ve heard of such things being done  i’ve heard of it said the captain nodding  bottom of the ocean must be paved with them in places said mr tredgold rising and following miss drewitt who had gone into the garden to plant seeds  mr chalk refilled his pipe and accepting a match from the captain smoked slowly his gaze was fixed on the window but instead of dialstone lane he saw tumbling blue seas and islets far away  that’s something you’ve never come across i suppose captain bowers he remarked at last  no said the other  mr chalk with a vain attempt to conceal his disappointment smoked on for some time in silence the blue seas disappeared and he saw instead the brass knocker of the house opposite  nor any other kind of craft with treasure aboard i suppose he suggested at last  the captain put his hands on his knees and stared at the floor no he said slowly i can’t call to mind any craft but it’s odd that you should have got on this subject with me  mr chalk laid his pipe carefully on the table  why he inquired  well said the captain with a short laugh it is odd that’s all  mr chalk fidgeted with the stem of his pipe you know of sunken treasure somewhere he said eagerly  the captain smiled and shook his head the other watched him narrowly  you know of some treasure he said with conviction  not what you could call sunken said the captain driven to bay  mr chalk’s paleblue eyes opened to their fullest extent ingots he queried  the other shook his head it’s a secret he remarked we won’t talk about it  yes of course naturally i don’t expect you to tell me where it is said mr chalk but i thought it might be interesting to hear about that’s all  it’s buried said the captain after a long pause i don’t know that there’s any harm in telling you that buried in a small island in the south pacific  have you seen it inquired mr chalk  i buried it rejoined the other  mr chalk sank back in his chair and regarded him with awestruck attention captain bowers slowly ramming home a charge of tobacco with his thumb smiled quietly  buried it he repeated musingly with the blade of an oar for a spade it was a long job but it’s six foot down and the dead man it belonged to atop of it  the pipe fell from the listener’s fingers and smashed unheeded on the floor  you ought to make a book of it he said at last  the captain shook his head i haven’t got the gift of storytelling he said simply besides you can understand i don’t want it noised about people might bother me  he leaned back in his chair and bunched his beard in his hand the other watching him closely saw that his thoughts were busy with some scene in his stirring past  not a friend of yours i hope said mr chalk at last  who inquired the captain starting from his reverie  the dead man atop of the treasure replied the other  no said the captain briefly  is it worth much asked mr chalk  roughly speaking about half a million responded the captain calmly  mr chalk rose and walked up and down the room his eyes were bright and his face pinker than usual  why don’t you get it he demanded at last pausing in front of his host  why it ain’t mine said the captain staring d’ye think i’m a thief  mr chalk stared in his turn but who does it belong to then he inquired  i don’t know replied the captain all i know is it isn’t mine and that’s enough for me whether it was rightly come by i don’t know there it is and there it’ll stay till the crack of doom  don’t you know any of his relations or friends persisted the other  i know nothing of him except his name said the captain and i doubt if even that was his right one don silvio he called himself—a spaniard it’s over ten years ago since it happened my ship had been bought by a firm in sydney and while i was waiting out there i went for a little run on a schooner among the islands this don silvio was aboard of her as a passenger she went to pieces in a gale and we were the only two saved the others were washed overboard but we got ashore in the boat and i thought from the trouble he was taking over his bag that the danger had turned his brain  ah said the keenly interested mr chalk  he was a sick man aboard ship continued the captain and i soon saw that he hadn’t saved his life for long he saw it too and before he died he made me promise that the bag should be buried with him and never disturbed after i’d promised he opened the bag and showed me what was in it it was full of precious stones—diamonds rubies and the like some of them as large as birds’ eggs i can see him now propped up against the boat and playing with them in the sunlight they blazed like stars half a million he put them at or more  what good could they be to him when he was dead inquired the listener  captain bowers shook his head that was his business not mine he replied it was nothing to do with me when he died i dug a grave for him as i told you with a bit of a broken oar and laid him and the bag together a month afterwards i was taken off by a passing schooner and landed safe at sydney  mr chalk stopped and mechanically picking up the pieces of his pipe placed them on the table  suppose that you had heard afterwards that the things had been stolen he remarked  if i had then i should have given information i think said the other it all depends  ah but how could you have found them again inquired mr chalk with the air of one propounding a poser  with my map said the captain slowly before i left i made a map of the island and got its position from the schooner that picked me up but i never heard a word from that day to this  could you find them now said mr chalk  why not said the captain with a short laugh the island hasn’t run away  he rose as he spoke and tossing the fragments of his visitor’s pipe into the fireplace invited him to take a turn in the garden mr chalk after a feeble attempt to discuss the matter further reluctantly obeyed     chapter iii     mr chalk with his mind full of the story he had just heard walked homewards like a man in a dream the air was fragrant with spring and the scent of lilac revived memories almost forgotten it took him back forty years and showed him a small boy treading the same road passing the same houses nothing had changed so much as the small boy himself nothing had been so unlike the life he had pictured as the life he had led even the blamelessness of the latter yielded no comfort it savoured of a lack of spirit  his mind was still busy with the past when he reached home mrs chalk a woman of imposing appearance who was sitting by the window at needlework looked up sharply at his entrance before she spoke he had a dim idea that she was excited about something  i’ve got her she said triumphantly  oh said mr chalk  she didn’t want to come at first said mrs chalk she’d half promised to go to mrs morris mrs morris had heard of her through harris the grocer and he only knew she was out of a place by accident he—  her words fell on deaf ears mr chalk gazing through the window heard without comprehending a long account of the capture of a new housemaid which slightly altered as to name and place would have passed muster as an exciting contest between a skilful angler and a particularly sulky salmon mrs chalk noticing his inattention at last pulled up sharply  you’re not listening she cried  yes i am go on my dear said mr chalk  what did i say she left her last place for then demanded the lady  mr chalk started he had been conscious of his wife’s voice and that was all you said you were not surprised at her leaving he replied slowly the only wonder to you was that a decent girl should have stayed there so long  mrs chalk started and bit her lip yes she said slowly yees go on anything else  you said the house wanted cleaning from top to bottom said the painstaking mr chalk  go on said his wife in a smothered voice what else did i say  said you pitied the husband continued mr chalk thoughtfully  mrs chalk rose suddenly and stood over him mr chalk tried desperately to collect his faculties  how dare you she gasped i’ve never said such things in my life never and i said that she left because mr wilson her master was dead and the family had gone to london i’ve never been near the house so how could i say such things  mr chalk remained silent  what made you think of such things persisted mrs chalk  mr chalk shook his head no satisfactory reply was possible my thoughts were far away he said at last  his wife bridled and said oh indeed mr chalk’s mother dead some ten years before had taken a strange pride—possibly as a protest against her only son’s appearance—in hinting darkly at a stormy and chequered past pressed for details she became more mysterious still and saying that she knew what she knew declined to be deprived of the knowledge under any consideration she also informed her daughterinlaw that what the eye don’t see the heart don’t grieve and that it was better to let bygones be bygones usually winding up with the advice to the younger woman to keep her eye on mr chalk without letting him see it  peckham rye is a long way off certainly added the indignant mrs chalk after a pause it’s a pity you haven’t got something better to think of at your time of life too  mr chalk flushed peckham rye was one of the nuisances bequeathed by his mother  i was thinking of the sea he said loftily  mrs chalk pounced oh yarmouth she said with withering scorn  mr chalk flushed deeper than before i wasn’t thinking of such things he declared  what things said his wife swiftly  the—the things you’re alluding to said the harassed mr chalk  ah said his wife with a toss of her head why you should get red in the face and confused when i say peckham rye and yarmouth are a long way off is best known to yourself it’s very funny that the moment either of these places is mentioned you get uncomfortable people might read a geographybook out loud in my presence and it wouldn’t affect me  she swept out of the room and mr chalk’s thoughts excited by the magic word geography went back to the island again the halfforgotten dreams of his youth appeared to be materializing sleepy binchester ended for him at dialstone lane and once inside the captain’s room the enchanted world beyond the seas was spread before his eager gaze the captain amused at first at his enthusiasm began to get weary of the subject of the island and so far the visitor had begged in vain for a glimpse of the map  his enthusiasm became contagious prudence entering one evening in the middle of a conversation heard sufficient to induce her to ask for more and the captain not without some reluctance and several promptings from mr chalk when he showed signs of omitting vital points related the story edward tredgold heard it and judging by the frequency of his visits was almost as interested as mr chalk  i can’t see that there could be any harm in just looking at the map said mr chalk one evening you could keep your thumb on any part you wanted to  then we should know where to dig urged mr tredgold properly managed there ought to be a fortune in your innocence chalk  mr chalk eyed him fixedly seeing that the latitude and longitude and all the directions are written on the back he observed with cold dignity i don’t see the force of your remarks  well in that case why not show it to mr chalk uncle said prudence charitably  captain bowers began to show signs of annoyance well my dear he began slowly  then miss drewitt could see it too said mr tredgold blandly  miss drewitt reddened with indignation i could see it any time i wished she said sharply  well wish now entreated mr tredgold as a matter of fact i’m dying with curiosity myself bring it out and make it crackle captain it’s a banknote for half a million  the captain shook his head and a slight frown marred his usually amiable features he got up and turning his back on them filled his pipe from a jar on the mantelpiece  you never will see it chalk said edward tredgold in tones of much conviction i’ll bet you two to one in golden sovereigns that you’ll sink into your honoured family vault with your justifiable curiosity still unsatisfied and i shouldn’t wonder if your perturbed spirit walks the captain’s bedroom afterwards  miss drewitt looked up and eyed the speaker with scornful comprehension take the bet mr chalk she said slowly  mr chalk turned in hopeful amaze then he leaned over and shook hands solemnly with mr tredgold i’ll take the bet he said  uncle will show it to you to please me announced prudence in a clear voice won’t you uncle  the captain turned and took the matches from the table certainly my dear if i can find it he said in a hesitating fashion but i’m afraid i’ve mislaid it i haven’t seen it since i unpacked  mislaid it ejaculated the startled mr chalk good heavens suppose somebody should find it what about your word to don silvio then  i’ve got it somewhere said the captain brusquely i’ll have a hunt for it all the same i don’t know that it’s quite fair to interfere in a bet  miss drewitt waved the objection away remarking that people who made bets must risk losing their money  i’ll begin to save up said mr tredgold with a lightness which was not lost upon miss drewitt the captain has got to find it before you can see it chalk  mr chalk with a satisfied smile said that when the captain promised a thing it was as good as done  for the next few days he waited patiently and ransacking an old lumberroom divided his time pretty equally between a volume of captain cook’s voyages that he found there and famous shipwrecks by this means and the exercise of great selfcontrol he ceased from troubling dialstone lane for a week even then it was edward tredgold who took him there the latter was in high spirits and in explanation informed the company with a cheerful smile that he had saved five and ninepence and was forming habits which bade fair to make him a rich man in time  don’t you be in too much of a hurry to find that map captain he said  it’s found said miss drewitt with a little note of triumph in her voice  found it this morning said captain bowers he crossed over to an oak bureau which stood in the corner by the fireplace and taking a paper from a pigeonhole slowly unfolded it and spread it on the table before the delighted mr chalk miss drewitt and edward tredgold advanced to the table and eyed it curiously  the map which was drawn in leadpencil was on a piece of ruled paper yellow with age and cracked in the folds the island was in shape a rough oval the coastline being broken by small bays and headlands mr chalk eyed it with all the fervour usually bestowed on a holy relic and breathlessly reading off such terms as cape silvio bowers bay and mount lonesome gazed with breathless interest at the discoverer  and is that the grave he inquired in a trembling voice pointing to a mark in the northeast corner  the captain removed it with his fingernail no he said briefly for full details see the other side  for one moment mr chalk hoped then his face fell as captain bowers displaying for a fraction of a second the writing on the other side took up the map and replacing it in the bureau turned the key in the lock and with a low laugh resumed his seat miss drewitt glancing over at edward tredgold saw that he looked very thoughtful  you’ve lost your bet she said pointedly  i know was the reply  his gaiety had vanished and he looked so dejected that miss drewitt was reminded of the ruined gambler in a celebrated picture she tried to quiet her conscience by hoping that it would be a lesson to him as she watched mr tredgold dived into his left trouserpocket and counted out some coins mostly brown to these he added a few small pieces of silver gleaned from his waistcoat and then after a few seconds’ moody thought found a few more in the other trouserpocket  eleven and tenpence he said mechanically  any time said mr chalk regarding him with awkward surprise any time  give him an i o u said captain bowers fidgeting  yes any time repeated mr chalk i’m in no hurry  no i’d sooner pay now and get it over said the other still fumbling in his pockets as miss drewitt says people who make bets must be prepared to lose i thought i had more than this  there was an embarrassing silence during which miss drewitt who had turned very red felt strangely uncomfortable she felt more uncomfortable still when mr tredgold discovering a banknote and a little collection of gold coins in another pocket artlessly expressed his joy at the discovery the simpleminded captain and mr chalk both experienced a sense of relief miss drewitt sat and simmered in helpless indignation  you’re careless in money matters my lad said the captain reprovingly  i couldn’t understand him making all that fuss over a couple o’ pounds said mr chalk looking round he’s very free as a rule too free  mr tredgold sitting grave and silent made no reply to these charges and the girl was the only one to notice a faint twitching at the corners of his mouth she saw it distinctly despite the fact that her clear grey eyes were fixed dreamily on a spot some distance above his head  she sat in her room upstairs after the visitors had gone thinking it over the light was fading fast and as she sat at the open window the remembrance of mr tredgold’s conduct helped to mar one of the most perfect evenings she had ever known  downstairs the captain was also thinking dialstone lane was in shadow and already one or two lamps were lit behind drawn blinds a little chatter of voices at the end of the lane floated in at the open window mellowed by distance his pipe was out and he rose to search in the gloom for a match when another murmur of voices reached his ears from the kitchen he stood still and listened intently to put matters beyond all doubt the shrill laugh of a girl was plainly audible the captain’s face hardened and crossing to the fireplace he rang the bell  yessir said joseph as he appeared and closed the door carefully behind him  what are you talking to yourself in that absurd manner for inquired the captain with great dignity  me sir said mr tasker feebly  yes you repeated the captain noticing with surprise that the door was slowly opening  mr tasker gazed at him in a troubled fashion but made no reply  i won’t have it said the captain sternly with a side glance at the door if you want to talk to yourself go outside and do it i never heard such a laugh what did you do it for it was like an old woman with a bad cold  he smiled grimly in the darkness and then started slightly as a cough a hostile challenging cough sounded from the kitchen before he could speak the cough ceased and a thin voice broke carelessly into song  what roared the captain in wellfeigned astonishment do you mean to tell me you’ve got somebody in my pantry go and get me those rules and regulations  mr tasker backed out and the captain smiled again as he heard a whispered discussion then a voice clear and distinct took command i’ll take’em in myself i tell you it said i’ll rules and regulations him  the smile faded from the captain’s face and he gazed in perplexity at the door as a strange young woman bounced into the room  here’s your rules and regulations said the intruder in a somewhat shrewish voice you’d better light the lamp if you want to see’em though the spelling ain’t so noticeable in the dark  the impressiveness of the captain’s gaze was wasted in the darkness for a moment he hesitated and then with the dignity of a man whose spelling has nothing to conceal struck a match and lit the lamp the lamp lighted he lowered the blind and then seating himself by the window turned with a majestic air to a thin slip of a girl with towcoloured hair who stood by the door  who are you he demanded gruffly  my name’s vickers said the young lady selina vickers i heard all what you’ve been saying to my joseph but thank goodness i can take my own part i don’t want nobody to fight my battles for me if you’ve got anything to say about my voice you can say it to my face  captain bowers sat back and regarded her with impressive dignity miss vickers met his gaze calmly and with a pair of unwinking green eyes stared him down  what were you doing in my pantry demanded the captain at last  i was in your kitchen replied miss vickers with scornful emphasis on the last word to see my young man  well i can’t have you there said the captain with a mildness that surprised himself one of my rules—  miss vickers interposed i’ve read’em all over and over again she said impatiently  if it occurs again said the other i shall have to speak to joseph very seriously about it  talk to me said miss vickers sharply that’s what i come in for i can talk to you better than what joseph can i know what harm do you think i was doing your old kitchen don’t you try and interfere between me and my joseph because i won’t have it you’re not married yourself and you don’t want other people to be how do you suppose the world would get on if everybody was like you  captain bowers regarded her in openeyed perplexity the door leading to the garden had just closed behind the valiant joseph and he stared with growing uneasiness at the slight figure of miss vickers as it stood poised for further oratorical efforts before he could speak she gave her lips a rapid lick and started again  you’re one of those people that don’t like to see others happy that’s what you are she said rapidly i wasn’t hurting your kitchen and as to talking and laughing there—what do you think my tongue was given to me for show p’r’aps if you’d been doing a day’s hard work you’d—  look here my girl— began the captain desperately  don’t you my girl me please interrupted miss vickers i’m not your girl thank goodness if i was you’d be a bit different i can tell you if you had any girls you’d know better than to try and come between them and their young men besides they wouldn’t let you when a girl’s got a young man—  the captain rose and went through the form of ringing the bell miss vickers watched him calmly  i thought i’d just have it out with you for once and for all she continued i told joseph that i’d no doubt your bark was worse than your bite and what he can see to be afraid of in you i can’t think nervous disposition i s’pose good evening  she gave her head a little toss and returning to the pantry closed the door after her captain bowers still somewhat dazed returned to his chair and gazing at the rules which still lay on the table grinned feebly in his beard     chapter iv     to keep such a romance to himself was beyond the powers of mr chalk the captain had made no conditions as to secrecy and he therefore considered himself free to indulge in hints to his two greatest friends which caused those gentlemen to entertain some doubts as to his sanity mr robert stobell whose work as a contractor had left a permanent and unmistakable mark upon binchester became imbued with a hazy idea that mr chalk had invented a new process of making large diamonds mr jasper tredgold on the other hand arrived at the conclusion that a highly respectable burglar was offering for some reason to share his loot with him a conversation between messrs stobell and tredgold in the high street only made matters more complicated  chalk always was fond of making mysteries of things complained mr tredgold  mr stobell whose habit was taciturn and ruminative fixed his dull brown eyes on the ground and thought it over i believe it’s all my eye and betty martin he said at length quoting a saying which had been used in his family as an expression of disbelief since the time of his greatgrandmother  he comes in to see me when i’m hard at work and drops hints pursued his friend when i stop to pick’em up out he goes yesterday he came in and asked me what i thought of a man who wouldn’t break his word for half a million half a million mind you i just asked him who it was and out he went again he pops in and out of my office like a figure on a cuckooclock  mr stobell relapsed into thought again but no gleam of expression disturbed the lines of his heavy face mr tredgold whose sharp alert features bred more confidence in his own clients than those of other people waited impatiently  he knows something that we don’t said mr stobell at last that’s what it is  mr tredgold who was too used to his friend’s mental processes to quarrel with them assented  he’s coming round to smoke a pipe with me tomorrow night he said briskly as he turned to cross the road to his office you come too and we’ll get it out of him if chalk can keep a secret he has altered that’s all i can say  his estimate of mr chalk proved correct with mr tredgold acting as crossexamining counsel and mr stobell enacting the part of a partial and overbearing judge mr chalk after a display of fortitude which surprised himself almost as much as it irritated his friends parted with his news and sat smiling with gratification at their growing excitement  half a million and he won’t go for it ejaculated mr tredgold the man must be mad  no he passed his word and he won’t break it said mr chalk the captain’s word is his bond and i honour him for it i can quite understand it  mr tredgold shrugged his shoulders and glanced at mr stobell that gentleman after due deliberation gave an assenting nod  he can’t get at it that’s the long and short of it said mr tredgold after a pause he had to leave it behind when he was rescued or else risk losing it by telling the men who rescued him about it and he’s had no opportunity since it wants money to take a ship out there and get it and he doesn’t see his way quite clear he’ll have it fast enough when he gets a chance if not why did he make that map  mr chalk shook his head and remarked mysteriously that the captain had his reasons mr tredgold relapsed into silence and for some time the only sound audible came from a briarpipe which mr stobell ought to have thrown away some years before  have you given up that idea of a yachting cruise of yours chalk demanded mr tredgold turning on him suddenly  no was the reply i was talking about it to captain bowers only the other day that’s how i got to hear of the treasure  mr tredgold started and gave a significant glance at mr stobell in return he got a wink which that gentleman kept for moments of mental confusion  what did the captain tell you for pursued mr tredgold returning to mr chalk he wanted you to make an offer he hasn’t got the money for such an expedition you have the yarn about passing his word was so that you shouldn’t open your mouth too wide you were to do the persuading and then he could make his own terms do you see why it’s as plain as a b c  plain as the alphabet said mr stobell almost chidingly  mr chalk gasped and looked from one to the other  i should like to have a chat with the captain about it continued mr tredgold slowly and impressively i’m a business man and i could put it on a business footing it’s a big risk of course all those things are    but if we went shares    if we found the money——  he broke off and filling his pipe slowly gazed in deep thought at the wall his friends waited expectantly  combine business with pleasure resumed mr tredgold lighting his pipe seaair    change    blow away the cobwebs    experience for edward to be left alone what do you think stobell he added turning suddenly  mr stobell gripped the arms of his chair in his huge hands and drew his bulky figure to a more upright position  what do you mean by combining business with pleasure he said eyeing him with dull suspicion  chalk is set on a trip for the love of it explained mr tredgold  if we take on the contract he ought to pay a bigger share then said the other firmly  perhaps he will said tredgold hastily  mr stobell pondered again and slightly raising one hand indicated that he was in the throes of another idea and did not wish to be disturbed  you said it would be experience for edward to be left alone he said accusingly  i did was the reply  you ought to pay more too then declared the contractor because it’s serving of your ends as well  we can’t split straws exclaimed tredgold impatiently if the captain consents we three will find the money and divide our portion whatever it is equally  mr chalk who had been in the clouds during this discussion came back to earth again if he consents he said sadly but he won’t  well he can only refuse said mr tredgold and anyway we’ll have the first refusal things like that soon get about what do you say to a stroll i can think better while i’m walking  his friends assenting they put on their hats and sallied forth that they should stroll in the direction of dialstone lane surprised neither of them mr tredgold leading they went round by the church and that gentleman paused so long to admire the architecture that mr stobell got restless  you’ve seen it before tredgold he said shortly  it’s a fine old building said the other binchester ought to be proud of it why here we are at captain bowers’s  the house has been next to the church for a couple o’ hundred years retorted his friend  let’s go in said mr tredgold strike while the iron’s hot at any rate he concluded as mr chalk voiced feeble objections we can see how the land lies  he knocked at the door and then stepping aside left mr chalk to lead the way in captain bowers who was sitting with prudence looked up at their entrance and putting down his newspaper extended a hearty welcome  chalk didn’t like to pass without looking in said mr tredgold and i haven’t seen you for some time you know stobell  the captain nodded and mr chalk pale with excitement accepted his accustomed pipe from the hands of miss drewitt and sat nervously awaiting events mr tasker set out the whisky and miss drewitt avowing a fondness for smoke in other people a comfortable haze soon filled the room mr tredgold with a significant glance at mr chalk said that it reminded him of a seafog  it only reminded mr chalk however of a smoky chimney from which he had once suffered and he at once entered into minute details the theme was an inspiriting one and before mr tredgold could hark back to the sea again mr stobell was discoursing almost eloquently for him upon drains from drains to the shortcomings of the district council they progressed by natural and easy stages and it was not until miss drewitt had withdrawn to the clearer atmosphere above that a sudden ominous silence ensued which mr chalk saw clearly he was expected to break  i—i’ve been telling them some of your adventures he said desperately as he glanced at the captain they’re both interested in such things  the latter gave a slight start and glanced shrewdly at his visitors aye aye he said composedly  very interesting some of them murmured mr tredgold i suppose you’ll have another voyage or two before you’ve done one at any rate  no said the captain i’ve had my share of the sea other men may have a turn now there’s nothing to take me out again—nothing  mr tredgold coughed and murmured something about breaking off old habits too suddenly  it’s a fine career sighed mr chalk  a manly life said mr tredgold emphatically  it’s like every other profession it has two sides to it said the captain  it is not so well paid as it should be said the wily tredgold but i suppose one gets chances of making money in outside ways sometimes  the captain assented and told of a steward of his who had made a small fortune by selling japanese curios to people who didn’t understand them  the conversation was interesting but extremely distasteful to a business man intent upon business mr stobell took his pipe out of his mouth and cleared his throat why you might build a hospital with it he burst out impatiently  build a hospital repeated the astonished captain as mr chalk bent suddenly to do up his shoelace  think of the orphans you could be a father to added mr stobell making the most of an unwonted fit of altruism  the captain looked inquiringly at mr tredgold  and widows said mr stobell and putting his pipe in his mouth as a sign that he had finished his remarks gazed stolidly at the company  stobell must be referring to a story chalk told us of some precious stones you buried i think said mr tredgold reddening aren’t you stobell  of course i am said his friend you know that  captain bowers glanced at mr chalk but that gentleman was still busy with his shoelace only looking up when mr tredgold taking the bull by the horns made the captain a plain straightforward offer to fit out and give him the command of an expedition to recover the treasure in a speech which included the benevolent mr stobell’s hospitals widows and orphans he pointed out a score of reasons why the captain should consent and wound up with a glowing picture of miss drewitt as the heiress of the wealthiest man in binchester the captain heard him patiently to an end and then shook his head  i passed my word he said stiffly  mr stobell took his pipe out of his mouth again to offer a little encouragement tredgold has broke his word before now he observed he’s got quite a name for it  but you would go out if it were not for that inquired tredgold turning a deaf ear to this remark  naturally said the captain smiling but then you see i did  mr tredgold drummed with his fingers on the arms of his chair and after a little hesitation asked as a great favour to be permitted to see the map as an estate agent he said he took a professional interest in plans of all kinds  captain bowers rose and in the midst of an expectant silence took the map from the bureau and placing it on the table kept it down with his fist the others drew near and inspected it  nobody but captain bowers has ever seen the other side said mr chalk impressively  except my niece interposed the captain she wanted to see it and i trust her as i would trust myself she thinks the same as i do about it  his stubby forefinger travelled slowly round the coastline until coming to the extreme southwest corner it stopped and a mischievous smile creased his beard  it’s buried here he observed all you’ve got to do is to find the island and dig in that spot  mr chalk laughed and shook his head as at a choice piece of waggishness  suppose said mr tredgold slowly—suppose anybody found it without your connivance would you take your share  let’em find it first said the captain  yes but would you inquired mr chalk  captain bowers took up the map and returned it to its place in the bureau you go and find it he said with a genial smile  you give us permission demanded tredgold  certainly grinned the captain i give you permission to go and dig over all the islands in the pacific there’s a goodish number of them and it’s a fairly common shape  it seems to me it’s nobody’s property said tredgold slowly that is to say it’s anybody’s that finds it it isn’t your property captain bowers you lay no claim to it  no no said the captain it’s nothing to do with me you go and find it he repeated with enjoyment  mr tredgold laughed too and his eye travelled mechanically towards the bureau if we do he said cordially you shall have your share  the captain thanked him and taking up the bottle refilled their glasses then catching the dull brooding eye of mr stobell as that plainspoken man sat in a brown study trying to separate the serious from the jocular he drank success to their search he was about to give vent to further pleasantries when he was stopped by the mysterious behaviour of mr chalk who first laying a finger on his lip to ensure silence frowned severely and nodded at the door leading to the kitchen  the other three looked in the direction indicated the door stood half open and the silhouette of a young woman in a large hat put the upper panels in shadow the captain rose and with a vigorous thrust of his foot closed the door with a bang  eavesdropping said mr chalk in a tense whisper  there’ll be a rival expedition said the captain falling in with his mood i’ve already warned that young woman off once you’d better start tonight  he leaned back in his chair and surveyed the company pleasantly somewhat to mr chalk’s disappointment mr tredgold began to discuss agriculture and they were still on that theme when they rose to depart some time later tredgold and chalk bade the captain a cordial goodnight but stobell a creature of primitive impulses found it difficult to shake hands with him on the way home he expressed an ardent desire to tell the captain what men of sense thought of him  the captain lit another pipe after they had gone and for some time sat smoking and thinking over the events of the evening then mr tasker’s second infringement of discipline occurred to him and stretching out his hand he rang the bell  has that young woman gone he inquired cautiously as mr tasker appeared  yessir was the reply  what about your articles demanded the captain with sudden loudness what do you mean by it  mr tasker eyed him forlornly it ain’t my fault he said at last i don’t want her  eh said the other sternly don’t talk nonsense what do you have her here for then  because i can’t help myself said mr tasker desperately that’s why she’s took a fancy to me and that being so it would take more than you and me to keep ’er away  rubbish said his master  mr tasker smiled wanly that’s my reward for being steady he said with some bitterness that’s what comes of having a good name in the place i get selina vickers after me  you—you must have asked her to come here in the first place said the astonished captain  ask her repeated mr tasker with respectful scorn ask her she don’t want no asking  what does she come for then inquired the other  me said mr tasker brokenly i never dreamt o’ such a thing i was going ’er way one night—about three weeks ago it was—and i walked with her as far as her roadmint street somehow it got put about that we were walking out a week afterwards she saw me in harris’s the grocer’s and waited outside for me till i come out and walked ’ome with me after she came in the other night i found we was keeping company tonighttonight she got a ring out o’ me and now we’re engaged  what on earth did you give her the ring for if you don’t want her inquired the captain eyeing him with genuine concern  ah it seems easy sir said the unfortunate but you don’t know selina she bought the ring and said i was to pay it off a shilling a week she took the first shilling tonight  his master sat back and regarded him in amazement  you don’t know selina sir repeated mr tasker in reply to this manifestation she always gets her own way her father ain’t ’it ’er mother not since selina was seventeen he dursent the last time selina went for him tooth and nail smashed all the plates off the dresser throwing ’em at him and ended by chasing of him up the road in his shirtsleeves  the captain grunted  that was two years ago continued mr tasker and his spirit’s quite broke he ’as to give all his money except a shilling a week to his wife and he’s not allowed to go into pubs if he does it’s no good because they won’t serve ’im if they do selina goes in next morning and gives them a piece of ’er mind she don’t care who’s there or what she says and the consequence is mr vickers can’t get served in binchester for love or money that’ll show you what she is  well tell her i won’t have her here said the captain rising goodnight  i’ve told her over and over again sir was the reply and all she says is she’s not afraid of you nor six like you  illustration the captain fell back silent and mr tasker pausing in a respectful attitude watched him wistfully the captain’s brows were bent in thought and mr tasker reminding himself that crews had trembled at his nod and that all were silent when he spoke felt a flutter of hope  well said the captain sharply as he turned and caught sight of him what are you waiting there for  mr tasker drifted towards the door which led upstairs  i—i thought you were thinking of something we could do to prevent her coming sir he said slowly it’s hard on me because as a matter of fact——  well said the captain  i—i’ve ’ad my eye on another young lady for some time concluded mr tasker  he was standing on the bottom stair as he spoke with his hand on the latch under the baleful stare with which the indignant captain favoured him he closed it softly and mounted heavily to bed     chapter v     mr chalk’s expedition to the southern seas became a standing joke with the captain and he waylaid him on several occasions to inquire into the progress he was making and to give him advice suitable for all known emergencies at sea together with a few that are unknown even mr chalk began to tire of his pleasantries and after listening to a surprising account of a scotch vessel which always sailed backwards when the men whistled on sundays signified his displeasure by staying away from dialstone lane for some time  deprived of his society the captain consoled himself with that of edward tredgold a young man for whom he was beginning to entertain a strong partiality and whose observations of binchester folk flavoured with a touch of goodnatured malice were a source of neverfailing interest  he is very wideawake he said to his niece there isn’t much that escapes him  miss drewitt gazing idly out of window said that she had not noticed it  very clever at his business i understand said the captain  his niece said that he had always appeared to her—when she had happened to give the matter a thought—as a picture of indolence  ah that’s only his manner replied the other warmly he’s a young man that’s going to get on he’s going to make his mark his father’s got money and he’ll make more of it  something in the tone of his voice attracted his niece’s attention and she looked at him sharply as an almost incredible suspicion as to the motive of this conversation flashed on her  i don’t like to see young men too fond of money she observed sedately  i didn’t say that said the captain eagerly if anything he is too openhanded what i meant was that he isn’t lazy  he seems to be very fond of coming to see you said prudence by way of encouragement  ah said the captain and——  he stopped abruptly as the girl faced round and she prompted  and the crow’snest concluded the captain somewhat lamely  there was no longer room for doubt scarce two months ashore and he was trying his hand at matchmaking fresh from a world of obedient satellites and ships responding to the lightest touch of the helm he was venturing with all the confidence of ignorance upon the most delicate of human undertakings miss drewitt eyeing him with perfect comprehension and some little severity sat aghast at his hardihood  he’s very fond of going up there said captain bowers somewhat discomfited  yes he and joseph have much in common remarked miss drewitt casually they’re some what alike too i always fancy  alike exclaimed the astonished captain  edward tredgold like joseph why you must be dreaming  perhaps it’s only my fancy conceded miss drewitt but i always think that i can see a likeness  there isn’t the slightest resemblance in the world said the captain there isn’t a single feature alike besides haven’t you ever noticed what a stupid expression joseph has got  yes said miss drewitt  the captain scratched his ear and regarded her closely but miss drewitt’s face was statuesque in its repose  there—there’s nothing wrong with your eyes my dear he ventured anxiously—short sight or anything of that sort  i don’t think so said his niece gravely  captain bowers shifted in his chair and convinced that such a superficial observer must have overlooked many things pointed out several admirable qualities in edward tredgold which he felt sure must have escaped her notice the surprise with which miss drewitt greeted them all confirmed him in this opinion and he was glad to think that he had called her attention to them ere it was too late  he’s very popular in binchester he said impressively chalk told me that he is surprised he has not been married before now seeing the way that he is run after  dear me said his niece with suppressed viciousness  the captain smiled he resolved to stand out for a long engagement when mr tredgold came to him and to stipulate also that they should not leave binchester an admirer in london to whom his niece had once or twice alluded—forgetting to mention that he was only ten—began to fade into what the captain considered proper obscurity  mr edward tredgold reaped some of the benefits of this conversation when he called a day or two afterwards the captain was out but encouraged by mr tasker who represented that his return might be looked for at any moment he waited for over an hour and was on the point of departure when miss drewitt entered  i should think that you must be tired of waiting she said when he had explained  i was just going said mr tredgold as he resumed his seat if you had been five minutes later you would have found an empty chair i suppose captain bowers won’t be long now  he might be said the girl  i’ll give him a little while longer if i may said mr tredgold i’m very glad now that i waited—very glad indeed  there was so much meaning in his voice that miss drewitt felt compelled to ask the reason  because i was tired when i came in and the rest has done me good explained mr tredgold with much simplicity do you know that i sometimes think i work too hard  miss drewitt raised her eyebrows slightly and said indeed—i am very glad that you are rested she added after a pause  thank you said mr tredgold gratefully i came to see the captain about a cardtable i’ve discovered for him it’s a queen anne i believe one of the best things i’ve ever seen it’s poked away in the back room of a cottage and i only discovered it by accident  it’s very kind of you said miss drewitt coldly but i don’t think that my uncle wants any more furniture the room is pretty full now  i was thinking of it for your room said mr tredgold  thank you but my room is full said the girl sharply  it would go in that odd little recess by the fireplace continued the unmoved mr tredgold we tried to get a small table for it before you came but we couldn’t see anything we fancied i promised the captain i’d keep my eyes open for something  miss drewitt looked at him with growing indignation and wondered whether mr chalk had added her to his list of the victims of mr tredgold’s blandishments  why not buy it for yourself she demanded  no money said mr tredgold shaking his head you forget that i lost two pounds to chalk the other day owing to your efforts  well i don’t wish for it said miss drewitt firmly please don’t say anything to my uncle about it  mr tredgold looked disappointed as you please of course he remarked  old things always seem a little bit musty said the girl softening a little i should think that i saw the ghosts of dead and gone players sitting round the table i remember reading a story about that once  well what about the other things said mr tredgold look at those old chairs full of ghosts sitting piled up in each other’s laps—there’s no reason why you should only see one sitter at a time think of that beautifullycarved fourposter  my uncle bought that said miss drewitt somewhat irrelevantly  yes but i got it for him said mr tredgold you can’t pick up a thing like that at a moment’s notice—i had my eye on it for years all the time old brown was bedridden in fact i used to go and see him and take him tobacco and he promised me that i should have it when he had done with it  done with it repeated the girl in a startled voice did—did he get another one then  mr tredgold roused from the pleasurable reminiscences of a collector remembered himself suddenly oh yes he got another one he said soothingly  is—is he bedridden now inquired the girl  i haven’t seen him for some time said mr tredgold truthfully he gave up smoking and—and then i didn’t go to see him you know  he’s dead said miss drewitt shivering he died in—— oh you are horrible  that carving— began mr tredgold  don’t talk about it please said the indignant miss drewitt i can’t understand why my uncle should have listened to your advice at all you must have forced it on him i’m sure he didn’t know how you got it  yes he did said the other in fact it was intended for his room at first he was quite pleased with it  why did he alter his mind then inquired the girl  mr tredgold looked suddenly at the opposite wall but his lips quivered and his eyes watered miss drewitt reading these signs aright was justly incensed  i don’t believe it she cried  he said that you didn’t know and he did said mr tredgold apologetically i talk too much i’d no business to let out about old brown but i forgot for the moment—sailors are always prone to childish superstitions  are you talking about my uncle inquired miss drewitt with ominous calm  they were his own words said the other  miss drewitt feeling herself baffled sat for some time wondering how to find fault politely with the young man before her her mind was full of subjectmatter but the politeness easily eluded her she threw out after a time the suggestion that his presence at the bedside of sick people was not likely to add to their comfort  captain bowers entered before the aggrieved mr tredgold could think of a fitting reply and after a hasty greeting insisted upon his staying for a cup of tea by a glance in the visitor’s direction and a faint smile miss drewitt was understood to endorse the invitation  the captain’s satisfaction at finding them together was complete but a little misunderstanding was caused all round when mr tasker came in with the tea by the series of nods and blinks by which the captain strove to call his niece’s attention to various facial and other differences between his servant and their visitor mr tredgold after standing it for some time created a little consternation by inquiring whether he had got a smut on his nose  the captain was practically the only talker at tea but the presence of two attentive listeners prevented him from discovering the fact he described his afternoon’s ramble at such length that it was getting late by the time they had finished  stay and smoke a pipe he said as he sought his accustomed chair  mr tredgold assented in the usual manner by saying that he ought to be going and instead of one pipe smoked three or four the light failed and the lamp was lit but he still stayed on until the sound of subdued but argumentative voices beyond the drawn blind apprised them of other visitors the thin tones of mr chalk came through the open window apparently engaged in argument with a bear a faint sound of hustling and growling followed by a gentle bumping against the door seemed to indicate that he—or perhaps the bear—was having recourse to physical force  come in cried the captain  the door opened and mr chalk somewhat flushed entered leading mr stobell the latter gentleman seemed in a surly and reluctant frame of mind and having exchanged greetings subsided silently into a chair and sat eyeing mr chalk who somewhat nervous as to his reception after so long an absence plunged at once into conversation  i thought i should find you here he said pleasantly to edward tredgold  why demanded mr tredgold with what mr chalk thought unnecessary abruptness  well—well because you generally are here i suppose he said somewhat taken aback  mr tredgold favoured him with a scowl and a somewhat uncomfortable silence ensued  stobell wanted to see you again said mr chalk turning to the captain he’s done nothing but talk about you ever since he was here last  captain bowers said he was glad to see him mr stobell returned the courtesy with an odd noise in his throat and a strange glare at mr chalk  i met him tonight continued that gentleman and nothing would do for him but to come on here  it was evident from the laboured respiration of the ardent mr stobell coupled with a word or two which had filtered through the window that the ingenious mr chalk was using him as a stalkinghorse from the fact that mr stobell made no denial it was none the less evident despite the growing blackness of his appearance that he was a party to the arrangement the captain began to see the reason  it’s all about that island explained mr chalk he can talk of nothing else  the captain suppressed a groan and mr tredgold endeavoured but without success to exchange smiles with miss drewitt  aye aye said the captain desperately  he’s as eager as a child that’s going to its first pantomime continued mr chalk  mr stobell’s appearance was so alarming that he broke off and eyed him with growing uneasiness  you were talking about a pantomime said mr tredgold after a long pause  mr chalk cast an imploring glance at mr stobell to remind him of their compact and resumed  talks of nothing else he said watching his friend and can’t sleep for thinking of it  that’s bad said mr tredgold sympathetically has he tried shutting his eyes and counting sheep jumping over a stile  no he ain’t said mr stobell exploding suddenly and turning a threatening glance on the speaker and what’s more he added in more ordinary tones he ain’t going to  we—we’ve been thinking of that trip again interposed mr chalk hurriedly the more stobell thinks of it the more he likes it you know what you said the last time we were here  the captain wrinkled his brows and looked at him inquiringly  told us to go and find the island mr chalk reminded him you said ’i’ve shown you a map of the island now go and find it’  oh aye said the captain with a laugh so i did  stobell was wondering continued mr chalk whether you couldn’t give us just a little bit more of a hint without breaking your word of course  i don’t see how it could be done replied the captain pondering a promise is a promise  mr chalk’s face fell he moved his chair aside mechanically to make room for mr tasker who had entered with a tray and glasses and sat staring at the floor then he raised his eyes and met a significant glance from mr stobell  i suppose we may have another look at the map he said softly just a glance to freshen our memories  the captain who had drawn his chair to the table to preside over the tray looked up impatiently  no he said brusquely  mr chalk looked hurt i’m very sorry he said in surprise at the captain’s tone you showed it to us the other day and i didn’t think—  the fact is said the captain in a more gentle voice—the fact is i can’t  can’t repeated the other  it is not very pleasant to keep on refusing friends said the captain making amends for his harshness by pouring a serious overdose of whisky into mr chalk’s glass and it’s only natural for you to be anxious about it so i removed the temptation out of my way  removed the temptation repeated mr chalk  i burnt the map said the captain with a smile  burnt it gasped mr chalk burnt it  burnt it to ashes said the captain jovially  it’s a load off my mind i ought to have done it before in fact i never ought to have made the map at all  mr chalk stared at him in speechless dismay  try that said the captain handing mr stobell his glass  mr stobell took it from mere force of habit and sat holding it in his hand as though he had forgotten what to do with it  i did it yesterday morning said the captain noticing their consternation i had just lit my pipe after breakfast and i suppose the match put me in mind of it i took out the map and set light to it at cape silvio the flame ran halfway round the coast and then popped through the middle of the paper and converted mount lonesome into a volcano  he gave a boisterous laugh and raising his glass nodded to mr stobell mr stobell who was just about to drink lowered his glass again and frowned  i don’t see anything to laugh at he said deliberately  he can’t have been listening said mr tredgold in a low voice to miss drewitt  well it’s done now said the captain genially you—you’re not going  yes i am said mr stobell  he bade them goodnight and then pausing at the door stood and surveyed them even mr tasker who was gliding in unobtrusively with a jug of water shared in his regards  when i think of the orphans and widows he said bitterly i——  he opened the door suddenly and closing it behind him breathed the rest to dialstone lane an aged woman sitting in a doorway said hush     chapter vi     miss drewitt sat for some time in her room after the visitors had departed eyeing with some disfavour the genuine antiques which she owed to the enterprise not to say officiousness of edward tredgold that they were in excellent taste was undeniable but there was a flavour of age and a suspicion of decay about them which did not make for cheerfulness  she rose at last and taking off her watch went through the nightly task of wondering where she had put the key after using it last it was not until she had twice made a fruitless tour of the room with the candle that she remembered that she had left it on the mantelpiece downstairs  the captain was still below and after a moment’s hesitation she opened her door and went softly down the steep winding stairs  the door at the foot stood open and revealed the captain standing by the table there was an air of perplexity and anxiety about him such as she had never seen before and as she waited he crossed to the bureau which stood open and searched feverishly among the papers which littered it apparently dissatisfied with the result he moved it out bodily and looked behind and beneath it coming to an erect position again he suddenly became aware of the presence of his niece  it’s gone he said in an amazed voice  gone repeated prudence what has gone  the map said the captain tumbling his beard i put it in this end pigeonhole the other night after showing it and i haven’t touched it since and it’s gone  but you burnt it said prudence with an astonished laugh  the captain started no i was going to he said eyeing her in manifest confusion  but you said that you had persisted his niece  yes stammered the captain i know i did but i hadn’t i was just looking ahead a bit that was all i went to the bureau just now to do it  miss drewitt eyed him with mild reproach you even described how you did it she said slowly you said that mount lonesome turned into a volcano wasn’t it true  figure o’ speech my dear said the unhappy captain i’ve got a talent for description that runs away with me at times  his niece gazed at him in perplexity  you know what chalk is said captain bowers appealingly i was going to do it yesterday only i forgot it and he would have gone down on his knees for another sight of it i don’t like to seem disobliging to friends and it seemed to me a good way out of it chalk is so eager— it’s like refusing a child and i hurt his feelings only the other day  perhaps you burnt it after all and forgot it said prudence  for the first time in her knowledge of him the captain got irritable with her i’ve not burnt it he said sharply where’s that joseph he must know something about it  he moved to the foot of the staircase but miss drewitt laid a detaining hand on his arm  joseph was in the room when you said that you had burnt it she exclaimed you can’t contradict yourself like that before him besides i’m sure he has had nothing to do with it  somebody’s got it grumbled her uncle pausing  he dropped into his chair and looked at her in consternation good heavens suppose they go after it he said in a choking voice  well it won’t be your fault said prudence you haven’t broken your word intentionally  but the captain paid no heed he was staring wildeyed into vacancy and rumpling his grey hair until it stood at all angles his face reflected varying emotions  somebody has got it he said again  whoever it is will get no good by it said miss drewitt who had had a pious upbringing  and if they’ve got the map they’ll go after the island said the captain pursuing his train of thought  perhaps they won’t find it after all said prudence  perhaps they won’t said the captain gruffly  he got up and paced the room restlessly prudence watching him with much sympathy had a sudden idea  edward tredgold was in here alone this afternoon she said significantly  no no said the captain warmly whoever has got it it isn’t edward tredgold i expect the talk about it has leaked out and somebody has slipped in and taken it i ought to have been more careful  he started when you said that you had burnt it persisted miss drewitt unwilling to give up a theory so much to her liking you mark my words if his father and mr chalk and that mr stobell don’t go away for a holiday soon goodnight  she kissed him affectionately under the left eye—a place overlooked by his beard—and went upstairs again the captain filled his pipe and resuming his chair sat in a brown study until the clock of the neighbouring church struck two  it was about the same time that mr chalk fell asleep thoroughly worn out by the events of the evening and a conversation with mr stobell and mr tredgold whom he had met on the way home waiting for him  the opinion of mr tredgold senior an opinion in which mr stobell fully acquiesced was that mr chalk had ruined everything by displaying all along a youthful impetuosity sadly out of place in one of his years and standing the offender’s plea that he had thought it best to strike while the iron was hot only exposed him to further contumely  well it’s no good talking about it said mr tredgold impatiently it’s all over now and done with  half a million clean chucked away said mr stobell  mr chalk shook his head and finding that his friends had by no means exhausted the subject suddenly bethought himself of an engagement and left them  miss vickers who heard the news from mr joseph tasker received it with an amount of amazement highly gratifying to his powers as a narrator her strongly expressed opinion afterwards that he had misunderstood what he had heard was not so agreeable  i suppose i can believe my own ears he said in an injured voice  he must have been making fun of them all said selina he couldn’t have burnt it—he couldn’t  why not inquired the other surprised at her vehemence  miss vickers hesitated because it would be such a silly thing to do she said at last now tell me what you heard all over again—slow  mr tasker complied  i can’t make head or tail of it said miss vickers when he had finished  seems simple enough to me said joseph staring at her  all things seem simple when you don’t know them said miss vickers vaguely  she walked home in a thoughtful mood and for a day or two went about the house with an air of preoccupation which was a source of much speculation to the family george vickers aged six was driven to the verge of madness by being washed three times in succession one morning a gag of wellsoaped flannel being applied with mechanical regularity each time that he strove to point out the unwashed condition of martha and charles his turn came when the exultant couple charged with having made themselves dirty in the shortest time on record were deprived of their breakfast mr vickers having committed one or two minor misdemeanours unchallenged attributed his daughter’s condition to love and began to speak of that passion with more indulgence than he had done since his marriage  miss vickers’s’ abstraction however lasted but three days on the fourth she was herself again and having spent the day in hard work dressed herself with unusual care in the evening and went out  the evening was fine and the air to one who had been at work indoors all day delightful miss vickers walked briskly along with the smile of a person who has solved a difficult problem but as she drew near the horse and groom a hostelry of retiring habits standing well back from the road the smile faded and she stood face to face with the stern realities of life  a few yards from the sidedoor mr vickers stood smoking a contemplative pipe the sidedoor itself had just closed behind a tall man in corduroys who bore in his right hand a large mug made of pewter  ho said selina so this is how you go on the moment my back is turned is it  what d’ye mean demanded mr vickers blustering  you know what i mean said his daughter standing outside and sending bill russell in to get you beer that’s what i mean  mr vickers turned and with a little dramatic start intimated that he had caught sight of mr russell for the first time that evening mr russell himself sought to improve the occasion  wish i may die— he began solemnly  like a policeman continued selina regarding her father indignantly  i wish i was a policeman muttered mr vickers i’d show some of you  what have you got to say for yourself demanded miss vickers shortly  nothing said the culprit i s’pose i can stand where i like there’s no law agin it  do you mean to say that you didn’t send bill in to get you some beer said his daughter  certainly not said mr vickers with great indignation i shouldn’t think of such a thing  i shouldn’t get it if ’e did said mr russell virtuously  whose beer is it then said selina  why bill’s i s’pose how should i know replied mr vickers  yes it’s mine said mr russell  drink it up then commanded miss vickers sternly  both men started and then mr russell bestowing a look of infinite compassion upon his unfortunate friend raised the mug obediently to his sensitive lips always a kindhearted man he was glad when the gradual tilting necessary to the occasion had blotted out the picture of indignation which raged helplessly before him  i ’ope you’re satisfied now he said severely to the girl as he turned a triumphant glance on mr vickers which that gentleman met with a cold stare  miss vickers paid no heed you get off home she said to her father i’ll see to the horse and groom tomorrow  mr vickers muttered something under his breath and then with a forlorn attempt at dignity departed  miss vickers ignoring the remarks of one or two fathers of families who were volunteering information as to what they would do if she were their daughter watched him out of sight and resumed her walk she turned once or twice as though to make sure that she was not observed and then making her way in the direction of mr chalk’s house approached it cautiously from the back  mr chalk who was in the garden engaged in the useful and healthful occupation of digging became aware after a time of a low whistle proceeding from the farther end he glanced almost mechanically in that direction and then nearly dropped his spade as he made out a girl’s head surmounted by a large hat the light was getting dim but the hat had an odd appearance of familiarity a stealthy glance in the other direction showed him the figure of mrs chalk standing to attention just inside the open french windows of the drawingroom  the whistle came again slightly increased in volume mr chalk pausing merely to wipe his brow which had suddenly become very damp bent to his work with renewed vigour it is an old idea that whistling aids manual labour mr chalk moistening his lips with a tongue grown all too feverish for the task began to whistle a popular air with much liveliness  the idea was ingenious but hopeless from the start the whistle at the end of the garden became piercing in its endeavour to attract attention and what was worse developed an odd note of entreaty mr chalk pale with apprehension could bear no more  well i think i’ve done enough for one night he observed cheerfully and loudly as he thrust his spade into the ground and took his coat from a neighbouring bush  he turned to go indoors and knowing his wife’s objection to dirty boots made for the door near the kitchen as he passed the drawingroom window however a low but imperative voice pronounced his name  yes my dear said mr chalk  there’s a friend of yours whistling for you said his wife with forced calmness  whistling said mr chalk with as much surprise as a man could assume in face of the noise from the bottom of the garden  do you mean to tell me you can’t hear it demanded his wife in a choking voice  mr chalk lost his presence of mind i thought it was a bird he said assuming a listening attitude  bird gasped the indignant mrs chalk look down there do you call that a bird  mr chalk looked and uttered a little cry of astonishment  i suppose she wants to see one of the servants he said at last but why doesn’t she go round to the side entrance i shall have to speak to them about it  mrs chalk drew herself up and eyed him with superb disdain  go down and speak to her she commanded certainly not said mr chalk braving her although his voice trembled  why not  because if i did you would ask me what she said and when i told you you wouldn’t believe me said mr chalk  you—you decline to go down said his wife in a voice shaking with emotion  i do said mr chalk firmly why don’t you go yourself  mrs chalk eyed him for a moment in scornful silence and then stepped to the window and sailed majestically down the garden mr chalk watched her with parted lips and then he began to breathe more freely as the whistle ceased and the head suddenly disappeared still a little nervous he watched his wife to the end of the garden and saw her crane her head over the fence by the time she returned he was sitting in an attitude of careless ease with his back to the window  well he said with assurance  mrs chalk stood stockstill and the intensity of her gaze drew mr chalk’s eyes to her face despite his will for a few seconds she gazed at him in silence and then drawing her skirts together swept violently out of the room     chapter vii     mr chalk made but a poor breakfast next morning the effort to display a feeling of proper sympathy with mrs chalk who was presiding in gloomy silence at the coffeepot and at the same time to maintain an air of cheerful innocence as to the cause of her behaviour being almost beyond his powers he chipped his egg with a painstaking attempt to avoid noise and swallowed each mouthful with a feeble pretence of not knowing that she was watching him as he ate her glance conveyed a scornful reproach that he could eat at all in such circumstances and that there might be no mistake as to her own feelings she ostentatiously pushed the toastrack and eggstand away from her  you—you’re not eating my dear said mr chalk  if i ate anything it would choke me was the reply  mr chalk affected surprise but his voice quavered to cover his discomfiture he passed his cup up for more coffee shivering despite himself as he noticed the elaborate care which mrs chalk displayed in rinsing out the cup and filling it to the very brim beyond raising her eyes to the ceiling when he took another piece of toast she made no sign  you’re not looking yourself ventured mr chalk after a time  his wife received the information silence  i’ve noticed it for some time said the thoughtful husband making another effort it’s worried me  i’m not getting younger i know assented mrs chalk but if you think that that’s any excuse for your goings on you’re mistaken  mr chalk murmured something to the effect that he did not understand her  you understand well enough was the reply when that girl came whistling over the fence last night you said you thought it was a bird  i did said mr chalk hastily taking a spoonful of egg  mrs chalk’s face flamed what sort of bird she demanded  singin’ bird replied her husband with nervous glibness  mrs chalk left the room  mr chalk finished his breakfast with an effort and then moving to the window lit his pipe and sat for some time in moody thought a little natural curiosity as to the identity of the fair whistler would however not be denied and the names of binchester’s fairest daughters passed in review before him almost unconsciously he got up and surveyed himself in the glass  there’s no accounting for tastes he said to himself in modest explanation  his mind still dwelt on the subject as he stood in the hall later on in the morning brushing his hat preparatory to taking his usual walk mrs chalk upstairs listening thought that he would never have finished and drew her own conclusions  with the air of a man whose time hangs upon his hands mr chalk sauntered slowly through the narrow byways of binchester he read all the notices pasted on the door of the town hall and bought some stamps at the postoffice but the morning dragged slowly and he bent his steps at last in the direction of tredgold’s office in the faint hope of a little conversation  to his surprise mr tredgold senior was in an unusually affable mood he pushed his papers aside at once and motioning his visitor to a chair greeted him with much heartiness  just the man i wanted to see he said cheerfully i want you to come round to my place at eight o’clock tonight i’ve just seen stobell and he’s coming too  i will if i can said mr chalk  you must come said the other seriously it’s business  business said mr chalk i don’t see—  you will tonight said mr tredgold with a mysterious smile i’ve sent edward off to town on business and we sha’n’t be interrupted goodbye i’m busy  he shook hands with his visitor and led him to the door chalk after a vain attempt to obtain particulars walked slowly home  despite his curiosity it was nearly halfpast eight when he arrived at mr tredgold’s that evening and was admitted by his host the latter with a somewhat trite remark about the virtues of punctuality led the way upstairs and threw open the door of his study  here he is he announced  a slender figure sitting bolt upright in a large grandfatherchair turned at their entrance and revealed to the astonished mr chalk the expressive features of miss selina vickers facing her at the opposite side of the room mr stobell palpably ruffled eyed her balefully  this is a new client of mine said tredgold indicating miss vickers  mr chalk said good evening  i tried to get a word with you last night said miss vickers i was down at the bottom of your garden whistling for over ten minutes as hard as i could whistle i wonder you didn’t hear me  hear you cried mr chalk guiltily conscious of a feeling of disappointment quite beyond his control what do you mean by coming and whistling for me eh what do you mean by it  i wanted to see you private said miss vickers calmly but it’s just as well i went and saw mr tredgold this morning instead  on a matter of business said mr tredgold looking at her she came to me as one of the ordinary public about some—ha—land she’s interested in  an island corroborated miss vickers  mr chalk took a chair and looked round in amazement what another he said faintly  mr tredgold coughed my client is not a rich woman he began  chalk knows that interrupted mr stobell the airs and graces that girl will give herself if you go on like that——  but she has some property there which she is anxious to obtain continued mr tredgold with a warning glance at the speaker that being so——  make him wish he may die first interposed miss vickers briskly  yes yes that’s all right said tredgold meeting mr chalk’s startled gaze  it will be when he’s done it retorted the determined miss vickers  it’s a secret explained mr tredgold addressing his staring friend and you must swear to keep it if it’s told you that’s what she means i’ve had to and so has stobell  a fierce grunt from mr stobell who was still suffering from the remembrance of an indignity against which he had protested in vain came as confirmation then the marvelling mr chalk rose and instructed by miss vickers took an oath the efficacy of which consisted in a fervent hope that he might die if he broke it  but what’s it all about he inquired plaintively  mr tredgold conferred with miss vickers and that lady after a moment’s hesitation drew a folded paper from her bosom and beckoned to mr chalk with a cry of amazement he recognised the identical map of bowers’s island which he had last seen in the hands of its namesake it was impossible to mistake it although an attempt to take it in his hand was promptly frustrated by the owner  but captain bowers said that he had burnt it he cried  mr tredgold eyed him coldly burnt what he inquired  the map was the reply  just so said tredgold you told me he had burnt a map  is this another then inquired mr chalk  p’r’aps said miss vickers briefly  as the captain said he had burnt his this must be another said tredgold  didn’t he burn it then inquired mr chalk  i should be sorry to disbelieve captain bowers said tredgold  couldn’t be done said the brooding stobell not if you tried  mr chalk sat still and eyed them in perplexity  there is no doubt that this map refers to the same treasure as the one captain bowers had said tredgold with the air of one making a generous admission my client has not volunteered any statement as to how it came into her possession—  and she’s not going to put in miss vickers dispassionately  it is enough for me that we have got it resumed mr tredgold now we want you to join us in fitting out a ship and recovering the treasure equal expenses equal shares  what about captain bowers inquired mr chalk  he is to have an equal share without any of the expense said tredgold you know he gave us permission to find it if we could so we are not injuring anybody  he told us to go and find it if you remember said stobell and we’re going to  he’ll have a fortune handed to him without any trouble or being responsible in any way said tredgold impressively i should like to think there was somebody working to put a fortune like that into my lap we shall have a fifth each  that’ll be fivethousandpounds for you selina said mr stobell with a wouldbe benevolent smile  miss vickers turned a composed little face upon him and languidly closed one eye  i had two prizes for arithmetic when i was at school she remarked and don’t you call me selina unless you want to be called bobbie  a sharp exclamation from mr tredgold stopped all but the first three words of mr stobell’s retort but he said the rest under his breath with considerable relish  don’t mind him said miss vickers i’m half sorry i let him join now a man that used to work for him once told me that he was only half a gentleman but he’d never seen that half  mr stobell afraid to trust himself got up and leaned out of the window  well we’re all agreed then said tredgold looking round  half a second said miss vickers before i part with this map you’ve all got to sign a paper promising me my proper share and to give me twenty pounds down  mr tredgold hesitated and looked serious mr chalk somewhat dazed by the events of the evening blinked at him solemnly mr stobell withdrew his head from the window and spoke  twentypounds he growled  twenty pounds repeated miss vickers or four hundred shillings if you like it better if you wait a moment i’ll make it pennies  she leaned back in her chair and screwing her eyes tight began the calculation twelve noughts are nought she said in a gabbling whisper twelve noughts are nought twelve fours are forty—  all right said mr tredgold who had been regarding this performance with astonished disapproval you shall have the twenty pounds but there is no necessity for us to sign any paper  no there’s no necessity said miss vickers opening her small sharp eyes again only if you don’t do it i’ll find somebody that will  mr tredgold argued with her but in vain mr chalk taking up the argument and expanding it fared no better and mr stobell opening his mouth to contribute his mite was quelled before he could get a word out  them’s my terms said miss vickers take’em or leave’em just as you please i give you five minutes by the clock to make up your minds mr stobell can have six because thinking takes him longer and if you agree to do what’s right—and i’m letting you off easy—mr tredgold is to keep the map and never to let it go out of his sight for a single instant  she put her head round the side of the chair to make a note of the time and then sitting upright with her arms folded awaited their decision before the time was up the terms were accepted and mr tredgold drawing his chair to the table prepared to draw up the required agreement  he composed several but none which seemed to give general satisfaction at the seventh attempt however he produced an agreement which alluding in vague terms to a treasure quest in the southern seas on the strength of a map provided by miss vickers promised onefifth of the sum recovered to that lady and was considered to meet the exigencies of the case miss vickers herself without being enthusiastic said that she supposed it would have to do  another copy was avoided but only with great difficulty owing to her criticism of mr stobell’s signature it took the united and verbose efforts of messrs chalk and tredgold to assure her that it was in his usual style and rather a good signature for him than otherwise miss vickers viewing it with her head on one side asked whether he couldn’t make his mark instead a question which mr stobell at the pressing instance of his friends left unanswered then tredgold left the room to pay a visit to his safe and the other two gentlemen turning out their pockets the required sum was made up and with the agreement handed to miss vickers in exchange for the map  she bade them goodnight and then opening the door paused with her hand on the knob and stood irresolute  i hope i’ve done right she said somewhat nervously it was no good to anybody laying idle and being wasted i haven’t stolen anything  no no said tredgold hastily  it seems ridiculous for all that money to be wasted continued miss vickers musingly it doesn’t belong to anybody so nobody can be hurt by our taking it and we can do a lot of good with it if we like i shall give some of mine away to the poor we all will i’ll have it put in this paper  she fumbled in her bodice for the document and walked towards them  we can’t alter it now said mr tredgold decidedly  we’ll do what’s right said mr chalk reassuringly  miss vickers smiled at him yes i know you will she said graciously and i think mr tredgold will but—  you’re leaving that door open said mr stobell coldly and the draught’s blowing my head off pretty near  miss vickers eyed him scornfully but in the absence of a crushing reply disdained one at all she contented herself instead by going outside and closing the door after her with a sharpness which stirred every hair on his head  it’s a most extraordinary thing said mr chalk as the three bent exultingly over the map i could ha’ sworn to this map in a court of justice  don’t you worry your head about it advised mr stobell  you’ve got your way at last said tredgold with some severity we’re going for a cruise with you and here you are raising objections  not objections remonstrated the other and talking about the voyage what about mrs chalk she’ll want to come  so will mrs stobell said that lady’s proprietor but she won’t  she mustn’t hear of it till the last moment said tredgold dictatorially the quieter we keep the whole thing the better you’re not to divulge a word of the cruise to anybody when it does leak out it must be understood we are just going for a little pleasure jaunt mind you’ve sworn to keep the whole affair secret  mr chalk screwed up his features in anxious perplexity but made no comment  the weather’s fine continued tredgold and there’s nothing gained by delay on wednesday we’ll take the train to biddlecombe and have a look round my idea is to buy a small stout sailingcraft secondhand ship a crew ostensibly for a pleasure trip and sail as soon as possible  mr chalk’s face brightened and we’ll take some beads and guns and lookingglasses and trade with the natives in the different islands we pass he said cheerfully we may as well see something of the world while we’re about it  mr tredgold smiled indulgently and said they would see messrs stobell and chalk after a final glance at the map and a final perusal of the instructions at the back took their departure  it’s like a dream said the latter gentleman as they walked down the high street  that vickers girl ud like more dreams o’ the same sort said mr stobell as he thrust his hand in his empty pocket  it’s all very well for you continued mr chalk uneasily but my wife is sure to insist upon coming  mr stobell sniffed i’ve got a wife too he remarked  yes said mr chalk in a burst of unwonted frankness but it ain’t quite the same thing i’ve got a wife and mrs stobell has got a husband—that’s the difference  mr stobell pondered this remark for the rest of the way home he came to the conclusion that the events of the evening had made mr chalk a little lightheaded     chapter viii     until he stood on the platform on wednesday morning with his brother adventurers mr chalk passed the time in a state of nervous excitement which only tended to confirm his wife in her suspicions of his behaviour without any preliminaries he would burst out suddenly into snatches of seasongs the bay of biscay being an especial favourite until mrs chalk thought fit to observe that if the thunder did roar like that she should not be afraid of it ever sensitive to a fault mr chalk fell back upon tom bowling which he thought free from openings of that sort until mrs chalk after commenting upon the inability of the late mr bowling to hear the tempest’s howling indulged in idle speculations as to what he would have thought of mr chalk’s tredgold and stobell bought papers on the station but mr chalk was in too exalted a mood for reading the bustle and life as the train became due were admirably attuned to his feelings and when it drew up and they embarked to the clatter of milkcans and the rumbling of trolleys he was beaming with satisfaction  i feel that i can smell the sea already he remarked  mr stobell put down his paper and sniffed then he resumed it again and meeting mr tredgold’s eye over the top of it sniffed more loudly than before  have you told edward that you are going to sea inquired mr chalk leaning over to tredgold  certainly not was the reply i don’t want anybody to know till the last possible moment you haven’t given your wife any hint as to why you are going to biddlecombe today have you  mr chalk shook his head i told her that you had got business there and that i was going with you just for the outing he said what she’ll say when she finds out—  his imagination failed him and a prey to forebodings he tried to divert his mind by looking out of window his countenance cleared as they neared biddlecombe and the line running for some distance by the side of the river he amused himself by gazing at various small craft left high and dry by the tide  a short walk from the station brought them to the mouth of the river which constitutes the harbour of biddlecombe for a small port there was a goodly array of shipping and mr chalk’s pulse beat faster as his gaze wandered impartially from a stately barque in all the pride of fresh paint to dingy seaworn ketches and tiny yachts  uncertain how to commence operations they walked thoughtfully up and down the quay if any of the craft were for sale there was nothing to announce the fact and the various suggestions which mr chalk threw off from time to time as to the course they should pursue were hardly noticed  one o’clock said mr stobell extracting a huge silver timepiece from his pocket after a couple of wasted hours  let’s have something to eat before we do any more said mr tredgold after that we’ll ferry over and look at the other side  they made their way to the king of hanover an old inn perched on the side of the harbour and mounting the stairs entered the coffeeroom where mr stobell after hesitating for some time between the rival claims of roast beef and grilled chops solved the difficulty by ordering both  the only other occupant of the room a short wiry man with a closeshaven hardbitten face sat smoking with a glass of whisky before him in a bay window at the end of the room which looked out on the harbour there was a maritime flavour about him which at once enlisted mr chalk’s sympathies and made him overlook the small steely grey eyes and large and somewhat brutal mouth  fine day gentlemen said the stranger nodding affably to mr chalk as he raised his glass mr chalk assented and began a somewhat minute discussion upon the weather which lasted until the waiter appeared with the lunch  bring me another drop o’ whisky george said the stranger as the latter was about to leave the room and a little stronger d’ye hear a man might drink this and still be in the band of hope  we thought it wouldn’t do for you to get the chuck out of it after all these years cap’n brisket said george calmly it’s a whisky that’s kept special for teetotalers like you  captain brisket gave a hoarse laugh and winked at mr stobell that gentleman merely pausing to empty his mouth and drink half a glass of beer winked back  been here before sir inquired the captain  mr stobell who was busy again left the reply to mr chalk  several times said the latter i’m very fond of the sea  captain brisket nodded and taking up his glass moved to the end of their table with the air of a man disposed to conversation  there’s not much doing in biddlecombe nowadays he remarked shaking his head trade ain’t what it used to be ships are more than half their time looking for freights and even when they get them they’re hardly worth having  mr chalk started and leaning over whispered to mr tredgold  no harm in it said the latter better leave it to me shipping’s dull then he inquired turning to captain brisket  dull was the reply dull ain’t no name for it  mr tredgold played with a saltspoon and frowned thoughtfully  we’ve been looking round for a ship this morning he said slowly  as passengers inquired the captain staring  as owners put in mr chalk  captain brisket greatly interested drew first his glass and then his chair a yard nearer do you mean that you want to buy one he inquired  well we might if we could get one cheap admitted tredgold cautiously we had some sort of an idea of a cruise to the south pacific pleasure with perhaps a little trading mixed up with it i suppose some of these old schooners can be picked up for the price of an old song  the captain grating his chair along the floor came nearer still so near that mr stobell instinctively put out his right elbow  you’ve met just the right man said captain brisket with a boisterous laugh i know a schooner two hundred and forty tons that is just the identical article you’re looking for good as new and sound as a bell are you going to sail her yourself  no said mr stobell without looking up he ain’t  got a master demanded captain brisket with growing excitement don’t tell me you’ve got a master  why not growled mr stobell who having by this time arrived at the cheese felt that he had more leisure for conversation  because shouted the other hitting the table a thump with his fist that upset half his whisky—because if you haven’t bill brisket’s your man  the three gentlemen received this startling intelligence with such a lack of enthusiasm that captain brisket was fain to cover what in any other man might have been regarded as confusion by ringing the bell for george and inquiring with great sternness of manner why he had not brought him a full glass  we can’t do things in five minutes said mr tredgold after a long and somewhat trying pause first of all we’ve got to get a ship  the craft you want is over the other side of the harbour waiting for you said the captain confidently we’ll ferry over now if you like or if you prefer to go by yourselves do bill brisket is not the man to stand in anyone’s way whether he gets anything out of it or not  hold hard said mr stobell putting up his hand  captain brisket regarded him with a beaming smile mr stobell’s two friends waited patiently  what ud a schooner like that fetch inquired mr stobell  it all depends said brisket of course if i buy—  mr stobell held up his hand again all depends whether you buy it for us or sell it for the man it belongs to i s’pose he said slowly  captain brisket jumped up and to mr chalk’s horror smote the speaker heavily on the back mr stobell clenching a fist the size of a leg of mutton pushed his chair back and prepared to rise  you’re a trump said captain brisket in tones of unmistakable respect that’s what you are lord if i’d got the head for business you have i should be a man of fortune by now  mr stobell who had half risen sat down again and for the first time since his last contract but one a smile played lightly about the corners of his mouth he took another drink and shaking his head slightly as he put the glass down smiled again with the air of a man who has been reproached for making a pun  let me do it for you said captain brisket impressively i’ll tell you where to go without being seen in the matter or letting old todd know that i’m in it ask him a price and bate him down when you’ve got his lowest come to me and give me one pound in every ten i save you  mr tredgold looked at his friends if we do that he said turning to the captain it would be to your interest to buy the ship in any case how are we to be sure she is seaworthy  ah there you are said brisket with an expansive smile you let me buy for you and promise me the master’s berth provided you are satisfied with my credentials common sense’ll tell you i wouldn’t risk my own carcass in a rotten ship  mr stobell nodded approval and captain brisket with unexpected delicacy withdrawing to the window and becoming interested in the harbour conferred for some time with his friends the captain’s offer being accepted subject to certain conditions they settled their bill and made their way to the ferry  there’s the schooner said the captain pointing as they neared the opposite shore the fair emily and the place she is lying at is called todd’s wharf ask for mr todd or better still walk straight on to the wharf and have a look at her the old man’ll see you fast enough  he sprang nimbly ashore as the boat’s head touched the stairs and after extending a hand to mr chalk which was coldly ignored led the way up the steps to the quay  there’s the wharf just along there he said pointing up the road i’ll wait for you at the jack ashore here don’t offer him too much to begin with  i thought of offering a hundred pounds said mr tredgold if the ship’s sound we can’t be very much out over that sum  captain brisket stared at him no don’t do that he said recovering and speaking with great gravity offer him seventy good luck  he watched them up the road and then with a mysterious grin turned into the jack ashore and taking a seat in the bar waited patiently for their return  half an hour passed the captain had smoked one pipe and was half through another he glanced at the clock over the bar and fidgeted as an unpleasant idea that the bargain despite mr tredgold’s ideas as to the value of schooners might have been completed without his assistance occurred to him he took a sip from his glass and then his face softened as the faint sounds of a distant uproar broke upon his ear  what’s that said a customer  the landlord who was glancing at the paper put it down and listened sounds like old todd at it again he said coming round to the front of the bar  the noise came closer it is old todd said another customer and hastily finishing his beer moved with the others to the door captain brisket with a fine air of indifference lounged after them and peering over their shoulders obtained a good view of the approaching disturbance  his three patrons with a hopeless attempt to appear unconcerned were coming down the road while close behind a respectablelooking old gentleman with a long white beard and a voice like a foghorn almost danced with excitement they quickened their pace as they neared the inn and mr chalk throwing appearances to the winds almost dived through the group at the door he was at once followed by mr tredgold but mr stobell black with wrath paused in the doorway  fetch’em out vociferated the old gentleman as the landlord barred the doorway with his arms fetch that redwhiskered one out and i’ll eat him  what’s the matter mr todd inquired the landlord with a glance at his friends what’s he done  done repeated the excitable mr todd  done they come walking on to my wharf as if the place—fetch him out he bawled breaking off suddenly fetch him out and i’ll skin him alive  captain brisket took mr stobell by the cuff and after a slight altercation drew him inside  tell that redwhiskered man to come outside bawled mr todd what’s he afraid of  what have you been doing to him inquired captain brisket turning to the pallid mr chalk  nothing was the reply  is he coming out demanded the terrible voice or have i got to wait here all night why don’t he come outside and i’ll break every bone in his body  mr stobell scratched his head in gloomy perplexity then as his gaze fell upon the smiling countenances of mr todd’s fellowtownsmen his face cleared  he’s an old man he said slowly but if any of you would like to step outside with me for five minutes you’ve only got to say the word you know  nobody manifesting any signs of accepting this offer he turned away and took a seat by the side of the indignant tredgold mr todd after a final outburst began to feel exhausted and forsaking his prey with much reluctance allowed himself to be led away snatches of a strong and copious benediction only partly mellowed by distance fell upon the ears of the listeners  did you offer him the seventy inquired captain brisket turning to mr tredgold  i did said mr chalk plaintively  ah said the captain regarding him thoughtfully perhaps you ought to ha’ made it eighty he’s asking eight hundred for it i understand  mr tredgold turned sharply eight hundred he gasped  the captain nodded and i’m not saying it’s not worth it he said but i might be able to get it for you for six you’d better leave it to me now  mr tredgold at first said he would have nothing more to do with it but under the softening influence of a pipe and a glass was induced to reconsider his decision captain brisket waving farewells from the quay as they embarked on the ferryboat later on in the afternoon bore in his pocket the cards of all three gentlemen together with a commission entrusting him with the preliminary negotiations for the purchase of the fair emily     chapter ix     the church bells were ringing for morning service as mr vickers who had been for a stroll with mr william russell and a couple of ferrets returned home to breakfast contrary to custom the small front room and the kitchen were both empty and breakfast with the exception of a cold herring and the bitter remains of a pot of tea had been cleared away  i’ve known men afore now murmured mr vickers eyeing the herring disdainfully as would take it by the tail and smack’em acrost the face with it  he cut himself a slice of bread and pouring out a cup of cold tea began his meal ever and anon stopping to listen with a puzzled face to a continuous squeaking overhead it sounded like several pairs of new boots all squeaking at once but mr vickers who was a reasonable man and past the age of selfdeception sought for a more probable cause  a particularly aggressive squeak detached itself from the others and sounded on the stairs the resemblance to the noise made by new boots was stronger than ever it was new boots the door opened and mr vickers with a slice of bread arrested halfway to his mouth sat gazing in astonishment at charles vickers clad for the first time in his life in new raiment from top to toe ere he could voice inquiries an avalanche of squeaks descended the stairs and the rest of the children all smartly clad with selina bringing up the rear burst into the room  what is it demanded mr vickers in a voice husky with astonishment a beanfeast  miss vickers who was doing up a glove which possessed more buttons than his own waistcoat looked up and eyed him calmly new clothes—and not before they wanted’em she replied tartly  new clothes repeated her father in a scandalized voice where’d they get’em  shop said his daughter briefly  mr vickers rose and approaching his offspring inspected them with the same interest that he would have bestowed upon a waxworks a certain stiffness of pose combined with the glassy stare which met his gaze helped to favour the illusion  for once in their lives they’re respectable said selina regarding them with moist eyes soap and water they’ve always had bless’em but you’ve never seen’em dressed like this before  before mr vickers could frame a reply a squeaking which put all the others in the shade sounded from above it crossed the floor on hurried excursions to different parts of the room and then hesitating for a moment at the head of the stairs came slowly and ponderously down until mrs vickers looking somewhat nervous stood revealed before her expectant husband in scornful surprise he gazed at a blue cloth dress a black velvet cape trimmed with bugles and a bonnet so aggressively new that it had not yet accommodated itself to mrs vickers’s style of hairdressing  go on he breathed go on don’t mind me what you—you—you’re not going to church  mrs vickers glanced at the books in her hand—also new—and trembled  and why not demanded selina why shouldn’t we  mr vickers took another amazed glance round and his brow darkened  where did you get the money he inquired  saved it said his daughter reddening despite herself  saved it repeated the justlyastonished mr vickers saved it ah out of my money out of the money i toil and moil for—out of the money that ought to be spent on food no wonder you’re always complaining that it ain’t enough i won’t ’ave it d’ye hear i’ll have my rights i’ll——  don’t make so much noise said his daughter who was stooping down to ease one of mrs vickers’s boots you would have fours mother and i told you what it would be  he said that i ought to wear threes by rights said mrs vickers i used to  and i s’pose said mr vickers who had been listening to these remarks with considerable impatience—i s’pose there’s a bran’ new suit o’ clothes and a pair o’ boots and ’arfadozen shirts and a new hat hid upstairs for me  yes they’re hid all right retorted the dutiful miss vickers you go upstairs and amuse yourself looking for’em go and have a game of ’hot boiled beans’ all by yourself  why you must have been stinting me for years continued mr vickers examining the various costumes in detail this is what comes o’ keeping quiet and trusting you—not but what i’ve ’ad my suspicions my own kids taking the bread out o’ my mouth and buying boots with it my own wife going about in a bonnet that’s took me weeks and weeks to earn  his words fell on deaf ears no adjutant getting his regiment ready for a marchpast could have taken more trouble than miss vickers was taking at this moment over her small company caps were set straight and sleeves pulled down her face shone with pride and her eyes glistened as the small fry discoursing in excited whispers filed stiffly out  a sudden cessation of gossip in neighbouring doorways testified to the impression made by their appearance past little startled groups the procession picked its way in squeaking pride with mrs vickers and selina bringing up the rear the children went by with little set important faces but miss vickers’s little bows and pleased smiles of recognition to acquaintances were so ladylike that several untidy matrons retired inside their houses to wrestle grimly with feelings too strong for outside display  pack o’ prancing peacocks said the unnatural mr vickers as the procession wound round the corner  he stood looking vacantly up the street until the gathering excitement of his neighbours aroused new feelings vanity stirred within him and leaning casually against the doorpost he yawned and looked at the chimneypots opposite a neighbour in a pair of corduroy trousers supported by one brace worn diagonally shambled across the road  what’s up he inquired with a jerk of the thumb in the direction of mr vickers’s vanished family  up repeated mr vickers with an air of languid surprise  somebody died and left you a fortin inquired the other  not as i knows of replied mr vickers staring why  why exclaimed the other why new clothes all over i never see such a turnout  mr vickers regarded him with an air of lofty disdain kids must ’ave new clothes sometimes i s’pose he said slowly you wouldn’t ’ave’em going about of a sunday in a ragged shirt and a pair of trowsis would you  the shaft passed harmlessly why not said the other they gin’rally do  mr vickers’s denial died away on his lips in twos and threes his neighbours had drawn gradually near and now stood by listening expectantly the idea of a fortune was common to all of them and they were anxious for particulars  some people have all the luck said a stout matron i’ve ’ad thirteen and buried seven and never ’ad so much as a chiney teapot left me one thing is i never could make up to people for the sake of what i could get out of them i couldn’t not if i tried i must speak my mind free and independent  ah that’s how you get yourself disliked said another lady shaking her head sympathetically  disliked said the stout matron turning on her fiercely what d’ye mean you don’t know what you’re talking about who’s getting themselves disliked  a lot o’ good a chiney teapot would be to you said the other with a ready change of front or any other kind o’ teapot  surprise and indignation deprived the stout matron of utterance  or a milkjug either pursued her opponent following up her advantage or a coffeepot or—  the stout matron advanced upon her and her mien was so terrible that the other retreating to her house slammed the door behind her and continued the discussion from a firstfloor window mint street with the conviction that mr vickers’s tidings could wait swarmed across the road to listen  mr vickers himself listened for a little while to such fragments as came his way and then going indoors sat down amid the remains of his breakfast to endeavour to solve the mystery of the new clothes  he took a short clay pipe from his pocket and igniting a little piece of tobacco which remained in the bowl endeavoured to form an estimate of the cost of each person’s wardrobe the sum soon becoming too large to work in his head he had recourse to pencil and paper and after five minutes’ hard labour sat gazing at a total which made his brain reel the fact that immediately afterwards he was unable to find even a few grains of tobacco at the bottom of his box furnished a contrast which almost made him maudlin  he sat sucking at his cold pipe and indulging in hopeless conjectures as to the source of so much wealth and with a sudden quickening of the pulse wondered whether it had all been spent his mind wandered from selina to mr joseph tasker and almost imperceptibly the absurdities of which young men in love could be capable occurred to him he remembered the extravagances of his own youth and bethinking himself of the sums he had squandered on the future mrs vickers—sums which increased with the compound interest of repetition—came to the conclusion that mr tasker had been more foolish still  it seemed the only possible explanation his eye brightened and knocking the ashes out of his pipe he crossed to the tap and washed his face  if he can’t lend a trifle to the man what’s going to be his fatherinlaw he said cheerfully as he polished his face on a rollertowel i shall tell ’im he can’t have selina that’s all i’ll go and see ’im afore she gets any more out of him  he walked blithely up the road and after shaking off one or two inquirers whose curiosity was almost proof against insult made his way to dialstone lane in an unobtrusive fashion he glided round to the back and opening the kitchen door bestowed a beaming smile upon the startled joseph  busy my lad he inquired  what d’ye want asked mr tasker whose face was flushed with cooking  mr vickers opened the door a little wider and stepping inside closed it softly behind him and dropped into a chair  don’t be alarmed my lad he said benevolently selina’s all right  what d’ye want repeated mr tasker who told you to come round here  mr vickers looked at him in reproachful surprise  i suppose a father can come round to see his future soninlaw he said with some dignity i don’t want to do no interrupting of your work joseph but i couldn’t ’elp just stepping round to tell you how nice they all looked where you got the money from i can’t think  have you gone dotty or what demanded mr tasker who was busy wiping out a saucepan who looked nice  mr vickers shook his head at him and smiled waggishly  ah who he said with much enjoyment i tell you it did my father’s ’art good to see ’em all dressed up like that and when i thought of its all being owing to you sit down at home in comfort with a pipe instead of coming to thank you for it i could not not if you was to have paid me i couldn’t  look ’ere said mr tasker putting the saucepan down with a bang if you can’t talk plain common english you’d better get out i don’t want you ’ere at all as a matter o’ fact but to have you sitting there shaking your silly ’ead and talking a pack o’ nonsense is more than i can stand  mr vickers gazed at him in perplexity do you mean to tell me you haven’t been giving my selina money to buy new clothes for the young’uns he demanded sharply do you mean to tell me that selina didn’t get money out of you to buy herself and ’er mother and all of ’em—except me—a new rigout from top to toe  d’ye think i’ve gone mad or what inquired the amazed mr tasker what d’ye think i should want to buy clothes for your young’uns for that’s your duty and selina too i haven’t given ’er anything except a ring and she lent me the money for that d’ye think i’m made o’ money  all right joseph said mr vickers secretly incensed at this unforeseen display of caution on mr tasker’s part i s’pose the fairies come and put’em on while they was asleep but it’s dry work walking ’ave you got such a thing as a glass o’ water you could give me  the other took a glass from the dresser and ignoring the eye of his prospective fatherinlaw which was glued to a comfortablelooking barrel in the corner filled it to the brim with fair water and handed it to him mr vickers giving him a surly nod took a couple of dainty sips and placed it on the table  it’s very nice water he said sarcastically  is it said mr tasker we don’t drink it ourselves except in tea or coffee the cap’n says it ain’t safe  mr vickers brought his eye from the barrel and glared at him  i s’pose joseph he said after a long pause during which mr tasker was busy making up the fire—i s’pose selina didn’t tell you you wasn’t to tell me about the money  i don’t know what you’re driving at said the other confronting him angrily i haven’t got no money  mr vickers coughed don’t say that joseph he urged softly don’t say that my lad as a matter o’ fact i come round to you interrupting of you in your work and i’m sorry for it—knowing how fond of it you are—to see whether i couldn’t borrow a trifle for a day or two  ho did you commented mr tasker who had opened the oven door and was using his hand as a thermometer  his visitor hesitated it was no use asking for too much on the other hand to ask for less than he could get would be unpardonable folly  if i could lay my hand on a couple o’ quid he said in a mysterious whisper i could make it five in a week  well why don’t you inquired mr tasker who was tenderly sucking the bulb of the thermometer after contact with the side of the oven  it’s the two quid that’s the trouble joseph replied mr vickers keeping his temper with difficulty a little thing like that wouldn’t be much trouble to you i know but to a pore man with a large family like me it’s a’most impossible  mr tasker went outside to the larder and returning with a small joint knelt down and thrust it carefully into the oven  a’most impossible repeated mr vickers with a sigh  what is inquired the other who had not been listening  the halfchoking mr vickers explained  yes o’ course it is assented mr tasker  people what’s got money said the offended mr vickers regarding him fiercely stick to it like leeches now suppose i was a young man keeping company with a gal and her father wanted to borrow a couple o’ quid—a paltry couple o’ thick’uns—what d’ye think i should do  if you was a young man—keeping company with a gal—and ’er father wanted—to borrow a couple of quid off o’ you—what would you do repeated mr tasker mechanically as he bustled to and fro  mr vickers nodded and smiled what should i do he inquired again hopefully  i don’t know i’m sure said the other opening the oven door and peering in how should i  at the imminent risk of something inside giving way under the strain mr vickers restrained himself he breathed hard and glancing out of window sought to regain his equilibrium by becoming interested in a blackbird outside  what i mean to say is he said at length in a trembling voice—what i mean to say is without no roundaboutedness will you lend a ’ardworking man what’s going to be your future fatherinlaw a couple o’ pounds  mr tasker laughed it was not a loud laugh nor yet a musical one it was merely a laugh designed to convey to the incensed mr vickers a strong sense of the absurdity of his request  i asked you a question said the latter gentleman glaring at him  i haven’t got a couple o’ pounds replied mr tasker and if i ’ad there’s nine hundred and ninetynine things i would sooner do with it than lend it to you  mr vickers rose and stood regarding the ignoble creature with profound contempt his features worked and a host of adjectives crowded to his lips  is that your last word joseph he inquired with solemn dignity  i’ll say it all over again if you like said the obliging mr tasker if you want money go and earn it same as i have to don’t come round ’ere cadging on me because it’s no good  mr vickers laughed a dry contemptuous laugh terrible to hear  and that’s the man that’s going to marry my daughter he said slowly that’s the man that’s going to marry into my family don’t you expect me to take you up and point you out as my soninlaw cos i won’t do it if there’s anything i can’t abide it’s stinginess and there’s my gal—my pore gal don’t know your real character wait till i’ve told ’er about this morning and opened ’er eyes wait till—  he stopped abruptly as the door leading to the front room opened and revealed the inquiring face of captain bowers  what’s all this noise about joseph demanded the captain harshly  mr tasker attempted to explain but his explanation involving a character for mr vickers which that gentleman declined to accept on any terms he broke in and began to give his own version of the affair much to joseph’s surprise the captain listened patiently  did you buy all those things joseph he inquired carelessly as mr vickers paused for breath  cert’nly not sir replied mr tasker where should i get the money from  the captain eyed him without replying and a sudden suspicion occurred to him the strange disappearance of the map followed by the sudden cessation of mr chalk’s visits began to link themselves to this tale of unexpected wealth he bestowed another searching glance upon the agitated mr tasker  you haven’t sold anything lately have you he inquired with startling gruffness  i haven’t ’ad nothing to sell sir replied the other in astonishment and i dare say mr vickers here saw a new pair o’ boots on one o’ the young’uns and dreamt all the rest  mr vickers intervened with passion  that’ll do said the captain sharply how dare you make that noise in my house i think that the tale about the clothes is all right he added turning to joseph i saw them go into church looking very smart and you know nothing about it  mr tasker’s astonishment was too genuine to be mistaken and the captain watching him closely transferred his suspicions to a more deserving object mr vickers caught his eye and essayed a smile  dry work talking sir he said gently  captain bowers eyed him steadily have we got any beer joseph he inquired  plenty in the cask sir said mr tasker reluctantly  well keep your eye on it said the captain good morning mr vickers  but disappointment and indignation got the better of mr vickers’s politeness     chapter x     penny for your thoughts uncle said miss drewitt as they sat at dinner an hour or two after the departure of mr vickers  h’m said the captain with a guilty start you’ve been scowling and smiling by turns for the last five minutes said his niece  i was thinking about that man that was here this morning said the captain slowly trying to figure it out if i thought that that girl selina——  he took a draught of ale and shook his head solemnly  you know my ideas about that said prudence  your poor mother was obstinate commented the captain regarding her tolerantly once she got an idea into her head it stuck there and nothing made her more angry than proving to her that she was wrong trying to prove to her i should have said  miss drewitt smiled amiably well you’ve earned half the sum she said now what were you smiling about  didn’t know i was smiling declared the captain  with marvellous tact he turned the conversation to lighthouses a subject upon which he discoursed with considerable fluency until the meal was finished miss drewitt who had a long memory and at least her fair share of curiosity returned to the charge as he smoked half a pipe preparatory to accompanying her for a walk  you’re looking very cheerful she remarked  the captain’s face fell several points am i he said ruefully i didn’t mean to  why not inquired his niece  i mean i didn’t know i was he replied more than usual i mean i always do look fairly cheerful—at least i hope i do there’s nothing to make me look the opposite  miss drewitt eyed him carefully and then passed upstairs to put on her hat relieved of her presence the captain walked to the small glass over the mantelpiece and regarding his telltale features with gloomy dissatisfaction acquired after one or two attempts an expression which he flattered himself defied analysis  he tapped the barometer which hung by the door as they went out and checking a remark which rose to his lips stole a satisfied glance at the face by his side  clark’s farm by the footpaths would be a nice walk said miss drewitt as they reached the end of the lane  the captain started i was thinking of dutton priors he said slowly we could go there by hanger’s lane and home by the road  the footpaths would be nice today urged his niece  you try my way said the captain jovially  have you got any particular reason for wanting to go to dutton priors this afternoon inquired the girl  reason said the captain good gracious no what reason should i have my leg is a trifle stiff today for stiles but still—  miss drewitt gave way at once and taking his arm begged him to lean on her questioning him anxiously as to his fitness for a walk in any direction  walking’ll do it good was the reply as they proceeded slowly down the high street  he took his watch from his pocket and after comparing it with the town clock peered furtively right and left gradually slackening his pace until miss drewitt’s fears for his leg became almost contagious at the old stone bridge spanning the river at the bottom of the high street he paused and resting his arms on the parapet became intent on a derelict punt on the subject of sitting in a craft of that description in midstream catching fish he discoursed at such length that the girl eyed him in amazement  shall we go on she said at length  the captain turned and merely pausing to point out the difference between the lines of a punt and a dinghy with a digression to sampans which included a criticism of the chinese as boatbuilders prepared to depart he cast a swift glance up the road as he did so and miss drewitt’s cheek flamed with sudden wrath as she saw mr edward tredgold hastening towards them in a somewhat pointed manner she called her uncle’s attention to the fact  lor’ bless my soul said that startled mariner so it is well well  if mr tredgold had been advancing on his head he could not have exhibited more surprise  i’m afraid i’m late said tredgold as he came up and shook hands i hope you haven’t been waiting long  the hapless captain coughed loud and long he emerged from a large red pockethandkerchief to find the eye of miss drewitt seeking his  that’s all right my lad he said huskily i’d forgotten about our arrangement did i say this sunday or next  this said mr tredgold bluntly  the captain coughed again and with some pathos referred to the tricks which old age plays with memory as they walked on he regaled them with selected instances  don’t forget your leg uncle said miss drewitt softly  captain bowers gazed at her suspiciously  don’t forget that it’s stiff and put too much strain on it explained his niece  the captain eyed her uneasily but she was talking and laughing with edward tredgold in a most reassuring fashion a choice portion of his programme which owing to the events of the afternoon he had almost resolved to omit clamoured for production he stole another glance at his niece and resolved to risk it  hah he said suddenly stopping short and feeling in his pockets there’s my memory again well of all the—  what’s the matter uncle inquired miss drewitt  i’ve left my pipe at home said the captain in a desperate voice  i’ve got some cigars suggested tredgold  the captain shook his head no i must have my pipe he said decidedly if you two will walk on slowly i’ll soon catch you up  you’re not going all the way back for it exclaimed miss drewitt  let me go said tredgold  the captain favoured him with an inscrutable glance i’ll go he said firmly i’m not quite sure where i left it you go by hanger’s lane i’ll soon catch you up  he set off at a pace which rendered protest unavailing mr tredgold turned and making a mental note of the fact that miss drewitt had suddenly added inches to her stature walked on by her side  captain bowers is very fond of his pipe he said after they had walked a little way in silence  miss drewitt assented nasty things she said calmly  so they are said mr tredgold  but you smoke said the girl  mr tredgold sighed i have often thought of giving it up he said softly and then i was afraid that it would look rather presumptuous  presumptuous repeated miss drewitt  so many better and wiser men than myself smoke exclaimed mr tredgold including even bishops if it is good enough for them it ought to be good enough for me that’s the way i look at it who am i that i should be too proud to smoke who am i that i should try and set my poor ideas above those of my superiors do you see my point of view  miss drewitt made no reply  of course it is a thing that grows on one continued mr tredgold with the air of making a concession it is the first smoke that does the mischief it is a fatal precedent unless perhaps—how pretty that field is over there  miss drewitt looked in the direction indicated very nice she said briefly but what were you going to say  mr tredgold made an elaborate attempt to appear confused i was going to say he murmured gently unless perhaps one begins on coarsecut cavendish rolled in a piece of the margin of the sunday newspaper  miss drewitt suppressed an exclamation i wanted to see where the fascination was she indignantly  and did you inquired mr tredgold smoothly  the girl turned her head and looked at him i have no doubt my uncle gave you full particulars she said bitterly it seems to me that men can gossip as much as women  i tried to stop him said the virtuous mr tredgold  you need not have troubled said miss drewitt loftily it is not a matter of any consequence i am surprised that my uncle should have thought it worth mentioning  she walked on slowly with head erect pausing occasionally to look round for the captain edward tredgold looked too and a feeling of annoyance at the childish stratagems of his wellmeaning friend began to possess him  we had better hurry a little i think he said glancing at the sky the sooner we get to dutton priors the better  why inquired his companion  rain said the other briefly  it won’t rain before evening said miss drewitt confidently uncle said so  perhaps we had better walk faster though urged mr tredgold  miss drewitt slackened her pace deliberately there is no fear of its raining she declared and uncle will not catch us up if we walk fast  a sudden glimpse into the immediate future was vouchsafed to mr tredgold for a fraction of a second the veil was lifted don’t blame me if you get wet through he said with some anxiety  they walked on at a pace which gave the captain every opportunity of overtaking them the feat would not have been beyond the powers of an athletic tortoise but the most careful scrutiny failed to reveal any signs of him  i’m afraid that he is not well said miss drewitt after a long searching glance along the way they had come perhaps we had better go back it does begin to look rather dark  just as you please said edward tredgold with unwonted caution but the nearest shelter is dutton priors  he pointed to a lurid ragged cloud right ahead of them as if in response a low growling rumble sounded overhead  was—was that thunder said miss drewitt drawing a little nearer to him  sounded something like it was the reply  a flash of lightning and a crashing peal that rent the skies put the matter beyond a doubt miss drewitt turning very pale began to walk at a rapid pace in the direction of the village  the other looked round in search of some nearer shelter already the pattering of heavy drops sounded in the lane and before they had gone a dozen paces the rain came down in torrents two or three fields away a small shed offered the only shelter mr tredgold taking his companion by the arm started to run towards it  before they had gone a hundred yards they were wet through but miss drewitt holding her skirts in one hand and shivering at every flash ran until they brought up at a tall gate ornamented with barbed wire behind which stood the shed  the gate was locked and the wire had been put on by a farmer who combined with great ingenuity a fervent hatred of his fellowmen to miss drewitt it seemed insurmountable but aided by mr tredgold and a peal of thunder which came to his assistance at a critical moment she managed to clamber over and reach the shed mr tredgold followed at his leisure with a strip of braid torn from the bottom of her dress  the roof leaked in twenty places and the floor was a puddle but it had certain redeeming features in mr tredgold’s eyes of which the girl knew nothing he stood at the doorway watching the rain  come inside said miss drewitt in a trembling voice you might be struck  mr tredgold experienced a sudden sense of solemn pleasure in this unexpected concern for his safety he turned and eyed her  i’m not afraid he said with great gentleness  no but i am said miss drewitt petulantly and i can never get over that gate alone  mr tredgold came inside and for some time neither of them spoke the rattle of rain on the roof became less deafening and began to drip through instead of forming little jets a patch of blue sky showed  it isn’t much said tredgold going to the door again  miss drewitt checking a sharp retort returned to the door and looked out the patch of blue increased in size the rain ceased and the sun came out birds exchanged congratulations from every tree the girl gathering up her wet skirts walked to the gate leaving her companion to follow  approached calmly and under a fair sky the climb was much easier  i believe that i could have got over by myself after all said miss drewitt as she stood on the other side i suppose that you were in too much of a hurry the last time my dress is ruined  she spoke calmly but her face was clouded from her manner during the rapid walk home mr tredgold was enabled to see clearly that she was holding him responsible for the captain’s awkward behaviour the rain her spoiled clothes and a severe cold in the immediate future he glanced at her ruined hat and the wet straight locks of hair hanging about her face and held his peace  never before on a sunday afternoon had miss drewitt known the streets of binchester to be so full of people she hurried on with bent head looking straight before her trying to imagine what she looked like there was no sign of the captain but as they turned into dialstone lane they both saw a huge shaggy grey head protruding from the small window of his bedroom it disappeared with a suddenness almost startling  thank you said miss drewitt holding out her hand as she reached the door goodbye  mr tredgold said goodbye and with a furtive glance at the window above departed miss drewitt opening the door looked round an empty room then the kitchen door opened and the face of mr tasker full of concern appeared  did you get wet miss he inquired  miss drewitt ignored the question where is captain bowers she asked in a clear penetrating voice  the face of mr tasker fell he’s gone to bed with a headache miss he replied  headache repeated the astonished miss drewitt when did he go  about ’arf an hour ago said mr tasker just after the storm i suppose that’s what caused it though it seems funny considering what a lot he must ha’ seen at sea he said he’d go straight to bed and try and sleep it off and i was to ask you to please not to make a noise  miss drewitt swept past him and mounted the stairs at the captain’s door she paused but the loud snoring of a determined man made her resolve to postpone her demands for an explanation to a more fitting opportunity tired wet and angry she gained her own room and threw herself thoughtlessly into that famous old chippendale chair which in accordance with mr tredgold’s instructions had been placed against the wall  the captain started in his sleep     chapter xi     mr chalk’s anxiety during the negotiations for the purchase of the fair emily kept him oscillating between tredgold and stobell until those gentlemen fled at his approach and instructed their retainers to make untruthful statements as to their whereabouts daily letters from captain brisket stated that he was still haggling with mr todd over the price and mr chalk quailed as he tried to picture the scene with that doughty champion  three times at the earnest instigation of his friends who pointed out the necessity of keeping up appearances had he set out to pay a visit to dialstone lane and three times had he turned back halfway as he realized the difficult nature of his task as well ask a poacher to call on a gamekeeper the morning after a raid  captain bowers anxious to see him and sound him with a few carefully prepared questions noted his continued absence with regret despairing at last of a visit from mr chalk he resolved to pay one himself  mr chalk who was listening to his wife rose hastily at his entrance and in great confusion invited him to a chair which was already occupied by mrs chalk’s workbasket the captain took another and after listening to an incoherent statement about the weather shook his head reproachfully at mr chalk  i thought something must have happened to you he said why it must be weeks since i’ve seen you  weeks said mrs chalk suddenly alert  why he went out the day before yesterday to call on you  yes said mr chalk with an effort so i did but halfway to yours i got a nail in my shoe and had to come home  home exclaimed his wife why you were gone two hours and thirtyfive minutes  it was very painful said mr chalk as the captain stared in openeyed astonishment at this exact timekeeping one time i thought that i should hardly have got back  but you didn’t say anything about it persisted his wife  i didn’t want to alarm you my dear said mr chalk  mrs chalk looked at him but except for a long shivering sigh which the visitor took for sympathy made no comment  i often think that i must have missed a great deal by keeping single said the latter it must be very pleasant when you’re away to know that there is somebody at home counting the minutes until your return  mr chalk permitted himself one brief wondering glance in the speaker’s direction and then gazed out of window  there’s no companion like a wife continued the captain nobody else can quite share your joys and sorrows as she can i’ve often thought how pleasant it must be to come home from a journey and tell your wife all about it where you’ve been what you’ve done and what you’re going to do  mr chalk stole another look at him mrs chalk somewhat suspicious followed his example  it’s a pity you never married captain bowers she said at length most men seem to do all they can to keep things from their wives but one of these days——  she finished the sentence by an expressive glance at her husband captain bowers suddenly enlightened hastened to change the subject  i haven’t seen tredgold or stobell either he said gazing fixedly at mr chalk  they—they were talking about you only the other day said that gentleman nervously is miss drewitt well  quite well said the captain briefly i was beginning to think you had all left binchester he continued gone for a sea voyage or something  mr chalk laughed uneasily i thought that joseph wasn’t looking very well the last time i saw you he said with an imploring glance at the captain to remind him of the presence of mrs chalk  joseph’s all right replied the other so is the parrot  mr chalk started and said that he was glad to hear it and sat trying to think of a safe subject for conversation  joseph’s a nice parrot he said at last the parrot’s a nice lad i mean  thomas said mrs chalk  josephisanicelad said mr chalk recovering himself i have often thought——  the sentence was never completed being interrupted by a thundering rattattat at the front door followed by a pealing at the bell which indicated that the visitor was manfully following the printed injunction to ring also the door was opened and a man’s voice was heard in the halla loud confident voice at the sound of which mr chalk with one horrified glance in the direction of captain bowers sank back in his chair and held his breath  captain brisket said the maid opening the door  the captain came in with a light bustling step and having shaken mr chalk’s hand with great fervour and acknowledged the presence of captain bowers and mrs chalk by two spasmodic jerks of the head sat boltupright on the edge of a chair and beamed brightly upon the horrified chalk  i’ve got news he said hoarsely  news said the unfortunate mr chalk faintly  ah said brisket nodding news i’ve got her at last  mrs chalk started  i’ve got her continued captain brisket with an air of great enjoyment and a fine job i had of it i can tell you old todd said he couldn’t bear parting with her once or twice i thought he meant it  mr chalk made a desperate effort to catch his eye but in vain it was fixed in reminiscent joy on the ceiling  we haggled about her for days continued brisket but at last i won the fair emily is yours sir  the fair who cried mrs chalk in a terrible voice emily who emily what  captain brisket turned and regarded her in amazement  emily who repeated mrs chalk  why it’s— began brisket  h’sh said mr chalk desperately it’s a secret  it’s a secret said captain brisket nodding calmly at mrs chalk  wrath and astonishment held her for the moment breathless mr chalk caught between his wife and captain bowers fortified himself with memories of the early martyrs and gave another warning glance at brisket for nearly two minutes that undaunted mariner met the gaze of mrs chalk without flinching  a—a secret gasped the indignant woman at last as she turned to her husband you sit there and dare to tell me that  it isn’t my secret said mr chalk else i should tell you at once  it isn’t his secret said the complaisant brisket  mrs chalk controlled herself by a great effort and turning to captain brisket addressed him almost calmly was it emily that came whistling over the gardenwall the other night she inquired  whis— said the hapless brisket making a noble effort he finished the word with a cough and gazed with protruding eyes at mr chalk the appearance of that gentleman sobered him at once  no he said slowly  how do you know inquired mrs chalk  because she can’t whistle replied captain brisket feeling his way carefully and what’s more she wouldn’t if she could she’s been too well brought up for that  he gave a cunning smile at mr chalk to which that gentleman having decided at all hazards to keep the secret from captain bowers made a ghastly response and nodded to him to proceed  what’s she got to do with my husband demanded mrs chalk her voice rising despite herself  i’m coming to that said brisket thoughtfully as he gazed at the floor in all the agonies of composition mr chalk is trying to get her a new place  new place said mrs chalk in a choking voice  captain brisket nodded she ain’t happy where she is he explained and mr chalk—out o’ pure goodnature and kindness of heart—is trying to get her another and i honour him for it  he looked round triumphantly mr chalk sitting openmouthed was regarding him with the fascinated gaze of a rabbit before a boaconstrictor captain bowers was listening with an appearance of interest which in more favourable circumstances would have been very flattering  you said cried mrs chalk—you said to my husband ’the fair emily is yours’  so i did said brisket anxiously—so i did and what i say i stick to when i said that the—that emily was his i meant it i don’t say things i don’t mean that isn’t bill brisket’s way  and you said just now that he was getting her a place mrs chalk reminded him grimly  mr chalk understands what i mean said captain brisket with dignity when i said ’she is yours’ i meant that she is coming here  ooh said mrs chalk breathlessly oh indeed oh is she  that is if her mother’ll let her come pursued the enterprising brisket with a look of great artfulness at mr chalk to call his attention to the bridge he was building for him but the old woman’s been laid up lately and talks about not being able to spare her  mrs chalk sat back helplessly in her chair and gazed from her husband to captain brisket and from captain brisket back to her husband captain brisket redfaced and confident sat upright on the edge of his chair as though inviting inspection mr chalk plucked nervously at his fingers captain bowers suddenly broke silence  what’s her tonnage he inquired abruptly turning to brisket  two hundred and for——  captain brisket stopped dead and rubbing his nose hard with his forefinger gazed thoughtfully at captain bowers  the fair emily is a ship said the latter to mrs chalk  a ship cried the bewildered woman a ship living with her invalid mother and coming to my husband to get her a place are you trying to screen him too  it’s a ship repeated captain bowers sternly as he sought in vain to meet the eye of mr chalk a craft of two hundred and something tons for some reason—best known to himself—mr chalk wants the matter kept secret  it—it isn’t my secret faltered mr chalk  where’s she lying said captain bowers  mr chalk hesitated biddlecombe he said at last  captain brisket laughed noisily and smacking his leg with his open hand smiled broadly upon the company no response being forthcoming he laughed again for his own edification and sat goodhumouredly waiting events  is this true thomas demanded mrs chalk  yes my dear was the reply  then why didn’t you tell me instead of sitting there listening to a string of falsehoods  i—i wanted to give you a surprise—a pleasant little surprise said mr chalk with a timid glance at captain bowers i have bought a share in a schooner to go for a little cruise just a jaunt for pleasure  tredgold stobell and chalk said captain bowers very distinctly  i wanted to keep it secret until it had been repainted and done up continued mr chalk watching his wife’s face anxiously and then captain brisket came in and spoilt it  that’s me ma’am said the gentleman mentioned shaking his head despairingly that’s bill brisket all over i come blundering in and the first thing i do is to blurt out secrets then when i try to smooth it over——  mrs chalk paid no heed alluding to the schooner as our yacht she at once began to discuss the subject of the voyage the dresses she would require and the rival merits of shutting the house up or putting the servants on board wages under her skilful hands aided by a few suggestions of captain brisket’s the fair emily was in the short space of twenty minutes transformed into one of the most luxurious yachts that ever sailed the seas mr chalk’s heart failed him as he listened his thoughts were with his partners in the enterprise and he trembled as he thought of their comments  it will do mrs stobell a lot of good said his wife suddenly  mr chalk about to speak checked himself and blew his nose instead the romance of the affair was beginning to evaporate he sat in a state of great dejection until captain bowers having learned far more than he had anticipated shook hands with impressive gravity and took his departure  the captain walked home deep in thought with a prolonged stare at the windows of tredgold’s office as he passed the present whereabouts of the map was now quite clear and at the top of dialstone lane he stopped and put his hand to his brow in consternation as he thought of the elaborate expedition that was being fitted out for the recovery of the treasure  prudence who was sitting in the window reading looked up at his entrance and smiled  edward tredgold has been in to see you she remarked  the captain nodded couldn’t he stop he inquired  i don’t know said his niece i didn’t see him i was upstairs when he came  captain bowers looked perturbed didn’t you come down he inquired  i sent down word that i had a headache said miss drewitt carelessly  despite his sixty odd years the captain turned a little bit pink i hope you are better now he said at last  oh yes said his niece it wasn’t very bad it’s strange that i should have a headache so soon after you looks as though they’re in the family doesn’t it  somewhat to the captain’s relief she took up her book again without waiting for a reply and sat reading until mr tasker brought in the tea the captain who was in a very thoughtful mood drank cup after cup in silence and it was not until the meal was cleared away and he had had a few soothing whiffs at his pipe that he narrated the events of the afternoon  there said prudence her eyes sparkling with indignation what did i say didn’t i tell you that those three people would be taking a holiday soon the idea of mr tredgold venturing to come round here this afternoon  he knows nothing about it protested the captain  miss drewitt shook her head obstinately we shall see she remarked the idea of those men going after your treasure after you had said it wasn’t to be touched why it’s perfectly dishonest  the captain blew a cloud of smoke from his mouth and watched it disperse perhaps they won’t find it he murmured  they’ll find it said his niece confidently why shouldn’t they this captain brisket will find the island and the rest will be easy  they might not find the island said the captain blowing a cloud so dense that his face was almost hidden some of these little islands have been known to disappear quite suddenly volcanic action you know what are you smiling at he added sharply  thoughts said miss drewitt clasping her hands round her knee and smiling again i was thinking how odd it would be if the island sank just as they landed upon it     chapter xii     mr chalk when halfawake next morning tried to remember mr stobell’s remarks of the night before fully awake he tried to forget them he remembered too with a pang that tredgold had been content to enact the part of a listener and had made no attempt to check the somewhat unusual fluency of the aggrieved mr stobell the latter’s last instructions were that mrs chalk was to be told without loss of time that her presence on the schooner was not to be thought of  with all this on his mind mr chalk made but a poor breakfast and his appetite was not improved by his wife’s enthusiastic remarks concerning the voyage breakfast over she dispatched a note to mrs stobell by the housemaid with instructions to wait for a reply altogether six notes passed during the morning and mr chalk who hazarded a fair notion as to their contents became correspondingly gloomy  we’re to go up there at five said his wife after reading the last note mr stobell will be at tea at that time and we’re to drop in as though by accident  what for inquired mr chalk affecting surprise go up where  to talk to mr stobell said his wife grimly fancy poor mrs stobell says that she is sure he won’t let her come i wish he was my husband that’s all  mr chalk muttered something about doing a little gardening  you can do that another time said mrs chalk coldly i’ve noticed you’ve been very fond of gardening lately  the allusion was too indirect to contest but mr chalk reddened despite himself and his wife after regarding his confusion with a questioning eye left him to his own devices and his conscience  mr stobell and his wife had just sat down to tea when they arrived and mrs stobell rising from behind a huge teapot gave a little cry of surprise as her friend entered the room and kissed her affectionately  well who would have thought of seeing you she cried sit down  mrs chalk sat down at the large table opposite mr stobell mr chalk without glancing in his wife’s direction seated himself by that gentleman’s side  well weren’t you surprised inquired mrs chalk loudly as her hostess passed her a cup of tea  surprised said mrs stobell curiously  why hasn’t mr stobell told you exclaimed mrs chalk  told me repeated mrs stobell glancing indignantly at the wideopen eyes of mr chalk told me what  it was now mrs chalk’s turn to appear surprised and she did it so well that mr chalk choked in his teacup about the yachting trip she said with a glance at her husband that made his choking take on a ventriloquial effect of distance  he—he didn’t say anything to me about it said mrs stobell timidly  she glanced at her husband but mr stobell taking an enormous bite out of a slice of bread and butter made no sign  it’ll do you a world of good said mrs chalk affectionately it’ll put a little colour in your cheeks  mrs stobell flushed she was a faded little woman faded eyes faded hair faded cheeks it was even whispered that her love for mr stobell was beginning to fade  and i don’t suppose you’ll mind the seasickness after you get used to it said the considerate mr chalk and the storms and the cyclones and fogs and collisions and all that sort of thing  if you can stand it she can said his wife angrily  but i don’t understand said mrs stobell appealingly what yachting trip  mrs chalk began to explain mr stobell helped himself to another slice and except for a single glance under his heavy brows at mr chalk appeared to be oblivious of his surroundings  it sounds very nice said mrs stobell after her friend had finished her explanation perhaps it might do me good i have tried a great many things  mr stobell ought to have taken you for a voyage long before said mrs chalk with conviction still better late than never  the only thing is said mr chalk speaking with an air of great benevolence that if the sea didn’t suit mrs stobell she would be unable to get away from it and of course it might upset her very much  mr stobell wiped some crumbs from his moustache and looked up  no it won’t he said briefly  is she a good sailor queried mr chalk somewhat astonished at such a remark from that quarter  don’t know said mr stobell passing his cup up but this trip won’t upset her—she ain’t going  mrs chalk exclaimed loudly and exchanged glances of consternation with mrs stobell mr stobell having explained the position took some more bread and butter and munched placidly  don’t you think it would do her good said mrs chalk at last  might said mr stobell slowly and then again it mightn’t  but there’s no harm in trying persisted mrs chalk  mr stobell made no reply having reached his fifth slice he was now encouraging his appetite with apricot jam  and it’s so cheap continued mrs chalk  that’s the way i look at it if she shuts up the house and gets rid of the servants same as i am going to do it will save a lot of money  she glanced at mr stobell whose slowly working jaws and knitted brows appeared to indicate deep thought and then gave a slight triumphant nod at his wife  servants are so expensive she murmured really i shouldn’t be surprised if we saved money on the whole affair and then think of her health she has never quite recovered from that attack of bronchitis she has never looked the same woman since think of your feelings if anything happened to her nothing would bring her back to you if once she went  went where inquired mr stobell who was not attending very much  if she died i mean said mrs chalk shortly  we’ve all got to die some day said the philosophic mr stobell she’s fortysix  mrs stobell interposed not till september robert she said almost firmly  it wouldn’t be nice to be buried at sea remarked mr chalk contributing his mite to the discussion of course it’s very impressive but to be left down there all alone while the ship sails on must be very hard  mrs stobell’s eyes began to get large i’m feeling quite well she gasped  yes dear said mrs chalk with a threatening glance at her husband of course we know that but a voyage would do you good you can’t deny that  mrs stobell fumbling for her handkerchief said in a tremulous voice that she had no wish to deny it mr stobell appealed to by the energetic mrs chalk admitted at once that it might do his wife good but that it wouldn’t him  we’re going to be three jolly bachelors he declared and first nudging mr chalk to attract his attention deliberately winked at him  oh indeed exclaimed mrs chalk drawing herself up but you forget that i am coming  two jolly bachelors then said the undaunted stobell  no said mrs chalk shaking her head i am not going alone if mrs stobell can’t come i would sooner stay at home  mr stobell’s face cleared his mouth relaxed and his dull eyes got almost kindly with the idea of calling the attention of mr chalk to the pleasing results of a little firmness he placed his foot upon that gentleman’s toe and bore heavily  best place for you he said to mrs chalk there’s no place like home for ladies you can have each other to tea every day if you like in fact there’s no reason—— he paused and looked at his wife half doubtful that he was conceding too much—there’s no reason why you shouldn’t sleep at each other’s sometimes  he helped himself to some cake and rendered polite by goodnature offered some to mrs chalk  mind i shall not go unless mrs stobell goes said the latter waving the plate away impatiently that i am determined upon  mr chalk feeling that appearances required it ventured on a mild—a very mild—remonstrance  and he continued mrs chalk sternly indicating her husband with a nod doesn’t go without me—not a single step not an inch of the way  mr chalk collapsed and sat staring at her in dismay mr stobell placing both hands on the table pushed his chair back and eyed her disagreeably  it seems to me—— he began  i know said mrs chalk speaking with some rapidity—i know just how it seems to you but that’s how it is if you want my husband to go you have got to have me too and if you have me you have got to have your wife and if——  what is there any more of you coming demanded mr stobell with great bitterness  mrs chalk ignored the question my husband wouldn’t be happy without me she said primly would you thomas  no said mr chalk with a gulp  we—we’re going a long way said mr stobell after a long pause  longer the better retorted mrs chalk  we’re going among savages continued mr stobell casting about for arguments cannibal savages  they won’t eat her said mrs chalk with a passing glance at the scanty proportions of her friend not while you’re about  i don’t like to take my wife into danger said mr stobell with surly bashfulness i’m—i’m too fond of her for that and she don’t want to come do you alice  no said mrs stobell dutifully but i want to share your dangers robert  say ’yes’ or ’no’ without any trimmings commanded her husband as he intercepted a look passing between her and mrs chalk doyouwantto come  mrs stobell trembled i don’t want to prevent mr chalk from going she murmured  never mind about him said mr stobell  do—you—want—to—come  yes said mrs stobell  her husband hardly able to believe his ears gazed at her in bewilderment very well then he said in a voice that made the teacups rattle come  he sat with bent brows gazing at the table as mrs chalk her face wreathed in triumphant smiles began to discuss yachting costumes and other necessities of ocean travel with the quivering mrs stobell unable to endure it any longer he rose and in a voice by no means alluring invited mr chalk into the garden to smoke a pipe mr chalk helping himself to two pieces of cake as evidence said that he had not yet finished his tea owing partly to lack of appetite and partly to the face which mr stobell pressed to the window every other minute to entice him out he made but slow progress  the matter was discussed next day as they journeyed down to biddlecombe with mr tredgold to complete the purchase of the schooner the views of the latter gentleman coinciding so exactly with those of mr stobell that mr chalk was compelled to listen to the same lecture twice  under this infliction his spirits began to droop nor did they revive until from the ferryboat his eyes fell upon the masts of the fair emily and the trim figure of captain brisket standing at the foot of the steps awaiting their arrival  we’ve had a stroke of good luck gentlemen said brisket in a husky whisper as they followed him up the steps see that man  he pointed to a thin dismallooking man standing a yard or two away who was trying to appear unconscious of their scrutiny  peter duckett said brisket in the same satisfied whisper  mr stobell ever willing for a free show stared at the dismal man and groped in the recesses of his memory the name seemed familiar  the man who ate three dozen hardboiled eggs in four minutes he asked with a little excitement natural in the circumstances  captain brisket stared at him no peter duckett the finest mate that ever sailed he said with a flourish we’re lucky to have the chance of getting him i can tell you to see him handle sailormen is a revelation to see him handle a ship——  he broke off and shook his head with the air of a man who despaired of doing justice to his subject these are the gentlemen peter he said introducing them with a wave of his hand  mr duckett raised his cap and tugging at a small patch of reddishbrown hair strangely resembling a doormat in texture which grew at the base of his chin cleared his throat and said it was a fine morning  not much of a talker is peter said the genial brisket he’s a doer that’s what he isa doer now if you’re willing—and i hope you are— he’ll come aboard with us and talk the matter over  this proposition being assented to after a little delay on the part of mr stobell who appeared to think mr duckett’s lack of connection with the hardboiled eggs somewhat suspicious they proceeded to todd’s wharf and made a thorough inspection of the schooner mr chalk’s eyes grew bright and his step elastic he roamed from forecastle to cabin and from cabin to galley and his practice with the crow’snest in dialstone lane standing him in good stead wound up by ascending to the masthead and waving to his astonished friends below  mr todd came on board as he regained the deck and stroking his white beard regarded him with an air of benevolent interest  there’s no illfeeling he said as mr chalk eyed his outstretched hand somewhat dubiously you’re a hard nut that’s what you are and i pity anybody that has the cracking of you a man that could come and offer me seventy pounds for a craft like this—seventy pounds mind you he added with a rising colour as he turned to the others seventy pounds and a face like a baby why when i think of it damme if i  don’t——        captain brisket laid his hand on his arm and with soothing words        led him below his voice was heard booming in the cabin until at        length it ended in a roar of laughter and captain brisket        appearing at the companion beckoned them below with a whispered        injunction to mr chalk to keep as much in the background as        possible  the business was soon concluded and mr chalk’s eye brightened again as he looked on his new property captain brisket in high goodhumour began to talk of accommodation and among other things suggested a scheme of cutting through the bulkhead at the foot of the companion ladder and building a commodious cabin with three berths in the hold  there are two ladies coming said mr chalk  captain brisket rubbed his chin i’d forgotten that he said slowly two did you say  it doesn’t matter said mr stobell fixing him with his left eye and slowly veiling the right you go on with them alterations one of the ladies can have your stateroom and the other the mate’s bunk  where are captain brisket and the mate to sleep inquired mr chalk  anywhere replied mr stobell with the crew if they like  captain brisket looking suddenly very solemn shook his head and said that it was impossible he spoke in moving terms of the danger to discipline and called upon mr duckett to confirm his fears meantime mr stobell opening his right eye slowly winked with the left  you go on with them alterations he repeated  captain brisket started and reflected a nod from mr tredgold and a significant gesture in the direction of the unconscious mr chalk decided him very good gentlemen he said cheerfully i’m in your hands and peter ducket’ll do what i do it’s settled he’s coming i suppose  mr tredgold after a long look at the anxious face of mr duckett said yes and then at captain brisket’s suggestion the party adjourned to the jack ashore where in a little room upstairs not much larger than the schooner’s cabin the preparations for the voyage were discussed in detail  and mind peter said captain brisket to his friend as the pair strolled along by the harbour after their principals had departed the less you say about this the better we don’t want any biddlecombe men in it  why not inquired the other  because replied brisket lowering his voice there’s more in this than meets the eye they’re not the sort to go on a cruise to the islands for pleasure—except chalk that is i’ve been keeping my ears open and there’s something afoot d’ye take me  mr duckett nodded shrewdly  i’ll pick a crew for ’em said brisket a man here and a man there biddlecombe men ain’t tough enough and now what about that whisky you’ve been talking so much about     chapter xiii     further secrecy as to the projected trip being now useless mr tredgold made the best of the situation and talked freely concerning it to the astonished edward he spoke feelingly of seeing the world before the insidious encroachments of age should render it impossible to captain bowers whom he met in the high street he discussed destinations with the air of a man whose mind was singularly open on the subject if he had any choice it appeared that it was in the direction of north america  you might do worse said the captain grimly  chalk said mr tredgold meditatively chalk favours the south i think that he got rather excited by your description of the islands there he is a very—  if you are going to try and find that island i spoke about interrupted the captain impatiently i warn you solemnly that you are wasting both your time and your money if i had known of this voyage i would have told you so before if you take my advice you’ll sell your schooner and stick to business you understand  mr tredgold laughed easily we may look for it if we go that way he said i believe that chalk has bought a trowel in case we run up against it he has got a romantic belief in coincidences you know  very good said the captain turning away only don’t blame me whatever happens you can’t say i have not warned you  he clutched his stick by the middle and strode off down the road mr tredgold gazing after his retreating figure with a tolerant smile wondered whether he would take his share of the treasure when it was offered to him  the anxiety of miss vickers at this period was intense particulars of the purchase of the schooner were conveyed to her by letter but the feminine desire of talking the matter over with somebody became too strong to be denied she even waylaid mr stobell one evening and despite every discouragement insisted upon walking part of the way home with him he sat for hours afterwards recalling the titbits of a summary of his personal charms with which she had supplied him  mr chalk spent the time in preparations for the voyage purchasing among other necessaries a stock of firearms of all shapes and sizes with which he practised in the garden most marksmen diminish gradually the size of their target but mr chalk after starting with a medicinebottle at a hundred yards wound up with the greenhouse at fifteen mrs chalk who was inside at the time tending an invalid geranium acted as marker and although mr chalk proved by actual measurement that the bullet had not gone within six inches of her the range was closed  by the time the alterations on the fair emily were finished the summer was nearly at an end and it was not until the 20th of august that the travellers met on binchester platform mrs chalk in a smart yachting costume with a whitepeaked cap stood by a pile of luggage discoursing to an admiring circle of friends who had come to see her off she had shut up her house and paid off her servants and her pity for mrs stobell whose husband had forbidden such a course in her case provided a suitable and agreeable subject for conversation mrs stobell had economised in quite a different direction and mrs chalk gazed in indignant pity at the one small box and the gladstone bag which contained her wardrobe  she don’t want to dress up on shipboard said mr stobell  mrs chalk turned and eyed her friend’s costume—a plain tweed coat and skirt in which she had first appeared the spring before last  if we’re away a year she said decidedly she’ll be in rags before we get back  mr stobell said that fortunately they would be in a warm climate and turned to greet the tredgolds who had just arrived then the train came in and mr chalk appearing suddenly from behind the luggage where he had been standing since he had first caught sight of the small anxious face of selina vickers on the platform entered the carriage and waved cheery adieus to binchester  to the eyes of mr chalk and his wife biddlecombe appeared to have put on holiday attire for the occasion with smiling satisfaction they led the way to the ferry mrs chalk’s costume exciting so much attention that the remainder of the party hung behind to watch edward tredgold fasten his bootlace it took two boats to convey the luggage to the schooner and the cargo of the smaller craft shifting in midstream the boatman pulled the remainder of the way with a large portion of it in his lap unfortunately his mouth was free  mr chalk could not restrain a cry of admiration as he clambered on board the fair emily the deck was as white as that of a manofwar and her brasswork twinkled in the sun white paint work and the honest and healthy smell of tar completed his satisfaction his chest expanded as he sniffed the breeze and with a slight nautical roll paced up and down the spotless deck  and now said captain brisket after a couple of sturdy seamen had placed the men’s luggage in the new cabin which of you ladies is going to have my stateroom and which the mate’s bunk  mrs chalk started she had taken it for granted that she was to have the stateroom she turned and eyed her friend anxiously  the bunk seems to get the most air said mrs stobell and it’s nearer the ladder in case of emergencies  you have it dear said mrs chalk tenderly i’m not nervous  but you are so fond of fresh air said mrs stobell with a longing glance at the stateroom i don’t like to be selfish  you’re not said mrs chalk with conviction  chalk and i will toss for it said mr stobell who had been listening with some impatience he spun a coin in the air and mr chalk winning the bunk for his indignant wife was at some pains to dilate upon its manifold advantages mrs stobell with a protesting smile had her things carried into the stateroom while mrs chalk stood by listening coldly to plans for putting her heavy luggage in the hold  what time do we start inquired tredgold senior moving towards the companionladder  four o’clock sir replied brisket  mr stobell his heavy features halflit by an unwonted smile turned and surveyed his friends i’ve ordered a little feed at the king of hanover at halfpast one he said awkwardly we’ll be back on board by halfpast three captain  captain brisket bowed and the party were making preparations for departure when a hitch was caused by the behaviour of mrs chalk who was still brooding over the affair of the stateroom in the plainest of plain terms she declared that she did not want any luncheon and preferred to stay on board her gloom seemed to infect the whole party mr stobell in particular being so dejected that his wife eyed him in amazement  it’ll spoil it for all of us if you don’t come he said with bashful surliness why i arranged the lunch more for you than anybody it’ll be our last meal on shore  mrs chalk said that she had had so many meals on shore that she could afford to miss one and mr stobell after eyeing her for some time in a manner strangely at variance with his words drew his wife to one side and whispered fiercely in her ear  well i sha’n’t go without her said mrs stobell rejoining the group what with losing that nice airy bunk and getting that nasty stuffy stateroom i don’t feel like eating  mrs chalk’s countenance cleared don’t you like it dear she said affectionately change by all means if you don’t never mind about their stupid tossing  mrs stobell changed and mr tredgold senior after waiting a decent interval for the sake of appearances entreated both ladies to partake of the luncheon unable to resist any longer mrs chalk gave way and in the ship’s boat propelled by the brawny arms of two of the crew went ashore with the others  luncheon was waiting for them in the coffeeroom of the inn and the table was brave with flowers and bottles of champagne impressed by the occasion george the waiter attended upon them with unusual decorum and the landlady herself entered the room two or three times to see that things were proceeding properly  here’s to our next meal on shore said mr chalk raising his glass and nodding solemnly at edward  that will be tea for me said the latter i shall come back here i expect and take a solitary cup to your memory let me have a word as soon as you can  you ought to get a cable from sydney in about six or seven months said his father  his son nodded don’t trouble about any expressions of affection he urged they’d come expensive if you find me dead of overwork when you come back——  i shall contest the certificate said his father with unwonted frivolity  i wonder how we shall sleep tonight said mrs stobell with a little shiver fancy only a few planks between us and the water  that won’t keep me awake said mrs chalk decidedly but i shouldn’t sleep a wink if i had left my girls in the house the same as you have i should lie awake all night wondering what tricks they’d be up to  but you’ve left your house unprotected said mrs stobell  the house won’t run away retorted her friend and i’ve sent all my valuables to the bank and to friends to take care of and had all my carpets taken up and beaten and warehoused i can’t imagine what mr stobell was thinking of not to let you do the same  there’s a lot as would like to know what i’m thinking of sometimes remarked mr stobell with a satisfied air  mrs chalk glanced at him superciliously but remembering that he was her host refrained from the only comments she felt to be suitable to the occasion under the tactful guidance of edward tredgold the conversation was led to shipwrecks fires at sea and other subjects of the kind comforting to the landsman mr chalk favouring them with a tale of a giant octopus culled from captain bowers’s collection which made mrs stobell’s eyes dilate with horror  you won’t see any octopuses said her husband you needn’t worry about them  he got up from the table and crossing to the window stood with his hands behind his back smoking one of the king of hanover’s cigars  very good smoke this he said taking the cigar from his mouth and inspecting it critically i think i’ll take a box or two with me  just what i was thinking said mr jasper tredgold let’s go down and see the landlord  mr stobell followed him slowly from the room leaving mr chalk and edward to entertain the ladies the former gentleman clad in a neat serge suit an open collar and a knotted necktie leaned back in his chair puffing contentedly at one of the cigars which had excited the encomiums of his friends he was just about to help himself to a little more champagne when mr stobell reappearing at the door requested him to come and give them the benefit of his opinion in the matter of cigars  they don’t seem up to sample he said with a growl and you’re a good judge of a cigar  mr chalk rose and followed him downstairs where to his great astonishment he was at once seized by mr tredgold and led outside  anything wrong he demanded  we must get to the ship at once said tredgold in an excited whisper the men  mr chalk much startled clapped his hands to his head and spoke of going back for his hat  never mind about your hat said stobell impatiently we haven’t got ours either  he took mr chalk’s other arm and started off at a rapid pace  what is the matter inquired mr chalk looking from one to the other  message from captain brisket to go on board at once or he won’t be answerable for the consequences replied tredgold in a thrilling whisper and above all to bring mr chalk to quiet the men  mr chalk turned a ghastly white is it mutiny he faltered already  something o’ the sort said stobell  despite his friend’s great strength mr chalk for one moment almost brought him to a standstill then in a tremulous voice he spoke of going to the police  we don’t want the police said tredgold sharply if you’re afraid chalk you’d better go back and stay with the ladies while we settle the affair  mr chalk flushed and holding his head erect said no more mr duckett and a waterman were waiting for them at the stairs and barely giving them time to jump in pushed off and pulled with rapid strokes to the schooner mr chalk’s heart failed him as they drew near and he saw men moving rapidly about her deck his last thoughts as he clambered over the side were of his wife  in blissful ignorance of his proceedings mrs chalk having adjusted her cap in the glass and drawn on her gloves sat patiently awaiting his return she even drew a goodnatured comparison between the time spent on choosing cigars and bonnets  there’s plenty of time she said in reply to an uneasy remark of mrs stobell’s it’s only just three and we don’t sail until four what is that horrid clanking noise  some craft getting up her anchor said edward going to the window and leaning out why halloa  what’s the matter said both ladies  edward drew in his head and regarded them with an expression of some bewilderment  it’s the fair emily he said slowly and she’s hoisting her sails  just trying the machinery to see that it’s all right i suppose said mrs chalk my husband said that captain brisket is a very careful man  edward tredgold made no reply he glanced first at three hats standing in a row on the sideboard and then at the ladies as they came to the window and gazed with innocent curiosity at the schooner even as they looked she drew slowly ahead and a boat piled up with luggage which had been lying the other side of her became visible mrs chalk gazed at it in stupefaction  it can’t be ours she gasped they—they’d never dare they—they—  she stood for a moment staring at the hats on the sideboard and then followed by the others ran hastily downstairs there was a hurried questioning of the astonished landlady and then mrs chalk leading they made their way to the stairs at a pace remarkable in a woman of her age and figure mrs stobell assisted by edward tredgold did her best to keep up with her but she reached the goal some distance ahead and jumping heavily into a boat pointed to the fastreceding schooner and bade the boatman overtake it  can’t be done ma’am said the man staring not without wings  row hard said mrs chalk in a voice of sharp encouragement  the boatman a man of few words jerked his thumb in the direction of the fair emily which was already responding to the motion of the sea outside  you run up the road on to them cliffs and wave to’em he said slowly wave ’ard  mrs chalk hesitated and then stepping out of the boat resumed the pursuit by land ten minutes’ hurried walking brought them to the cliffs and standing boldly on the verge she enacted to the great admiration of a small crowd the part of a human semaphore  the schooner her bows pointing gradually seawards for some time made no sign then a little group clustered at the stern and waved farewells     chapter xiv     mrs chalk watched the schooner until it was a mere white speck on the horizon a faint idea that it might yet see the error of its ways and return for her chaining her to the spot compelled at last to recognise the inevitable she rose from the turf on which she had been sitting and her face crimson with wrath denounced husbands in general and her own in particular  it’s my husband’s doing i’m sure said mrs stobell with a side glance at her friend’s attire not entirely devoid of self congratulation that’s why he wouldn’t let me have a yachting costume i can see it now  mrs chalk turned and eyed her with angry disdain  and that’s why he wouldn’t let me bring more than one box continued mrs stobell with the air of one to whom all things had been suddenly revealed and why he wouldn’t shut the house up oh just fancy what a pickle i should have been in if i had i must say it was thoughtful of him  thoughtful exclaimed mrs chalk in a choking voice  and i ought to have suspected something continued mrs stobell because he kissed me this morning i can see now that he meant it for goodbye well i can’t say i’m surprised robert always does get his own way  if you hadn’t persuaded me to come ashore for that wretched luncheon said mrs chalk in a deep voice we should have been all right  i’m sure i wasn’t to know said her friend although i certainly thought it odd when robert said that he had got it principally for you i could see you were a little bit flattered  mrs chalk trembling with anger sought in vain for a retort  well it’s no good staying here said mrs stobell philosophically we had better get home  home cried mrs chalk as a vision of her bare floors and dismantled walls rose before her when i think of the deceitfulness of those men giving us champagne and talking about the long evenings on board i don’t know what to do with myself and your father was one of them she added turning suddenly upon edward  mr tredgold disowned his erring parent with some haste and being by this time rather tired of the proceedings suggested that they should return to the inn and look up trains—a proposal to which mrs chalk after a final glance seawards silently assented with head erect she led the way down to the town again her bearing being so impressive that george the waiter who had been watching for them after handing her a letter which had been entrusted to him beat a precipitate retreat  the letter which was from mr stobell was short and to the point it narrated the artifice by which mr chalk had been lured away and concluded with a general statement that women were out of place on shipboard this mrs stobell declared after perusing the letter was intended for an apology  mrs chalk received the information in stony silence and declining tea made her way to the station and mounted guard over her boxes until the train was due with the exception of saying indeed on three or four occasions she kept silent all the way to binchester and arrived there departed for home in a cab in spite of a most pressing invitation from mrs stobell to stay with her until her own house was habitable  mr tredgold parted from them both with relief the voyage had been a source of wonder to him from its first inception and the day’s proceedings had only served to increase the mystery he made a light supper and the house being too quiet for his taste went for a meditative stroll the shops were closed and the small thoroughfares almost deserted he wondered whether it was too late to call and talk over the affair with captain bowers and still wondering found himself in dialstone lane  two or three of the houses were in darkness but there was a cheerful light behind the drawn blind of the captain’s sittingroom he hesitated a moment and then rapped lightly on the door and no answer being forthcoming rapped again the door opened and revealed the amiable features of mr tasker  captain bowers has gone to london sir he said  mr tredgold drew his right foot back three inches and at the same time tried to peer into the room  we’re expecting him back every moment said mr tasker encouragingly  mr tredgold moved his foot forward again and pondered it’s very late but i wanted to see him rather particularly he murmured as he stepped into the room  miss drewitt’s in the garden said joseph  mr tredgold started and eyed him suspiciously mr tasker’s face however preserving its usual appearance of stolid simplicity his features relaxed and he became thoughtful again  perhaps i might go into the garden he suggested  i should if i was you sir said joseph preceding him and throwing open the back door it’s fresher out there  mr tredgold stepped into the garden and stood blinking in the sudden darkness there was no moon and the night was cloudy a fact which accounted for his unusual politeness towards a cypress of somewhat stately bearing which stood at one corner of the small lawn he replaced his hat hastily and an apologetic remark concerning the lateness of his visit was never finished a trifle confused he walked down the garden peering right and left as he went but without finding the object of his search twice he paced the garden from end to end and he had just arrived at the conclusion that mr tasker had made a mistake when a faint sound high above his head apprised him of the true state of affairs  he stood listening in amazement but the sound was not repeated ordinary prudence and a sense of the fitness of things suggested that he should go home inclination suggested that he should seat himself in the deckchair at the foot of the crow’snest and await events he sat down to consider the matter  sprawling comfortably in the chair he lit his pipe his ear on the alert to catch the slightest sound of the captive in the cask above the warm air was laden with the scent of flowers and nothing stirred with the exception of mr tasker’s shadow on the blind of the kitchen window the clock in the neighbouring church chimed the threequarters and in due time boomed out the hour of ten mr tredgold knocked the ashes from his pipe and began seriously to consider his position lights went out in the next house huge shadows appeared on the kitchen blind and the light gradually faded to reappear triumphantly in the room above anon the shadow of mr tasker’s head was seen wrestling fiercely with its back collarstud  mr tredgold said a sharp voice from above  mr tredgold sprang to his feet overturning the chair in his haste and gazed aloft  miss drewitt he cried in accents of intense surprise  i am coming down said the voice  pray be careful said mr tredgold anxiously it is very dark can i help you  yes—you can go indoors said miss drewitt  her tone was so decided and so bitter that mr tredgold merely staying long enough to urge extreme carefulness in the descent did as he was desired he went into the sittingroom and standing uneasily by the fireplace tried to think out his line of action he was still floundering when he heard swift footsteps coming up the garden and miss drewitt very upright and somewhat flushed of face confronted him  i—i called to see the captain he said hastily and joseph told me you were in the garden i couldn’t see you anywhere so i took the liberty of sitting out there to wait for the captain’s return  miss drewitt listened impatiently did you know that i was up in the crow’snest she demanded  joseph never said a word about it said mr tredgold with an air of great frankness he merely said that you were in the garden and not being able to find you i thought that he was mistaken  did you know that i was up in the crow’snest repeated miss drewitt with ominous persistency  a—a sort of idea that you might be there did occur to me after a time admitted the other  did you know that i was there  mr tredgold gazed at her in feeble indignation but the uselessness of denial made truth easier yes he said slowly  thank you said the girl scornfully you thought that i shouldn’t like to be caught up there and that it would be an amusing and gentlemanly thing to do to keep me a prisoner i quite understand my estimate of you has turned out to be correct  it was quite an accident urged mr tredgold humbly i’ve had a very worrying day seeing them off at biddlecombe and when i heard you up in the nest i succumbed to sudden temptation if i had stopped to think—if i had had the faintest idea that you would catechise me in the way you have done—i shouldn’t have dreamt of doing such a thing  miss drewitt who was standing with her hand on the latch of the door leading upstairs as a hint that the interview was at an end could not restrain her indignation  your father and his friends have gone off to secure my uncle’s treasure and you come straight on here she cried hotly do you think that there is no end to his goodnature  treasure said the other with a laugh why that idea was knocked on the head when the map was burnt even chalk wouldn’t go on a roving commission to dig over all the islands in the south pacific  i don’t see anything to laugh at said the girl my uncle fully intended to burn it he was terribly upset when he found that it had disappeared  disappeared cried mr tredgold in accents of unmistakable amazement why wasn’t it burnt after all the captain said it was  he was going to burn it repeated the girl watching him but somebody took it from the bureau  took it when inquired the other as the business of the yachting cruise began to appear before him in its true colours  the afternoon you were here waiting for him said miss drewitt  afternoon repeated mr tredgold blankly the afternoon i was—— he drew himself up and eyed her angrily do you mean to say that you think i took the thing  it doesn’t matter what i think said the girl i suppose you won’t deny that your friends have got it  yes but you said that it was the afternoon i was here persisted the other  miss drewitt eyed him indignantly the consciencestricken culprit of a few minutes before had disappeared leaving in his stead an arrogant young man demanding explanations in a voice of almost unbecoming loudness  you are shouting at me she said stiffly  mr tredgold apologised but returned to the charge i answered your question a little while ago he said in more moderate tones now please answer mine do you think that i took the map  i am not to be commanded to speak by you said miss drewitt standing very erect  fairplay is a jewel said the other question for question do you  miss drewitt looked at him and hesitated no she said at last with obvious reluctance  mr tredgold’s countenance cleared and his eyes softened  i suppose you admit that your father has got it said the girl noting these signs with some disapproval how did he get it  mr tredgold shook his head if those three overgrown babes find that treasure he said impressively i’ll doom myself to perpetual bachelorhood  i answered your question just now said the girl very quietly because i wanted to ask you one do you believe my uncle’s story about the buried treasure  mr tredgold eyed her uneasily i never attached much importance to it he replied it seemed rather romantic  do you believe it  no said the other doggedly  the girl drew a long breath and favoured him with a look in which triumph and anger were strangely mingled  i wonder you can visit him after thinking him capable of such a falsehood she said at last you certainly won’t be able to after i have told him  i told you in confidence was the reply i have regarded it all along as a story told to amuse chalk that is all i shall be very sorry if you say anything that might cause unpleasantness between myself and captain bowers  i shall tell him as soon as he comes in said miss drewitt it is only right that he should know your opinion of him goodnight  mr tredgold said goodnight and walking to the door stood for a moment regarding her thoughtfully it was quite clear that in her present state of mind any appeal to her better nature would be worse than useless he resolved to try the effect of a little humility  i am very sorry for my behaviour in the garden he said sorrowfully  it doesn’t matter said the girl i wasn’t at all surprised  mr tredgold recognised the failure of the new treatment at once of course when i went into the garden i hadn’t any idea that you would be in such an unlikely place he said with a kindly smile let us hope that you won’t go there again  miss drewitt hardly able to believe her ears let him go without a word and in a dazed fashion stood at the door and watched him up the lane when the captain came in a little later she was sitting in a stiff and uncomfortable attitude by the window still thinking  he was so tired after a long day in town that the girl at considerable personal inconvenience allowed him to finish his supper before recounting the manifold misdeeds of mr tredgold she waited until he had pushed his chair back and lit a pipe and then without any preface plunged into the subject with an enthusiasm which she endeavoured in vain to make contagious the captain listened in silence and turned a somewhat worried face in her direction when she had finished  we can’t all think alike he said feebly as she waited with flushed cheeks and sparkling eyes for the verdict i told you he hadn’t taken the map as for those three idiots and their harebrained voyage—  but mr tredgold said that he didn’t believe in the treasure said the wrathful prudence one thing is he can never come here again i think that i made him understand that the idea of thinking that you could tell a falsehood  the captain bent down and picking a used match from the hearthrug threw it carefully under the grate miss drewitt watched him expectantly  we mustn’t quarrel with people’s opinions he said at last it’s a free country and people can believe what they like look at protestants and catholics for instance their belief isn’t the same and yet i’ve known ’em to be staunch friends  miss drewitt shook her head he can never come here again she said with great determination he has insulted you and if you were not the bestnatured man in the world you would be as angry about it as i am  the captain smoked in silence  and his father and those other two men will come back with your treasure continued prudence after waiting for some time for him to speak and so far as i can see you won’t even be able to prosecute them for it  i sha’n’t do anything said captain bowers impatiently as he rose and knocked out his halfsmoked pipe and i never want to hear another word about that treasure as long as i live i’m tired of it it has caused more mischief and unpleasantness than—than it is worth they are welcome to it for me     chapter xv     mr chalk’s foot had scarcely touched the deck of the schooner when mr tredgold seized him by the arm and whispering indistinctly in his ear hurried him below  get your arms out of the cabin as quick as you can he said sharply then follow me up on deck  mr chalk trembling violently tried to speak but in vain a horrid clanking noise sounded overhead and with the desperation of terror he turned into the new cabin and collecting his weapons began with frantic haste to load them then he dropped his rifle and sprang forward with a loud cry as he heard the door close smartly and the key turn in the lock  he stood gazing stupidly at the door and listening to the noise overhead the clanking ceased and was succeeded by a rush of heavy feet above which he heard captain brisket shouting hoarsely he threw a despairing glance around his prison and then looked up at the skylight it was not big enough to crawl through but he saw that by standing on the table he could get his head out no less clearly he saw how easy it would be for a mutineer to hit it  huddled up in a corner of the cabin he tried to think tredgold and stobell were strangely silent and even the voice of brisket had ceased the suspense became unbearable then suddenly a faint creaking and straining of timbers apprised him of the fact that the fair emily was under way  he sprang to his feet and beat heavily upon the door but it was of stout wood and opened inwards then a bright idea the result of reading sensational fiction occurred to him and raising his rifle to his shoulder he aimed at the lock and pulled the trigger  the noise of the explosion in the small cabin was deafening but loud as it was it failed to drown a cry of alarm outside the sound of heavy feet and of two or three bodies struggling for precedence up the companionladder followed and mr chalk still holding his smoking rifle and regarding a splintered hole in the centre of the panel wondered whether he had hit anybody he slipped in a fresh cartridge and becoming conscious of a partial darkening of the skylight aimed hastily at a face which appeared there the face which bore a strong resemblance to that of mr stobell disappeared with great suddenness  he’s gone clean off his head said captain brisket as mr stobell staggered back  mad as a march hare said mr tredgold shivering it’s a wonder he didn’t have one of us just now call down to him that it’s all right stobell  call yourself said that gentleman shortly  get a stick and raise the skylight said tredgold  a loud report sounded from below mr chalk had fired a second and successful shot at the lock what’s he doing inquired stobell blankly  a sharp exclamation from captain brisket was the only reply and he turned just as mr chalk with a rifle in one hand and a revolver in the other appeared on deck the captain’s cry was echoed forward and three of the crew dived with marvellous skill into the forecastle the boy and two others dashed into the galley so hurriedly that the cook who was peeping out was borne backwards on to the stove and kept there the things he said in the heat of the moment being attributed to excitement and attracting no attention tredgold brisket and stobell dodged behind the galley and mr chalk was left to gaze in openmouthed wonder at the shrinking figure of mr duckett at the wheel they regarded each other in silence until a stealthy step behind mr chalk made him turn round smartly mr stobell who was stealing up to secure him dodged hastily behind the mainmast  stobell cried mr chalk faintly  it’s all right said the other  mr chalk regarded his proceedings in amazement what are you hiding behind the mast for he inquired stepping towards him  mr stobell made no reply but with an agility hardly to be expected of one of his bulk dashed behind the galley again  a sense of mystery and unreality stole over mr chalk he began to think that he must be dreaming he turned and looked at mr duckett and mr duckett trying to smile at him contorted his face so horribly that he shrank back appalled he looked about him and saw that they were now in open water and drawing gradually away from the land the stillness and mystery became unbearable and with an air of resolution he cocked his rifle and proceeded with infinite caution to stalk the galley as he weathered it with his finger on the trigger stobell and the others stole round the other side and making a mad break aft stumbled down the companionladder and secured themselves below  has everybody gone mad inquired mr chalk approaching the mate again  everybody except you sir said mr duckett with great politeness  mr chalk looked forward again and nearly dropped his rifle as he saw three or four tousled heads protruding from the galley instinctively he took a step towards mr duckett and instinctively that muchenduring man threw up his hands and cried to him not to shoot mr chalk pale of face and trembling of limb strove to reassure him  but it’s pointing towards me said the mate and you’ve got your finger on the trigger  mr chalk apologized  what did tredgold and stobell run away for he demanded  mr duckett said that perhaps they were—like himself—nervous of firearms he also in reply to further questions assured him that the mutiny was an affair of the past and gaining confidence begged him to hold the wheel steady for a moment mr chalk still clinging to his weapons laid hold of it and the mate running to the companion called to those below led by mr stobell they came on deck  it’s all over now said tredgold soothingly  as peaceable as lambs said captain brisket taking a gentle hold of the rifle while stobell took the revolver  mr chalk smiled faintly and then looked round in trepidation as the inmates of the galley drew near and scowled at him curiously  get for’ard cried brisket turning on them sharply keep your own end o’ the ship d’ye hear  the men shuffled off slowly keeping a wary eye on mr chalk as they went the knowledge of the tempting mark offered by their backs to an eager sportsman being apparent to all  it’s all over said brisket taking the wheel from the mate and motioning to him to go away and after your determination sir there’ll be no more of it i’m sure  but what was it demanded mr chalk mutiny  not exactly what you could call mutiny replied the captain in a low voice a little mistake o’ duckett’s he’s a nervous man and perhaps he exaggerated a little but don’t allude to it again for the sake of his feelings  but somebody locked me in the cabin persisted mr chalk looking from one to the other  captain brisket hesitated did they he said with a smile of perplexity did they i gave orders that that door was to be kept locked when there was nobody in there and i expect the cook did it by mistake as he passed it’s been a chapter of accidents all through but i must say sir that the determined way you came on deck was wonderful  extraordinary murmured mr tredgold  i didn’t know him attested mr stobell continuing to regard mr chalk with much interest  i can’t make head or tail of it complained mr chalk what about the ladies  captain brisket shook his head dismally and pointed ashore and mr chalk following the direction of his finger gazed spellbound at a figure which was signalling wildly from the highest point tredgold and stobell approaching the side waved their handkerchiefs in response  we must go back for them said mr chalk firmly  what in this wind sir inquired brisket with an indulgent laugh you’re too much of a sailor to think that’s possible i’m sure and it’s going to last  we must put up with the disappointment and do without’em said stobell  mr chalk gazed helplessly ashore but we’ve got their luggage he cried  duckett sent it ashore said brisket thinking that there was men’s work ahead and that the ladies might be in the way he put it over the side and sent it back and mind believing what he did i’m not saying he wasn’t in the right  mr chalk again professed his inability to make head or tail of the proceedings ultimately—due time having been given for captain brisket’s invention to get under way—he learned that a dyspeptic seaman mistaking the mate’s back for that of the cook had first knocked his cap over his eyes and then pushed him over and that of course concluded the captain couldn’t be allowed anyway but seeing that it was a mistake we let the chap off  there’s one thing about it said tredgold as chalk was about to speak it’s shown us the stuff you’re made of chalk  he frightened me said brisket solemnly i own it when i saw him come up like that i lost my nerve  mr chalk cast a final glance at the dwindling figure on the cliff and then went silently below and stood in a pleasant reverie before the smashed door he came to the same conclusion regarding the desperate nature of his character as the others and the nervous curiosity of the men who took sly peeps at him and the fact that the cook dropped the souptureen that evening when he turned and found mr chalk at his elbow only added to his satisfaction  he felt less heroic next morning the wind had freshened during the night and the floor of the cabin heaved in a sickening fashion beneath his feet as he washed himself the atmosphere was stifling timbers creaked and strained and boots and other articles rolled playfully about the floor  the strong sweet air above revived him but the deck was wet and cheerless and the air chill land had disappeared and a tumbling waste of grey seas and a leaden sky was all that met his gaze nevertheless he spoke warmly of the view to captain brisket rather than miss which he preferred to miss his breakfast contenting himself with half a biscuit and a small cup of tea on deck the smell of fried bacon and the clatter of cups and saucers came up from below  the heavy clouds disappeared and the sun came out the sea changed from grey to blue and tredgold and stobell coming on deck after a good breakfast arranged a couple of chairs and sat down to admire the scene aloft the new sails shone white in the sun and spars and rigging creaked musically a little spray came flying at intervals over the bows as the schooner met the seas  lovely morning sir said captain brisket who had been for some time exchanging glances with stobell and tredgold so calm and peaceful  bu’ful said mr chalk shortly he was gazing in much distaste at a brig to starboard which was magically drawn up to the skies one moment and blotted from view the next  nice fresh smell said tredgold sniffing have a cigar chalk  mr chalk shook his head and his friend selecting one from his case lit it with a fusee that poisoned the atmosphere  none of us seem to be seasick he remarked  seasickness sir said captain brisket—seasickness is mostly imagination people think they’re going to be bad and they are but there’s one certain cure for it  cure said mr chalk turning a glazing eye upon him  yes sir said brisket with a warning glance at mr stobell who was grinning broadly it’s oldfashioned and i’ve heard it laughed at but it’s a regular good old remedy mr stobell’s laughing at it he continued as a gasping noise from that gentleman called for explanation but it’s true all the same  what is it inquired mr chalk with feeble impatience  pork replied captain brisket with impressive earnestness all that anybody’s got to do is to get a bit o’ porkfat pork mind you—and get the cook to stick a fork into it and frizzle it all bubbling and spluttering over the galley fire better still do it yourself the smell o’ the cooking being part of——  mr chalk arose and keeping his legs with difficulty steadied himself for a moment with his hands on the companion and disappeared below  there’s nothing like it said brisket turning with a satisfied smile to mr stobell who was sitting with his hands on his knees and rumbling with suppressed mirth it’s an odd thing but if a man’s disposed to be queer you’ve only got to talk about that to finish him why talking about fried bacon should be so bad for ’em i don’t know  imagination said tredgold smoking away placidly  brisket smiled and then nursing his knee scowled fiercely at the helmsman who was also on the broad grin  of course it wants proper telling he continued turning to stobell did you notice his eyes when i spoke of it bubbling and spluttering over the galley fire  i did replied mr stobell laying his pipe carefully on the deck  some people tell you to tie the pork to a bit o’ string after frying it said brisket but that’s what i call overdoing it i think it’s quite enough to describe its cooking don’t you  plenty said stobell have one o’ my matches he said proffering his box to tredgold who was about to relight his cigar with a fusee  thanks i prefer this said tredgold  mr stobell put his box in his pocket again and sitting lumpily in his chair gazed in a brooding fashion at the side  talking about pork began brisket reminds me—  what ain’t you got over that joke yet inquired mr stobell glaring at him poor chalk can’t help his feelings  no no said the captain staring back  people can’t help being seasick said stobell fiercely  certainly not sir agreed the captain  there’s no disgrace in it continued mr stobell with unusual fluency and nothing funny about it that i can see  certainly not sir said the perplexed captain again i was just going to point out to you how talking about pork—  i know you was stormed mr stobell rising from his chair and lurching forward heavily d’ye think i couldn’t hear you prating and prating and pra——  he disappeared below and the captain after exchanging a significant grin with mr tredgold put his hands behind his back and began to pace the deck musing solemnly on the folly of trusting to appearances  seasickness wore off after a day or two and was succeeded by the monotony of life on board a small ship week after week they saw nothing but sea and sky and mr chalk thirsting for change thought with wistful eagerness of the palmgirt islands of the fijian archipelago to which captain brisket had been bidden to steer in the privacy of their own cabin the captain and mr duckett discussed with great earnestness the nature of the secret which they felt certain was responsible for the voyage     chapter xvi     it is an article of belief with some oldfashioned people that children should have no secrets from their parents and though not a model father in every way mr vickers felt keenly the fact that his daughter was keeping something from him on two or three occasions since the date of sailing of the fair emily she had relieved her mind by throwing out dark hints of future prosperity and there was no doubt that somewhere in the house she had a hidden store of gold with his left foot glued to the floor he had helped her look for a sovereign one day which had rolled from her purse and twice she had taken her mother on expensive journeys to tollminster  brooding over the lack of confidence displayed by selina he sat on the side of her bed one afternoon glancing thoughtfully round the room he was alone in the house and now or never was his opportunity after an hour’s arduous toil he had earned tenpencehalfpenny and rightly considering that the sum was unworthy of the risk put it back where he had found it and sat down gloomily to peruse a paper which he had found secreted at the bottom of her box  mr vickers was but a poor scholar and the handwriting was deplorable undotted i’s travelled incognito through the scrawl and uncrossed t’s passed themselves off unblushingly as l’s after half an hour’s steady work his imagination excited by one or two words which he had managed to decipher he abandoned the task in despair and stood moodily looking out of the window his gaze fell upon mr william russell standing on the curb nearly opposite with his hands thrust deep in his trouserpockets and after a slight hesitation he pushed open the small casement and beckoned him in  you’re a bit of a scholar ain’t you bill he inquired  mr russell said modestly that he had got the name for it  again mr vickers hesitated but he had no choice and his curiosity would brook no delay with a strong caution as to secrecy he handed the paper over to his friend  mr russell his brow corrugated with thought began to read slowly to himself the writing was certainly difficult but the watching mr vickers saw by the way his friend’s finger moved along the lines that he was conquering it by the slow but steady dilation of mr russell’s eyes and the gradual opening of his mouth he also saw that the contents were occasioning him considerable surprise  what does it say he demanded anxiously  mr russell paid no heed he gave vent to a little gurgle of astonishment and went on then he stopped and looked up blankly  well i’m d—d he said  what is it cried mr vickers  mr russell read on and such exclamations as well i’m jiggered well i’m blest and others of a more complicated nature continued to issue from his lips  what’s it all about shouted the excited mr vickers  mr russell looked up and blinked at him i can’t believe it he murmured it’s like a fairy tale ain’t it what do you think of it  the exasperated mr vickers thrusting him back in his chair shouted insults in his ear until his friend awaking to the true position of affairs turned to the beginning again and proceeded with much unction to read aloud the document that mr tredgold had given to selina some months before mr vickers listened in a state of amazement which surpassed his friend’s and the reading finished besought him to go over it again mr russell complied and having got to the end put the paper down and gazed enviously at his friend  you won’t have to do no more work he said wistfully  not if i ’ad my rights said mr vickers it’s like a dream ain’t it  they bought a ship so i ’eard murmured the other they’ve got eight or nine men aboard and they’ll be away pretty near a year why selina’ll ’ave a fortune  mr vickers sitting with his legs stretched out stiffly before him tried to think a lot o’ good it’ll do me he said bitterly it’s young joseph tasker that’ll get the benefit of it  mr russell whistled i’d forgot him he exclaimed but i expect she only took him becos she couldn’t get anybody else  mr vickers eyed him sternly but reflecting that selina was well able to fight her own battles forbore to reply  she must ha’ told him pursued mr russell following up a train of thought nobody in their senses would want to marry selina for anything else  ho indeed said mr vickers coldly  unless they was mad admitted the other what are you going to do about it he inquired suddenly  i shall think it over said mr vickers with dignity as soon as you’ve gone i shall sit down with a quiet pipe and see what’s best to be done  mr russell nodded approval first thing you do you put the paper back where you got it from he said warningly  i know what i’m about said mr vickers i shall think it over when you’re gone and make up my mind what to do  don’t you do nothing in a hurry advised mr russell earnestly i’m going to think it over too  mr vickers stared at him in surprise you he said disagreeably  yes me replied the other after all what’s looks looks ain’t everything  his friend looked bewildered and then started furiously as the meaning of mr russell’s remark dawned upon him he began to feel like a miser beset by thieves  what age do you reckon you are bill he inquired after a long pause  i’m as old as i look replied mr russell simply and i’ve got a young face i’d sooner it was anybody else than selina but still you can’t ’ave everything if she don’t take me sooner than young joseph i shall be surprised  mr vickers regarded him with undisguised astonishment  i might ha’ married scores o’ times if i’d liked said mr russell with a satisfied air  don’t you go doing nothing silly said mr vickers uneasily selina can’t abear you you drink too much why she’s talking about making young joseph sign the pledge to keep’im steady  mr russell waved his objections aside i can get round her he said with cheery confidence i ain’t kept ferrets all these years for nothing i’m not going to let all that money slip through my fingers for want of a little trying  he began his courtship a few days afterwards in a fashion which rendered mr vickers almost helpless with indignation in full view of selina who happened to be standing by the door he brought her unfortunate father along mint street holding him by the arm and addressing him in fond but severe tones on the surpassing merits of total abstinence and the folly of wasting his children’s money on beer  i found ’im inside the ’horse and groom’ he said to the astonished selina they’ve got a new barmaid there and the pore gal wasn’t in the house ’arf an hour afore she was serving him with beer a pot mind you  he shook his head in great regret at the speechless mr vickers and pushing him inside the house followed close behind  look here bill russell i don’t want any of your larks said miss vickers recovering herself  larks repeated mr russell with an injured air i’m a teetotaler and it’s my duty to look after brothers that go astray  he produced a pledgecard from his waistcoatpocket and smoothing it out on the table pointed with great pride to his signature the date of the document lay under the ban of his little finger  i’d just left the temperance hall continued the zealot i’ve been to three meetings in two days they’d been talking about the new barmaid and i guessed at once what brother vickers would do an’ i rushed off just in the middle of brother humphrey’s experiences—and very interesting they was too—to save him he was just starting his second pot and singing in between when i rushed in and took the beer away from him and threw it on the floor  i wasn’t singing snarled mr vickers endeavouring to avoid his daughter’s eye  oh my dear friend said mr russell who had made extraordinary progress in temperance rhetoric in a very limited time that’s what comes o’ the drink it steals away your memory  miss vickers trembled with wrath how dare you go into publichouses after i told you not to she demanded stamping her foot  we must ’ave patience said mr russell gently we must show the backslider ’ow much happier he would be without it i’ll ’elp you watch him  when i want your assistance i’ll ask you for it said miss vickers tartly what do you mean by shoving your nose into other people’s affairs  it’s—it’s my duty to look after fallen brothers said mr russell somewhat taken aback  what d’ye mean by fallen snapped miss vickers confronting him fiercely  fallen into a pub explained mr russell hastily anybody might fall through them swingdoors they’re made like that o’ purpose  you’ve fell through a good many in your time interposed mr vickers with great bitterness  i know i ’ave said the other sadly but never no more oh my friend if you only knew how ’appy i feel since i’ve give up the drink if you only knew what it was to ’ave your own selfrespeck think of standing up on the platform and giving of your experiences but i don’t despair brother i’ll have you afore i’ve done with you  mr vickers unable to contain himself got up and walked about the room mr russell with a smile charged with brotherly love drew a blank pledgecard from his pocket and detaining him as he passed besought him to sign it  he’ll do it in time he said in a loud whisper to selina as his victim broke loose i’ll come in of an evening and talk to him till he does sign  miss vickers hesitated but observing the striking improvement in the visitor’s attire effected by temperance allowed a curt refusal to remain unspoken mr vickers protested hotly  that’ll do said his daughter indecision vanishing at sight of her father’s opposition if bill russell likes to come in and try and do you good he can  mr vickers said that he wouldn’t have him but under compulsion stayed indoors the following evening while mr russell by means of coloured diagrams cheerfully lent by his new friends tried to show him the inroads made by drink upon the human frame he sat as miss vickers remarked like a wooden image and was only moved to animation by a picture of cirrhosis of the liver which he described as being very pretty  at the end of a week mr vickers’s principles remained unshaken and so far mr russell had made not the slightest progress in his designs upon the affections of selina that lady indeed treated him with but scant courtesy and on two occasions had left him to visit mr tasker mr vickers’s undisguised amusement at such times being hard to bear  don’t give up bill he said encouragingly as mr russell sat glum and silent read over them beautiful ’verses to a teapot’ agin and try and read them as if you ’adn’t got your mouth full o’ fishbait you’re wasting time  i don’t want none o’ your talk said his disappointed friend if you ain’t careful i’ll tell selina about you going up to her papers  the smile faded from mr vickers’s face don’t make mischief bill he said uneasily  well don’t you try and make fun o’ me said mr russell ferociously taking the pledge is ’ard enough to bear without having remarks from you  i didn’t mean them to be remarks bill said the other mildly but if you tell about me you know selina’ll see through your little game  i’m about sick o’ the whole thing said mr russell desperately i ain’t ’ad a drink outside o’ my own house for pretty near a fortnight i shall ask selina tomorrow night and settle it  ask her said the amazed mr vickers ask ’er what  ask ’er to marry me said the other doggedly  mr vickers thoroughly alarmed argued with him in vain the utmost concession he could wring from the determined mr russell being a promise to give him a hint to get out of the way  i’ll do that for my own sake he said frankly i can do it better alone and if your old woman is in you get her out too ask ’er to go for a walk that’ll please selina i don’t know what the gal does want i thought turning teetotaler and setting a good example to you would do the trick if anything would  mrs vickers’s utter astonishment next evening when her husband asked her to go for a walk irritated that gentleman almost beyond endurance convinced at last that he was not joking she went upstairs and put on her bonnet and then stood waiting for the reluctant mr vickers with an air of almost bashful diffidence  joseph is coming in soon said selina as her parents moved to the door i’m expecting him every minute  i’ll stop and see ’im said mr russell there’s something i want to speak to him about partikler  mr vickers gave a warning glance at him as he went out and trembled as he noted his determined aspect in a state of considerable agitation he took hold of his wife by the elbow and propelled her along  it was a cold night and a strong easterly wind had driven nearly everybody else indoors mr vickers shivered and moving at a good pace muttered something to his astonished wife about a good country walk they quitted the streets and plunged into dark lanes until in mr vickers’s judgment sufficient time having elapsed for the worst to have happened they turned and made their way to the town again  there’s somebody outside our house said mrs vickers who had been in a state of amazed discomfort the whole time  mr vickers approached warily two people were on the doorstep in the attitude of listeners while a third was making strenuous attempts to peep through at the side of the windowblind from inside came the sound of voices raised in dispute that of selina’s being easily distinguishable  what—what’s all this demanded mr vickers in trembling tones as he followed his wife inside and closed the door  he glanced from selina who was standing in front of mr tasker in the manner of a small hen defending an overgrown chicken to mr russell who was towering above them and trying to reach him  what’s all this he repeated with an attempt at pomposity  the disputants all spoke at once mr russell with an air of jocular ferocity miss vickers in a voice that trembled with passion and mr tasker speaking as a man with a grievance despite the confusion mr vickers soon learned that it was a case of two’s company and three’s none and that mr russell after turning a deaf ear to hints to retire which had gradually increased in bluntness had suddenly turned restive and called mr tasker a mouldy image a walleyed rabbit and divers other obscure and contradictory things not content with that he had without any warning kissed miss vickers and when mr tasker obeying that infuriated damsel’s commands tried to show him the door had facetiously offered to show that gentleman the wall and taken him up and bumped him against it until they were both tired  anybody would ha’ thought i was hurting ’im by the noise he made said the impenitent mr russell  i—i’m surprised at you bill said mr vickers nervously  put him outside cried selina stamping her foot  you’d better get off ’ome bill said mr vickers with a persuasive wink  while you’re safe added his daughter with a threatening gesture  go and get yourself ’arf a pint o’ warm lemonade chimed in the voice of the daring joseph  mr russell stepped towards him but mr vickers seizing him by the coat held him back and implored him to remember where he was  i’d bump the lot of you for two pins said the disappointed mr russell longingly and it’ud do you good you’d all be the better for it you’d know ’ow to behave to people when they come in to see you then as for selina i wouldn’t marry her now for all her money  money said the irate selina scornfully what money  the money in the paper said mr russell with a diabolical leer in the direction of the unfortunate mr vickers the paper what your father found in your box didn’t he tell you  he kicked over a chair which stood in his way and with a reckless swagger strode to the door at the horse and groom where he spent the remainder of the evening he was so original in his remarks upon women that two unmarried men offered to fight him and were only appeased by hearing a full and true account of the circumstances responsible for so much bitterness     chapter xvii     tried said captain bowers indignantly i have tried over and over again but it’s no use  have you tried the right way suggested edward tredgold  i’ve tried every way replied captain bowers impatiently  we must think of another then said the imperturbable edward have some more beef the captain passed his plate up you should have seen her when i said that i was coming to supper with you this evening he said impressively mr tredgold laid down the carving knife and fork what did she say he inquired eagerly grunted said the captain nonsense said the other sharply  i tell you she did retorted the captain she didn’t say a word just grunted  i know what you mean said mr tredgold only you are not using the right word  all right said the captain resignedly i don’t know a grunt when i hear it then that’s all she generally does grunt if i happen to mention your name  mr tredgold resumed his meal and sat eating in silence the captain who was waiting for more beef became restless  i hope my plate isn’t in your way he said at last  not at all said the other absently  perhaps you’ll pass it back to me then said the captain  mr tredgold still deep in thought complied i wish i could persuade you to have a little more he said in tones of polite regret i’ve often noticed that big men are small eaters i wonder why it is  sometimes it is because they can’t get it i expect said the indignant captain  mr tredgold said that no doubt that was the case sometimes and was only recalled to the true position of affairs by the hungry captain marching up to the beef and carving for himself  i’m sorry he said with a laugh i was thinking of something else i wonder whether you would let me use the crow’snest for a day or two there’s a place we have got on our hands a mile or two out and i want to keep my eye on it  the captain his good humour quite restored preserved his gravity with an effort i don’t see that she could object to that he said slowly it’s a matter of business as you might say  of course i could go straight round to the back without troubling you resumed mr tredgold it’s so awkward not to be able to see you when i want to  captain bowers ventured a sympathetic wink it’s awkward not to be able to see anybody when you want to he said softly  two days later miss drewitt peeping cautiously from her bedroom window saw mr tredgold perched up in the crow’snest with the telescope it was a cold frosty day in january and she smiled agreeably as she hurried downstairs to the fire and tried to imagine the temperature up aloft  stern in his attention to duty mr tredgold climbed day after day to his post of observation and kept a bored but whimsical eye on a deserted cowhouse three miles off on the fourth day the captain was out and miss drewitt after a casual peep from the kitchen window shrugged her shoulders and returned to the sittingroom  mr tredgold must be very cold up there miss said mr tasker respectfully as he brought in the tea he keeps slapping his chest and blowing on his fingers to keep ’imself warm  miss drewitt said oh and drawing the little table up to her easychair put down her book and poured herself out a cup of tea she had just arranged it to her tastetwo lumps of sugar and a liberal allowance of cream—when a faint rap sounded on the front door  come in she said taking her feet from the fender and facing about  the door opened and revealed to her indignant gaze the figure of mr tredgold his ears and nose were of a brilliant red and his eyes were watering with the cold she eyed him inquiringly  good afternoon he said bowing  miss drewitt returned the greeting  isn’t captain bowers in said mr tredgold with a shade of disappointment in his voice as he glanced around  no said the girl  mr tredgold hesitated i was going to ask him to give me a cup of tea he said with a shiver i’m half frozen and i’m afraid that i have a taken a chill  miss drewitt nearly dropped her teacup in surprise at his audacity he was certainly very cold and she noticed a little blue mixed with the red of his nose she looked round the cosy room and then at the open door which was causing a bitter draught  he is not in she repeated  thank you said mr tredgold patiently good afternoon  he was so humble that the girl began to feel uncomfortable his gratitude for nothing reminded her of a disappointed tramp moreover the draught from the door was abominable  i can give you a cup of tea if you wish she said shivering but please make haste and shut that door  mr tredgold stepped inside and closed it with alacrity his back being turned just long enough to permit a congratulatory wink at the unconscious oak he took a chair the other side of the fire and extending his numbed fingers to the blaze thanked her warmly  it is very kind of you he said as he took his cup from her i was half frozen  i should have thought that a brisk walk home would have been better for you said the girl coldly  mr tredgold shook his head dolefully i should probably only have had lukewarm tea when i got there he replied nobody looks after me properly  he passed his cup up and began to talk of skating and other seasonable topics as he got warmer and his features regained their normal colouring and his face its usual expression of cheerfulness miss drewitt’s pity began to evaporate  are you feeling better she inquired pointedly  a little was the cautious reply his face took on an expression of anxiety and he spoke of a twinge lightly tapping his left lung by way of emphasis  i hope that i shall not be taken ill here he said gravely  miss drewitt sat up with a start i should hope not she said sharply  so inconvenient he murmured  quite impossible said miss drewitt whose experience led her to believe him capable of anything  i should never forgive myself he said gently  miss drewitt regarded him in alarm and of her own accord gave him a third cup of tea and told him that he might smoke she felt safer when she saw him light a cigarette and for fear that a worse thing might befall her entered amiably into conversation she even found herself somewhat to her surprise discussing the voyage and sympathising with mr tredgold in his anxiety concerning his father’s safety  mrs chalk and mrs stobell are very anxious too he said it is a long way for a small craft like that  and then to find no treasure at the end of it said miss drewitt with feminine sweetness  mr tredgold stole a look at her i did not mean to say that the captain had no treasure he said quietly  you believe in it now said the girl triumphantly  i believe that the captain has a treasure admitted the other certainly  worth half a million persisted miss drewitt  worth more than that said mr tredgold gazing steadily into the fire  the girl looked puzzled more she said in surprise  much more said the other still contemplating the fire it is priceless  miss drewitt sat up suddenly and then let herself back slowly into the depths of the chair her face turned scarlet and she hoped fervently that if mr tredgold looked at her the earth might open and swallow him up she began to realize dimly that in the absence of an obliging miracle of that kind there would never be any getting rid of him  priceless repeated mr tredgold in challenging tones  miss drewitt made no reply rejoinder was dangerous and silence difficult in a state of nervous indignation she rang for mr tasker and instructed him to take away the teathings to sweep the hearth and to alter the position of two pictures by the time all this was accomplished she had regained her wonted calm and was airing some rather strong views on the subject of two little boys who lived with a catapult next door but one     chapter xviii     month by month the fair emily crept down south the great bear and other constellations gave way to the stars of the southern skies and mr chalk tried hard not to feel disappointed with the arrangement of those in the southern cross pressed by the triumphant brisket to whom he voiced his views he had to admit that it was at least as much like a cross as the other was a bear  as they got farther south he had doffed his jersey and sea boots in favour of a drill suit and bare feet in this costume surmounted by a panama hat he was the only thing aboard that afforded the slightest amusement to mr stobell whose temper was suffering severely under a long spell of monotonous idleness and whose remarks concerning the sea and everything in connection with it were so strangely out of keeping with the idea of a pleasure cruise that mr tredgold lectured him severely on his indiscretion  stobell is no more doing this for pleasure than i am said captain brisket to mr duckett it’s something big that’s brought him all this way you mark my words  the mate nodded acquiescence what about mr chalk he said in a low voice can’t you get it out of him  shuts up like an oyster directly i get anywhere near it replied the captain sticks to it that it is a yachting trip and that tredgold is studying the formations of islands says he has got a list of them he is going to visit  mr tredgold was talking the same way to me said the mate he says he’s going to write a book about them when he goes back he asked me what i thought’ud be a good title  i know what would be a good title for him growled brisket as mr stobell came on deck and gazed despondently over the side we’re getting towards the end of our journey sir  end said mr stobell end i don’t believe there is an end i believe you’ve lost your way and we shall go sailing on and on for ever  he walked aft and placing himself in a deckchair gazed listlessly at the stolid figure of the helmsman the heat was intense and both tredgold and chalk had declined to proceed with a conversation limited almost entirely on his side to personal abuse he tried the helmsman and made that unfortunate thirsty for a week by discussing the rival merits of bitter ale in a pewter and stout in a china mug the helmsman a man of liberal ideas said with some emotion that he could drink either of them out of a flowerpot  mr chalk became strangely restless as they neared their goal he had come thousands of miles and had seen nothing fresh with the exception of a few flyingfish an albatross and a whale blowing in the distance pacing the deck late one night with captain brisket he expressed mild yearnings for a little excitement  you want adventure said the captain shaking his head at him i know you ah what a sailorman you’d ha’ made with a crew o’ six like yourself i’d take this little craft anywhere the way you pick up seamanship is astonishing peter duckett swears you must ha’ been at sea as a boy and all i can do i can’t persuade him otherwise  i always had a feeling that i should like it said mr chalk modestly  like it repeated the captain o’ course you do you’ve got the salt in your blood but this peaceful cruising is beginning to tell on you there’s a touch o’ wildness in you sir that’s always struggling to come to the front peter duckett was saying the same thing only the other day he’s very uneasy about it  uneasy repeated mr chalk  aye said the captain drawing a deep breath and if i tell you that i am too it wouldn’t be outside the truth  but why inquired mr chalk after they had paced once up and down the deck in silence  it’s the mystery we don’t like said brisket at last how are we to know what desperate venture you are going to let us in for follow you faithful we will but we don’t like going in the dark it ain’t quite fair to us  there’s not the slightest danger in the world said mr chalk with impressive earnestness  but there’s a mystery you can’t deny that said the captain  mr chalk cleared his throat it’s a secret he said slowly  from me inquired the captain in reproachful accents  it isn’t my secret said mr chalk so far as i’m concerned i’d tell you with pleasure  the captain slowly withdrew his arm from mr chalk’s and moving to the side leaned over it with his shoulders hunched somewhat moved by this display of feeling mr chalk for some time hesitated to disturb him and when at last he did steal up and lay a friendly hand on the captain’s shoulder it was gently shaken off  secrets said brisket in a hollow voice from me i ain’t to be trusted  it isn’t my doing said mr chalk  well well it don’t matter sir said the captain bill brisket must put up with it it’s the first time in his life he’s been suspected and it’s doubly hard coming from you you’ve hurt me sir and there’s no other man living could do that  mr chalk stood by in sorrowful perplexity  and i put my life in your hands continued the captain with a low hard laugh you’re the only man in the world that knows who killed smiling peter in san francisco and i told you well well  but you did it in selfdefence said the other eagerly  what does that matter said the captain turning and walking forward followed by the anxious mr chalk i’ve got no proof of it open your mouth—once—and i swing for it that’s the extent of my trust in you  mr chalk much affected swore a few sailorly oaths as to what he wished might happen to him if he ever betrayed the other’s confidence  yes said the captain mournfully that’s all very well but you can’t trust me in a smaller matter however much i swear to keep it secret and it’s weighing on me in another way i believe the crew have got an inkling of something and here am i master of the ship responsible for all your lives kept in ignorance  the crew ejaculated the startled mr chalk  captain brisket hesitated and lowered his voice the other night i came on deck for a look round and saw one of them peeping down through your skylight he said slowly i sent him below and after he’d gone i looked down and saw you and mr tredgold and stobell all bending over a paper  mr chalk deep in thought paced up and down in silence  that’s a secret said brisket i don’t want them to think that i was spying i told you because you understand a shipmaster has to keep his eyes open for everybody’s sake  it’s your duty said mr chalk firmly  captain brisket with a little display of emotion thanked him and leaning against the side drew his attention to the beauty of the stars and sea impelled by the occasion and the charm of the night he waxed sentimental and with a strange mixture of bluffness and shyness spoke of his aged mother of the loneliness of a seafarer’s life and the inestimable boon of real friendship he bared his inmost soul to his sympathetic listener and then affecting to think from a remark of mr chalk’s that he was going to relate the secret of the voyage declined to hear it on the ground that he was only a rough sailorman and not to be trusted mr chalk contesting this hotly convinced him at last that he was in error and then found that bewildered by the argument the captain had consented to be informed of a secret which he had not intended to impart  but mind said brisket holding up a warning finger i’m not going to tell peter duckett there’s no need for him to know  mr chalk said certainly not and seeing no way for escape led the reluctant man as far from the helmsman as possible and whispered the information by the time they parted for the night captain brisket knew as much as the members of the expedition themselves and with a rare thoughtfulness quieted mr chalk’s conscience by telling him that he had practically guessed the whole affair from the beginning  he listened with great interest a few days later when mr tredgold after considering audibly which island he should visit first gave him the position of bowers’s island and began to discuss coral reefs and volcanic action they were now well in among the islands two they passed at a distance and went so close to a third—a mere reef with a few palms upon it—that mr chalk after a lengthy inspection through his binoculars was able to declare it uninhabited  a fourth came into sight a couple of days later a small grey bank on the starboard bow captain brisket who had been regarding it for some time with great care closed his glass with a bang and stepped up to mr tredgold  there she is sir he said in satisfied tones  mr tredgold who was drinking tea put down his cup and rose with an appearance of mild interest mr stobell followed suit and both gazed in strong indignation at the undisguised excitement of mr chalk as he raced up the rigging for a better view tredgold with the captain’s glass and stobell with an old pair of fieldglasses in which he had great faith gazed from the deck tredgold was the first to speak  are you sure this is the one brisket he inquired carelessly  certainly sir said the captain in some surprise at least it’s the one you told me to steer for  don’t look much like the map said stobell in a low aside where’s the mountain  tredgold looked again i fancy it’s a bit higher towards the middle he said after a prolonged inspection and besides it’s ’mount’ not ’mountain’  captain brisket who had with great delicacy drawn a little apart in recognition of their whispers stepped towards them again  i don’t know that i’ve ever seen this particular island before he said frankly likely not but it’s the one you told me to find there’s over a couple of hundred of them large and small knocking about if you think you’ve made a mistake we might try some of the others  no said tredgold after a pause and a prolonged inspection this must be right  mr chalk came down from aloft his eyes shining with pure joy and joined them  how long before we’re alongside he inquired  two hours replied the captain perhaps three he added considering  mr chalk glanced aloft and after a knowing question or two as to the wind began in a low voice to converse with his friends mr tredgold’s misgivings as to the identity of the island he dismissed at once as baseless the mount satisfied him and when as they approached nearer discrepancies in shape between the island and the map were pointed out to him he easily explained them by speaking of the difficulties of cartography to an amateur  there’s our point he said indicating it with a forefinger which the incensed stobell at once struck down we couldn’t have managed it better so far as time is concerned we’ll sleep ashore tonight in the tent and start the search at daybreak  captain brisket approached the island cautiously to the eyes of the voyagers it seemed to change shape as they neared it until finally the fair emily anchoring off the reef which guarded it it revealed itself as a small island about threequarters of a mile long and two or three hundred yards wide a beach of coral sand shelved steeply to the sea and a background of cocoanut trees and other vegetation completed a picture on which mr chalk gazed with the rapture of a devotee at a shrine  he went below as the anchor ran out and after a short absence reappeared on deck bedizened with weapons a small tent with blankets and provisions and a long deal box containing a couple of spades and a pick were put into one of the boats and the three friends after giving minute instructions to the captain followed mr duckett took the helm and after a short pull along the edge of the reef discovered an opening which gave access to the smooth water inside  a pretty spot gentlemen he said scanning the island closely i don’t think that there is anybody on it  we’ll go over it first and make sure said stobell as the boat’s nose ran into the beach come along chalk  he sprang out and taking one of the guns led the way along the beach followed by mr chalk the men looked after them longingly and then in obedience to the mate took the stores out of the boat and pitched the tent by the time chalk and stobell returned they were seated in the boat and ready to depart  a feeling of loneliness came over mr chalk as he watched the receding boat the schooner riding at anchor half a mile outside the reef had taken in her sails and presented a singularly naked and desolate appearance he wondered how long it would take the devoted brisket to send assistance in case of need and blamed himself severely for not having brought some rockets for signalling purposes long before night came the prospect of sleeping ashore had lost all its charm  one of us ought to keep watch he said as stobell after a heavy supper followed by a satisfying pipe rolled himself in a blanket and composed himself for slumber  mr stobell grunted and in a few minutes was fast asleep mr tredgold first blowing out the candle followed suit while mr chalk a prey to vague fears sat up nursing a huge revolver  the novelty of the position the melancholy beat of the surge on the farther beach and faint uncertain noises all around kept him awake he fancied that he heard stealthy footsteps on the beach and low guttural voices calling among the palms twice he aroused his friends and twice they sat up and reviled him  if you put your bony finger into my ribs again growled mr stobell tenderly rubbing the afflicted part you and me won’t talk alike like a bar of iron it was  i thought i heard something said mr chalk i should have fired only i was afraid of scaring you  fired repeated mr stobell thoughtfully fired was it the barrel of that infernal pistol you shoved into my ribs just now  i just touched you with it admitted the other i’m sorry if i hurt you  mr stobell feeling in his pocket struck a match and held it up full cock he said in a broken voice and he stirred me up with it and then he talks of savages  he struck another match and lit the candle and then before mr chalk could guess his intentions pressed him backwards and took the pistol away he raised the canvas and threw it out into the night and then remembering the guns threw them after it this done he blew out the candle and in two minutes was fast asleep again  an hour passed and mr chalk despite his fears began to nod half asleep he lay down and drew his blanket about him and then he sat up suddenly wide awake as an unmistakable footstep sounded outside  for a few seconds he sat unable to move then he stretched out his hand and began to shake stobell he could have sworn that hands were fumbling at the tent  eh said stobell sleepily  chalk shook him again stobell sat up angrily but before he could speak a wild yell rent the air the tent collapsed suddenly and they struggled half suffocated in the folds of the canvas     chapter xix     mr stobell was the first to emerge and seizing the canvas dragged it free of the writhing bodies of his companions mr chalk gained his feet and catching sight of some dim figures standing a few yards away on the beach gave a frantic shout and plunged into the interior followed by the others a shower of pieces of coral whizzing by their heads and another terrible yell accelerated their flight  mr chalk gained the farther beach unmolested and half crazy with fear ran along blindly footsteps which he hoped were those of his friends pounded away behind him and presently stobell panting heavily called to him to stop mr chalk looking over his shoulder slackened his pace and allowed him to overtake him  wait—for—tredgold said stobell breathlessly as he laid a heavy hand on his shoulder  mr chalk struggled to free himself where is he he gasped  stobell still holding him stood trying to regain his breath they— they must—have got him he said at last have you got any of your pistols on you  you threw them all away quavered mr chalk i’ve only got a knife  he fumbled with trembling fingers at his belt stobell brushing his hand aside drew a sailor’s knife from its sheath and started to run back in the direction of the tent mr chalk after a moment’s hesitation followed a little way behind  look out he screamed and stopped suddenly as a figure burst out of the trees on to the beach a score of yards ahead stobell with a hoarse cry raised his hand and dashed at it  stobell cried a voice  it’s tredgold cried stobell he waited for him to reach them and then turning all three ran stumbling along the beach  they ran in silence until they reached the other end of the island so far there were no signs of pursuit and stobell breathing hard from his unwonted exercise collected a few lumps of coral and piled them on the beach  they had me over—twice said tredgold jerkily they tore the clothes from my back how i got away i don’t know i fought—kicked—then suddenly i broke loose and ran  he threw himself on the beach and drew his breath in long sobbing gasps stobell going a few paces forward peered into the darkness and listened intently  i suppose they’re waiting for daylight he said at last  he sat down on the beach and after making a few disparaging remarks about coral as a weapon lapsed into silence  to mr chalk it seemed as though the night would never end a dozen times he sprang to his feet and gazed fearfully into the darkness and a dozen times at least he reminded the silent stobell of the folly of throwing other people’s guns away day broke at last and showed him tredgold in a tattered shirt and a pair of trousers and stobell sitting close by sound asleep  we must try and signal to the ship he said in a hoarse whisper it’s our only chance  tredgold nodded assent and shook stobell quietly the silence was oppressive they rose and peered out to sea and a loud exclamation broke from all three the fair emily had disappeared  stobell rubbed his eyes and swore softly tredgold and chalk stood gazing in blank dismay at the unbroken expanse of shining sea  the savages must have surprised them said the latter in trembling tones that’s why they left us alone  or else they heard the noise ashore and put to sea said tredgold  they stood gazing at each other in consternation then stobell who had been looking about him gave vent to an astonished grunt and pointed to a boat drawn upon the beach nearly abreast of where their tent had been  some of the crew have escaped ashore said mr chalk  striking inland so as to get the shelter of the trees they made their way cautiously towards the boat colour was lent to mr chalk’s surmise by the fact that it was fairly well laden with stores as they got near they saw a couple of small casks which he thought contained water an untidy pile of tinned provisions and two or three bags of biscuit the closest search failed to reveal any signs of men and plucking up courage they walked boldly down to the boat and stood gazing stupidly at its contents  the firearms which stobell had pitched out of the tent the night before lay in the bottom together with boxes of cartridges from the cabin a couple of axes and a pile of clothing from the top of which mr tredgold with a sharp exclamation snatched a somewhat torn coat and waistcoat from the former he drew out a bulky pocketbook and opening it with trembling fingers hastily inspected the contents  the map has gone he shouted  the others stared at him  brisket has gone off with the ship he continued with desperate calmness it was the crew of our own schooner that frightened us off last night  mr stobell still staring in a stony fashion nodded slowly mr chalk after an effort found his voice  they’ve gone off with the treasure he said slowly  also continued tredgold this is not bowers’s island i can see it all now they’ve only taken the map and now they’re off to the real island to get the treasure it’s as clear as daylight  broad daylight said stobell huskily but how did they know  somebody has been talking said tredgold in a hard voice somebody has been confiding in that honest openhearted sailor captain brisket  he turned as he spoke and gazed fixedly at the openmouthed chalk in a slower fashion but with no less venom mr stobell also bent his regards upon that amiable but erring man  mr chalk returned their gaze with something like defiance half an hour before he had expected to have been killed and eaten he had passed a night of horror expecting death every minute now he exulted in the blue sky the line of white breakers crashing on the reef and the sea sparkling in the sunshine and he had not spent twentyfive years with mrs chalk without acquiring some skill in the noble art of selfdefence  ah brisket was trying to pump me a week ago he said confidentially i see it all now  the others glared at him luridly  he said that he had seen us through the skylight studying a paper continued mr chalk shaking his head i thought at the time you were rather rash tredgold  mr tredgold choked and meeting the faultfinding eye of mr stobell began to protest  the thing brisket couldn’t understand said chalk gaining confidence as he proceeded was stobell’s behaviour he said that he couldn’t believe that a man who grumbled at the sea so much as he did could be sailing for pleasure  mr stobell glowered fiercely why didn’t you tell us before he demanded  i didn’t attach any importance to it said mr chalk truthfully i thought that it was just curiosity on brisket’s part it surprised me that he had been observing you and tredgold so closely that was all  pity you didn’t tell us exclaimed tredgold harshly we might have been prepared then  you ought to have told us at once said stobell  mr chalk agreed i ought to have done so perhaps he said slowly only i was afraid of hurting your feelings as it is we must make the best of it it is no good grumbling at each other  if i had had the map instead of tredgold perhaps this wouldn’t have happened  it was a crazy idea to keep it in your coatpocket said stobell scowling at tredgold no doubt brisket saw you put it back there the other night guessed what it was and laid his plans according  if it hadn’t been for your grumbling it wouldn’t have happened retorted tredgold hotly that’s what roused his suspicions in the first instance  mr chalk interposed it is no good you two quarrelling about it he said with kindly severity the mischief is done bear a hand with these stores and then help me to fix the tent up again  the others hesitated and then without a word mr stobell worked one of the casks out of the boat and began to roll it up the beach the tent still lay where it had fallen but the case of spades had disappeared they raised the tent again and carried in the stores after which mr chalk with the air of an old campaigner made a small fire and prepared breakfast  day by day they scanned the sea for any signs of a sail but in vain cocoanuts and a few birds shot by mr stobell—who had been an expert at pigeonshooting in his youth—together with a species of fish which mr chalk pronounced to be edible a few hours after the others had partaken of it furnished them with a welcome change of diet in the smooth water inside the reef they pulled about in the boat and becoming bolder and more expert in the management of it sometimes ventured outside mr stobell pronounced the life to be more monotonous than that on board ship and once in a moment of severe depression induced by five days’ heavy rain spoke affectionately of mrs stobell to mr chalk’s reminder that the rain had enabled them to replenish their water supply he made a churlish rejoinder  he passed his time in devising plans for the capture and punishment of captain brisket and caused a serious misunderstanding by expressing his regret that that unscrupulous mariner had not rendered himself liable to the extreme penalty of the law by knocking mr chalk on the head on the night of the attack his belated explanation that he wished mr chalk no harm was pronounced by that gentleman to be childish  we can do nothing to brisket even if we escape from this place said tredgold peremptorily  do nothing roared stobell why not  in the first place we sha’n’t find him said tredgold after they have got the treasure they will get rid of the ship and disperse all over the world  mr stobell with heavy sarcasm said that once many years before he had heard of people called detectives  in the second place continued tredgold we can’t explain it wasn’t our map and strictly speaking we had no business with it even if we caught brisket we should have no legal claim to the treasure and if you want to blurt out to all binchester how we were tricked and frightened out of our lives by imitation savages i don’t  he stole our ship growled stobell after a long pause we could have him for that  mutiny on the high seas added chalk with an important air  the whole story would have to come out said tredgold sharply verdict served them right once we had got the treasure we could have given captain bowers his share or more than his share and it would have been all right as it is nobody must know that we went for it  mr stobell unable to trust himself with speech stumped fiercely up and down the beach  but it will all have to come out if we are rescued objected mr chalk  we can tell what story we like said tredgold we can say that the schooner went to pieces on a reef in the night we got separated from the other boat and made our way here we have got plenty of time to concoct a story and there is nobody to contradict it  mr stobell brought up in front of him and frowned thoughtfully i suppose you’re right he said slowly but if we ever get off this chickenperch and i run across him let him look out that’s all  to pass the time they built themselves a hut on the beach in a situation where it would stand the best chance of being seen by any chance vessel at one corner stood a mast fashioned from a tree and a flag composed for the most part of shirts which mr chalk thought his friends had done with fluttered bravely in the breeze it was designed to attract attention and so far as the bereaved mr stobell was concerned it certainly succeeded     chapter xx     nearly a year had elapsed since the sailing of the fair emily and binchester which had listened doubtfully to the tale of the treasure as revealed by mr william russell was still awaiting news of her fate cablegrams to sydney only elicited the information that she had not been heard of and the opinion became general that she had added but one more to the many mysteries of the sea  captain bowers familiar with many cases of ships long overdue which had reached home in safety still hoped but it was clear from the way in which mrs chalk spoke of her husband and the saintlike qualities she attributed to him that she never expected to see him again mr stobell also appeared to his wife through teardimmed eyes as a person of great gentleness and infinite selfsacrifice  all the years we were married she said one afternoon to mrs chalk who had been listening with growing impatience to an account of mr stobell which that gentleman would have been the first to disclaim i never gave him a cross word nothing was too good for me i only had to ask to have  mrs chalk couldn’t help herself why don’t you ask then she inquired  mrs stobell started and eyed her indignantly so long as i had him i didn’t want anything else she said stiffly we were all in all to each other he couldn’t bear me out of his sight i remember once when i had gone to see my poor mother he sent me three telegrams in thirtyfive minutes telling me to come home  thomas was so unselfish murmured mrs chalk i once stayed with my mother for six weeks and he never said a word  an odd expression transient but unmistakable flitted across the face of the listener  it nearly broke his heart though poor dear said mrs chalk glaring at her he said he had never had such a time in his life  i don’t expect he had said mrs stobell screwing up her small features  mrs chalk drew herself up in her chair what do you mean by that she demanded  i meant what he meant replied mrs stobell with a little air of surprise  mrs chalk bit her lip and her friend turning her head gazed long and mournfully at a large photograph of mr stobell painted in oils which stared stiffly down on them from the wall  he never caused me a moment’s uneasiness she said tenderly i could trust him anywhere  mrs chalk gazed thoughtfully at the portrait it was not a good likeness but it was more like mr stobell than anybody else in binchester a fact which had been of some use in allaying certain unworthy suspicions of mr stobell the first time he saw it  yes said mrs chalk significantly i should think you could  mrs stobell about to reply caught the staring eye of the photograph and shaking her head sorrowfully took out her handkerchief and wiped her eyes mrs chalk softened  they both had their faults she said gently but they were great friends i dare say that it was a comfort to them to be together to the last  captain bowers himself began to lose hope at last and went about in so moody a fashion that a shadow seemed to have fallen upon the cottage by tacit consent the treasure had long been a forbidden subject and even when the news of selina’s promissory note reached dialstone lane he had refused to discuss it it had nothing to do with him he said and he washed his hands of it—a conclusion highly satisfactory to miss vickers who had feared that she would have had to have dropped for a time her visits to mr tasker  a slight change in the household occurring at this time helped to divert the captain’s thoughts mr tasker while chopping wood happened to chop his knee by mistake and as he did everything with great thoroughness injured himself so badly that he had to be removed to his home he was taken away at ten in the morning and at a quarterpast eleven selina vickers in a large apron and her sleeves rolled up over her elbows was blacking the kitchen stove and throwing occasional replies to the objecting captain over her shoulder  i promised joseph she said sharply and i don’t break my promises for nobody he was worrying about what you’d do all alone and i told him i’d come  captain bowers looked at her helplessly  i can manage very well by myself he said at last  chop your leg off i s’pose retorted miss vickers goodtemperedly oh you men  and i’m not at home much while miss drewitt is away added the captain  all the better said miss vickers breathing noisily on the stove and polishing with renewed vigour you won’t be in my way  the captain pulled himself together  you can finish what you’re doing he said mildly and then—  yes i know what to do interrupted miss vickers you leave it to me go in and sit down and make yourself comfortable you ought not to be in the kitchen at all by rights not that i mind what people say—i should have enough to do if i did—but still—  the captain fled in disorder and at first had serious thoughts of wiring for miss drewitt who was spending a few days with friends in town thinking better of this he walked down to a servants’ registry office and after being shut up for a quarter of an hour in a small room with a middleaged lady of irish extraction who was sent in to be catechized resolved to let matters remain as they were  miss vickers swept and dusted cooked and scrubbed undisturbed and so peaceable was his demeanour when he returned from a walk one morning and found the front room being turned out that she departed from her usual custom and explained the necessities of the case at some length  i dare say it’ll be the better for it said the captain  o’ course it will retorted selina you don’t think i’d do it for pleasure do you i thought you’d sit out in the garden and of course it must come on to rain  the captain said it didn’t matter  joseph said miss vickers as she squeezed a wet cloth into her pail— joseph’s got a nice leg it’s healing very slow  the captain halting by the kitchen door said he was sorry to hear it  though there’s worse things than bad legs continued miss vickers soaping her scrubbingbrush mechanically being lost at sea for instance  captain bowers made no reply adopting the idea that all roads lead to rome miss vickers had during her stay at dialstone lane made many indirect attempts to introduce the subject of the treasureseekers  i suppose those gentlemen are drowned she said bending down and scrubbing noisily  the captain taking advantage of her back being turned towards him eyed her severely the hardihood of the girl was appalling his gaze wandered from her to the bureau and as his eye fell on the key sticking up in the lid the idea of reading her a muchneeded lesson presented itself he stepped over the pail towards the bureau and catching the girl’s eye as she looked up turned the key noisily in the lock and placed it ostentatiously in his pocket a sudden vivid change in selina’s complexion satisfied him that his manoeuvre had been appreciated  are you afraid i shall steal anything she demanded hotly as he regained the kitchen  the captain quailed no he said hastily somebody once took a paper of mine out of there though he added so i keep it locked up now  miss vickers dropped the brush in the pail and rising slowly to her feet stood wiping her hands on her coarse apron her face was red and white in patches and the captain regarding her with growing uneasiness began to take in sail  at least i thought they did he muttered  selina paid no heed get out o’ my kitchen she said in a husky voice as she brushed past him  the captain obeyed hastily and stepping inside the dismantled room stood for some time gazing out of window at the rain then he filled his pipe and removing a small chair which was sitting upside down in a large one took its place and stared disconsolately at the patch of wet floor and the general disorder  at the end of an hour he took a furtive peep into the kitchen selina vickers was sitting with her back towards him brooding over the stove it seemed clear to him that she was ashamed to meet his eye and glad to see such signs of grace in her he resolved to spare her further confusion by going upstairs he went up noisly and closed his door with a bang but although he opened it afterwards and stood listening acutely he heard so sound from below  by the end of the second hour his uneasiness had increased to consternation the house was as silent as a tomb the sittingroom was still in a state of chaos and a healthy appetite would persist in putting ominous and inconvenient questions as to dinner whistling a cheerful air he went downstairs again and put his head in at the kitchen selina sat in the same attitude and when he coughed made no response  what about dinner he said at last in a voice which strove to be unconcerned  go away said selina thickly i don’t want no dinner  the captain started but i do he said feelingly  you’d better get it yourself then replied miss vickers without turning her head i might steal a potato or something  don’t talk nonsense said the other nervously  i’m not a thief continued miss vickers i work as hard as anybody in binchester and nobody can ever say that i took the value of a farthing from them if i’m poor i’m honest  everybody knows that said the captain with fervour  you said you didn’t want the paper said selina turning at last and regarding him fiercely i heard you with my own ears else i wouldn’t have taken it and if they had come back you’d have had your share you didn’t want the treasure yourself and you didn’t want other people to have it and it wasn’t yours because i heard you say so  very well say no more about it said the captain if anybody asks you can say that i knew you had it now go and put that back in the bureau  he tossed the key on to the table and miss vickers after a moment’s hesitation turned with a gratified smile and took it up the next hour he spent in his bedroom the rapid evolutions of miss vickers as she passed from the saucepans to the sitting room and from the sittingroom back to the saucepans requiring plenty of sea room  a week later she was one of the happiest people in binchester edward tredgold had received a cable from auckland all safe coming home and she shared with mrs chalk and mrs stobell in the hearty congratulations of a large circle of friends her satisfaction was only marred by the feverish condition of mr tasker immediately on receipt of the news     chapter xxi     fortunately for their peace of mind mr chalk and his friends safe on board the ss silver star bound for home had no idea that the story of the treasure had become public property since their message it had become the principal topic of conversation in the town and miss vickers being no longer under the necessity of keeping her share in the affair secret mr william russell was relieved of a reputation for untruthfulness under which he had long laboured  various religious and philanthropic bodies began to bestir themselves owing to his restlessness and love of change no fewer than three sects claimed mr chalk as their own and referring to his donations in the past looked forward to a golden future the claim of the church to mr tredgold was regarded as flawless but the case of mr stobell bristled with difficulties apologists said that he belonged to a sect unrepresented in binchester but an offshoot of the baptists put in a claim on the ground that he had built that place of worship—at a considerable loss on the contract—some fifteen years before  dialstone lane when it became known that captain bowers had waived his claim to a share was besieged by people seeking the reversion and even mint street was not overlooked mr vickers repelled all callers with acrimonious impartiality but selina after a long argument with a lady subaltern of the salvation army during which the methods and bonnets of that organization were hotly assailed so far relented as to present her with twopence on account  miss drewitt looked forward to the return of the adventurers with disdainful interest to edward tredgold she referred with pride to the captain’s steadfast determination not to touch a penny of their illgotten gains and with a few subtle strokes drew a comparison between her uncle and his father which he felt to be somewhat highly coloured in extenuation he urged the rival claims of chalk and stobell  they were both led away by chalk’s eloquence and thirst for adventure he said as he walked by her side down the garden  miss drewitt paid no heed and you will benefit by it she remarked  mr tredgold drew himself up with an air the nobleness of which was somewhat marred by the expression of his eyes i will never touch a penny of it he declared i will be like the captain i am trying all i can to model myself on his lines  the girl regarded him with suspicion i see no signs of any result at present she said coldly  mr tredgold smiled modestly don’t flatter me he entreated  flatter you said the indignant prudence  on my consummate powers of concealment was the reply i am keeping everything dark until i am so like him—in every particular—that you will not know the difference i have often envied him the possession of such a niece when the likeness is perfec——  well said miss drewitt with impatient scorn  you will have two uncles instead of one rejoined mr tredgold impressively  miss drewitt with marked deliberation came to a pause in the centre of the path  are you going to continue talking nonsense she inquired significantly  mr tredgold sighed i would rather talk sense he replied with a sudden change of manner  try said the girl encouragingly  only it is so difficult said edward thoughtfully to you  miss drewitt stopped again  for me added the other hastily his companion said that she supposed it was she also reminded him that nothing was easy without practice  and i ought not to find it difficult complained mr tredgold i have got plenty of sense hidden away somewhere  miss drewitt permitted herself a faint exclamation of surprise it was not an empty boast of yours just now then she said  boast repeated the other blankly what boast  on your wonderful powers of concealment said prudence gently  you are reverting of your own accord to the nonsense said mr tredgold sternly you are returning to the subject of uncles  nothing of the kind said prudence hotly  before we leave it—for ever said mr tredgold dramatically i should like if i am permitted to make just one more remark on the subject i would not for all the wealth of this world be your uncle where are you going  indoors said miss drewitt briefly  one moment implored the other i am just going to begin to talk sense  i will listen when you have had some practice said the girl walking towards the house  it’s impossible to practise this said edward following it is something that can only be confided to yourself won’t you stay  no said the girl  not from curiosity  miss drewitt gazing steadfastly before her shook her head  well perhaps i can say it as well indoors murmured edward resignedly  and you’ll have a bigger audience said prudence breathing more easily as she reached the house uncle is indoors  she passed through the kitchen and into the sittingroom so hastily that captain bowers who was sitting by the window reading put down his paper and looked up in surprise the look of grim determination on mr tredgold’s face did not escape him  mr tredgold has come indoors to talk sense said prudence demurely  talk sense repeated the astonished captain  that’s what he says replied miss drewitt taking a low chair by the captain’s side and gazing composedly at the intruder i told him that you would like to hear it  she turned her head for a second to hide her amusement and in that second mr tredgold favoured the captain with a glance the significance of which was at once returned fourfold she looked up just in time to see their features relaxing and moving nearer to the captain instinctively placed her hand upon his knee  i hope said captain bowers after a long and somewhat embarrassing silence—i hope the conversation isn’t going to be above my head  mr tredgold was talking about uncles said prudence maliciously  nothing bad about them i hope said the captain with pretended anxiety  edward shook his head i was merely envying miss drewitt her possession of you he said carelessly and i was just about to remark that i wished you were my uncle too when she came indoors i suppose she wanted you to hear it  miss drewitt started violently and her cheek flamed at the meanness of the attack  i wish i was my lad said the admiring captain  it would be the proudest moment of my life said edward deliberately  and mine said the captain stoutly  and the happiest  the captain bowed same here he said graciously  miss drewitt listening helplessly to this fulsome exchange of compliments wondered whether they had got to the end the captain looked at mr tredgold as though to remind him that it was his turn  you—you were going to show me a photograph of your first ship said the latter after a long pause don’t trouble if it’s upstairs  it’s no trouble said the captain briskly  he rose to his feet and the hand of the indignant prudence dislodged from his knee fell listlessly by her side she sat upright with her pale composed face turned towards mr tredgold her eyes were scornful and her lips slightly parted before these signs his courage flickered out and left him speechless even commonplace statements of fact were denied him at last in sheer desperation he referred to the loudness of the clock’s ticking  it seems to me to be the same as usual said the girl with a slight emphasis on the pronoun  the clock ticked on undisturbed upstairs the amiable captain did his part nobly drawers opened and closed noisily doors shut and lids of boxes slammed the absurdity of the situation became unbearable and despite her indignation at the treatment she had received miss drewitt felt a strong inclination to laugh she turned her head swiftly and looked out of window and the next moment edward tredgold crossed and took the captain’s empty chair  shall i call him down he asked in a low voice  call him down repeated the girl coldly but without turning her head yes if you——  a loud crash overhead interrupted her sentence it was evident that in his zeal the captain had pulled out a loaded drawer too far and gone over with it slapping sounds as of a man dusting himself down followed and it was obvious that miss drewitt was only maintaining her gravity by a tremendous effort much emboldened by this fact the young man took her hand  mr tredgold she said in a stifled voice  undismayed by his accident the indefatigable captain was at it again and in face of the bustle upstairs prudence drewitt was afraid to trust herself to say more she sat silent with her head resolutely averted but edward took comfort in the fact that she had forgotten to withdraw her hand  bless him he said fervently a little later as the captain’s foot was heard heavily on the stair does he think we are deaf     chapter xxii     much to the surprise of their friends who had not expected them home until november or december telegrams were received from the adventurers one day towards the end of september announcing that they had landed at the albert docks and were on their way home by the earliest train the most agreeable explanation of so short a voyage was that having found the treasure they had resolved to return home by steamer leaving the fair emily to return at her leisure but captain bowers to whom mrs chalk propounded this solution suggested several others  he walked down to the station in the evening to see the train come in his curiosity as to the bearing and general state of mind of the travellers refusing to be denied he had intended to witness the arrival from a remote corner of the platform but to his surprise it was so thronged with sightseers that the precaution was unnecessary the news of the return had spread like wildfire and half binchester had congregated to welcome their fellowtownsmen and congratulate them upon their romantically acquired wealth  despite the crowd the captain involuntarily shrank back as the train rattled into the station the carriage containing the travellers stopped almost in front of him and their consternation and annoyance at the extent of their reception were plainly visible bronzed and healthylooking they stepped out on to the platform and after a brief greeting to mrs chalk and mrs stobell led the way in some haste to the exit the crowd pressed close behind and inquiries as to the treasure and its approximate value broke clamorously upon the ears of the maddened mr stobell friends of many years who sought for particulars were shouldered aside and it was left to mr chalk who struggled along in the rear with his wife to announce that they had been shipwrecked  captain bowers who had just caught the word heard the full particulars from him next day for once the positions were reversed and mr chalk who had so often sat in that room listening to the captain’s yarns swelled with pride as he noted the rapt fashion in which the captain listened to his the tale of the shipwreck he regarded as a disagreeable necessity a piece of paste flaunting itself among gems in a few words he told how the fair emily crashed on to a reef in the middle of the night and how owing to the darkness and confusion the boat into which he had got with stobell and tredgold was cast adrift how a voice raised to a shriek cried to them to pull away and how a minute afterwards the schooner disappeared with all hands  it almost unnerved me he said turning to miss drewitt who was listening intently  you are sure she went down i suppose said the captain she didn’t just disappear in the darkness  sank like a stone said mr chalk decidedly our boat was nearly swamped in the vortex fortunately the sea was calm and when day broke we saw a small island about three miles away on our weatherbeam  where inquired edward tredgold who had just looked in on the way to the office mr chalk explained  you tell the story much better than my father does said edward nodding from the way he tells it one might think that you had the island in the boat with you  mr chalk started nervously it was three miles away on our weatherbeam he repeated the atmosphere clear and the sea calm we sat down to a steady pull and made the land in a little under the hour  who did the pulling inquired edward casually  mr chalk started again and wondered who had done it in mr tredgold’s version he resolved to see him as soon as possible and arrange details  most of us took a turn at it he said evasively and those who didn’t encouraged the others  most of you exclaimed the bewildered captain and those who didn’t— but how many  the events of that night are somewhat misty interrupted mr chalk hastily the suddenness of the calamity and the shock of losing our shipmates—  it’s wonderful to me that you can remember so much said edward with a severe glance at the captain  mr chalk paid no heed having reached the island the rest was truth and plain sailing he described their life there until they were taken off by a trading schooner from auckland and how for three months they cruised with her among the islands he spoke learnedly of atolls copra and missionaries and referring for a space to the fijian belles thought that their charms had been much overrated edward tredgold waiting until the three had secured berths in the ss silver star trading between auckland and london took his departure  miss vickers who had been spending the day with a friend at dutton priors and had missed the arrival in consequence heard of the disaster in a mingled state of wrath and despair the hopes of a year were shattered in a second and rejecting with fierceness the sympathy of her family she went up to her room and sat brooding in the darkness  she came down the next morning pale from want of sleep mr vickers who was at breakfast eyed her curiously until meeting her gaze in return he blotted it out with a teacup  when you’ve done staring said his daughter you can go upstairs and make yourself tidy  tidy repeated mr vickers what for  i’m going to see those three replied selina grimly and i want a witness and i may as well have a clean one while i’m about it  mr vickers darted upstairs with alacrity and having made himself approximately tidy smoked a morning pipe on the doorstep while his daughter got ready an air of importance and dignity suitable to the occasion partly kept off inquirers  we’ll go and see mr stobell first said his daughter as she came out  very good said the witness but if you asked my advice——  you just keep quiet said selina irritably i’ve not gone quite off my head yet and don’t hum  mr vickers lapsed into offended silence and arrived at mr stobell’s followed his daughter into the hall in so stately a fashion that the maid—lately of mint street—implored him not to eat her miss vickers replied for him and the altercation that ensued was only quelled by the appearance of mr stobell at the diningroom door  halloa what do you want he inquired staring at the intruders  i’ve come for my share said miss vickers eyeing him fiercely  share repeated mr stobell share why we’ve been shipwrecked haven’t you heard  perhaps you came to my house when i wasn’t at home retorted miss vickers in a trembling but sarcastic voice i want to hear about it that’s what i’ve come for  she walked to the diningroom and as mr stobell still stood in the doorway pushed past him followed by her father mr stobell after a short deliberation returned to his seat at the breakfasttable and in an angry and disjointed fashion narrated the fate of the fair emily and their subsequent adventures miss vickers heard him to an end in silence  what time was it when the ship struck on the rock she inquired  mr stobell stared at her eleven o’clock he said gruffly  miss vickers made a note in a little redcovered memorandumbook  who got in the boat first she demanded  mr stobell’s lips twisted in a faint grin chalk did he said with relish  miss vickers nodding at the witness to call his attention to the fact made another note  how far was the boat off when the ship sank  here look here— began the indignant stobell  how far was the boat off interposed the witness severely that’s what we want to know  you hold your tongue said his daughter  i’m doing the talking how far was the boat off  about four yards replied mr stobell and now look here if you want to know any more you go and see mr chalk i’m sick and tired of the whole business and you’d no right to talk about it while we were away  i’ve got the paper you signed and i’m going to know the truth said miss vickers fiercely it’s my right what was the size of the island  mr stobell maintained an obstinate silence  what colour did you say these ’ere fidgetty islanders was inquired mr vickers with truculent curiosity  you get out roared stobell rising at once d’ye hear me  mr vickers backed with some haste towards the door his daughter followed slowly  i don’t believe you she said turning sharply on stobell i don’t believe the ship was wrecked at all  mr stobell sat gasping at her what he stammered w haat  i don’t believe it was wrecked repeated selina wildly you’ve got the treasure all right and you’re keeping it quiet and telling this tale to do me out of my share i haven’t done with you yet you wait  she flung out into the hall and mr vickers after a lofty glance at mr stobell followed her outside  and now we’ll go and hear what mr tredgold has to say she said as they walked up the road and after that mr chalk  mr tredgold was just starting for the office when they arrived but recognising the justice of miss vickers’s request for news he stopped and gave his version of the loss of the fair emily in several details it differed from that of mr stobell and he looked at her uneasily as she took out pencil and paper and made notes  if you want any further particulars you had better go and see mr stobell he said restlessly i am busy  we’ve just been to see him replied miss vickers with an ominous gleam in her eye you say that the boat was two or three hundred yards away when the ship sank  more or less was the cautious reply  mr stobell said about half a mile suggested the wily selina  well perhaps that would be more correct said the other  half a mile then  half a mile said mr tredgold nodding as she wrote it down  four yards was what mr stobell said exclaimed selina excitedly i’ve got it down here and father heard it and you make the time it happened and a lot of other things different i don’t believe that you were any more shipwrecked than i was  not so much added the irrepressible mr vickers  mr tredgold walked to the door i am busy he said curtly good morning  miss vickers passed him with head erect and her small figure trembling with rage and determination by the time she had crossexamined mr chalk her wildest suspicions were confirmed his account differed in several particulars from the others and his alarm and confusion when taxed with the discrepancies were unmistakable  binchester rang with the story of her wrongs and being furnished with three different accounts of the same incident seemed inclined to display a little pardonable curiosity to satisfy this intimates of the gentlemen most concerned were provided with an official version which miss vickers discovered after a little research was compiled for the most part by adding all the statements together and dividing by three she paid another round of visits to tax them with the fact and strong in the justice of her cause even followed them in the street demanding her money  there’s one comfort she said to the depressed mr tasker i’ve got you joseph they can’t take you away from me  there’s nobody could do that responded mr tasker with a sigh of resignation  and if i had to choose continued miss vickers putting her arm round his waist i’d sooner have you than a hundred thousand pounds  mr tasker sighed again at the idea of an article estimated at so high a figure passing into the possession of selina vickers in a voice broken with emotion he urged her to persevere in her claims to a fortune which he felt would alone make his fate tolerable the unsuspecting selina promised  she’ll quiet down in time said captain bowers to mr chalk after the latter had been followed nearly all the way to dialstone lane by miss vickers airing her grievance and calling upon him to remedy it once she realizes the fact that the ship is lost she’ll be all right  mr chalk looked unconvinced she doesn’t want to realize it he said shaking his head  she’ll be all right in time repeated the captain and after all you know he added with gentle severity you deserve to suffer a little you had no business with that map     chapter xxiii     on a fine afternoon towards the end of the following month captain brisket and mr duckett sat outside the swan and bottle inn holemouth a small port forty miles distant from biddlecombe the day was fine with just a touch of crispness in the air to indicate the waning of the year and despite a position regarded by the gloomy mr duckett as teeming with perils the captain turned a bright and confident eye on the fair emily anchored in the harbour  we ought to have gone straight to biddlecombe said mr duckett following his glance it would have looked better not that anything’ll make much difference  and everybody in a flutter of excitement telegraphing off to the owners commented the captain no we’ll tell our story first quiet and comfortablelike say it over again  i’ve said it three times objected mr duckett and each time it sounds more unreal than ever  it’ll be all right said brisket puffing at his cigar besides we’ve got no choice it’s that or ruin and there’s nobody within thousands of miles to contradict us we bring both the ship and the map back to ’em what more can they ask  you’ll soon know said the pessimistic mr duckett i wonder whether they’ll have another shot for the treasure when they get that map back i should like to send that captain bowers out searching for it said brisket scowling and keep him out there till he finds it it’s all his fault if it hadn’t been for his cockandbull story we shouldn’t ha’ done what we did hanging’s too good for him  i suppose it’s best for them not to know that there’s no such island hazarded mr duckett  o’ course snapped his companion looks better for us don’t it giving them back a map worth half a million now go through the yarn again and i’ll see whether i can pick any holes in it the train goes in half an hour  mr duckett sighed and first emptying his mug began a monotonous recital brisket listened attentively  we were down below asleep when the men came running down and overpowered us they weighed anchor at night and following morning made you by threats promise to steer them to the island you told me on the quiet that you’d die before you betrayed the owners’ trust how did they know that the island the gentlemen were on wasn’t the right one because sam betts was standing by when you told me you’d made a mistake in your reckoning and said we’d better go ashore and tell them  that’s all right so far i think said brisket nodding  we sailed about and tried island after island just to satisfy the men and seize our opportunity continued mr duckett with a weary air at last one day when they were all drunk ashore we took the map shipped these natives and sailed back to the island to rescue the owners found they’d gone when we got there mr stobell’s boot and an old pair of braces produced in proof  better wrap it up in a piece o’ newspaper said brisket stooping and producing the relic in question from under the table  shipped four white men at viti levu and sailed for home continued mr duckett could have had more but wanted to save owners’ pockets and worked like ab’s ourselves to do so  let’em upset that if they can said brisket with a confident smile the crew are scattered and if they happened to get one of them it’s only his word against ours wait a bit how did the crew know of the treasure  chalk told you responded the obedient duckett and if he told you—and he can’t deny it—why not them  captain briskett nodded approval it’s all right as far as i can see he said cautiously but mind leave the telling of it to me you can just chip in with little bits here and there now let’s get under way  he threw away the stump of his cigar and rose turning as he reached the corner for a lingering glance at the fair emily  scrape her and clean her and she’d be as good as ever he said with a sigh she’s just the sort o’ little craft you and me could ha’ done with peter  they had to change twice on the way to binchester and at each stoppingplace mr duckett a prey to nervousness suggested the wisdom of disappearing while they had the opportunity  disappear and starve i suppose grunted the scornful brisket what about my certificate and yours too i tell you it’s our only chance  he walked up the path to mr chalk’s house with a swagger which the mate endeavoured in vain to imitate mr chalk was out but the captain learning that he was probably to be found at dialstone lane decided to follow him there rather than first take his tidings to stobell or tredgold with the idea of putting mr duckett at his ease he talked on various matters as they walked and arrived at dialstone lane even stopped to point out the picturesque appearance its old houses made in the moonlight  this is where the old pirate who made the map lives he whispered as he reached the door if he’s got anything to say i’ll tackle him about that now pull yourself together  he knocked loudly on the door with his fist a murmur of voices stopped suddenly and in response to a gruff command from within he opened the door and stood staring at all three of his victims who were seated at the table playing whist with captain bowers  the three gentlemen stared back in return tredgold and chalk had half risen from their seats mr stobell with both arms on the table leaned forward and regarded him openmouthed  good evening gentlemen all said captain brisket in a hearty voice  he stepped forward and seizing mr chalk’s hand wrung it fervently  it’s good for sore eyes to see you again sir he said look at him peter  mr duckett ignoring this reflection on his personal appearance stepped quietly inside the door and stood smiling nervously at the company  it’s him said the staring mr stobell drawing a deep breath it’s brisket  he pushed his chair back and rising slowly from the table confronted him captain brisket redfaced and confident stared up at him composedly  it’s brisket said mr stobell again in a voice of deep content turn the key in that door chalk  mr chalk hesitated but brisket stepping to the door turned the key and placing it on the table returned to his place by the side of the mate except for a hard glint in his eye his face still retained its smiling composure  and now said stobell you and me have got a word or two to say to each other i haven’t had the pleasure of seeing your ugly face since—  since the disaster interrupted tredgold loudly and hastily  since the——  mr stobell suddenly remembered for a few moments he stood irresolute and then with an extraordinary contortion of visage dropped into his chair again and sat gazing blankly before him  me and peter duckett only landed today said brisket and we came on to see you by the first train we could—  i know said tredgold starting up and taking his hand and we’re delighted to see you are safe and mr duckett—  he found mr duckett’s hand after a little trouble—the owner seeming to think that he wanted it for some unlawful purpose—and shook that captain brisket considerably taken aback by this performance gazed at him with suspicion  you didn’t go down with your ship then after all said captain bowers who had been looking on with much interest  amazement held brisket dumb he turned and eyed duckett inquiringly then tredgold with his back to the others caught his eye and frowned significantly  if captain brisket didn’t go down with it i am sure that he was the last man to leave it he said kindly and mr duckett last but one  mr duckett distrustful of these compliments cast an agonized glance at the door  stobell was a bit rough just now said tredgold with another warning glance at brisket but he didn’t like being shipwrecked  brisket gazed at the door in his turn he had an uncomfortable feeling that he was being played with  it’s nothing much to like he said at last but—  tell us how you escaped said tredgold or perhaps he continued hastily as brisket was about to speak—perhaps you would like first to hear how we did  perhaps that would be better said the perplexed brisket  he nudged the mate with his elbow and mr tredgold still keeping him under the spell of his eye began with great rapidity to narrate the circumstances attending the loss of the fair emily after one irrepressible grunt of surprise captain brisket listened without moving a muscle but the changes on mr duckett’s face were so extraordinary that on several occasions the narrator faltered and lost the thread of his discourse at such times mr chalk took up the story and once when both seemed at a loss a growling contribution came from mr stobell  of course you got away in the other boat said tredgold nervously when he had finished  brisket looked round shrewdly his wits hard at work already the advantages of adopting a story which he supposed to have been concocted for the benefit of captain bowers were beginning to multiply in his ready brain  and didn’t see us owing to the darkness prompted tredgold with a glance at mr joseph tasker who was lingering by the door after bringing in some whisky  you’re quite right sir said brisket after a trying pause i didn’t see you  unasked he took a chair and with crossed legs and folded arms surveyed the company with a broad smile  you’re a fine sort of shipmaster exclaimed the indignant captain bowers first you throw away your ship and then you let your passengers shift for themselves  i am responsible to my owners said brisket have you any fault to find with me gentlemen he demanded turning on them with a frown  tredgold and chalk hastened to reassure him  in the confusion the boat got adrift said brisket you’ve got their own word for it not that they didn’t behave well for landsmen mr chalk’s pluck was wonderful and mr tredgold was all right  mr stobell turned a dull but ferocious eye upon him  and you all got off in the other boat said tredgold i’m very glad  captain brisket looked at him but made no reply the problem of how to make the best of the situation was occupying all his attention  me and peter duckett would be glad of some of our pay he said at last  pay repeated tredgold in a dazed voice  brisket looked at him again and then gave a significant glance in the direction of captain bowers we’d like twenty pounds on account—now he said calmly  tredgold looked hastily at his friends come and see me tomorrow he said nervously and we’ll settle things  you can send us the rest said brisket but we want that now we’re off tonight  but we must see you again said tredgold who was anxious to make arrangements about the schooner we—we’ve got a lot of things to talk about the—the ship for instance  i’ll talk about her now if you want me to said brisket with unpleasant readiness meantime we’d like that money  fortunately—or unfortunately—tredgold had been to his bank that morning and turning a deaf ear to the expostulations of captain bowers he produced his pocketbook and after a consultation with mr chalk and an attempt at one with the raging stobell counted out the money and handed it over  and there is an iou for the remainder he said with an attempt at a smile as he wrote on a slip of paper  brisket took it with pleased surprise and the mate leaning against his shoulder read the contents where is the ’fair emily’  you might as well give me a receipt said tredgold significantly as he passed over pencil and paper  captain brisket thanked him and sucking the pencil eyed him thoughtfully then he bent to the table and wrote  you sign here peter he said  mr tredgold smiled at the precaution but the smile faded when he took the paper it was a correctly worded receipt for twenty pounds he began to think that he had rated the captain’s intelligence somewhat too highly  ah we’ve had a hard time of it said brisket putting the notes into his breastpocket and staring hard at captain bowers when that little craft went down of course i went down with her how i got up i don’t know but when i did there was peter hanging over the side of the boat and pulling me in by the hair  he paused to pat the mate on the shoulder  unfortunately for us we took a different direction to you sir he continued turning to tredgold and we were pulling for six days before we were picked up by a barque bound for melbourne by the time she sighted us we were reduced to half a biscuit a day each and two teaspoonfuls o’ water and not a man grumbled did they peter  not a man said mr duckett  at melbourne said the captain who was in a hurry to be off we all separated and duckett and me worked our way home on a cargoboat we always stick together peter and me  and always will said mr duckett with a little emotion as he gazed meaningly at the captain’s breastpocket  when i think o’ that little craft lying all those fathoms down continued the captain staring full at mr tredgold it hurts me the nicest little craft of her kind i ever handled well—so long gentlemen  we shall see you tomorrow said tredgold hastily as the captain rose  brisket shook his head  me and peter are very busy he said softly we’ve been putting our little bit o’ savings together to buy a schooner and we want to settle things as soon as possible  a schooner exclaimed mr tredgold with an odd look  captain brisket nodded indulgently  one o’ the prettiest little craft you ever saw gentlemen he said and if you’ve got no objection me and peter duckett thought o’ calling her the fair emily in memory of old times peter’s a bit sentimental at times but i don’t know as i can blame him for it good night  he opened the door slowly and the sentimental mr duckett still holding fast to the parcel containing mr stobell’s old boot slipped thankfully outside calmly and deliberately captain brisket followed and the door was closing behind him when it suddenly stopped and his red face was thrust into the room again  one thing is he said eyeing the speechless tredgold with sly relish she’s uncommonly like the fair emily we lost good night  the door closed with a snap

anything wrong inquired the astonished captain bowers looking from one to the other  there was no reply mr stobell rose and after steadying himself for a moment with his hands on the table blundered heavily towards the door as though magnetized tredgold and chalk followed and standing beside him on the footpath stared solemnly up dialstone lane  captain brisket and his faithful mate had
