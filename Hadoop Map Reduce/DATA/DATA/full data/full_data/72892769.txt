72892769	the coxswains bride by rm ballantyne    story one chapter 1  the rising tidea tale of the sea  the coxswain went by the name of sturdy bob among his mates  among the women of the village he was better known as handsome bob and looking at him you could not help seeing that both titles were appropriate for our coxswain was broad and strong as well as goodlooking with that peculiar cast of features and calm decided manner which frequently distinguish the men who are born to lead their fellows  robert massey though quite young was already a leader of mennot only by nature but by professionbeing coxswain of the greyton lifeboat and truly the men who followed his lead had need to be made of good stuff with bold enthusiastic selfsacrificing spirits for he often led them into scenes of wildbut hold  we must not forecast  well we introduce our hero to the reader on a calm september evening which blazed with sunshine  the sun need not have been mentioned however but for the fact that it converted the head of a fairhaired fishergirl seated beside bob into a ball of rippling gold and suffused her young cheeks with a glow that rudely intensified her natural colour  she was the coxswains brideelect and up to that date the course of their true love had run quite smoothly in spite of adverse proverbs  i cant believe my luck said bob gravely  he said most things gravely though there was not a man in greyton who could laugh more heartily than he at a good joke  what luck do you mean bob asked nellie carr lifting her eyes from the net she was mending and fixing them on the coxswains bronzed face with an air of charming innocence  then becoming suddenly aware of what he meant without being told she gave vent to a quick little laugh dropped her eyes on the net and again became intent on repairs  to think continued bob taking two or three draws at his short pipe for our hero was not perfect being like so many of his class afflicted with the delusion of tobaccoto think that therell be no nellie carr tomorrow afternoon only a mrs massey  the tide o my life is risin fast nelliealmost at flood now  it seems too good to be true  right you are boy interrupted a gruff but hearty voice as a burly fisherman rolled round the stern of the boat in front of which the lovers were seated on the sand  wen my moggie an me was acoortin we thought an said it was too good to be true an so it was leastwise it was too true to be good for moggie took me for better an wuss though it stood to reason i couldnt be both dee see an i soon found her wuss than better which  come come joe slag cried bob lets have none o your illomened growls tonight  what brings you here  ive comed for the key o the lifeboat returned slag with a knowing glance at nellie  if the glass aint tellin lies we may have use for her before long  massey pulled the key from his pocket and gave it to slag who was his bowman and who with the exception of himself was the best man of the lifeboat crew  ill have to follow him said bob rising soon after his mate had left so goodbye nellie till tomorrow  he did not stoop to kiss her for the wide sands lay before them with fisherboys playing thereonapparently in their fathers boots and souwestersand knots of observant comrades scattered about  see that youre not late at church tomorrow bob said the girl with a smile and a warning look  trust me returned bob  as he walked towards the lifeboathousea conspicuous little building near the pierhe tried to blow off some of the joy in his capacious breast by whistling  why slag he exclaimed on entering the shed i do believe youve been an put on the blue ribbon  thats just what ive done bob returned the other  i thought youd ave noticed it at the boat but i forgot you could see nothin but the blue of nellies eyes  of course not  whod expect me to see anything else when im beside her retorted bob  but what has made you change your mind  im sure the last time i tried to get you to hoist the bluepeter ye were obstinate enoughdead against it  true bob but since that time ive seed a dear woman that i was fond of die from drink an ive seed tom riley one of our best men get on the road to ruin through the same so ive hoisted the blue flag as ye see  thats a good job slag but dont you forget my lad that the blue ribbon wont save you  theres but one saviour of men  nevertheless its well to fight our battles under a flag an the blue is a good oneas things go  show your colours and never say die thats my motto  as you said slag the glass is uncommon low today  i shouldnt wonder if there was dirty weather brewin up somewhere  the coxswain was right and the barometer on that occasion was a true prophet  the weather which brewed up that evening was more than dirty it was tempestuous and before midnight a tremendous hurricane was devastating the western shores of the kingdom  many a good ship fought a hard battle that night with tide and tempest and many a bad one went down  the gale was shortlived but fierce and it strewed our western shores with wreckage and corpses while it called forth the energies and heroism of our lifeboat and coastguard men from north to south  driving before the gale that night under closereefed topsails a small but wellfound schooner came careering over the foaming billows from the regions of the far south freighted with merchandise and gold and happy human beings  happy  ay they were happy both passengers and crew for they were used by that time to facing and outriding gales and was not the desired haven almost in sighthome close at hand  the captain however did not share in the general satisfaction  out in blue water he feared no gale but no one knew better than himself that the enemy was about to assail him at his weakest momentwhen close to land  no one however could guess his thoughts as he stood there upon the quarterdeck clad in oilskins drenched with spray glancing now at the compass now at the sails or at the scarce visible horizon  as darkness deepened and tempest increased the passengers below became less cheerful with the exception of one curlyhaired little girl whose exuberant spirit nothing could quell  her young widowed mother had given in to the little ones importunities and allowed her to sit up late on this the last night at sea to lend a helping hand while she packed up so as to be ready for landing next day  consent had been the more readily given that the whitehaired grandfather of little lizzie volunteered to take care of her and keep her out of mischief  the other passengers were as yet only subdued not alarmed  there were men and women and little ones from the australian cities rough men from the sheep farms and bronzed men from the gold mines  all were busy making preparations to land on the morrow  with the exception of those preparations things on board went on much as they had been going on in dirty weather all the voyage through  suddenly there was a crash  most of the male passengers knowing well what it meant sprang to the companionladderthose of them at least who had not been thrown down or paralysedand rushed on deck  shrieks and yells burst forth as if in emulation of the howling winds  crash followed crash as each billow lifted the doomed vessel and let her fall on the sands with a shock that no structure made by man could long withstand  next moment a terrific rending overhead told that one or both of the masts had gone by the board  at the same time the sea found entrance and poured down hatchways and through opening seams in cataracts  the inclined position of the deck showed that she was aground  the very thought of being aground comforted some for to their minds it implied nearness to land and land was in their idea safety these simple ones were doomed to terrible enlightenment  little lizzie pale and silent from terror clung to her grandfathers neck the young widow to his disengaged arm  with the other arm the old man held on to a brass rod and prevented all three from being swept to leeward where several of the women and children were already struggling to escape from a mass of water and wrecked furniture  come on deckall hands shouted a hoarse voice as one of the officers leaped into the cabin followed by several men who assisted the people to rise  it is usual to keep passengers below as much as possible in such circumstances but the position of the schooner with her bow high on a bank and her stern deep in the water rendered a different course needful on this occasion  with difficulty the passengers were got up to the bow where they clustered and clung about the windlass and other points of vantage then it was that the true nature of their calamity was revealed for no land was visible nothing was to be seen around them but a hell of raging foam which in the almost total darkness of the night leaped and glimmered as if with phosphoric light  beyond this circle of as it were wild lambent flame all was black like a wall of ebony from out of which continually there rushed into view coiling curling hoaryheaded monsters in the shape of roaring billows which burst upon and over them deluging the decks and causing the timbers of the ship to writhe as if in pain  weve got on the tail o the sands muttered a sailor to some one as he passed axe in hand to cut away the wreckage of the masts which were pounding and tugging alongside  on the sands  yes but no sands were visible for they had struck on an outlying bank far from shore over which the ocean swept like the besom of destruction  it was nearly low water at the time of the disaster  as the tide fell the wreck ceased to heave  then it became possible for the seamen to move about without clinging to shrouds and stanchions for very life  fetch a rocket jim said the captain to one of the men  jim obeyed and soon a whizzing line of light was seen athwart the black sky  theyll never see it muttered the first mate as he got ready another rocket  weathers too thick  several rockets were fired and then to make more sure of attracting the lifeboat men a tarbarrel fastened to the end of a spar was thrust out ahead and set on fire  by the grand lurid flare of this giant torch the surrounding desolation was made more apparent and at the fearful sight hearts which had hitherto held up began to sink in despair  the mates fears seemed to be well grounded for no answering signal was seen to rise from the land towards which every eye was anxiously strained  one hour passed then another and another but still no help came  then the tide began to rise and with it of course the danger to increase  all this time rockets had been sent up at intervals and tarbarrels had been kept burning  we had better make the women and children fast sir suggested the mate as a heavy mass of spray burst over the bulwarks and drenched them  do so replied the captain gathering up a coil of rope to assist in the work  is this necessary asked the widow as the captain approached her  i fear it is he replied  the tide is rising fast  in a short time the waves will be breaking over us again and you will run a chance of bein swept away if we dont make you fast  but dont despair they must have seen our signals by this time an we shall soon have the lifeboat out  god grant it murmured the widow fervently as she strained poor little trembling lizzie to her breast  but as the moments flew by and no succour came some gave way altogether and moaned piteously while others appeared to be bereft of all capacity of thought or action  many began to pray in frantic incoherence and several gave vent to their feelings in curses  only a few maintained absolute selfpossession and silence  among these were the widow and one or two of the other women  they were in this condition when one of the crew who had been noted as a firstrate singer of sea songs and the life of the focsl had occasion to pass the spot where the passengers were huddled under the lee of the starboard bulwarks  is there never a one of ye he asked almost sternly who can pray like a christian without screechin  you dont suppose the almightys deaf do you  this unexpected speech quieted the noisy ones and one of the women turning to a man beside her said you pray for us joe  joe was one of those who had remained from the first perfectly still except when required to move or when those near him needed assistance he was a grave elderly man whose quiet demeanour dress and general appearance suggested the idea of a city missionaryan idea which was strengthened when in obedience to the womans request he promptly prayed in measured sentences yet with intense earnestness for deliverancefirst from sin and then from impending deathin the name of jesus  his petition was very short and it was barely finished when a wave of unusual size struck the vessel with tremendous violence burst over the side and almost swept every one into the sea  indeed it was evident that some of the weaker of the party would have perished then if they had not been secured to the vessel with ropes  it seemed like a stern refusal of the prayer and was regarded as such by some of the despairing ones when a sudden cheer was heard and a light resembling a great star was seen to burst from the darkness to windward  the lifeboat shouted the captain and they cheered with as much hearty joy as if they were already safe  a few minutes more and the familiar blue and white boat of mercy leaped out of darkness into the midst of the foaming waters like a living creature  it was the boat from the neighbouring port of brentley  either the stormdrift had not been so thick in that direction as in the neighbourhood of greyton or the brentley men had kept a better lookout  she had run down to the wreck under sail  on reaching ita short distant to windwardthe sail was lowered the anchor dropped the cable payed out and the boat eased down until it was under the lee of the wreck  but the first joy at her appearance quickly died out of the hearts of some who were ignorant of the powers of lifeboats and lifeboat men when the little craft was seen at one moment tossed on the leaping foam till on a level with the ships bulwarks at the next moment far down in the swirling waters under the mizzen chains now sheering off as if about to forsake them altogether anon rushing at their sides with a violence that threatened swift destruction to the boat never for one instant still always tugging and plunging like a mad thing  how can we ever get into that was the thought that naturally sprang into the minds of some with chilling power  those however who understood the situation better had more legitimate ground for anxiety for they knew that the lifeboat if loaded to its utmost capacity could not carry more than half the souls that had to be saved  on becoming aware of this the men soon began to reveal their true characters  the unselfish and gentle made way for the women and children  the coarse and brutal casting shame and every manly feeling aside struggled to the front with oaths and curses some of them even using that false familiar motto every man for himself and god for us all  but these received a check at the gangway for there stood the captain revolver in hand  he spoke but one wordback and the cravens slunk away  the mild man who had offered prayer sat on the ships bulwarks calmly looking on  he understood the limited capacity of the boat and had made up his mind to die  now madam make haste cried the mate pushing his way towards the widow  come father she said holding out her hand but the old man did not move  there are more women and little ones he said than the boat can hold  goodbye darling  we shall meet againup yonder  go  never exclaimed the widow springing to his side  i will die with you father  but here boatman save oh save my child  no one attended to her  at such terrible moments men cannot afford to wait on indecision  other women were ready and only too glad to go with a sense almost of relief at the thought that separation was now impossible the widow strained the child to her bosom and clung to her old father  at that moment the report of a pistol was heard and a man fell dead upon the deck  at the last moment he had resolved to risk all and rushed to the side intending to jump into the boat  shove off was shouted  the boat shot from the vessels side  the bowman hauled on the cable  in a few seconds the oars were shipped the anchor was got in and the overloaded but insubmergible craft disappeared into the darkness out of which it had come  the wretched people thus left on the wreck knew well that the boat could not make her port land the rescued party and return for them under some hours  they also knew that the waves were increasing in power and volume with the rising water and that their vessel could not survive another tide  can we wonder that most of them again gave way to despairforgetting that with god all things are possible  they were not yet forsaken however  on the pierhead at greyton their signals had indeed been observed but while the brentley boat owing to its position could run down to the wreck with all sail set it was impossible for that of greyton to reach it except by pulling slowly against wind and tide  the instant that bob massey saw the flare of the first tarbarrel he had called out his men  one after another they came leaping over the rockseager for the godlike work of saving life  it is one of the grand characteristics of our lifeboatmen that on being summoned to the fight there are often far more volunteers than are required  joe slag as in duty bound was first to answer the call then several of the younger men came running down  last of allalmost too latetom riley appeared buckling on his lifebelt as he ran  his gait was not quite steady and his face was flushed  the coxswain was quick to note these facts  take that lifebelt off he said sternly when riley came up  no need to ask why  the tippler knew the reason why only too well and he also knew that it was useless as well as dangerous to disobey the coxswain  he took off the belt at once flung it down and staggered away back to his grogshop  a powerful young fishermanwho had felt almost heartbroken by being refused permission to go for want of roomgladly put on the belt and took rileys place  another minute and they were out of the harbour battling with the billows and fighting their way inch by inch against the howling blast  at last they got out so far that they could hoist sail and run with a slant for the wreck    story one chapter 2  it was daylight by the time the greyton lifeboat arrived at the scene of action but the thick spraycharged atmosphere was almost as bad to see through as the blackness of night  im afeared shes gone shouted slag to the coxswain putting his hand to his mouth to prevent the words being blown bodily away  noi see her bearing souwest was the brief reply as bob massey plied his steering oar  a few minutes later and the despairing people on the wreck catching sight of the boat greeted her with a long wild cheer of reviving hope  what is it asked the widow faintly for she had been growing gradually weaker from prolonged exposure  the lifeboat darling said her father  did i not say that he would not forsake us  thank god murmured the poor woman fervently  look up lizzie the lifeboat is coming to save us  the child who had been comparatively warm and sheltered at the expense of her mother looked up and smiled  soon the boat was alongside and much the same scene that we have already described was reenacted but there were no rebels this time by the captains resolute bearing at first many lives had probably been saved  when most of the people had been lowered into the boatnot without great risk and many bruisesthe widow who cowering with her father and child under the forecastle had been overlooked was led to the side with her child  not together maam said the captain  youd likely drop her  let me lower the child down first or come first yourselfthat will be better  give lizzie to me said the grandfather  ill hold her till you are safe and ready to receive her  look alive maam urged one of the lifeboat men who had scrambled on deck to render assistance  the widow was soon in the boat and held out her arms for little lizzie somehowno one could tell howthe men made a bungle of it  perhaps the very fear of doing so was the cause  instead of being caught by the boatmen lizzie slipped between the boat and the vessel into the boiling sea  giving one agonised cry the grandfather leaped after her but the surging boat swept in at the moment and the old man fortunately fell into that instead of the sea  he was not hurt for strong arms had been upraised to receive him  the little child rose above the foam as she was whirled past the stern of the boat by a swift current  bob massey saw her little outstretched arms  there was no time for thought or consideration  with one bound the coxswain was overboard  next moment the crew saw him far astern with the child in his arms  get em all aboard first came back even against the wind in bobs powerful deeptoned voice  another moment and he was lost to sight in the boiling waste of waters slag knew well what he meant  if they should cast off the rope before rescuing all for the purpose of picking up the coxswain there would be no possibility of getting back again to the schooner for she was fast breaking up  every current and eddy about these sands was well known to joe slag also the set of the tidesbesides had not bob got on his lifebelt  he felt nevertheless that it was a tremendous risk to let him go  but what could poor slag do  to cast off at once would have been to sacrifice about a dozen lives for the sake of saving two  it was a fearful trial  joe loved bob as a brother  his heart well nigh burst but it stood the trial  he did his duty and held on to the wreck  duty on that occasion however was done with a promptitude and in a fashion that was not usual in one of his sedate nature  fortunately none but men remained on the wreck by that time  tumble em insharp cried slag  the lifeboat men obeyed literally and tumbled them in with a celerity that might almost have awakened surprise in a sack of potatoes  to haul up the anchor would have been slow work  slageconomical by naturebecame extravagant for once  an axe made short work of cable and anchor  let em go he growled as the boat drifted away  the sail was set with miraculous speed for now the wind was in their favour and the gay lifeboat bounded off in the direction where bob had disappeared as though it felt a lively interest in the recovery of its coxswain  it seemed as if the very elements sympathised with their anxiety for just then the gale sensibly abated and the rising sun broke through a rift in the grey clouds  there he isi see him shouted the man in the bowpointing eagerly ahead  its ony a bit o wreck boy cried a comrade  right you are returned the bowman  there he is though an no mistake this time  portport hardaport  as he spoke the boat swept round into a sort of crosscurrent among the waves where an object resembling a man was observed spinning slowly round like a lazy teetotum  they were soon alongside  a dozen clawlike hands made a simultaneous grasp and hauled the object on board with a mighty cheer for it was indeed the coxswainalive though much exhaustedwith his precious little curlyhaired burden in his arms  the burden was also alive and not much exhausted for the weather was comparatively warm at the time and bob had thrust her little head into the luxuriant thicket of his beard and whiskers and spreading his great hands and arms all over her little body had also kept her well out of the waterall which the great buoyancy of his lifebelt enabled him easily to do  shall we describe the joy of the widow and the grandfather  no there are some sacred matters in life which are best left to the imagination the sunshine which had begun to scatter the clouds and flood both land and sea was typical of the joy which could find no better means than sobs wherewith to express gratitude to the god of mercy  we have said that the gale had begun to abate  when the lifeboat escaped from the turmoil of crossseas that raged over the sands and got into deep water all difficulties and dangers were past and she was able to lay her course for greyton harbour  lets have another swig o that cold tea said bob massey resuming his rightful post at the helm  it has done me a power o good  i had no notion that cold tea was so good for warmin the cockles o ones heart  ah  bob massey it was not the cold tea but the saving of that little girl that sent the lifes blood careering so warmly through your veins however theres no harm done in putting it down to the credit of the cold tea  had the tea been hot there might have been some truth in your fancy  whats the time asked bob with a sudden look of anxiety  just gone ten said slag consulting a chronometer that bore some resemblance to an antique warmingpan  the look of anxiety on the coxswains countenance deepened  ease off the sheet a bit he said looking sternly over the weather quarter and whistling for a fresher breeze though most men would have thought the breeze fresh enough already  as if to accommodate him and confirm the crew in the whistling superstition the breeze did increase at the moment and sent the lifeboat as one of the men said snorin over the wild sea towards the harbour of greyton  it was a grand sight to behold the pier of the little port on that stormy morning  of course it had soon become known that the lifeboat was out  although at starting it had been seen by only a few of the old saltswhose delight it was to recall the memory of grand stormy times long past by facing the gales at all hours in oiled coats and souwestersthe greater part of the fishing village only became aware of the fact on turning out to work in the morning  we have said that the gale had moderated and the sun had come out so that the pier was crowded not only with fisherfolk but with visitors to the port and other landsmen  great was the hope and sanguine the expectation of the crowd when after long and anxious waiting the lifeboat was at last descried far out at sea making straight for the harbour  all right bill exclaimed an old fisherman who had been for some time past sweeping the horizon with his glass the flags aflyin  what does that mean asked a smart young lady who had braved the blast and run the risk of a saltwash from the sprays at the pierend in her eager desire to see the boat arrive  it means miss that theyve managed to save somebodyhow many in course we cant tell till they come  there was a strong disposition on the part of the crowd to cheer when this was said  after a few minutes further observation the old man with the glass murmured as if speaking to himself i do believe shes chockfull o people  when this was repeated the suppressed cheer broke forth and the excitement increased  soon the people with good eyes could see for themselves that the swiftly approaching boat was as full as she could hold of human beings  at the same time those who were in the boat could see the swarms of sympathisers on the pier who awaited their arrival  but there was one man who took no note of these things and seemed indifferent to everything around him  the coxswain of the lifeboat was spiritually absent from the scene  you seem tove got the fidgets bob remarked joe slag looking earnestly at his friend  that swim has been too much for ee  taint that joe replied bob quickly  whats the time now lad  pulling out the antique warmingpan again slag said it was nigh a quarter past ten and added that he bob seemed to be uncommon consarned about the time o day that mornin  and so would you be lad returned the coxswain in a low voice as he advanced his mouth to his comrades ear if you was in my fix  ive got to be spliced this day before twelve an the church is moren two miles inland  thats awkard returned slag with a troubled look  but i say bob youve kep this uncommon close from us alleh  i never heerd ye was to be spliced so soon  of course i kep it close cos i wanted to give you an my mates a surprise but it strikes me ill give some other people a surprise today for theres no time to put on clean toggery  youll never manage it said slag in a sympathetic tone as he once more consulted the warmingpan  its gettin on for half arter ten now an it takes a mortal time to rig out in them gotomeetin slops  do i look anything like a bridegroom as i am asked the coxswain with a curious glance  scacely replied slag surveying his friend with a grim smilemind your helm bob theres a awkard run on the tide round the pierhead you know  no youre not wery much like one  even if your toggery was all shipshapewhich it aintit would stand dryin and your hair would be the better o brushinto say nothin o your beardan it do seem too as if a bit o soap might improve your hands an face arter last nights work  no bob i couldnt honestly say as youre exactly shipshape as you stand  listen joe slag said bob massey with sudden earnestness  ive never yet come in after a rescue without seein the boat hauled up an made snug  dooty first an pleasure arter thats bin my motto as you know  but dooty lies in another direction this day so you promise to see her hauled up an cleaned an properly housed wont you  in coorse i does  well then continued bob in the same low earnest tone arter thats done youll go an invite all our mates an friends to a jolly blowout in the big shed alongside o my old mothers house  dont tell who invites em or anything about it an ask as many as like to come the sheds big enough to hold em all  only be sure to make em understand that theyll get no drink stronger than coffee an tea  if they cant enjoy themselves on that they may go to the grogshop but they neednt come to me  my mother will be there and shell keep em in order  what exclaimed slag with a look of slight surprise  your mother her whats bin bedridden for years an hasnt got no legs at all leastwise not to speak of  just so lad  well lift her in bed an all  now you be off to the bow  oars out lads stand by the halyards  they were by that time close to the pierhead where the people were shouting and cheering some of them even weeping and waving hats kerchiefs sticks and umbrellas almost wild with joy at seeing so many fellowcreatures rescued from the maw of the hungry sea  the first man who leaped out when the lifeboat touched the pier was the coxswain dripping dirty and dishevelled  bless you my gallant fellow exclaimed an irrepressible old enthusiast stepping forward and attempting to grasp the coxswains hand  but bob massey brushing past him ran along the pier leaped a fence and sprang up the steep path that led to the cliffs over the top of which he was finally seen to bound and disappear  poor fellow exclaimed the irrepressible enthusiast looking aghast at slag exposure and excitement have driven him mad  looks like it replied slag with a quiet grin as he stooped to assist the widow and little lizzie to land while ready hands were outstretched to aid and congratulate the old grandfather and the rest of the rescued people  the coxswain ranay he ran as he had been wont to run when he was a wild little fisherboyregardless alike of appearances and consequences  the clock of the village steeple told him that the appointed hour had almost arrived  two miles was a long way to run in heavy woollen garments and seaboots all soaked in seawater  but bob was young and strong and active andyou understand the rest good reader  the church had purposely been selected at that distance from the village to prevent bobs comrades from knowing anything about the wedding until it should be over  it was a somewhat strange fancy but the coxswain was a man who having taken a fancy was not easily turned from it  in order to her being got comfortably ready in good time nellie carr had slept the night before at the house of an uncle who was a farmer and lived near the church  the house was in a sheltered hollow so that the bride was scarcely aware of the gale that had been blowing so fiercely out at sea  besides being much taken up with cousinbridesmaids and other matters the thought of the lifeboat never once entered her pretty head  at the appointed hour arrayed in all the splendour of a fishermans bride she was led to the church but no bridegroom was there  he wont be long  hes never late whispered a bridesmaid to anxious nellie  minutes flew by and nellie became alarmed  the clergyman also looked perplexed  something must have happened said the farmeruncle apologetically  watches were consulted and compared  at that moment a heavy rapid tread was heard outside  another moment and bob massey sprang into the church panting flushed dirty wet wild and withal grandly savage  nellie he exclaimed stopping short with a joyful gaze of admiration for he had never seen her so like an angel before  bob she cried in alarm for she had never before seen him so like a reprobate  young man began the clergyman sternly but he got no further for without paying any attention to him whatever bob strode forward and seized nellies hands  i dursent kiss ye nell for im all wet but i hadnt one moment to change  bin out all night i the lifeboat an saved over thirty souls the brentley boats done as much  im ashamed sir he added turning to the clergyman for comin here like this but i couldnt help it  i hope theres nothin in scriptur agin a man bein spliced in wet toggery  whether the clergyman consulted his crudens concordance with a view to clear up that theological question we have never been able to ascertain but it is abundantly clear that he did not allow the coxswains condition to interfere with the ceremony for in the greyton journal of next day there appeared a paragraph to the following effect    the marriage of robert massey the heroic coxswain of our lifeboat   which with all its peculiar attendant circumstances and the gallant   rescue that preceded it will be found in another part of this days   issue was followed up in the afternoon by a feast and what we may   style a jollification which will live long in the memory of our   fisherfolk    several circumstances combined to render this weddingfeast unique   to say nothing of the singular beauty of the bride who is well known   as one of the most thrifty and modest girls in the town and the   stalwart appearance of our coxswain who although so young has   already helped to save hundreds of human lives from the raging sea   the gathering was graced by the presence of the bridegrooms   bedridden mother  old mrs massey had been carried in bed and all   to the scene of festivity and it is due to the invalid to state that   despite rheumatics and the singularity of her position she seemed to   enjoy herself exceedingly  besides this the friends and comrades of   the coxswainbacked by the enthusiastic groomsman joe slagwould   not permit massey to don wedding garments but insisted on his dancing   himself dry in the rough garb in which he had effected the rescue   this he had no difficulty in doing having already run himself more   than half dry in hastening from the lifeboat to the church which   latter he reached only just in time    the little girl whom massey personally saved was also present with   her mother and grandfather and one interesting episode of the evening   was the presentation to our coxswain of a gold watch and a purse of   fifty sovereigns by the grateful old grandfather  another peculiarity   of the proceedings was that massey insistedalthough the clergyman   was presenton his old mother asking gods blessing on the feast   before it began  all who are acquainted with our liberalminded vicar   will easily understand that he highly approved of the arrangement    to crown all the feast was conducted on strictly teetotal   principles  we have frequently advocated the principles of total   abstinence in these columnsat least for the young the healthy and   the strongand we are glad to acknowledge that this wedding has   greatly helped our cause for the fun and hilarity in all the vigour   of limb in dancing and of lung in singingin short the general   jollitycould not have been surpassed if the guests had been swilling   rivers of beer and brandy instead of oceans of tea  yes as one of   the irish guests remarked it was a great occasion intoirely and it   will be long before the event is forgotten for the noble deeds of our   greyton lifeboat are from this day forward intimately and   inseparably connected with her coxswains wedding  thus spake the greyton oracle but prophet though that journal professed to be the oracle failed to discern that from that time forward the names of robert massey and joe slag would very soon cease to be connected with the greyton lifeboat    story one chapter 3  soon after the wedding recorded in the last chapter an event occurred which entirely altered the character and current of our coxswains career at least for a time  this was the sudden death of the bedridden old mother who had played such an interesting part at the weddingfeast  to our hero who was a tenderhearted man and a most affectionate son the blow was almost overwhelming although long expected  i dont think i can stay here much longer he said one evening to his pretty wife as they sat together outside their door and watched the village children romping on the sands everything minds me o the dear old woman an takes the heart out me  if it wasnt for you nell id have been off to the other side o the world long before now but i find it hard to think o takin you away from all your old friends and playmatesand your aunt betty  a peculiar smile lit up nellies face as her husband concluded  i should be sorry to leave the old friends here she replied but dont let that hinder you if ye want to go away  id leave everything to please you bob  and as to aunt bettywell im not ungrateful i hope butbut she wouldnt break her heart at partin wi me  right you are nell as you always was and always will be said massey  he laughed a short dry laugh and was grave again  it was quite evident that aunt betty would not be a hindrance to the departure of either of them and no wonder for betty had received nellie carr into her family with a bad grace when her widowed brother old carr died leaving his only child without a home  from that day betty had brought the poor little orphan upor rather had scolded and banged her upuntil bob massey relieved her of the charge  to do aunt betty justice she scolded and banged up her own children in the same way but for theseher own young onesshe entertained and expressed a species of affection which mankind shares in common with cats while for nellie carr she had no such affection and contrived to make the fact abundantly plain  as we not infrequently find in such circumstances the favoured childrenwhich numbered sevenbecame heartbreakers while the snubbed one turned out the flower of the flock  then youre sure you wont think it hard nell if i ask you to leave home and friends and go wi me over the sea  yes bob im quite sure  im willin to follow you to the end o the world or further if thats possible  then the things settled said massey with decision rising and thrusting his short pipe into his vest pocket the lining of which had already been twice renewed in consequence of the inroads of that halfextinguished implement  in pursuance of his settled purpose our coxswain proceeded to the lifeboatshed in search of his bowman joe slag and found him there  joe said he in the quiet tone that was habitual to him nell and i have made up our minds to go to australia  to austrailly exclaimed slag leaning his arms on the mop with which he had been washing down the lifeboat  ay i cant settle to work nohow since the dear old woman went away so as nell is agreeable and theres nothin to keep me here ive decided to up anchor and bear away for the southern seas  the bowman had seated himself on a cask while his friend was speaking and gazed at him with a bewildered air  are ee in arnest bob  ay joe in dead earnest  an you say that youve nothin to keep you here  whats this said slag laying his strong hand tenderly on the blue side of the boat  well ill be sorry to leave her of course an all my friends in greyton but friends will get along well enough without me an as for the boat shell never want a good coxswain while joe slags alive an well  youre wrong there mate returned the bowman quickly while a look of decision overspread his bluff countenance therell be both a noo coxn and a noo bowman wanted for her before long for as sure as the first goes away the tother follers  nonsense joe youre jokin now  yes im jokin if youre jokin otherwise im in dead arnest too in as dead arnest as yourself if not deader  wasnt you an me born on the same day bob  didnt our mothers crow over us cheek by jowl when we was babbies  havent we rollicked together on the shore ever since we was the height of our daddies boots an gone fishin in company fair weather an foul to the present hour to say nothin o the times weve lent a hand to rescue men an women an childn i the lifeboat no no bob massey if you lay yer course for austrailly joseph slag follers as sure as a gun  finding that his comrade was in downright earnest and possessed of a will as inflexible as his own bob made no effort to dissuade him from his purpose  on the contrary he approved of the determination for he was pleased at the unexpected demonstration of affection which his announcement had called forth in one who was by nature undemonstrative and who having thus given vent to his aroused feelings quickly resumed the reserve from which he had been so suddenly drawn out  massey therefore shook hands with him by way of sealing an unspoken compact of eternal friendship and suggested that they should proceed together to the office of an emigration agent who had recently made his appearance in the village  in the office they found a very small boy with an air of selfpossession that would have been suitable in his grandfather  is the agent in asked the coxswain  yes but engaged  sit down hell attend to you directly  the lifeboat men obeyed almost sheepishly the one speculating as to whether highly developed precocity was not almost criminal the other wondering how such a boy would look and act if obliged to undergo the process of being rescuedsay by the hair of his headfrom a wreck  their minds were diverted from this subject of contemplation by the entrance of a man and woman  these like themselves were told to sit down and wait  the man was long thin and lugubrious  the woman short slight and lackadaisical though rather pretty  evidently the agent was a busy man for he kept them waiting some time when he at length appeared he almost took the breath away from his visitors by the rapid and enthusiastic way in which he described the advantages of the great island on the other side of the globe  there was goldyes enormous quantities of gold in all directions  there was land of the finest quality to be had for next to nothing work for all who were blessed with good bone and muscle a constant demand for labourskilled or unskilledat high wages a climate such as the olympian gods might revel in andin short if all england had heard the oration delivered by that man and had believed it the country would in less than a month have been depopulated of its younger men and women and left to the tender mercies of the old and middleaged  our two fishermen were captivated  so were the lugubrious man and his mild little wife  the end of it was that three weeks later these four with many other men and women of all ranks and conditions found themselves on board the good ship lapwing ploughing their way through the billows of the broad atlantic ocean bound for the sunny isles of the antipodes  wheels within wheelsworlds within worldsseems to be the order of nature everywhere  someone has written with more of truth than elegance    big fleas have little fleas upon their legs to bite em   and little fleas have lesser fleasand so ad infinitum  ones native land is to millions of people the world in which their thoughts centre and by which they are circumscribed  a farmers homestead is the world to him and one of the farmers cheeses contains a mighty world in itself  but the most complete compact and exclusive world in existence perhaps is a ship at seaespecially an emigrant shipfor here we find an epitome of the great world itself  here may be seen in small compass the operations of love and hate of wisdom and stupidity of selfishness and selfsacrifice of pride passion coarseness urbanity and all the other virtues and vices which tend to make the world at largea mysterious compound of heaven and hell  wherever men and womennot to mention childrenare crowded into small space friction ensues and the inevitable result is moral electricity positive and negativechiefly positive  influences naturally follow pleasant and unpleasantsometimes explosions which call for the interference of the captain or officer in charge of the deck at the time being  for instance tomlin is a fiery but provident man and has provided himself with a deckchaira most important element of comfort on a long voyage  sopkin is a big sulky and heedless man and has provided himself with no such luxury  a few days after leaving port sopkin finds tomlins chair on deck empty and being ignorant of social customs at sea seats himself thereon  tomlin coming on deck observes the fact and experiences sudden impulses in his fiery spirit  the electricity is at work  if it were allowable to venture on mental analysis we might say that tomlins sense of justice is violated  it is not fair that he should be expected to spend money in providing comforts for any man much less for a man who carelessly neglects to provide them for himself his sense of propriety is shocked for sopkin has taken possession without asking leave  his selfesteem is hurt for although sopkin knows it is his chair he sits there doggedly like a big brute as he is and does not seem to care what tomlin thinks or how he looks besides there is thrust upon tomlin the disagreeable necessity of claiming his own and that too in a gentlemanly tone and mannerfor it will not do to assume beforehand that sopkin is going to refuse restitution  tomlin is not aware that he thinks all this but he knows that he feels it and in spite of himself demands his property in a tone and with a look that sets agoing the electrical current in sopkin who replies in a growling tone it is my chair just now  ordinary men would remonstrate in a case of this kind or explain but tomlin is not ordinary  he is fiery  seizing the back of his property he hitches it up and with a deft movement worthy of a juggler deposits the unreasonable sopkin abruptly on the deck  sopkin leaps up with doubled fists  tomlin stands on guard  rumkin a presumptuous man who thinks it his special mission in life to set everything wrong right rushes between them and is told by both to mind his own business  the interruption however gives time to the captain to interfere he remarks in a mild tone not unmixed with sarcasm that rough skylarking is not appropriate in the presence of ladies and that there is a convenient focsl to which the gentlemen may retire when inclined for such amusement  there is a something in the captains look and manner which puts out the fire of tomlins spirit and reduces the sulky sopkin to obedience besides overawing the presumptuous rumkin and from that day forth there is among the passengers a better understanding of the authority of a sea captain and the nature of the unwritten laws that exist more or less on shipboard  we have referred to an incident of the quarterdeck but the same laws and influences prevailed in the forepart of the vessel in which our coxswain and his friend had embarked  it was the evening of the fifth day out and massey joe slag the long lugubrious man whose name was mitford and his pretty little lackadaisical wife whose name was peggy were seated at one end of a long messtable having suppera meal which included tea and bread and butter as well as salt junk etcetera  you dont seem quite to have recovered your spirits yet mitford said massey to the long comrade  have a bit o pork  theres nothin like that for givin heart to a man  ay specially arter a bout o seasickness put in slag who was himself busily engaged with a mass of the proposed remedy  it ud do yer wife good too  try it maam  youre not half yerself yit theres too much green round your eyes an yaller about yer cheeks for a healthy young ooman  thank you iid rather not said poor mrs mitford with a faint smileand really though faint and called forth in adverse circumstances it was a very sweet little smile despite the objectionable colours above referred to  i was never a great and with victuals an i find that the sea dont improve appetitethough after all i cant see why it should and  poor mrs mitford stopped abruptly for reasons best known to herself she was by nature rather a loquacious and so to speak irrelevant talker  she delivered herself in a soft unmeaning monotone which like the brook flowed on for everat least until some desperate listener interrupted her discourteously  in the present instance it was her own indescribable feelings which interrupted her  try a bit o plumduff mrs mitford suggested massey with wellintentioned sincerity holding up a lump of the viand on his fork  oh pleasedont  some tea  quick  ill go  and she went  poor peggy she never could stand much rough an tumble said her husband returning from the berth to which he had escorted his wife and seating himself again at the table  shes been very bad since we left an dont seem to be much on the mend  he spoke as one who not only felt but required sympathyand he got it  och niver give in said the assistant cook who had overheard the remark in passing  the ould girlll be all right before the end o this wake  it niver lasts more nor tin days at the outside  an the waker the patients is the sooner they comes round so dont let yer sperrits down mr mitford  thank ee kindly terrence for your encouragin words but im doubtful  my poor peggy is so weak and helpless  he sighed shook his head as he concluded and applied himself with such energy to the plumduff that it was evident he expected to find refuge from his woes in solid food  you dont seem to be much troubled wi sickness yourself remarked massey after eyeing the lugubrious man for some time in silence  no i am not which is a blessin  i hope that mrs massey aint ill  no my nell is never ill returned the coxswain in a hearty tone shed have been suppin along with us tonight but shes nursin that poor sick lad ian stuart thats dyin  is the lad really dyin asked mitford laying down his knife and fork and looking earnestly into his companions face  well it looks like it  the poor little fellow seemed to me past recoverin the day he came on board and the stuffy cabin wi the heavin o the ship has bin over much for him  while he was speaking nellie herself came softly to her husbands side and sat down  her face was very grave  the doctor says theres no hope she said  the poor boy may last a few days so he tells us but he may be taken away at any moment  pour me out a cup o tea bob  i must go back to him immediately  his poor mother is so broken down that shes not fit to attend to him and the fathers o no use at all  he can only go about groanin  no wonder ian is their only child bobtheir firstborn  i cant bear to think of it  but youll break down yourself nell if you go nursin him every night an all night like this  surely theres some o the women on board thatll be glad to lend a helpin hand  i know one wholl be only too happy to do that whether shes well or ill said mitford rising with unwonted alacrity and hastening to his wifes berth  just then the bosns stentorian voice was heard giving the order to close reef topsls and the hurried tramping of many feet on the deck overhead coupled with one or two heavy lurches of the ship seemed to justify the assistant cooks remarksure its durty weather were goin to have annyhow    story one chapter 4  the indications of bad weather which had been observed were not misleading for it not only became what terrence oconnor had termed durty but it went on next day to develop a regular gale insomuch that every rag of canvas except stormsails had to be taken in and the hatches battened down thus confining the passengers to the cabins  these passengers looked at matters from wonderfully different points of view and felt accordingly  surroundings had undoubtedly far greater influence on some of them than was reasonable  of course we refer to the landsmen only  in the aftercabin where all was light cosy and comfortable and well fastened and where a considerable degree of propriety existed feelings were comparatively serene  most of the ladies sought the retirement of berths and became invisible though not necessarily inaudible a few who were happily weatherproof jammed themselves into velvety corners held on to something fixed and lost themselves in books  the gentlemen linking themselves to articles of stability did the same or retiring to an appropriate room played cards and draughts and enveloped themselves in smoke  few if any of them bestowed much thought on the weather  beyond giving them occasionally a little involuntary exercise it did not seriously affect them  very different was the state of matters in the steerage  there the difference in comfort was not proportioned to the difference in passagemoney  there was no velvet not much light little space to move about and nothing soft  in short discomfort reigned so that the unfortunate passengers could not easily read and the falling of tin panikins and plates the crashing of things that had broken loose the rough exclamations of men and the squalling of miserable children affected the nerves of the timid to such an extent that they naturally took the most gloomy view of the situation  of course the mere surroundings had no influence whatever on the views held by bob massey and joe slag  my dear said the latter in a kindly but vain endeavour to comfort mrs mitford rumpusses below aint got nothin to do wi rows overheadleastways theyre only an effect not a cause  there theres another interrupted mrs mitford with a little scream as a tremendous crash of crockery burst upon her ear  well my dear said slag in a soothing fatherly tone if all the crockery in the ship was to go in universal smash into the lee scuppers it couldnt make the wind blow harder  poor mrs mitford failed to derive consolation from this remark  she was still sick enough to be totally and hopelessly wretched but not sufficiently so to be indifferent to life or death  every superlative howl of the blast she echoed with a sigh and each excessive plunge of the ship she emphasised with a weak scream  i dont know what you think she said faintly when two little boys rolled out of their berths and went yelling to leeward with a mass of miscellaneous rubbish but it do seem to be as if the end of the world ad come  not that the sea could be the end of the world for if it was of course it would spill over and then we would be left dry on the bottomor moist if not dry  i dont mean that you know but these crashes are so dreadful an my poor ead is like to splitwhich the planks of this ship will do if they go on creakin so  i know they will for umanmade things cant  you make your mind easy my woman said her husband coming forward at the moment and sitting down to comfort her  things are lookin a little better overhead so one o the men told me an i heard terrence say that were goin to have lobscouse for dinner today though what that may be i cant tellsomethin good i suppose  something thick an lukewarm an greasy i know groaned peggy with a shudder  there was a bad man on board the ship  there usually is a bad man on board of most ships sometimes more than one  but this one was unusually bad and was unfortunately an old acquaintance of the mitfords  indeed he had been a lover of mrs mitford when she was peggy owen though her husband knew nothing of that  if peggy had known that this manned jarring by namewas to be a passenger she would have prevailed on her husband to go by another vessel but she was not aware of it until they met in the forecabin the day after leaving port  being a darkhaired sallowcomplexioned man he soon became known on board by the name of black ned  like many bad men jarring was a drunkard and when under the influence of liquor was apt to act incautiously as well as wickedly  on the second day of the gale he entered the forecabin with unsteady steps and looked round with an air of solemn stupidity  besides being dark and swarthy he was big and strong and had a good deal of the bully in his nature  observing that mrs mitford was seated alone in a dark corner of the cabin with a still greenish face and an aspect of woe he staggered towards her and sitting down took her hand affectionately  dear peggy he began but he got no further for the little woman snatched her hand away sprang up and confronted him with a look of blazing indignation  every trace of her sickness vanished as if by magic  the greenish complexion changed to crimson and the woebegone tones to those of firm resolution as she exclaimed  ned jarring if you ever again dare to take liberties with me ill tell my usband i will an as sure as youre asittin on that seat ell twist you up turn you outside in an fling you overboard  little mrs mitford did not wait for a response but turning sharply round left the cabin with a stride which for a woman of her size and character was most impressive  jarring gazed after her with an expression of owlish and unutterable surprise on his swarthy countenance  then he smiled faintly at the unexpected and appallingnot to say curiousfate that awaited him but reflecting that although lugubrious and long mitford was deepchested broadshouldered and wiry he became grave again shook his head and had the sense to make up his mind never again to arouse the slumbering spirit of peggy mitford  it was a wild scene that presented itself to the eyes of the passengers in the lapwing when the hatches were at last taken off and they were permitted once more to go on deck  grey was the prevailing colour  the great seas which seemed unable to recover from the wild turmoil into which they had been lashed were of a cold greenish grey flecked and tipped with white  the sky was steely grey with clouds that verged on black and both were so mingled together that it seemed as if the little vessel were imbedded in the very heart of a drizzling heaving hissing ocean  the coxswains wife stood leaning on her stalwart husbands arm by the foremast gazing over the side  it do seem more dreary than i expected she said  i wouldnt be a sailor bob much as ive bin used to the sea an like it  ah nell thats cause youve only bin used to the seashore  you havent bin long enough on blue water lass to know that folks opinions change a good deal wi their feelins  wait till we git to the neighbourood o the line wi smooth water an blue skies an sunshine sharks and flyin fish  youll have a different opinion then about the sea  right you are bob said joe slagg coming up at that moment  most people change their opinions arter gittin to the line specially when it comes blazin hot fit to bile the sea an stew the ship an a dead calm gits a hold of e an keeps ye swelterin in the doldrums for a week or two  but it wasnt that way we was lookin at it joe returned nellie with a laugh  bob was explainin to me how pleasant a change it would be after the cold grey sea an sky were havin just now  well it may be so but whatever way ye may look at it youll change yer mind more or less when you cross the line  by the way that minds me that some of us in the steerage are invited to cross the line tonightthe line that separates us from the cabinto attend a lectur therean youll niver guess the subjec bob  i know that joe  i never made a right guess in my life that i knows on  heave ahead what is it  a lectur on the lifeboat no less  but it aint our lifeboat sarvice its the american one cause its to be given by that fine young fellow dr hayward who looks as if suthin had damaged his constitootion somehow  im told hes a yankee though he looks uncommon like an englishman  hes tall an andsome enough anyhow remarked massey  ay an hes good enough for anything said nellie with enthusiasm you should see the kind way he speaks to poor ian when he comes to see himwhich is pretty much every day  he handles him too so tenderly just like his mother but he wont give him medicine or advice for it seems that wouldnt be thought fair by the ships doctor  no more it would i suppose  dee know whats the matter wi him asked mitford who had joined the group  not i returned massey  it seems more like gineral weakness than anything else  i can tell you said a voice close to them  the voice was that of tomlin who although a firstclass passenger was fond of visiting and fraternising with the people of the forecabin  he got himself severely wounded some time ago when protecting a poor slavegirl from her owner and hes now slowly recovering  he is taking a long voyage for his health  the girl it seems had run away from her owner and had nearly escaped into canada where of course being on british soil she would be free  god bless the british soil interrupted little mrs mitford in a tone of enthusiasm which caused a laugh all round but that did not prevent some of the bystanders from responding with a hearty amen  i agree with you mrs mitford said tomlin but the owner of the poor slave did not think as you and i do  the girl was a quadroonthat is nearly if not altogether white  she was also very beautiful well the ownera coarse brutewith two followers overtook the runaway slave near a lonely roadside taverni forget the name of the placebut dr hayward happened to have arrived there just a few minutes before them  his horse was standing at the door and he was inside talking with the landlord when he heard a loud shriek outside  running out he found the girl struggling wildly in the hands of her captors of course he demanded an explanation though he saw clearly enough how matters stood  shes my slave said the owner haughtily  he would not perhaps have condescended even with that much explanation if he had not seen that the landlord sympathised with the doctor  this was enough however for hayward who is a man of few words and swift action  he was unarmed but carried a heavyhandled whip with this he instantly felled the slaveowner and one of his men to the ground before they had time to wink but the third man drew a pistol and pointing it straight at the doctors head would have blown out his brains if the landlord had not turned the weapon aside and tripped the man up  before he could recover hayward had swung the girl on his horse leaped into the saddle and dashed off at full speed  he did not draw rein till he carried her over the frontier into canada and had placed her beyond the reach of her enemies  brayvo the doctor exclaimed slag heartily  then he found continued tomlin that he had been wounded in the chest by the ball that was meant for his head but made light of the wound until it was found to be serious  the ball was still in him and had to be extracted after which he recovered slowly  the romantic part of it is however that he fell in love with evathat was the girls nameand she with him and they were married  ah poor thing said mitford then she died and he married again  not at all returned tomlin she did not die and he did not marry again  howwhat then about that splendid wife that hes got in the aftercabin now asked mitford  thats her  thats eva the quadroon  shes not only as white as mrs massey or mrs mitford there but shes been educated and brought up as a lady and among ladies besides having the spirit of a real lady which many a born one hasnt got at all  there were many forecabin passengers who crossed the line that night in order to hear the gallant american lecture but chiefly to see the beautiful lady who had been so romantically rescued from slavery  not a drop of black blood in her body was mrs mitfords verdict after the lecture was over  an what if there was demanded slag in a tone of indignation  dee think that white blood is worth more than black blood in the eyes o the almighty as made em both  the lecture itself was highly appreciated being on a subject which bob and joe had already made interesting to the steerage passengers  and the lecturer not only treated it well but was himself such a fine lionlike yet softvoiced fellow that his audience were quite charmed  soon the lapwing was gliding through the warm waters of the equatorial seas and those of the passengers who had never visited such regions before were immensely interested by the sight of dolphins sharks and especially flyingfish  i dont believe in em said mrs mitford to mrs massey one day as they stood looking over the side of the ship  i do believe in em said mrs massey because my bob says he has seen em  not long after this double assertion of opinion there was a sudden cry that flyingfish were to be seen alongside and mrs mitford actually beheld them with her own eyes leap out of the sea skim over the waves a short distance and then drop into the water again still she was incredulous  flyin she exclaimed nothin of the sort they only made a long jump out o the water an wriggled their tails as they went at least they wriggled something for i couldnt be rightly sure they ad tails to wriggle any more than wingsnever avin seen em except in pictures which is mostly lies  indeed  lookout exclaimed slag at the moment for a couple of fish flew over the bulwarks just then and fell on deck almost at mrs mitfords feet when she saw them there floundering about wings and all she felt constrained to give in  well well she said raising her hands and eyes to heaven as though she addressed her remarks chiefly to celestial ears did ever mortal see the likes  fish wi wings an no feathers  ill believe anything after that  peggy mitford is not the first and wont be the last womanto say nothing of manwho has thus bounded from the depths of scepticism to the heights of credulity    story one chapter 5  dr hayward who had given great satisfaction with his lecture possessed so much urbanity and power of anecdote and song that he soon became a general favourite alike with steerage and cabin passengers  one sultry forenoon terrence oconnor the assistant steward went aft and whispered to him that ian stuart the sick boy wanted very much to see him  i think hes dying sor said terrence in a low tone  has the doctor seen him this morning asked hayward as he rose quickly and hurried forward  hes seed him twice sor said terrence an both times he shook his head as he left him  it was evident that the steerage passengers felt death to be hovering over them for they were unusually silent and those who were in the forecabin at the time hayward passed cast solemn glances at him as he descended and went to the berth of the poor boy  it was a comparatively large berth and being at the time on the weather side of the ship had the port open to admit fresh air  my poor boy do you suffer much said the doctor in soothing tones as he sat down beside ian and took his hand  it was obvious that ian suffered for an expression of weariness and pain sat on his emaciated countenance but on the appearance of hayward the expression gave place to a glad smile on a face which was naturally refined and intellectual  oh thank youthanks said ian in a low hesitating voice for he was almost too far gone to speak  there dont speak dear boy said the doctor gently  i see you have been thinking about our last conversation  shall i read to you  nono  jesus is speakingto me  his words are crowding on me  no need forreading when he speaks comeunto mei will never leave  his breath suddenly failed him and he ceased to speak but the glad look in his large eyes showed that the flow of divine words though inaudible had not ceased  motherfather he said after a short pause dont cry  youll soon join me  dont let them cry dr hayward  the parting wont be for long  the doctor made no reply for at that moment the unmistakable signs of dissolution began to overspread the pinched features and in a few minutes it became known throughout the ship that the king of terrors had been there in the guise of an angel of light to pluck a little flower and transplant it into the garden of god  hayward tried to impress this fact on the bereaved parents but they would not be comforted  they were a lowly couple who could not see far in advance of them even in regard to things terrestrial  the last words of their child seemed to have more weight than the comfort offered by the doctor  cheer up david said the poor wife grasping her husbands hand and striving to check her sobs ian said truth it wont be long afore we jine him the dear dear boy  but even as she uttered the words of cheer her own heart failed her and she again gave way to uncontrollable grief while her husband dazed and motionless sat gazing at the face of the dead  the funeral and its surroundings was as sad as the death  everything was done to shroud the terrible reality  the poor remains were tenderly laid in a black deal coffin and carried to the port side of the ship by kind and loving hands  a young wesleyan minister who had been an unfailing comforter and help to the family all through the boys illness gave a brief but very impressive address to those who stood around and offered up an earnest prayer but nothing could blind the mourners especially the parents to the harsh fact that the remains were about to be consigned to a never resting grave and that they were going through the form rather than the reality of burial while as if to emphasise this fact the back fin of a great shark was seen to cut the calm water not far astern  it followed the ship until the hollow plunge was heard and the weighted coffin sank into the unknown depths of the sea  an impression that never faded quite away was made that day on some of the more thoughtful and sensitive natures in the ship  and who can say that even amongst the thoughtless and the depraved no effect was produced  gods power is not usually exerted in visibly effective processes  seeds of life may have been sown by that death which shall grow and flourish in eternity  certain it is that some of the reckless were solemnised for a time and that the young wesleyan was held in higher esteem throughout the ship from that day forward  some of the passengers however seemed very soon to forget all about the death and relapsed into their usual frames of mind  among these was ned jarring  for several days after the funeral he kept sober and it was observed that the wesleyan minister tried to get into conversation with him several times but he resisted the good mans efforts and when one of his chums laughingly remarked that he seemed to be hand and glove wi the parson now black ned swung angrily round took to drinking again and as is usually the case in such circumstances became worse than before  thus the little world of shipboard went on from day to day gradually settling down into little coteries as likeminded men and women began to find each other out  gradually also the various qualities of the people began to be recognised and in a few weeksas in the greater worldeach man and woman was more or less correctly gauged according to worth  the courageous and the timid the sensible and the vain the weak and the strong the selfsacrificing and the selfish all fell naturally into their appropriate positions subject to the moderate confusion resulting from favouritism abused power and other forms of sin  it was observable also that here as elsewhere all the coteries commented with considerable freedom on each other and that each coterie esteemed itself unquestionably the best of the lot although it might not absolutely say so in words  there was one exception namely in the case of the worst or lowest coterie which so far from claiming to be the best openly proclaimed itself the worst gloried in its shame and said that it didnt care a button or words even more expressive to the same effect  ned jarring belonged to this last class  he was probably the worst member of it  one night an incident occurred which tested severely some of the qualities of every one on board  it was sometime after midnight when the dead silence of the slumbering ship was broken by perhaps the most appalling of all sounds at seathe cry of fire  smoke had been discovered somewhere near the forecabin  fortunately the captain had just come up at the time to speak with the officer of the watch on deck  at the first cry he ran to the spot pointed out telling the officer to call all hands and rig the pumps and especially to keep order among the passengers  the first man who leaped from profound slumber into wideawake activity was dr hayward  having just lain down to sleep on a locker as he expected to be called in the night to watch beside a friend who was ill he was already dressed and would have been among the first at the scene of the fire but for an interruption  at the moment he was bounding up the companionladder a young man of feeble characterwho would have been repudiated by the sex had he been born a womansprang down the same ladder in abject terror  he went straight into the bosom of the ascending doctor and they both went with a crash to the bottom  although somewhat stunned hayward was able to jump up and again make for the region of the fire where he found most of the men and male passengers working with hose and buckets in the midst of dire confusion fortunately the seat of the conflagration was soon discovered and owing much to the cool energy of the captain and officers the fire was put out  it was about a week after this thrilling event that mrs massey was on the forecastle talking with peggy mitford  a smart breeze was blowing just enough to fill all the sails and carry the ship swiftly on her course without causing much of a sea  the moon shone fitfully through a mass of drifting clouds mingling its pallid light with the wondrous phosphoric sheen of the tropical seas  mrs mitford had been regaling her companion with a longwinded and irrelevant though wellmeant yarn about things in general and nothing in particular and nellie who was the personification of considerate patience had seated herself on the starboard rail to listen to and comment on her lucubrations  yes as i was sayin nellie remarked peggy in her soft voice after a brief pause during which a variety of weak little expressions crossed her pretty face i never could abide the sea  it always makes me sick an when it doesnt make me sick it makes me nervish  not that im given to bein nervish an if i was it wouldnt matter much for the sea would take it out o me whether or not  thats always the wayif its not one thing its sure to be another  dont you think so nellie  my john says e thinks sothough it isnt to be thought much of what e says dear man for es got a way of sayin things when e dont mean emyou understand  well i dont quite understand answered mrs massey cutting in at this point with a laugh but im quite sure its better to say things when you dont mean them than to mean things when you dont say them  perhaps youre right nellie rejoined mrs mitford with a mild nod of assent ive sometimes thought on these things when ive ad one o my sick eadaches which prevents me from thinkin altogether almost an bless you youd wonder what strange idears comes over me at such times  did you ever try to think things with a sick eadache nellie  with a laugh and a bright look mrs massey replied that she had never been in a position to try that curious experiment never having had a headache of any kind in her life  while she was speaking a broadbacked wave caused the ship to roll rather heavily to starboard and mrs massey losing her balance fell into the sea  sedate and strongminded though she was nellie could not help shrieking as she went over but the shriek given by mrs mitford was tenfold more piercing  it was of a nature that defies description  its effect was to thrill the heart of every one who heard it  but peggy did more than shriek  springing on the rail like an antelope she would have plunged overboard to the rescue of her friend regardless of her own inability to swim and of everything else had not a seaman who chanced to be listening to the conversationcaught her with a vicelike grip  hold on peggy he cried  but peggy shrieked and struggled thus preventing the poor fellow from attempting a rescue while shouts and cries of man overboard rang through the ship from stem to stern until it became known that it was a woman  then the cries redoubled  in the midst of the hubbub the strong but calm voice of the captain was heard to give orders to lower a boat and port the helmhard aport  but alas for poor nellie that night if her life had depended on shouters strugglers shriekers or boatmen  at the moment the accident happened two men chanced to be standing on the starboard side of the shipone on the quarterdeck the other on the forecastle  both men were ready of resource and prompt in action invaluable qualities anywhere but especially at sea  the instant the cry arose each sprang to and cut adrift a lifebuoy  each knew that the person overboard might fail to see or catch a buoy in the comparative darkness  he on the forecastle who chanced to see nellie fall over at once followed her with the lifebuoy in his arms  ignorant of this act the man near the stern saw something struggling in the water as the ship flew past  without an instants hesitation he also plunged into the sea with a lifebuoy in his grasp  the faint light failed to reveal who had thus boldly plunged to the rescue but the act had been observed both at bow and stern and a cheer of hope went up as the ship came up to the wind topsails were backed and the boat was dropped into the water  twenty minutes elapsed before there was any sign of the boat returning during which time the ships bell was rung continually  it may be better imagined than described the state of poor bob massey who had been asleep on a locker in the forecabin when the accident occurred and who had to be forcibly prevented at first from jumping into the sea when he heard that it was nellie who was overboard  at last oars were heard in the distance  stop that bell boat ahoy shouted the captain  ship ahoooy came faintly back on the breeze while every voice was hushed and ear strained to listen all right all saved  a loud thank the lord burst from our coxswains heaving chest and a wild ringing cheer leaped upwards alike from passengers and crew while warm tears overflowed from many an eye that was more intimate with cold spray for a noble deed and a life saved have always the effect of stirring the deepest enthusiasm of mankind  a few minutes more and three dripping figures came up the gangway first came nellie herself dishevelled and pale but strong and hearty nevertheless as might be expected of a fishergirl and a lifeboat coxswains wife  she naturally fell into or was caught up by her husbands arms and was carried off to the cabin  following her came two somewhat exhausted men  the cheer that greeted them was not unmingled with surprise  the best an the worst men i the ship gasped joe slag amid laughter and hearty congratulations  he was probably right for it was the young wesleyan minister and ned jarring who had effected this gallant rescue  the performance of a good action has undoubtedly a tendency to elevate as the perpetration of a bad one has to demoralise  from that day forward black ned felt that he had acquired a certain character which might be retained or lost  without absolutely saying that he became a better man in consequence we do assert that he became more respectable to look at and drank less  thus the voyage progressed until the good ship lapwing sailed in among some of the innumerable islands of the southern seas    story one chapter 6  darkness whether physical mental or spiritual is probably the greatest evil that man has had to contend with since the fall  at all events the physical and mental forms of it were the cause of the good ship lapwing sailing one night straight to destruction  it happened thus  a pretty stiff breeze amounting almost to half a gale was blowing on the night in question and the emigrant ship was running before it under closereefed topsails  for some days previously the weather had been dirty and the captain had found it impossible to obtain an observation so that he was in the dark as to the exact part of the ocean in which he was sailing  in an open sea this is not of serious moment but when one is nearing land or in the neighbourhood of islands it becomes cause for much anxiety  to make matters worse the ship had been blown considerably out of her course and worst of all the night was so intensely dark that it was not possible to see more than a few yards beyond the flying jibboom  the captain and mate with several of the men stood on the forecastle peering anxiously out into the darkness  i dont like the look o things at all muttered the captain to the chief mate  perhaps it would be well sir to layto till daylight suggested the mate  whether the captain agreed with his chief officer or not was never known for just then a dull sound was heard which sent a thrill to the bravest heart on board  breakers ahead cried the lookout as in duty bound but he was instantly contradicted by the mate who shouted that they were on the starboard beam while another voice roared that they were on the portbow  the helm was instantly put hard aport and immediately after the order was given hard astarboard for it was discovered that the sound of breakers came from both sides of the vessel  they were obviously either running in a narrow strait between two islands or into a bay in the first case the danger was imminent in the second case destruction was almost inevitable  clear the anchor and stand by to let go cried the captain in loud sharp tones for he felt that there was no room to turn and retreat the order was also given to take in all sail  but before either order could be obeyed a cry of terror burst from many throats for right in front of them there suddenly loomed out of the darkness an object like a great black cloud which rose high above and seemed about to fall upon them  there was no mistaking its nature however for by that time the roar of the breakers right ahead told but too plainly that they were rushing straight upon a high perpendicular cliff  at this moment the vessel struck a rock  it was only a slight touch at the stern nevertheless it tore the rudder away so that the intention of the captain to put about and take his chance of striking on the rocks to starboard was frustrated  let go he shouted in this extremity  quick as lightning the anchor went to the bottom but with such way on the ship the sudden strain snapped the chain and the lapwing rushed upon her doom while cries of terror and despair arose from the passengers who had by that time crowded on deck  to the surprise of the captain and those who were capable of intelligent observation the ship did not immediately strike again but sailed straight on as if right against the towering cliffs  still onward it went and as it did so there settled around them a darkness so profound that no one could see even an inch before his eyes  then at last the illfated vessel struck but not with her hull as might have been expected  high up above them a terrific crash was heard  god help us exclaimed the captain weve sailed straight into a cave  that he was right soon became evident for immediately after the crashing of the topmasts against the roof of the cave a shower of small stones and several large fragments fell on the deck with a rattle like that of musketry  some of the people were struck and injured though not seriously so by the shower  get down below all of you cried the captain himself taking shelter under the companion hatchway  but the order was needless for the danger was so obvious that every one sought the shelter of the cabins without delay  the situation was not only terrible but exceedingly singular as well as trying for as long as stones came thundering down on the deck it would have been sheer madness to have attempted to do anything aboveboard and to sit idle in the cabins with almost certain death staring them in the face was a severe test of endurance  from the motion of the vessel several facts could be deduced  although the scraping and crashing of the masts overhead told eloquently of destruction going on in that direction the heaving of the ship and her striking occasionally on either side proved that there was deep water below her  that they were not progressing into an interminable cavern was made evident by the frequent plunging of the shattered bowsprit against the inner end of the cave  this action sent the vessel reeling backwards as it were every time she struck besides shattering the bowsprit  that the cave also was open to the full force of the sea was only too severely proved by the rush of the billows into it and the frequent and severe shocks to which they were in consequence subjected these shocks had extinguished the lamps and it was only by the aid of a few candles that they were delivered from sitting in absolute darkness  in these awful circumstances the young wesleyan proved that besides the courage that he had already shown in facing danger on a sudden emergency he also possessed that far higher courage which can face the slow and apparently sure approach of death with equanimity and selfpossession  moreover he proved that the word of god and prayer are the true resources of man in such extremities  calling those who were willing around him he led them in prayer and then quieted the timid among them as well as comforted all not by reading but by quoting appropriate passages from scripture in which he was profoundly versed  dee know when itll be low water sir asked joe slag of the captain when the ship gave one of her upward heaves and rasped her timbers again on the sides of the cave  not for three hours yet but its falling  i expect there will be less sea on in a short time  if the ship holds together we may yet be saved  there was a murmured thank god at these words  then bob massey expressed some fear that there might be a danger of striking the rocks underneath before low water  i wish it was the risin tide he said and the words took his mind back like a flash of lightning to the time when he used them in a very different sense  then all was peace hope sunshine and his bride was sitting like a good angel beside him with a sweet smile on her fair face  now something like darkness visible showed him his poor wife still beside him thank godbut clinging to his arm with looks of terror amounting almost to despair  what a contrast he thought and for the first time a feeling of rebellion arose in his mind  theres no use o sittin here to be drowned like rats he cried starting up  ill go on deck an take a cast o the lead an see what chances we have  no you wont bob cried nellie throwing her arms firmly round him theres big stones falling all about the deck yet  dont you hear them  as if to corroborate her words a piece of rock nearly half a ton in weight fell on the skylight at that moment crashed completely through it through the table below and even sank into the cabin floor fortunately no one was hurt though slag had a narrow escape but that worthy was not easily intimidated  he rose up and saying that it was as well to be killed on deck doin somethin as in the cabin doin nothin was about to ascend the ladder when dr hayward suddenly entered all wet and dishevelled and with blood trickling down his face  no use going up just now joe he said as he sat down beside his wife and permitted her to tie a kerchief round his head  only a slight wound eva got while taking soundings  i find that there are sixteen fathoms of water under us and although i couldnt see my hand held up before my face i managed to make out by the flash of a match which burned for a moment before being blown out that the sides of the cave are quite perpendicular not the smallest ledge to stand on  the tide however is ebbing fast and the water in the cave calming so that if no bad leak has been made by all this thumping we may yet be saved  our only chance is to stick to the ship  while he was speaking the vessel again surged violently against one side of the cave and another of the huge masses of rock that were brought down by the swaying masts came crashing on the deck  there is no bad leak as yet said the captain reentering the cabin which he had quitted for the purpose of sounding the well  if we can keep afloat for an hour or two we may be able to use the boats  just now it would be useless to attempt launching them  although the captains words were not particularly reassuring his confident tone and manner infused hope and comforted the people greatly  some of the male passengers even volunteered to face the shower of stones if need be and lend a hand in launching the boats when the time for doing so arrived  these boats three in number were lying bottom up on deck and to reach them involved the risk of death to whoever should attempt it  they were therefore compelled to wait  it is difficult to form even a slight conception of the horrors of that night  for several hours they sat in the aftercabin and the ship surged and plunged in the wildlyheaving water striking the sides continually while rocks fell at intervals on the deck thus adding to the noise of wind and waves as they raged with echoing deafening noise in the black cavern  each moment it seemed as if the ship must have her planks stove in and be sunk but she was a new vessel and strong  of course she leaked considerably but when the tide went down the sea calmed a little the rocks ceased falling from the roof and they were enabled to rig the pumps and work them vigorously  the boats meanwhile were cast loose and got ready to launch at the first glimmer of daylight  fortunately they had received no serious injury from the falling rocks  oh how they longed and prayed for the day  it came at last a gleam so faint that it showed nothing of their surroundings save the outline of the caverns great mouth  shall we launch the boats now sir asked the first mate who was becoming anxious because the carpenter had just reported that the water in the hold was increasing dangerously in spite of the pumps  not yetnot yet returned the captain hurriedly  we must have more light first  the loss of a boat would be fatal  im afraid of the rising tide  afraid of the rising tide  again the words struck strangely on bob masseys ears as he stood wiping the perspiration from his brow after a long spell at the pumpsand once more carried him back to the sunlit sands of old england  soon the increase of water in the hold was so great that the getting out of the boats could no longer be delayed  the first launched was a small one  it was lowered over the stern by means of the studdingsail boom with a block and whip which kept it from dropping too quickly into the water  massey and his friend slag being recognised as expert boatmen in trying circumstances were sent in it with two of the crew to run out a line and drop an anchor in the sea outside so that the heavier boats might be hauled out thereby  two hundred and fifty fathoms of rope were given themmore than sufficient for the purpose  on getting outside bob and his friend according to custom as lifeboat men kept a sharp lookout on everything around them and the feeble daylight enabled them to see that the black cliff which had as it were swallowed up the lapwing was full six hundred feet high and a sheer precipice in some places overhanging at the top and without the symptom of a break as far as the eye could reach in either direction  a black lookout joe muttered massey as he assisted his comrade to heave the anchor over the side  ay bob an the worst of it is that the tides risin  a boat can live here as long as that ridge o rocks keeps off the seas but in an hour or so itll be rollin in as bad as ever  i knows it joe an the more need to look sharp  returning to the ship our coxswain made his report and recommended urgent haste  but the captain required no urging for by that time the ships main deck was level with the water and the seas were making a clean breach over the stern  the passengers and crew crowded towards the port gangway where the large boat was being brought round to receive the women and children first  this was such a familiar scene to the two lifeboat men that they kept cool and selfpossessed from the mere force of habit  seeing this the captain ordered mitford to get into the boat first and help to stow the others for it would be a tight pack he said to stow them all  dr hayward was ordered to assist  ned jarring volunteered to help to fend the boat off during the operation and without waiting for permission jumped into her  mitford had consigned his wife to the care of his friend massey who at once undertook the duty by tying a kerchief round peggys head to keep her hair out of her eyes after which he did the same for nellie  both women were perfectly quiet and submissivethe first owing to fear and exhaustion the last from native courage which enabled her to rise to the occasion  massey then stripped off all his own clothes except shirt and trousers so as to be ready for swimming and catching up a rope advanced towards his wife intending to fasten it round her waist  peggy first bob ill wait for you said his wife  look sharp cried the captain  bob turned at once to peggy and in a few seconds she was lowered into the boat  mrs hayward followed  then massey insisted on his wife going and the obedient nellie submitted but owing to a lurch of the ship at the moment she missed the boat and dropped into the water one of the men attempted to pull her in but could not and as all the others were engaged at the moment in trying to fend off the rocks massey at once jumped into the sea and helped to get his wife into the boat  at that moment there arose a cry that the ship was sinking and a wild rush was made for the longboat which had also been successfully launched  of course it was instantly overcrowded for all discipline was now at an end  before anything else could be done the lapwing sank in sixteen fathoms of water carrying the longboat and all the people in her along with it but those in the other boat had shoved off at the first wild cry and hauling on the anchored cable just escaped being sucked down by the sinking ship  bob massey clung to the boats gunwale and thus escaped  rowing back instantly however to the spot where the ship had gone down they sought eagerly for swimmers  only three were discovered and rescued but the othersseventy souls in allfound a watery grave in the dark cavern of that unknown land    story one chapter 7  so rapidly did the final catastrophe take place that it was difficult for the rescued party at first to credit the evidence of their senses on the spot where the lapwing had been beating her sides against the cruel walls of the cavern and where so many hearts had been throbbing wildly between hope and fear no living creature remained nothing but a few feet of the shattered masts appearing now and then above the surging waves was left to tell of the terrible tragedy that had been enacted there  for upwards of an hour the party in the boat hovered about the place not so much with the hope of rescuing any of their shipmates as on account of the difficulty of tearing themselves away from the fatal spot  perhaps the natural tendency of man to hope against hope had something to do with it  then they passed silently out of the cavern and rowed slowly along the base of the tremendous cliffs  at length the feeling of selfpreservation began to assert itself and bob massey was the first to break silence with the question  does any one know if theres anything to eat aboard  wed better see to that observed dr hayward who was steering  bob massey pulled in his oar and without remark began to search the boat  it was found that all the food they had brought away consisted of nine tins of preserved meat and three pieces of pork a supply which would not go far among ten persons  the ten survivors were dr hayward and his wife massey and nellie joe slag john mitford and his wife peggy terrence oconnor the assistant cook tomlin one of the cabin passengers and ned jarring  all the rest as we have said had perished with the illfated lapwing  little was said at first for the hopelessness of their condition seemed so obvious that the men shrank from expressing their gloomy fears to the women who sat huddled together wet and cold in the bottom of the boat  as we have said as far as the eye could see in any direction the frowning cliffs rose perpendicularly out of deep water  there was not even a strip of sand or a bay into which they could run in case of the wind increasing  there is nothing for it but to push on till we come to an inlet or break of some sort in the cliffs by which we may land said hayward speaking encouragingly to the women  god helping us we are sure to find some such place ere long  dont look very like it muttered black ned gloomily  we can see how it looks about as well as you can retorted john mitford indignantly  if ye cant say somethin to cheer the women theres no need for to look blue an tell us what a mere babby could see for itself  this remark coming as it did from lugubrious mitford caused terrence oconnor to smile  true for ye he said we can see whats fornint us but even black ned cant see round the corner  besides there may be a flat shore on the other side o the island added bob massey in a cheerful tone ive often noticed islands o this build and when theyre so high on one side they usually are low on the opposite side so well only have to pull roundan mayhap there are people on itwho knows  ay natives praps growled jarring an cannibals who are fond of eatin white folkspecially women  shut up your black muzzle or ill heave ye overboard said mitford fiercely for like many easygoing quiet men he was unusually savage when fairly roused  whatever black ned may have felt he gave no expression to his thoughts or feelings by word or look but continued calmly to pull his oar  all that day and all that night however the party pulled steadily along the shore without finding an opening in the cliffs or any part which could be scaled by man  during this period their plight was miserable in the extreme for the weather at the time was bitterly cold they were drenched through and through with spray which broke so frequently over the side as to necessitate constant baling and to make matters worse towards evening of the second day snow began to fall and continued to do so the greater part of the night  fortunately before dark they came to some small rocky islets on which they could not land as the waves washed over them but in the lee of which they cast anchor and thus were enabled to ride out a furious gale which sprang up at sunset and did not subside till morning  it need scarcely be said that the men did all that lay in their power to shelter the poor women who had exhibited great fortitude and uncomplaining endurance all that weary time but little could be done for them for there was not even a bit of sail to put over them as a protection  nellie dear said massey when the boat was brought up under the lee of the rocks dee feel very cold  not very replied his wife raising her head  im strong thank god and can stand it but peggy here is shudderin awful bad  i believe shell die if somethin isnt done for her  i think if she could only ring the water out of her clothes whispered mrs hayward to her husband it might do her some good but  i know that eva it would do you all good and we must have it done somehow  an exclamation in the bow of the boat at that moment attracted attention  it was john mitford who having taken off his own coat and wrapped it round his shivering wife had gone to the bow to rummage in a locker there and had found a tarpaulin  massey had overhauled the locker for food before him but the tarpaulin had been so well folded and laid so flat in the bottom that it had escaped his notice  retiring aft with this godsend the lugubrious man speedily with the assistance of his comrades covered over the centre of the boat so completely that a small chamber was formed into which the women could retire  it was not high enough indeed to stand in but it formed a sufficient shelter from wind and spray  now peggy my dear said her husband when it was finished get in thereoff wi your things an wring em out  ththank you jjohn replied peggy whose teeth chattered like castanets but ow am i tto ddry em  for wet ccloes wont dry wiwithout a fire  at least i nnever eard of  the remainder of her remarks were lost to male ears as the tarpaulin dropped around her after eva hayward and nellie had led or halflifted her under its sheltering folds  how they managed to manipulate the shivering peggy it is not our province to tell but there can be no doubt that the treatment of her two friends in misfortune was the cause of her emerging from under the tarpaulin the following morning alive and comparatively well though still far from dry  the aspect of things had changed greatly for the better when the unfortunates resumed their voyage  the wind had abated the sea although still heaving was smooth  the snow had ceased and the sun arose in a cloudless sky so that when poor mrs mitford raised her dishevelled head and felt the suns cheering rays she exclaimed with a sigh of relief la if the sun aint blazin ot  an im so ungry dear dear ave you bin rowin all night john  ow tired you must be an your ands blistered though you are pretty tough in the ands but you couldnt old a candle to bob massey at thatyes yes nellie i ear you but la what does it matter ow your air an things is deranged wen youre wrecked at sea and  the abrupt disappearance of the dishevelled head at that moment suggested the idea that mrs mitford had either fallen backward suddenly or been pulled under cover by her companions  shes all right anyhow said oconnor adjusting his oar  shes always all right remarked mitford in a funereal tone which however was meant to be confidential  bless your heart ive seen that woman under all circumstances but although shes timid by nature an not over strong in body ive never seen her give in or fairly cast down  no doubt she was pretty low last night poor thing but that was cause she was nigh dead wi coldyet her spirit wasnt crushed  its my solemn conviction that if my peggy ever dies at all shell die game  with a profound sigh of satisfaction at having thus borne testimony to the rare and admirable qualities of his wife the worthy man applied himself to his oar with redoubled vigour  it is quite a pleasure in this censorious world to see any man absolutely blind to his wifes faults and thoroughly awake to her good qualities  the opinion formed of peggyby mrs massey and mrs hayward respectively did not quite coincide with that of john mitford  how did you get on with poor peggy last night eva asked dr hayward of his wife in an undertone as they breakfasted that forenoon beside the tiller while the rest of their companions were similarly engaged in the middle of the boat and at the bow  pretty well tom but shes troublesome to manage  she is so unusually timid poor creature so prone to give way to despair when things look bad yet so sweetly apt to bound into high spirits when things are looking hopefuland withal so amusingly garrulous  strange to say at the very moment that this was uttered nellie was remarking to her husband in a low tone that poor peggy was quite a puzzle that she was all but dead at one moment and quite lively at another that she professed to be all submission but was as obstinate as a pig and that her tonguesoft though it waswent like the clapper of a mill  we have referred to breakfast but the meal spread before the castaways hardly merits that name for it consisted of only a small slice of pork to each a few pieces of ships biscuit that slag had discovered in his pockets and a cup of water drawn from the pond which had accumulated in a hollow of the tarpaulin during the night  it is lucky that one of the pieces of pork happened to be cooked observed dr hayward as he served out the allowance for i would have been sorry to break into the preserved meat tins till forced to do so we must keep these as a reserve as long as possible  right you are sir said slag with his mouth full while with a claspknife he carefully cut off another morsel to be ready right you are  that minds me when we was starvin me and my shipmates in the arctic regions so as our ribs was all but comin through our skins an we was beginnin to cast an evil eye on the stooard whod kep fatter than the rest of us somehow an was therefore likely to prove a more satisfyin kind o grub dee see  i say joe said hayward interrupting for he feared that slags anecdote might not tend to render the pork breakfast more palatable  sir said slag  will you just go to the bow and take a squint ahead  i think there seems to be something like an end o the cliffs in viewyour eyes are better than mine  slag swallowed the mouthful on which he was engaged thrust after it the morsel that was ready to follow wiped the claspknife on his thigh and went forward to take a squint  it turned out that the end of the cliffs which the doctor had only supposed possible was a reality for after a long gaze slag turned and said  your eyes are better than you think sir for the end o the cliff is visible an a spit o sand beyond is quite plain  as this report was corroborated by bob massey and then by all the other men it sent a thrill of gratitude into the hearts of most of the partyespecially the women who having lain so long wet and almost motionless were nearly benumbed in spite of the sunshine  longer exposure indeed would probably have proved fatal to poor mrs mitford possibly also to mrs hayward who was by no means robust  as for our coxswains wife having been reared among the healthgiving breezes of the seashore and inured from infancy to exposure and hard work she suffered much less than her female companions and busied herself a great part of the time in chafing their cold limbs  in doing this she reaped the natural advantage of being herself both warmed and invigorated  thus virtue not only is but inevitably brings its own reward  similarly vice produced its natural consequences in the case of black ned for that selfish man being lazy shirked work a good deal  it is possible to pull an oar in such a way that though the rower may be apparently doing his best he is in reality taking the work very lightly and doing next to nothing  acting in this way ned jarring became cold when the sleet and spray were driving in his face his blood flowed sluggishly in his veins and his sufferings were consequently much more severe than those of his comrades  towards the afternoon of that day they rounded the spit of sand mentioned by joe slag and came upon a lowlying coast  after proceeding a considerable distance along which they discovered a good harbour  this was fortunate for grey clouds had again covered the sun and a bitter east wind began to blow  thank god eva said hayward as he steered into the bay for if we had not come upon this harbour your strength and that of poor peggy i fear would have failed but now youll be all right in a short time  oh no sir i dont think as my strength would fail said peggy in a feeble voice for she had overheard the remark  not that i shouldnt be thankful all the same i allowfor thankfulness for mercies received is a dooty an most on us do fail in that though i say it that shouldnt but my strength aint quite gone yet  stand by slag to fend off with your oar when we get close in said the doctor interrupting peggys discourse  have any of you got matches in your pockets asked massey clapping his hands suddenly to the various receptacles about his person with a look of unwonted anxiety  ye may well ax that bob said oconnor using his own hands in the same way  cold wet weather and no house  it ud be death to the women sure av  here you are shouted tomlin in a burst of triumph in spite of his naturally reserved disposition  he held up a box of vestas which being a smoker he fortunately had in his pocket  i hope they aint wet remarked black ned suggestively  wrap em well up said slag  tomlin drew out his handkerchief and proceeded to do so  at the same moment the boats keel grated softly on the shingly shore    story one chapter 8  seldom have the mysterious sparks of life been sought for more anxiously or tended and nursed with greater care than were the little sparks of fire which were evoked with difficulty from tomlins matchbox  drizzling rain had commenced just as the wrecked party landed  the tarpaulin had been set up as a slight though very imperfect shelter the ground underneath had been strewn with twigs and grass and a large pile of dead branches had been arranged to receive the vital spark before any attempt was made to create it  everything must be quite ready first said hayward to tomlin for our very lives depend under god on our securing fire so keep the matches snug in your pocket till i ask for them  i will replied tomlin dyou know it never occurred to me before how tremendously important the element of fire is  but how will you ever manage to make the branches catch everything being so thoroughly soaked  you shall see  i have had to make a fire in worse circumstances than the present returned hayward though i admit they are bad enough have you got the small twigs broken and ready slag  all ready sir  now look here tomlin  as he spoke the doctor picked up a dead but wet branch and sheltering himself under the tarpaulin began to whittle it with his penknife  he found of course that the interior of the branch was dry  the thin morsels which he sliced off were handed to slag who placed them with great care in the heart of a bundle of very small twigs resembling a crows nest  a place had been reserved for this bundle or nest in the heart of the large pile of branches lying on the ground  meanwhile slag held the nest ready in his hands  now tomlin get out your matches said the doctor  with the utmost care the anxious man unfolded the kerchief and opening the box looked into it earnestly  wet asked hayward  tomlin shook his head  i fear they are  he took one out while the whole party assembled round him to note the result  the first match dropped its head like a piece of soft putty when scraped on the lid  the second did the same and a suppressed groan escaped from the little group for it could be seen that there were not more than ten or twelve matches in the box altogether  again and again a match was struck with similar result  the fifth however crackled a little and rekindled sinking hope in the observers though it failed to kindle itself  the seventh burst at once into a bright blaze and almost drew forth a cheer which however was checked when a puff of wind blew out the newborn flame  och let bob massey try it cried oconnor  sure hes used to workin in throublesome weather  right boy said slag hand it to the coxsn  tomlin readily obeyed only too glad to get some of the failure shifted to other shoulders  massey readily undertook the task and success attended his first effort  i knowed it said nellie in a quiet tone as she saw the bright flame leap up and almost set her husbands beard on fire  bob never fails  the burning match was quickly plunged into haywards handful of shavings which blazed up as he thrust it into slags nest and slag holding the nest with the tender care of a loving sicknurse and the cool indifference of a salamander till it was a flaming ball crammed it into the heart of the pile of sticks  tremendous was the volume of smoke that arose from the pile and anxious were the looks riveted on it  sure yeve smothered it intirely gasped oconnor  oh me sighed peggy in a voice of mild despair  no fear its all right said massey in a confident tone while joe slag on his knees with cheeks inflated and nose all but kindling blew at the glowing heart with unwearied determination regardless alike of friend and foe  its going to do remarked john mitford in his most dismal tone  any child might tell that said nellie with a light laugh  the laugh seemed infectious for the whole party joined in as a glorious gush of flame rushed among the sticks dried up the dampness and effectually changed the pillar of smoke into a pillar of fire  the fire thus kindled was rightly deemed of such vital importance that it was not permitted to go out thereafter for many months being watched night and day by members of the party appointed to the duty by turns it had indeed not a few narrow escapes and more than once succeeded in reaching what appeared to be its last spark but was always caught in time and recovered and thus was kept burning until a discovery was made which rendered such constant attendance and care unnecessary  now said dr hayward when the fire was safely established we have not much daylight left so it behoves us to make the most of it  you are a man of action and experience robert massey what would you advise us to do first  well doctor since youre good enough to ask me i would advise that we should appoint a leader  you see mates he continued addressing himself to the company in general theres no possibility of a ship gettin along without a captain or an army without a general  if we was going off to a wreck now with or without a lifeboat i would claim a sort o right to be coxswain in virtue o past experience but as weve now begun a sort o shoregoin business which requires a deal o general knowledge besides seamanship an as dr hayward has got that by edication i move that we make him our leader  right you are bob said joe slag  as he always is said nellie sotto voce so i second the moveif thats the reglar way to do it  hear hear said every one with right good will and a gleam of pride flashed from evas pretty brown eyes as her husband was thus unanimously appointed leader of the shipwrecked band  like a sensible man knowing his capacity he at once accepted the command without any display of undue modesty and proved his fitness by at once going to work  the first thing then is to thank god for our deliverance which we all do i am sure most heartily  this was received with a responsive amen from every onenot even excepting black ned  next we must find fresh water and boil a bit of pork  ah then we havent a kittle exclaimed oconnor  havent we a big balingdish terrence said hayward  sure we have sor an its a tin wan asll stand fire returned terrence with a reproved look  well then you go fetch it wash it well out and get the pork ready jarring and tomlin will gather as much dead wood as they can find and pile it beside the fire  mitford will search for fresh waterthere must be a spring or brook not far offand massey and i will rig up some sort of shelter for the night  please sir may i go with mitford to seek for water asked nellie  by all means if you wish to  and i will keep you company nell said mrs hayward energetically  so will i chimed in little mrs mitford feebly  i was always fond of water  as a child i used to paddle about in it continually an sometimes tumbled into it for of course young people will  no peggy you must sit by the fire with my wife said the doctor neither of you is fit for work of any kind yet so sit down and warm yourselves  eva was too wise and peggy too weak to offer objection so these two sat by the fire while the others went to work  energy of action tends to lighten the burdens that may be laid on human spirits and to induce the most favourable view of the worst circumstances  the toil which the party now undertook was such a blessed relief to them after the prolonged exposure to cold and comparative inaction in the boat that all returned to the campfire in a much more cheerful state of mind than they left it  the searchers for water came back first having found what they sought close at hand and terrence filling his balingdish soon had the pork boiling along with some mysterious herbs gathered by the doctor to convert the liquid into soup  tomlin and black ned returned heavily laden with firewood and bob massey discovered a tree with branches sufficiently spreading and leafy to protect them to some extent from rain  tis as well we have found overhead protection massey said the doctor when our coxswain led him to the spot for i have been thinking that as we have no blankets we shall be obliged to use our tarpaulin as a quilt rather than an umbrella  thats true sir returned massey but how about the women  well ive been thinking about that said hayward and ive devised a plan for tonight at least tomorrow i hope to hit on a better arrangement  first of all well spread in front of a fire which we will kindle beneath this tree a layer of branches and grass  in the middle of this the women will lie down side by side after having dried and warmed themselves thoroughly at the fire  then well take two of the floor planks from the boat and put one on each side of them partially frame them as it were  then one half of us men will lie down on one side of the frame the other half on the other side and well draw the tarpaulin over us all  hm not very comfortable said massey for the poor women to be framed like that  admitted but what else can we do said hayward  it would risk our lives to sleep without covering of any kind in such cold weather and with sleet falling as it does now  better have the sheet spread upon us than merely over our heads  so now lets kindle another fire and do you arrange our couch bob  in spite of the cold and the sleet things looked much more cosy than persons unacquainted with roughing it could believe possible and they became comparatively happy when the couch was spread and they were seated under the sheltering tree with the fire blazing and crackling in front of them suffusing their faces and persons and the leafcanopy overhead with a deep red glare that contrasted well with the ebonyblack surroundings while a rich odour of pork soup exhaled from the balingdish  ah now theres nothin wantin to produce parfit felicity but a pipe said oconnor with a sigh  thats so lad assented tomlin echoing the sigh and feeling in his pocket from force of habit though he knew too well that nothing was to be found there  here terrence said massey handing him an empty pipe at the same time asking him to shut his eyes and draw and try to imagine himself smoking but terrence shook his head  i couldnt do that bob he said but ill sing ye a stave in praise o the weed  without waiting for permission the jovial irishman at once began    oh its baccy as is my chief joy   at mornin noon and night   an its verily my belief boy   that i love it with all my might   if your liver an lungs are squeakin   an your head is growin cracky   theres nothin so sure to kill or cure   as fumes o the strongest baccy  if it would improve your voice terrence observed mr mitford meekly im sure i wish ye had pounds of it for its that harsh though of course i make no pretence to music myself but  just listen to that now harsh an that to a man whose own mother by the fathers side towld him he shud make music his purfession arrah howld on black ned ye spalpeen yeve had two helpins already  this latter remark had reference to the balingdish of soup which was being passed round the party so that each might help himself to two mouthfuls of soup before passing it on  as they had no spoons the doctor had extemporised ladles of folded bark which served the purpose pretty well  havent ye a small bit o baccy in the corner o wan o yer pockets doctor dear asked terrence insinuatingly  may be yed find a morsel if yed try  quite useless to try my poor fellow returned the doctor with a look of affected pity for im a nonsmoker  i never indulge in such an absurdity  sure its a true proverb that says doctors differ retorted oconnor for most o the sawbones of my acquaintance have smoked like lime kilns  mores the pity terrence but if youll heave on some more firewood youll have a smoke that may do as a substitute at present  by heaping quantities of fresh branches on the fire till it was large enough to roast an ox the party managed to pass the night in comparative comfort in spite of cold and sleet  hayward watched the fire during the first part of the night  then he was relieved by our coxswain who was succeeded by joe slag and no vestal virgins ever tended their fire with more anxious solicitude than those three men guarded theirs during that first night on the island  as if to make up for the sufferings of the past few days the morning that followed broke with unclouded splendour and the rising sun shone upon as beautiful a scene as could well be imagined for it revealed an island richly clothed with verdure which rising out of a calm blue sea sloped gradually upwards until its western ridge met the bright sky  evidently that terminating ridge was the place whence descended the precipitous cliffs along which they had sailed immediately after leaving the cave of the wreck  there is no accounting for the eccentricities of weakminded females whether pretty or plain  the first thing that pretty little mrs mitford exclaimed on opening her eyes and beholding the glorious view was  oh  i do so wish that we had oysters for breakfast  if she had expressed a desire for elephant chops she could not have taken eva hayward more by surprise  as for nell massey she went off into a hilarious giggle  i fear there are no oysters hereabouts said hayward but i shouldnt wonder if we were to find mussels and things of that sort  come lads well go and have a search for them while the ladies fill and boil our kettle  limpets mussels and other shellfish were found in great abundance with these warm soup was soon made and after a hearty breakfast hayward organised the party in two bands which were sent off in different directions to explore the island peggy and her husband being left behind to cook the dinner and keep up the fire    story one chapter 9  for several days the shipwrecked party continued to live chiefly on limpets and mussels gathered on the seashore  only a very little of the pork was used for the purpose of converting the food into soup  as they could not tell of course how long they might be compelled to live there it behoved them to be very careful of the foodsupply already in possession  fortunately the weather continued fine though cold so that it was not necessary at first to make any alteration in their camp arrangements  during this period much of their time was necessarily spent in laying in a stock of shellfish and in attempting to bring down with stones some of the gulls which flew inquisitively about and very temptingly near to the camp but none of the party was a good marksman with stone ammunition and it soon became evident that unless some other means of obtaining food were discovered there was every prospect of starvation ending their career  in this emergency dr hayward organised an exploring expedition on a more extended scale  he divided the party into three bandsone consisting of ned jarring tomlin and himself to examine the shores another comprising joe slag john mitford and oconnor to penetrate the interior and higher lands while it was appointed to bob massey who had by that time come to be more frequently addressed by his old title of coxswain to stay at the camp keep the allimportant fire going and guard the women  you see we must go about this business thoroughly said the doctor when they were all assembled in the camp one day after their frugal meal excepting oconnor who was a short distance off trying with unwearied perseverance and unvaried failure to kill gulls with stones and for this purpose we must hold a council of war  wheres terrence  hes pelting the gulls as usual said black ned  amissin of em you mean suggested mitford  hallo terrence shouted hayward catching sight of the irishman at that moment  here we want you  comin sor jist wan more shot at this baste  hes bin flyin round me hid for halfanhour at laste winkin at the stones as they go by him  och missed againbad luck to ye  as he uttered the malediction the disappointed man heaved a last stone angrily and without an attempt at an aim  he did not even look up to observe the result but turned sharply round towards the camp  that stone however was like the arrow shot at a venture  it hit the bird full on the breast and brought it down which fact was made known to the sportsman by a cheer from the camp and a heavy thud behind him  well done terrence cried hayward as he came up with his prize  i regard it as a good omena sort of turn in the tide which will encourage us on our contemplated expedition  the leader then gave minute instructions as to how long they were to be away how much food they were to take the direction to be followed and the work to be done  in short said the doctor in conclusion we must use our eyes ears and limbs to the best advantage but bear in mind that the grand object of the expedition is  grub suggested oconnor  just so  grub is our first and greatest necessity  meanwhile peggy nell and eva will do what they can to make our camp comfortable gather mussels and other shellfish and see that the coxswain does not eat more than a fair share of victuals and conducts himself in all respects like an obedient and trusted servant  with such and similar touches of pleasantry hayward sought to cheer the spirits of the party and divert their minds from dwelling too much on the fact that their case was a very serious onealmost desperate for they were on a comparatively small island far to the southward of the usual track of ships without food or shelter and without any of the ordinary means of procuring either  the remainder of that day was spent in making preparation for the projected expedition  as they had no offensive or defensive arms except two gully knives their first business was to provide each man with a spear  fortunately some of the surrounding trees had very straight branches of various sizes so they had only to cut down such as were suitable and peel the bark off  but the formation of hard points gave them some anxiety until tomlin hit upon the idea of utilising the bones of their pork  the very thing said mitford with a look of melancholy satisfaction  having no turn whatever for mechanics he never saw difficulties till they met and overcame him and was always ready to rush in where mechanical angelsif we may say sofeared to tread  and how would you propose to cut the bones john asked slag with an air of modest simplicity  cut em eh wellwi the knife of course  it was found however that the knife made but slight impression on the bones and after one or two vain attempts they turned to a more effective method  finding a huge boulder of some kind of sandstone they broke it up and on the rough surface thus produced ground the bones into sharp points and by an ingenious method known to slag who learned it from the eskimos they fixed these firmly on the ends of their spears  thus armed and with a small quantity of cold pork and a large allowance of cold boiled limpets and mussels in their wallets they set out on their explorations  it is impossible to accompany two parties at once  let us follow just now the one composed of joe slag terrence oconnor and john mitford these with joe as their leader proceeded along the shore some miles in a northerly direction and then turning into the bush which was nowhere thick they pushed into the interior of the island  after advancing about ten miles they came on a wide stretch of sandhills or downs and found that having crossed a sort of isthmus they had come out again on the seashore  this wont do said slag on making the discovery  well have to steer drect for the highest land  thats so joe said mitford and yonders a height away there right in the winds eye that will act as a beacon to us  i sees it johnbut i say whats the matter wi terrence  this question was drawn forth by the action of the irishman who had walked on about fifty yards in advance of his comrades  he was standing in the attitude of an ancient roman about to discharge a javelin stooping low as if to render themselves less conspicuous mitford muttered hallo and his comrade whispered sh he sees suthin  whatever it was he saw oconnor evidently felt too far off to act effectively for after standing a moment in the classic position just referred to he suddenly lowered his spear dropped on hands and knees and made a slow undignified advance of a few yards  then he rose again became classic once more and discharged his spear in a manner that would have done credit to achilles himself  the growl that followed and the bad luck to ye that came faintly back on the breeze told too plainly that the result was a miss  sure its a rabbit i saw he said returning to his companions an if id only sent it two yards more to the left id have hit the baste  to the satisfaction of the explorers it was found that the sandhills were burrowed all over by rabbits and that there existed there a large colony of them  cheered by thisin spite of their bad javelin play they made for the high ground and soon found themselves threading a belt of wood after crossing which they reached the foot of the range of hills that bounded the island to the westward  it was a weird rugged spot covered with great boulders that had rolled down the hillsides and with gaps and chasms here and there of considerable depth that suggested the idea of volcanic action having visited the place at some remote period  these chasms or rents in the earth were overgrown with trees or bushes in many places and obliged the travellers to make wide detours in some places to avoid them  thus they were so much delayed that night was upon them before they had reached the higher parts of the hillrange where they had intended to encamp  the difference between blanketing and gossamer is great yet it is inconceivably slight compared with the difference between gossamer and nothing  in the pride of their strength the members of the exploring party lay down to sleep without covering of any kind for the good reason that they possessed none and before morning they would gladly have given a fabulous price for even a gossamer coverlet  its freezin i am if not froze said terrence oconnor at the end of the second sleepless hour  if we could have only brought away some o the fire in our pockets what a comfort it would have bin  he got up shook himself and slapped his arms across his breast vigorously  slag and mitford followed his example  im beginnin to feel better on the outside continued oconnor pausing but my spinal marrow isnt properly warm yet  minds me o baffins bay growled slag with a mighty slap of the arms between each word  mitford seemed to think any remark superfluous for he only groaned  pity its too dark to see yer face john said terrence  it must be a sight worth seein  och av i only had a goodsized pockethankicher id wrap me feet in it anyhow  suppose we cut some grass and try that suggested mitford  the suggestion was acted on  it was slow work cutting grass with a claspknife tearing it up in handfuls was still slower but the labour warmed the tired explorers and when they lay down again under this adamaneveic bedding they fell asleep almost immediately and did not waken till the sun was pretty well up in the eastern sky  breakfast fust said slag on completing a tremendous stretch and yawn  its always bin my way since i was a babbybusiness first pleasure to foller  grub is business an work is pleasureleastwise it ought to be to any man whos rated a  one on the ships books hallo sorrowfulmonkeyface clap a stopper on yer nose an tumble updye hear  mitford did not hear but a touch of slags toe caused him to feel and to rise  oconnor was already astir preparing breakfast  cold boiled mussels and a bit of pork may be good food but it is not appetising consequently they did not linger long over the meal but were soon striding up the mountainside rejoicing in the fresh air and sunshine  there was a certain phase in john mitfords character which had not yet been discovered by his friends and was known only to his wife  he was romanticpowerfully so  to wander through unknown lands and be a discoverer had been the dream of his youth  he was naturally reticent and had never said so to any one but peggy who being the reverse of romantic was somewhat awestricken by the discovery and in an imbecile way encouraged him to hope that one of these days hed ave is desires gratified as there was nothink to prevent im from goin to novazealandif that was the right way to pronounce itor to van demons landnot in a sinful way of course for they had given up transportin people there nowthough wherever they transported em to she couldnt imagineanyhow there was nothink to prevent his tryin  and john did try which was the primary cause of his being a member of the exploring party now under consideration  influenced by his romantic spirit mitford betrayed a troublesome tendency to wander from his comrades in pursuit of the unknown oconnor with the straightforward simplicity of his nation set it down to pigheadedness  slag being a man of feeling opined that it was absence of mind  the spalpeen hes off again said oconnor turning round as they halted to rest a minute after breasting the hill for halfanhour hallo john  where are ye boy  hereall right shouted a voice in the distance im exploring behind the knoll here  go ahead ill meet ye at the top o the hill  by that time they were within about an hours walk of the highest ridge of the island so they pushed on without delay expecting to find their lugubrious friend there before them or not far behind them  it turned out as had been supposed  the mountain ridge formed the summit of the great precipice along the foot of which they had sailed after quitting the cavern or as they had come to call it the wreckcave  for some time the two stood on the giddy edge looking in silence on the tremendous depths below and the sublime spectacle of illimitable sea beyond with its myriad facets gleaming in the sunshine  then they bethought them of their comrade and turned back to look for him hallooing now and then as they went and expecting every moment to see him emerge from one of the gorges that led to the ridge  but there was no answering shout or any sign of his having been there  soon becoming anxious and then alarmed the two men set to work in earnest to search for their lost comrade but they sought in vain  returning to the spot where they had last heard his voice they continued the search in that direction and made the rocks echo with their shouting  still no john mitford was to be found and the curious thing was that there seemed to be no very rugged or precipitous formation of land where he could easily have met with an accident  at last evening approached  we must go back at wance said oconnor with anxious looks an rouse all the men out to seek for him wi torches  without another word they turned and made for the camp as fast as they could go  meanwhile dr hayward and his party had been successful in their exploration for they not only discovered a rabbitwarren but had observed seals basking on the rocks and found the tracks of goats or some animal of that kind with divided hoofs  they had even succeeded in getting between a young seal and the water and speared it so that there was something like jubilation in the camp on their return at the prospect of a fresh meal and better fare in future  but this was abruptly put an end to by the arrival of slag and his comrade with the news of mitfords disappearance  poor mrs mitford was thrown into a state of terrible alarm and at first insisted on accompanying the search party but under the united entreaties of eva and nelly she was prevailed on to remain behind  with torches made of resinous wood which burnt admirably they searched all that night and taking only a few hours rest continued the search all the following day but without success  day after day the search was continued even after all hope of ever again seeing their comrade alive had died out but at last they were compelled to give it up and devote themselves to the urgent duty of procuring better shelter and food  as for poor mrs mitford she sank into a state of helpless and hopeless despair    story one chapter 10  men in straits cannot afford to sit down to grieve and mope over their sorrows  although a deep gloom had been cast over the shipwrecked party by the loss of one whom they had learned to respect the urgent need of obtaining better food and shelter compelled them as we have said to give their whole mind and attention to this work  they pitied poor peggy sincerely however and endeavoured to comfort her a little by raising the hope that her husband might have merely lost himself in the woods of the island and would yet perhaps be found alive and well  but although their intentions were kindly they could comfort neither peggy nor themselves with such a hope for their experience convinced them that the woods although thick and tangled were not extensive enough for any one to be permanently lost in them and it seemed quite certain that if the lost man had not met with some fatal accident he would certainly have made his way to the coast by following which he could have easily found the camp  it is very sad to give over our search for poor mitford said dr hayward one morning while seated on a ledge of rock near the beach taking counsel with his male companions as to the order of procedure for the day but we cannot afford to delay our operations longer  this poor fare of mussel soup with such a small allowance of pork is beginning to injure the health of our women not to mention ourselves besides the pork wont last long even though we put ourselves on the shortest possible allowance so i think that today we must go on an expedition after the seals we saw the last time we went to the southern end of the island  what say you comrades  all right capn answered massey  youve only got to say the word but whos to stop at home to mind the campfire and the women  im afraid returned hayward with a deprecatory smile that its your own turn bob  i would say that im sorry for you were it not ungallant to pity a man for being condemned for a day to female society  the way in which the coxswain received this showed that he did not repine at his fate  he did not even object to oconnors remark that faix he might consider himself the luckiest man o the lot  accordingly massey remained at the camp while the doctor slag oconnor tomlin and jarring set out on a hunting expedition with two days cooked provisions in their wallets  the doctor and tomlin armed themselves with spears but jarring and slag preferred clubs  you see said the latter ive heardthough i cant rightly say ive seed it done myselfthat the sealhunters o the north do their work wi clubs so if one man can kill a seal wi such a thing i dont see why another shouldnt  and truly there was some reason for this covert boast for joe besides possessing arms of prodigious power had cut and shaped for himself a knotted club which might have suited the hand of hercules himself  it turned out that bob masseys satisfaction at being left behind that day was not altogether the result of regard for female society  while he was sauntering back to the camp after his comrades had left he congratulated himself aloud on having at last a chance of making his experiment without being laughed at during the trial  that isif nellie has got enough of line made  at that moment nell was busy with the line in question and at the same time doing her best to comfort mrs mitfordmrs hayward being engaged in preparing dinner by no means a difficult duty which the women undertook day about  keep up your spirits dear peggy said nell in that sweet cosy toneif we may say sowhich played such havoc in bobs bosom at the time when she was known as the coxswains bride  i feel sure that your dear husband will return to us  no doubt some sort o misfortune has come to him but hes such a sensible handy man is john that i cant help feelin hell come back to us an when i feel anything very strongly dee know ive almost always found it come true  do you believe in strong feelin peggy  poor mrs mitford who had been sitting with her hands clasped in her lap and an utterly woebegone expression on her pale face raised her head with a troubled look on being thus directly appealed to  believe in strong feelins nellie  i should just think i do  not to mention my own feelinswhich are so strong that i never felt nothink like em beforeany one who has been married to my john must know well what ststrongoh no i shall never see im again dear nellie dont tell me she said beginning to cry  i knowi know  there nowtheres a good soul  dont go off again  look  dee know what this is for  as she spoke nellie held up a ball of what appeared to be twine and her companionwhose mind resembled that of a child in that it could be easily divertedsaid no she didnt know what it was for and that she peggy had seen her making it when the men were off excursioning and had asked about it and why didnt she nellie relieve her curiosity before upon the point instead of waitin till now  well you see peggy replied her friend with the confidential air of one who has a secret to tell my bob has took it into his head to give his mates a surprise by fishin for albatrosses  lawks  nellie an that will give em a surprise interrupted mrs mitford drying her eyes  how ever can any man fish for a bird unless indeed it goes under water an changes its nature which no creetur can do though now i come to think of it i have seen flyin fish an so perhaps there may be albytresses or other birds that  hallo  nellie hard at the twine lass  youve made about enough of it now cried our coxswain entering the camp at that moment sitting down beside his wife and examining the ball of cord which she had been so busily spinning  im glad you think theres enough bob for ive come to the end o the stuff you gathered for me  plenty more where that came from nell but theres no need to gather more than enough for enough you know is as good as a feast  well peggy he added turning to the poor woman and patting her gently on the shoulder has nell been tellin you what im goin to try  she was beginnin to tell me mr massey when you came in something about fishin for albytresses an i always thought albytresses was birds and  quite right peggy  see this is how it is you bait a hookbut come said the coxswain rising suddenly and taking up the ball of twine they do say examples better than precept  come along wi me an nell an well show you how to do it  so saying massey led the two women down to the boat telling mrs hayward whom they passed on the way to heave some more sticks on the fire as it was getting low  never fear said eva who carried the balingdish full of shellfish in her hands  i shall never forget the fright we got that time joe let it get so low that it was almost at the last spark  you wont be long away will you  not long  anyhow well be sure to turn up for dinner  during their short residence on the island the coxswain had observed that albatrosses paid them frequent visits  the giant birds had exhibited some signs of curiosity as to the doings of the new arrivals on the island so he resolved to capture one of them with a view to soup  embarking in the boat he rowed towards a point of rocks jutting out into the sea over which albatrosses had been seen hovering many times on the way nellie who had previously been taught what to do fastened a small bit of wood to the end of the line she had spun  hanging from this was a hook that the coxswain had made from a gulls breastbone it was baited with a piece of pork  before arriving at the point of rocks they saw that an albatross was soaring over it on its mighty outspread wings  on observing the boat it flew away and disappeared in the distance but bob was not much concerned about that  now nell he said on landing carry this bait out to sea as far as the line will let you lay it on the water an then pull back into yon cove and see that you hide the boat an yourselves well and keep quiet  you mustnt even talk peggy  yon fellow will soon be back  nellie did exactly as she was directed and then her husband holding the shoreend of the line concealed himself among the rocks  he was right about the bird  ere long it was seen returning and soon on motionless expanded wings it hovered over the rocky point  then it caught sight of the floating bait  with a majestic swoop it dived caught it up and next moment was flouncing wildly about hooked by the tongue while bob massey hauled in the line  he had provided himself with a stick and when the huge bird came within reach he felled it to the immense delight of the watchers in the cove who had already begun to smell savoury soup by anticipation  while these were thus engaged the sealing party was even more successful in the opposite direction  they had not gone halfadozen miles when they sighted a group of seals sleepingor sunning themselveson a flat rock near highwater mark  now then hercules lead the way with your club said the doctor to joe slag in a whisper  joe at once shouldered his weapon and led the party round by some sheltering rocks so as to get between the seals and the sea then rushing forward in a body they took the creatures by surprise and intercepted two of them  on coming to close quarters however they found that the seals were much more formidable to look at than anything that any of them had ever seen in the arctic seas and when joe brought his club down on the skull of the foremost with a terrible thwack it refused to tumble over but continued to splutter and flounder towards the sea  dr hayward however used his spear at this moment with such effect that the seal fell and another blow from the herculean club finished its career  as this animal was about halfaton in weight they left it on the beach with the intention of cutting off some steaks on their return and sending the boat round afterwards to fetch the remainder of the carcass  considerably elated by their success they pushed on  in a valley which led towards the interior hills they found fresh tracks of goats and saw one of those animals in the distance  rabbits were also seen but none killed at that time  they had not gone far into this valley when a most interesting discovery was made  on opening up a new turn in the valley they came on the ruins of a hut  with feelings of profound interest they enteredfor there was no door to bar their progressand gazed around on the silent mouldering walls  good luck exclaimed oconnor springing forward and grasping an object which lay on the ground  it was a hatchet covered with red rust  here is something else that will be useful said tomlin picking up a file which was also covered with rust  the party at once began an eager search in the hope of finding other things that might be of use to them and they were not altogether disappointed for jarring found a claspknifemuch rusteaten of course but still fit for use  slag found a muchbattered fryingpan and tomlin discovered a large castiron pot behind the hut with a chip out of its rim  a bottle was also found and the party crowded round to watch while the doctor examined it  gin i hope said jarring in a low tone  physic i think murmured slag  a paper exclaimed the doctor holding it up to the light then breaking the bottle he unfolded the paper but much of the writing on it had been obliterated by water which had leaked in  the few sentences however that were more or less legible conveyed the fact that a vessel had been wrecked on the island in 1848 that the crew had lived there eighteen months when a ship chancing to pass that way rescued them that they had no provisions to leave for the use of unfortunates who might chance to be cast away there in future and that there was a garden with some vegetables in it about  here the writing became quite illegible  now we must find that garden said the doctor and as weve not much daylight left we must begin at once  come along lads  in half an hour they found the garden with potatoes growing in it and a few other roots that were new to them  rejoicing over their discoveries the party started back without delay for the camp carrying the pot the fryingpan etcetera along with them and not forgetting a good slice of the seal in passing  arriving late that night they found bob massey and the women already enjoying a supper of albatross soup  hooroo bob exclaimed oconnor flourishing the fryingpan in his excitement weve found some praties boy  shovel out some o that into this honey an ill soon let ye smell the smell of an irish stew  next day the party removed from the camp and took up their abode in the old hut which was soon repaired sufficiently to keep out wind and rain and the skin of the sealwith that of another killed next daywas large enough to screen off part of the hut as a separate chamber for the women  from that time forward they had no lack of food for they succeeded in killing plenty of seals and in snaring a great many rabbits though they failed entirely to kill any of the goats  and thus they lived for several months in comparative comfort though suffering considerably from cold and bad weather  during all that time the poor women were kept pretty busy cooking looking after domestic matters and mending the garments of the men this last they accomplished by means of needles made from albatross bones and the finely divided sinews of various animals instead of thread  when the european garments were worn outwhich they were long before deliverance was sent to themnell massey proved her fitness for a robinson crusoe life by actually splitting the sealskinswhich were as thick as sole leatherso as to obtain material thin enough for clothing  of course a flagstaff had been among the first things erected  it stood on a prominent hill and a sealskin flag was hoisted thereon to attract any vessel that might chance to pass that way but the flag fluttered in vain for as we have said the island lay far out of the usual track of commerce  although poor mrs mitford appeared to become resigned to her great loss as time passed by it was evident to her kindhearted female companions that she was not recovering from the shock she had received  in spite of their care of her she grew thinner and olderlooking every day and although she quietly took her share of the work she had become sad and silentcaring little apparently for what was going on around her and never indulging in those prolonged observations of an irrelevant nature to which she had been addicted before her husbands disappearance  things were in this state when about two months after their landing a boatvoyage to the western cliffs of the island was arranged for purposes of further exploration    story one chapter 11  within the dark recesses of a great cavern in the western cliffs in the midst of a mass of wreckage there sat one morning a man whose general appearance might have suggested to a beholder the wild man of the caveor at the least an unhappy maniacfor his grey locks were long and unkempt his eyes bloodshot and wild his garments torn so that his wasted limbs were exposed in numerous places and his beard and moustache dishevelled and bristling  no one looking at that gaunt creaturenot even the mother who bore himwould have easily recognised john mitford yet it was he  on the day when he mysteriously disappeared he had come upon a great hollow or hole of about sixty yards in diameter which appeared to descend into the very depths of the earth  the sides of the hollow sloped towards the centre and were covered with bushes  noting this our romantic friend resolved to explore the spot  he descended cautiously till he came to a place where the hole had narrowed to about twenty feet in diameter and the herbage ceased because of the absence of the earth to sustain it  filled with eager curiosity the reckless man held on to a branch and stretched his head over the edge of the hole  he saw nothing but blackness  he soon felt something however for the branch suddenly broke off and john went headlong down into that hole  then and there he would certainly have paid for his curiosity with his life had not a mass of earth a few feet further down and against which he struck broken his fall in some measure and shunted him off to the opposite wall of the rock  this latter proved to be a slope so steep that it let him slide like lightning to the bottom a depth of about thirty feet or more where he was stopped with such violence that he lay stunned for a considerable time  recovering he found that no bones were broken and that indeed he was not much damaged considering the violence of the fall but the satisfaction and thankfulness that this undoubtedly caused him were diminished by the fact that he was in total darkness and at the bottom of a hole of unknown depth  a feeling of horror rushed over him at the thought of being thus as it were buried alive  springing up he felt all round the walls of his prison for some inequalities or projections by which he might climb out but none such could he find  the place was like a well of not more than about ten feet wide with smooth rocky sides which were almost perpendicular as far up as he could reach  on looking upward he could see the mouth of the hole through which he had fallen glimmering like a little star above him  after a fruitless search of nearly halfanhour the poor man sat down on a piece of fallen rock over which he had stumbled several times in his search and a deep groan burst from him as he began to realise the fact that escape from the place was impossible and that a lingering death awaited himfor he could scarcely hope that his companions would find him in such a place  hope however is hard to kill in the human breast  perhaps they might hear him if he shouted  immediately he began to shout for help with all the strength of his lungs  then as no answering shout came down from the little star aboveat which he continuously gazeda feeling of wild despair took possession of him and he yelled and shrieked in mortal agony until his vocal chords refused to act and nothing but a hoarse whisper passed his parched lips  overcome at last alike with horror and exhaustion he fell to the ground and became partially unconscious  how long he lay thus he could not tell but on recovering and looking up he found that the star was gonetelling plainly that night had set in  then it was when all hope of delivering himself or of being delivered by others had fled that a word which had been uttered by dr hayward to a dying man on board the ship leaped into john mitfords mind like a gleam of light  call upon me in the time of trouble and i will deliver thee and thou shalt glorify me  he had seen this invitation accepted by the dying man and deliverance obtainedif a happy smile and a triumphant gaze across the river of death were to be regarded as testimony  but then thought john mitford that was spiritual deliverance  here it is a hard physical fact from which nothing short of a miracle can deliver me  noit is impossible  was it a voice within him or an old memory that immediately whispered the words with god all things are possible  at all events the poor man rose up slowly in a somewhat calmer frame of mind and began once more to feel round the walls of his narrow prison  he found nothing mew save that once he narrowly escaped falling down what seemed to be a still deeper hole among the fallen rocks already referred to  then he lay downor rather fell on the floor exhaustedand slept till morning the fact that another day had begun was only ascertainable by the shining of the starlike mouth of the hole  he attempted again to shout but found that his voice had left him and that even if his comrades should return to the place he could not make them hear  in the fit of despair which followed he went round and round his living tomb like some wild beast in a cage  during one of these perambulations he stumbled again over the fallen rocks dropped into the hole behind them and slid a few feet downwards but not rapidly for the slope was gradual and it terminated on a flat floor  looking cautiously round on reaching this lower depth he saw what appeared to be a faint light far beneath him and considerably in advance of the spot where he stood or rather to which he clung  gradually his mind calmed and resolving to make for this light he groped his way downward  it was a long and wearisome scramble involving many a slip and slide and not a few falls for it was made of course in total darkness and the distant light did not appear to become stronger or nearer  at last it seemed as though it were growing then john found himself on ground over which he could walk guiding himself by touching perpendicular walls of rock on either side with his hands  it was a great split in the mountain caused perhaps by those mighty subterranean forces which some men recognise as volcanic action whilst others admittingbut passing beyondsecond causes recognise them as tools with which god is moulding this world according to his will  strange thought the man as he moved slowly forward  was this split made hundredsperhaps thousandsof years ago for the purpose of enabling me to escape  certainly notabsurd presumptuous idea answered unbelief smartly  it was remarked faith slowly made no doubt for hundredsit may be millionsof other purposes but among these purposes the saving of your life was certainly in the mind of him who knows all things from the beginning and with whom even the falling of a sparrow is a matter for consideration  we do not assert that john mitfords reasoning took the precise form of these words for many minds can think somewhat profoundly without being able to express themselves clearly but some such thoughts undoubtedly coursed through johns mind as he moved through that subterranean labyrinth and finally emergedthrough a narrow crack not so large as an ordinary doorupon the inner margin of a stupendous cavern  with a fervent thank god and a hopeful leap of the heart the poor man beheld the waters of the sea rushing up to his very feet and beyond the caves mouth lay the grand ocean itself like a bright picture in a black frame  but what was that projecting from the water not twenty yards from where he stood  the broken mast of a sunken wreck mitfords heart almost stood still for he became aware that he had made his way to the very cavern in which the illfated lapwing had met her doom and around him were masses of wreckage that had been washed up and thrown on the rocks at the inner end of the cave where he stood  an involuntary shudder passed through the mans frame as he glanced round expecting to see the dead bodies of his late shipmates  but nothing of the kind was visible and the spars masts and other wreckage which had reached the rocks had been shattered into matchwood by frequent gales  john mitford now hastened in eager hope along the sides of the cave towards its mouth intending to go out to the base of the cliffs forgetting in his eagerness that the mouth could not be reached without a boat  he soon discovered this and was then thrown into another fit of despair by remembering that he could not swim  oh how bitterly he blamed himself for having neglected to acquire such a simple accomplishment  he might have learnt it when young had he not been indifferent or lazy about it  often had he been advised to learn it by companions but had treated the matter lightly and let the chance go byand now only fifty yards or so of deep water intervened between the end of the ledges of rock and the outside of the cavern where he might perhaps find foothold enough to scramble along the base of the cliffsbut those fifty yards were equal to the atlantic to him he could not swim that distance to save his life  once or twice in a fit of desperation he had almost plunged in to attempt it and take his chance  fortunately his courage failed  had he taken the plunge his fate would no doubt have been sealed  returning to the inner end of the cave he searched among the wreckage for wood with which to make a raft but it was so shattered that he found no pieces large enough to be thus used  he found however a barrel of pork and another of pease jammed into a crevice  these proved an immense relief to his feelings for they secured him against absolute starvation which he had begun to think stared him in the face  from that time forward the unfortunate man made incessant and wild efforts to get out of the cave  he climbed and scrambled about until his clothes were almost torn off his back  he gathered the largest masses of wood he could find and tied them together in bundles until he had made something like a raft but john was not a handy workman his raft overturned the first time he tried it and went to pieces and he would have been drowned at that time if he had not been within grasping distance of the rocks  as it was he got a fright which made him finally turn from that method of escape in despair  then the raw pork and hard pease tried him severely and brought on a complaint which lasted a considerable time and greatly reduced his strength but john was tough and recoveredthough not much more than the skeleton of his former self remained  thus he continued to exist in that cavern during all the time that his wife and friends were mourning him as dead and in this condition was he there seated on the morning in which this chapter opens  weary wearydesolation moaned the unfortunate man lifting his head and gazing round with the air of one from whom all hope has long since departed  it is said or supposed that when a spoke in fortunes wheel is at the lowest there must needs be a rise  mitfords experience at this time would seem to give ground for belief in the saying for the word desolation had scarcely passed his lips when distant voices of men were heard causing his heart to bound violently  next moment a boat glided in front of the caves mouth  john mitford sprang up and gave vent to a yell  hope raised to strong life after being long deferred despair suddenly trampled in the dust joy bounding as from the tomb into rampant being and a host of indescribable sentiments and passions found vent in that tremendous that inconceivable howl  and its effect on those in the boatwell  that morning our exploring party had resumed their voyage with somewhat saddened hearts for they remembered the look of the coast well and knew that an hour or so would bring them to the cave where the lapwing had gone down  even black ned had become sentimental and given vent to a few expressions of a semireligious nature  we cant be far from it now said dr hayward as the men ceased rowing and the boat glided slowly silently along  its a gruesome place remarked black ned in a low voice  to think that so many lives were lost hereor hereabouts murmured tomlin  an their ghost maybe hangin about suggested slag with a superstitious glance over his shoulder  just then hayward bade oconnor get up and stand in the bow with the boathook ready to fend offan order which the irishman having been somewhat awed by the tone of the conversation obeyed in silence  it was at this point that they glided in front of the cave and drew forth the yell which burst upon them like a clap of thunder  the shock to the nervous system of each was terrific  in the case of oconnor it was visible for he fell flat back into the bottom of the boat and fetched jarring a tremendous whack on the head with the boathook in falling  afterwards terrence asserted stoutly that a slip of the foot as he stood on the thort was the cause but those who knew him best held that it was a case of nerves  need it be said that on recovering nervous equilibrium the joy of rescuers and rescued was intense  come along lets take im home at wanst cried the irishman when they had got the poor dazed man into the boat  isnt it peggy thatll open her eyes an screech for joy when she sots her eyes on ye  well have to wash and comb an clothe him first said tomlin  he did not say shave for they had no razorsand by that time the beards of most of the party were as long as mitfords but their locks had been trimmed by means of a claspknife supersharpened whereas mitfords were in wildest disorder  that night they encamped in the wreckcave made a fire and prepared a splendid supper of pork and peasoup for john and themselves after which they subjected their recovered comrade to a scrubbing and cropping and repairing of habiliments that almost proved fatal to his constitution  next day they loaded the boat with all the pork and pease they could find as well as portions of cordage that might be useful then they started off on the return journey  it was a fine day when they reached the encampment where the coxswain and the women were on the lookout  massey of course was the first to observe as the boat approached that an extra hand was in it but he wisely said nothing at first  then his heart began to beat as it used to do when he brought in rescued men and women from wrecks for the truth suddenly flashed upon him  he glanced at peggy  poor thing her sad eyes had wandered from the approaching boat and were resting wistfully on the horizon beyond  nell murmured the coxswain in a deep earnest whisper to his wife who stood at his elbow the tides agoin to rise again wi poor peggy if my eyes are tellin truth  what dee mean bob asked nellie with a quick anxious look  five men went away nell six are comin back  as he spoke a tall figure rose up in the stern of the boat and waved a hand  nellie glanced quickly at her friend  she was standing with glaring eyes parted lips and a deathly pallor on her worn face  peggy  the familiar word came rolling to the shore and a piercing shriek replied to it as the poor woman threw up both hands and fell backward into the ready arms of the coxswains wife who had sprung to her side in anticipation of some such catastrophe  there was the voice of prayer and thanksgiving that night in the hut on the lonely shoresuch thanksgiving as we might conceive filled the hearts of jairus and of the widow of nain in the days of old    story one chapter 12  the state of things on the island was now considerably improved  peggy under the influence of gratitude for restored felicity became more helpful than she had formerly been and more loquacious than ever  her female companions being amiable and easily pleased were rather amused than otherwise at the continuous flow of discursive sometimes incomprehensible and always goodnatured small talkparticularly small talkwith which she beguiled the hours that might have otherwise hung heavily on their minds while their hands were busily engaged with the boneneedles and sinew threads which the coxswain had manufactured for them  for the clothes with which they had landed on the island especially those of the menhad begun to wear out after eight or ten months and new garments had to be made while repairs never ceased  meanwhile the men were fully occupied each day in hunting seals or fishing cutting firewood with the axe they had found in the hut and in making their home more comfortable  a door was fitted to the hut a wooden partition was put up to cut off more effectually the womens apartment from that of the men the open crevices in the walls were stopped up with moss and many other improvements were made  a few nails extracted from the walls of the hut were converted into fishhooks by means of the file which had been found and nellie spun some excellent fishinglines from flax found growing wild in abundance the file also enabled them to strike fire with broken flints picked up on the shore  the ash of burnt cotton as the doctor knew makes good tinder so in the public interest john mitford agreed to part with the ragged remains of the cotton shirt he had long wornquite unnecessarilyover his woollen jersey  thus they could afford to let the fire go out and were relieved from constant watching as well as anxiety in regard to it  they did not however cease their nocturnal vigils for the hope of deliverance never died out though it at last sank very low  besides keeping their sealskin flag flying they kindled a beaconfire every night to guard and replenish which became the nightly duty of one or other of the menwatch and watch aboutall the time they stayed on the island  during the earlier part of each night however the beaconfire was not watched  it was merely lighted and left for some hours to look after itself  during this period after supper the whole party were wont to draw round the blazing fire in the hut and each contributed his or her share to the entertainment of the social circle  then it was that lugubrious john mitford developed amazing powers of inventive storytelling and joe slag came out strong with thrilling lifeboat tales every word of which bob massey corroborated while terrence oconnor displayed powers of sarcastic criticism of the highest order and tomlin black ned and the women proved an intensely appreciative audience  but the latter were not merely listeners  true peggy did nothing for the general good  having quite exhausted her lungs with incessant talk during each day she was fortunately almost incapable of speech in the evening but nellie who possessed a voice as sweet as herself and clear and true as that of a nightingale was induced to favour the companychiefly with pathetic or patriotic ditties and hymnswhile eva thrilled her audience with terrible tales of slavery in many of which she had acted a part  of course dr hayward lent his aid both with song and story but like a true leader he devoted himself chiefly to drawing out the powers of his companions directing or diverting the flow of conversation and keeping order  he also instituted what may be truly styled family worship at night by repeating from memory portions of the word of god and engaging in prayer just before retiring to rest  bob massey and tomlin were induced to help him in this and never was a prayer put up from that hut in which there was not an earnest petition that a ship might be sent for their deliverance  but a ship is long long o comin said slag to jarring as he accompanied the latter part of the way to the beaconfire one night when it was black neds turn to watch  a shipll come joe when god sees fit to send it said ned  slag glanced at his comrade in surprise the reply was so very unlike neds usual style of speech that he felt uncertain whether it was uttered in earnest  the only thing i feel an awful longin for now at times is a bit o baccy continued ned  so does i ned an i sometimes think dr hayward has got the advantage of us there for he never smoked so he says an in coorse it stands to reason that he cant have no longin for a thing he dont wantan he seems as jolly an happy as the best of us without it  ay jollier and happier replied ned shortly  but i say ned dont ye ever feel a longin for grog  ye used to be raither fond of it  nonot now joe  its the best thing as ever happened to me bein cast on this here islandwi dr hayward to give a feller a word of advice  slag who felt a sort of selfrighteous superiority over his comrade inasmuch as he had never given way to drink said you should be thankful for that ned  i am thankful returned the other in a tone that induced slag to say no more  it was a very dark night and cold so that black ned involuntarily shuddered as he approached the beaconfire alonejoe having left him and commenced to heap on fuel  then rain began to fall heavily  there was no shelter and the watchman was soon drenched to the skin  heaping on more logs till the fire roared again he tried to warm himself and stood so close to the blaze that his garments smokedthey would have burnt had they not been wetbut no heat seemed to penetrate the shivering frame of black ned  next morning the poor man was smitten with a raging fever  from the first the doctor had little hope of his recovery  with a constitution fatally injured by dissipation and drink his chance was very small but of course every effort was made to save him  he was laid on a soft bed of moss in the warmest corner of the hut and the women took their turn in nursing him night and daythe coxswains wife however being the chief nurse for besides being sympathetic and tender by nature she had been trained in a rough school where selfreliance and capacity were constantly called into action in circumstances of difficulty so that she was better fitted for the post than either of her companions  but their efforts were of no avail  after a week black ned died with a smile of gratitude on his dark face as he gazed in haywards eyes and held his hand until the spirit returned to god who gave it  the gloom cast over the little community by this sudden appearance of the king of terrors lasted for many days and had the good effect of turning the thoughts of all of them to those subjects which are obviously and naturally distasteful to fallen manthe soul and the world to come  but gradually the gloom passed away though it left in the party a greater longing than ever to escape from their island prison  one day while some of them were at breakfast terrence oconnor rushed into the hut with the news that a ship was in sight  instantly the boat was manned and they rowed with all their might towards the vessel which was seen like a white speck on the horizon  they rowed to within four miles of her with an oar set up as a mast and a jacket attached thereto as a flag but a breeze sprang up and the strange sail actually passed on without taking the slightest notice of themthough the people on board could not have failed to see the boat  profound was the disappointment and violent the indignation that filled the thoughts of the castaways as they rowed slowly back to land  sure its devils that must live in the bodies o some men growled oconnor in the bitterness of his soul  youre too hard on the devils terrence said bob massey  some men in this world do the worst that they can an surely devils can do no more than that  this incident however aroused the hopes and expectations of the party to a high pitch so that the beaconfire was kept burning more steadily and brightly than before and the lookout hill was more frequently visited still weeks and months passed by and no deliverance came to them  during this period the sealhunting fishing clothesmending etcetera were carried on with unflagging energy and the nightly entertainments became more and more entertaining by reason of use and effort developing new capacities and talents that might in less favourable circumstances have lain altogether dormant  all this was due very much to their leader for besides being a godfearing man hayward was preeminently cheery and full of fun as well as vigour  the coxswain too was likeminded and of great capacity in every way while his wifes voice was so charming that the party became almost dependent on it  they could scarcely have gone to rest at last without nellies hymn or song as a lullaby  we must state however that tomlin did not share in this pleasure  that poor man had been born musically deaf as some people are born physically blind  there was no musical inlet to his soul  there was indeed a door for sound to enter and music of course sought an entrance by that door but it was effectually destroyed somehow in passing through the doorway so that poor tomlin showed no symptom of pleasure  what he heard and how he heard it is known only to himself  once or twice during this time they visited the cavern of the wreck with the view if possible of recovering something from the sunk vessel but though most of the men could swim none of them could dive therefore the result was failure  they succeeded however in making soap by boiling woodash and seals fat in their castiron pot  those who are accustomed to the celebrated pears can scarcely understand what an addition to cleanliness and comfort resulted from this coarsely manufactured article  gulls eggs were found in great quantity on the cliffs and the discovery and capture of wild pigs added to the luxury of their table which latter by the way was an ingenious contrivance of joe slag binding four sticks together in the form of a stout oblong frame joe had covered thisfilled it in as it werewith straight branches about a finger thick laid side by side and tied to the frame  this he fixed on four posts driven into the ground and thus formed an excellent if not an elegant table  one morning at breakfast terrence oconnor was observed to be unusually busy with a large hook  are you goin to fish for sharks today asked slag  faix no its to the woods ill go fishin today joe  now nell gi me the stoutest line yeve got on hand mavourneen  will that do  i made it the other day specially for sharksor whales said nellie with a light laugh for she expected him to reject the line she held up  the very thing nell  hand it over  now boys im off to try my luck i the woods for im gittin tired o the say  oconnor went off alone bestowing a mysterious wink on peggy mitford as he left  the irishman had observed that the wild pigs were particularly fond of a certain root which was plentiful in a valley about three miles distant from the hut  repairing to that valley he dug up one of the roots baited his hook with it hung it from a low branch to attract attention fastened the other end of the line to a tree and went off to hide and bide his time  before halfanhour had elapsed a gay young pig visited the scene of its former festivities saw the pendent bait smelt it took it in its mouth and straightway filled the woods with frantic lamentations  the struggle between the irishman and that pig was worthy of record but we prefer leaving it to the readers imagination  the upshot was that the pig was overcome carriedbound and shriekingto the hut and tamed by peggy  in a short time other pigs were caught and tamed  so also were rabbits  these bred and multiplied  the original pig became the mother of a large family and in a short time something like the sounds and aspects of a farm began to surround the old hut  still furtherby means of the castiron pot which already boiled their soup and their soapthey managed to boil seawater down into salt and with this some of the pigs were converted into salt porkin short the place began to assume the appearance of a busy and thriving backwoods settlement  its risin tide with us again after a fashion nell said the coxswain to his wife as they stood one evening on the seashore watching the sunset  nellie sighed  it is bob she said and im very thankful butbut id rather be at home in old england among kith and kin even though the tide was low  what alongside o aunt betty  yes even alongside o aunt betty for if this voyage has taught me anything at all it has taught me that after all theres no place like home  right you are nell said joe slag who came up at that moment theres no place like homewhen its a happy one but if it aint a happy one there may be difference of opinion even on that pint dee see  that very night a great ocean steamer bound from the antipodes to old england chanced to diverge from her true course and sighted the beaconfire which tomlinon duty at the timewas stirring up to fervent heat  the captain was not one of those whom terrence oconnor credited with diabolic possession  he was a good man and knowing that men did not light beaconfires on lonely islands merely for amusement he resolved to layto till daylight which was due in about an hour from the time the island was sighted  meanwhile he sounded his steam whistle  at the sound the hut instantly disgorged its male inmates who recognising the familiar noise and the steamers lights sent up a shout of mingled joy and thanksgiving  get out the boat boys cried hayward as he ran back to the hut to rouse the women  get ready quick  eva a steamer at last thank god in the offing dont lose a moment  they may have little time to wait  boat will be ready in a few minutes  ay an pack up all you want to carry away cried the coxswain crossing the threshold at that moment  so it is all going to end suddenly like a dream said eva as she hastened to obey orders  home sweet home murmured nellie trembling with joy at the prospect  wherever you are my dear the home will be sweet said peggy though of course it wouldnt be that without your usband for it takes two to make a fight you know an it takes two no less i think to make things pleasant butdear dear what a disagreeable thing it is to ave to dress in a urry though one shouldnt  look alive there look alive roared oconnor putting his head in at the door  daylights abreakin an they wont  oh  terrence that reminds medont forget our pets cried nellie who had steadily declined to speak of them as live stock  all right missis  its lookin after them i am this minnit  the irishman ran as he spoke to the styes and hutches where the pigs and rabbits were kept and opened the doors  out wid ye he cried the act of emancipations passed and yere all freeivery mothers son of ye  accustomed to his voice and his caressing hand the astonished creatures seemed to look up at him in surprise  be aff at wance hooroo cried the excited man with a clap of his hands and a donnybrook yell that sent all the pets leaping and squealing into their native jungle  soon after that the boat was bounding out to sea under the impulse of strong arms and willing hearts  a few minutes more and they were receiving the warm congratulations of the passengers and crew of the steamer  then the order was given to go ahead full speed and the engines great heart seemed to throb sympathetically within the hearts of the rescued ones as the vessel cut her way swiftly through the southern oceanhomeward bound for old england  nevertheless there was a touch of sadness in the breasts of all as they turned their farewell gaze on the receding island and thought of the pets the old hut the long period of mingled pleasure and suffering and the lonely grave    we cannot part from the friends whose footsteps we have followed so long and so far without a parting word or two  on returning to his native village bob massey found that his successor as coxswain had died and that another man had not yet been appointed to the lifeboathe was therefore installed with much rejoicing in his old position as a rescuer of human lives  joe slag naturally and pleasantly also fell into his old post at the bow  nellie found that aunt betty had had what the villagers called a stroke during her absence which crushing blow had the effect of opening her eyes to many things regarding herself and others to which she had been particularly blind before  it also had the effectindirectlyof subduing much of the evil in her character and bringing out much of the good  as evil begets evil so good begets good and one result of this law was that the seven children whom she had broughtor bangedup became seven repentant and sympathetic and reasonably good creatures when they saw the old mother whom they used to think so harsh and so physically strong reduced to amiable helplessness  thus it came to pass that there was not in all the village an old woman who was so well looked after by her progeny as aunt betty  terrence oconnor continued to rove about the world in the capacity of a ships cook till near the end of his days  john mitford and peggy unexpectedly came into a small inheritance soon after returning home and settled down for life close to the coxswains cottage  tomlin went to new zealand to seek his fortune  whether he found it or not we cannot tell  last but not least dr hayward and his wife returned to their native land and for many years afterwards kept up a steady correspondence with nell massey in which you may be sure there were frequent and pleasant allusions to the time which they had spent together on the lonely isle in the southern seas  one morning nellie presented her husband with a baby boy  bob was out with the lifeboat rescuing a shipwrecked crew at the time the presentation was made  on his return he opened the door and stood before his wife dripping wet  fifteen saved this time nell he began but the nurse stopped him by exhibiting the baby boy  thank the lord he said with a glad look in his wet eyes  you mustnt come near us said the nurse with a look of warning only a look just now  the tide has risen to the flood now bob murmured the young mother softly  ay said the coxswain in a deep voice an its a high spring tide too  god bless you nell  the end    story two chapter 1  jack frost and sonsa short story  one year in the last quarter of the present century john frost esquire of arctic hall paid an unusually long visit to the british islands  john or jack frost as he was familiarly called by those who did not fear him was a powerful fellow an amazingly active vigorous selfwilled fellow whom it was difficult to resist and in some circumstances quite impossible to overcome  jack was a giant  indeed it is not improbable that he was also a giantkilleran insolent selfassertive coldhearted giant who swaggered with equal freedom into the palaces of the rich and the cottages of the poor but he did not by any means meet with the same reception everywhere  in palaces and mansions he was usually met in the entrance hall by a sturdy footman who kicked him out and slammed the door in his face while in cottages and lowly dwellings he was so feebly opposed that he gained entrance easilyfor he was a bullying shameless fellow who forced his way wherever he couldand was induced to quit only after much remonstrance and persuasion and even then he usually left an unpleasant flavour of his visit behind him  but there were some abodes in which our hero met with no opposition at all where the inmates scarcely made any attempt to keep him out but remained still and trembled or moaned feebly while he walked in and sat down beside them  jack was somewhat of a deceiver too  he had for the most part a bright beaming jovial outward aspect which made the bitter coldness of his heart all the more terrible by contrast  he was most deadly in his feelings in calm weather but there were occasions when he took pleasure in sallying forth accompanied by his likeminded sons colonel wind and major snow  and it was a tremendous sight that few people cared to see except through windows when those three arminarm went swaggering through the land together  one christmas morning at the time we write of jack and his two sons went careering in a happygolucky sort of way along the london streets towards the west end blinding peoples eyes as they went reversing umbrellas overturning old women causing young men to stagger and treating hats in general as if they had been black footballs  turning into saint jamess park they rushed at the royal palace but finding that edifice securely guarded from basement to rooftree they turned round and with fearless audacity assaulted the admiralty and the horseguardstaking a shot at the clubs in passing it need scarcely be recorded that they made no impression whatever on those centres of wealth and power  undismayedfor jack and his sons knew nothing either of fear or favourthey went careering westward until they came to a palatial mansion at the halfopen front door of which a pretty servant girl stood peeping out  it was early  perhaps she was looking for the milkmanpossibly for the policeman  with that quick perception which characterises men of war major snow saw and seized his opportunity dashing forward he sprang into the hall  colonel wind not a whit less prompt burst the door wide open and the three assailants tumbled over each other as they took possession of the outworks of the mansion  but jeames was not far distant  the screams of mary drew him forth he leaped into the hall drove out the intruders and shut the door with a crash but with no further damage to the foe than the snipping off part of major snows tails which mary swept up into a dust shovel and deposited in the coalhole or some such dark region below  our trio possessed neither fear nor pride  they were also destitute of taste and had no respect for persons  treating their repulse as a good joke they turned round and went hilariously along the strand embracing every one they met young and old rich and poor pretty and plain with pointed impartiality until they reached the city  there we will leave them to revel amongst the poor while we return to the mansion at the west end  in two snug bedrooms thereof two young men lay in their comfortable beds partially awake and yawningthe one flat on his back as if laid out for his last sleep the other coiled into a bundle with the bedclothes as if ready to be carried off to the laundry with the next washing  the rooms were connected by a door which stood open for the occupants were twin brothers their united ages amounting to forty years  ned said the straight one to the bundle  well tom sleepily  did you hear that noiselike a cannonshot  yaiou yessoming tumbleddoor bangd snore  hallo ned cried tom suddenly leaping out of bed and beginning to dress in haste why its christmas morning  i had almost forgot  a merry christmas to you my boy  mrry kissms ol man but don waken me  whats use o gettin up  the use echoed tom proceeding rapidly with his toilet why ned the use of rising early is that it enables a man to get through with his work in good time and ive a deal of work to do today at the eastend  so v i murmured ned at th wes end  indeed  what are you going to do  skt  skt  whats that  skateol man let m lone growled ned as he uncoiled himself to some extent and rearranged the bundle for another snooze  with a light laugh tom westlake left his brother to enjoy his repose and descended to the breakfastroom where his sister matilda better known as matty met him with a warm reception  everything that met him in that breakfastparlour was warm  the fire of course was warm and it seemed to leap and splutter with a distinctly christmas morning air the curtains and carpets and armchairs were warm and cosy in aspect the teaurn was warm indeed it was hot and so were the muffins while the atmosphere itself was unusually warm  the tiny thermometer on the chimneypiece told that it was 65 degrees of fahrenheit  outside the selfregistering thermometer indicated 5 degrees below zero  why matty exclaimed tom as he looked frowningly at the instrument i have not seen it so low as that for years  it will freeze the thames if it lasts long enough  matty made no reply but stood with her hands clasped on her brothers arm gazing contemplatively at the driving snow  what are you thinking about asked tom  about the poor answered matty as she went and seated herself at the breakfasttable  on such a terrible morning as this i feel so inexpressibly selfish in sitting down to an overflowing meal in the midst of such warmth and comfort when i know that there are hundreds and thousands of men and women and children all round us who have neither fire nor food sufficientlittle clothing and no comfort  it is dreadful added matty as an unusually fierce gust dashed the snow against the windows  tom was likeminded with his sister but he could not suppress a smile as he looked into her pretty little anxious face  yes matty it is dreadful he replied and the worst of it is that we can do so little so very little to mend matters  yet i dont feel as you do about the selfishness of enjoying a good breakfast in comfortable circumstances for it is god who has given us all that we have as well as the power to enjoy it  i grant that if we simply enjoyed our good things and neither thought of nor cared for the poor we should indeed be most abominably selfish but happily that is not our case this morning  have we not risen an hour earlier than usual to go out and do what we can to mitigate the sorrows of the poor  are we not about to face the bitter blast and the driving snow on this christmas morning for that very purpose and should we not be rendered much less capable of doing so if we were to start off on our mission with cold bodies and halffilledi beg pardon pass the muffins dear  besides sister mine if you were to go out on such a morning cold and underfed would it not be probable that i should have to go and fetch a doctor for you instead of taking you out to help me in aiding and comforting poor people  that may be all very true tom returned matty with a dissatisfied and puzzled look but i cannot help feeling that i have so much so very much more than i need of everything while the thousands i speak of have so littleso very little  why could not rich people like us be content with plainer things and use fewer things and so have more to give to the poor  you have broached a very wide and profound subject matty and it would probably take us a week to go into it exhaustively but a few words may suffice to show you that your remedy would not meet the case  suppose that all the people in england were all at once smitten with your desire to retrench in order to have more to spare to the poorand were to act upon their convictions to determine that henceforth they would live on the plainest food such as potatoes mutton and bread what i ask you would become of the great army of confectioners  would they not be thrown out of employment and help perhaps to swell the ranks of the poor  if the rich ceased to buy pictures what would become of painters  if they gave up books horrible to think of what would be the consequences to authors and what the result to themselves  if carriages and horses were not kept what would become of coachmen and grooms and ostlersto say nothing of coachmakers saddlers harnessmakers and their innumerable dependants  noliving plainly or simply is not what is wanted but living reasonablyaccording to ones means  then as to your having as you say much more than you need that does not injure the poor for nothing of it is wasted  does not part of the surplus go to mary and james and the other servants and much of what they do not consume goes in charity directly to the poor themselves  well but returned matty with the distressed and puzzled look still unabated though all you tell me may be quite true it does not in the least degree alter the fact that there is something quite wrong in the condition of the poor of our great cities which ought to be remedied  of course it does not little woman but it relieves my mind and it ought to relieve yours as to the selfishness of enjoying a good breakfast  but surely resumed matty with a slightly indignant look and tone surely you dont mean to tell me that there is no remedy for the miserable condition of the poor and that the rich must just sigh over it or shut their eyes to it while they continue to revel in luxury  how you fly to extremes sister said tom with a laugh as he neatly cut the top off a fourth egg  i combat your erroneous views and straightway you charge me by implication with having no views at all a remedy there surely is but the wisest among us are not agreed as to what it ischiefly i think because the remedy is not simple but extremely complex  it cannot be stated in a few words  it consists in the wise and prompt application of multiform means  brother interrupted matty with a smile do you think i am to be turned from my quest after this great truth by the stringing together of words without meaningat least words vague and incomprehensible  by no means matty  i hope that nothing will ever turn you from your quest after the best method of helping the poor  but my words are not meant to be vague  by multiform means i would indicate legislation in numerous channels and social effort in all its ramifications besides the correction of many erroneous modes of thoughtsuch for instance as the putting of the less before the greater  tom again interrupted matty i think it is about time to go and put on my things  not so sister dear said tom impressively i intend that you shall hear me out  i think that you put the less before the greater when you talk of giving to the poor instead of considering the poor  the greater you know includes the less  consideration includes judicious giving and the teaching of scripture is not to give to but to consider the poor  now you may be off and get readyas quickly as you can too for it would never do to keep the poor waiting breakfast  with a light laugh and a vigorous stepthe result of goodwill to mankind good intentions good feeding and generally good circumstancesmatilda westlake ran upstairs to her room at the top of the house to put on a charming little winter bonnet a dear little cloak lined with thick fur and everything else to match while tom busied himself in meditating on the particular passage of gods word which he hoped by the spirits influence to bring home to the hearts of some of the poor that christmas morning  half an hour after these two had gone forth to do battle with john frost and sons edward westlake sauntered into the breakfastroom his right hand in his pocket and his left twirling the end of an exceedingly juvenile moustache  turning his back to the fire he perused the morning paper and enjoyed himself thoroughly while james rearranged the table for another sumptuous meal  ned was by no means a bad fellow  on the contrary his companions thought and called him a jolly good fellow  his father was a jolly though a gouty old widower  perhaps it was owing to the fact that there was no mother in the household that ned smoked a meerschaum in the breakfastroom while he read the paper  have my skates been sharpened he asked looking over the top of the paper  james said that they had been sharpened and were then lying ready on the hall table  sauntering to the window ned looked out and james having retired he made a few remarks himself which showed the direction of his thoughts  capital  ice will be splendid  snow wont matter  lots of men to sweep it  looks as if the wind would fall and theres a little bit of blue sky  even if it doesnt clear the pond is well sheltered  i do like a sharp stinging frosty day  makes ones blood career so pleasantly  with such agreeable thoughts and a splendid appetite ned westlake sat down to breakfast  thereafter he put on a thick overcoat edged with sable a thick pair of boots and softly lined gloves and went out with the skates swinging on his arm  jack frost and his two sons were still holding high revelry outside they met him with impartial violence but ned bent forward with a smile of goodhumoured defiance and went on his way unchecked  not so a stout and short old female of the costermonger class who after a series of wild gyrations that might have put a dancing dervish to shame bore down on ned after the manner of a fat teetotum and finally launched herself into his arms  hallo old girlsteady exclaimed ned holding her up with an effort you carry too much sail to venture abroad in such weather  which it were my only one gasped the old woman holding out her umbrella that had been reversed and obviously shattered beyond repair then looking up at ned youd better leave ago of me young man what will the neighbours think of us  which remark she uttered sternlyall the more that she had securely hooked herself to the railings and could afford to cast off her friend  with a solemn assurance that he esteemed her the sweetest of the fair ned went smilingly on his way receiving in reply la now whod a thought it  having twisted this ladys bonnet off blown her unkempt hair straight out and otherwise maltreated her colonel wind with his father and brother went raging along the streets until he came to the neighbourhood of whitechapel  the three seemed rather fond of this region and no wonder for although never welcomed they found themselves strong enough to force an entrance into many a poor home and to remain in possession  swaggering in their own noisy and violent manner into several courts and blind alleys they caught up all the lighter articles of rubbish that lay about hurled them against the frail and cracked windowssome of which they broke and others of which they could not break by reason of their having been broken already  they did what was next best howeverdrove in the old hats and coats and other garments with which the square holes had been inefficiently stopped  jolly aint it remarked a street boy with a ruddy face and hair blown straight on end all round to another street boy with a castiron look and a red noseboth being powerfully robust  prime asserted the knight of the red nose  and then both went eagerly to take liberties with a neighbouring pump from the spout of which hung an icicle like a stalactite the droppings from which at an earlier period had formed a considerable stalagmite on the stones below  it is probable that the sick old man on the poor bed in the small room close to the pump did not think the state of matters either jolly or prime for besides being very old he was very weak and thin and cold and hungry in addition to which jack frost had seated himself on the rickety chair beside the empty grate and seemed bent on remainingthe colonel having previously blown open the door and removed a garment which had sheltered the old mans head thus permitting the major to sprinkle a miniature drift on his pillow  i hardly like to leave you granfather in such blustery weather said a little maiden of about ten years of age with filthy garments and a dirty face who if she had been washed and dressed would have been distinctly pretty but who in the circumstances was rather plain  as she spoke she readjusted the garmentscreen and removed the snowdrift  dont say that martha replied the old man in a thin weak voiceit had been strong and deep and resonant once but time and want and disease play sad havoc with strong men  you must go darling resumed the old man after a few seconds pause to recover breath  youve no chance of a breakfast otherwise  and perhapsthey may give you a bit to bring home for  martha eagerly interrupted the hesitating voiceand it was easily interrupted  yes yes granfather  theyll be sure to let me bring home some for you  ill be quite quite sure to do it  she made the promise with great decision as well she might for she had made up her mind to pocket all the food that was given to her except just a small morsel which she would nibble in order to make believe that she was feeding  lock the door and put the key in your pocket said the old man while the child tucked in about him the thin torn counterpane which formed the only covering to his straw bed  an dont fear for me darling  the lord is with me  be sure to eat as much as you can  having regard to her secret intentions martha refrained from pledging herself but she laughed and nodded significantly as she quitted the cold dismal and shabby room  it was little marthas first experience of a free breakfast  she had indeed heard of such a thing before but had not up to that time met with anything of the kind so she advanced to the hall with some timidity and much expectation  the hall was very full and as poor little martha was rather late she could not manage to crush in much beyond the door  besides being small she could see nothing  in these depressing circumstances her heart began to sink when her attention was attracted by a slight stir outside the door  a lady and gentleman were coming in  it so happened that the lady in passing trod upon one of marthas cold little toes and drew from the child a sharp cry  oh my dear dear little girl cried the shocked lady with a gush of selfreproach and sympathy im so sorryso very very sorry it was so stupid of me  have i hurt you much dear little girl comecome with me  bring her to the stove matty theres more room there to have it looked to said the gentleman in a kind voice  much consoled by all this though still whimpering little martha suffered herself to be led to the front seats and set on a bench just below the platform where she began to bloom under the genial influence of the stove and to wonder with inexpressible surprise at the mighty sea of upturned faces in front of her  as for the toe it was utterly forgotten  the ladys foot you see being almost as light as her heart had done it no serious injury  nevertheless she continued for a few minutes to inspect it earnestly and inquire for it tenderly regardless of dirt  youre sure it is better dear little child  oh yes maam thank you  i dont feel it at all now  an its so nice to feel warm again  what a depth of meaning was unwittingly given to the last two words by the emphasis of the childvoicewarmagain  the lady almost burst into tears as she thought of all that they implied  but her services were required at the harmonium  with a parting pat on marthas curly head and a bright smile she hurried away to ascend the platform  the preliminaries of a feast at which most of the feasters are cold and hungrysome of them starvingshould not be long  full well did tom westlake know and appreciate this truth and being the donor originator and prime mover in the matter he happily had it all his own way  in the fewest possible words and in a good loud voice which produced sudden silence he asked god to give his blessing with the food provided and to send his holy spirit into the hearts of all present so that they might be made to hunger and thirst for jesus the bread and water of life  then the poor people had scarcely recovered from their surprise at the brevity of the prayer when they were again charmed to silence by the sweet strains of the harmonium  you see they had not yet become blase and incapable of enjoying anything short of an organ indeed there were some among them who deliberately said they preferred a harmonium to an organ  but no instrument either of ancient or modern invention could drown the clatter that ensued when enormous mugs of earthenware were distributed to the company by more or less rich and welloff workers so the clatter and the hymns went on together until each lung was filled with some delectable fluid smoking hot and each mouth crammed with excellent bread and meat  then comparative quiet ensued during which temporary calm tom read a few verses of the word of god commenting on them briefly in language so forcible that it went right home to many hearts yet so simple that even little martha understood it  true to her intention little martha although much surprised and charmed and perplexed by all that was going on around her did not forget to pocket something for granfather  she was met however by an exasperating difficulty at the very outset  her pocket was not large enough to contain the huge roll which with some meat had been put hastily into her small hand by a lady with a red rose in her bonnet  to achieve her object with the roll and meat in one hand and the mug in the other was she found impossible so she set the mug on the floor between her feet and proceeded to wrestle with the loaf and pocket having previously torn off a very small portion of the bread for her own use  still the loaf was too large so she tore off another morsel and finally after a severe struggle succeeded in getting it and the bit of meat in  youll go for to kick it over if you dont mind said a small boy near her referring to the mug  you mind your own businessimperence replied martha sharply  it must be remembered that she was a child of the slums  wot a cheeky little shrimp it is retorted the boy with as much of a grin as a stuffed mouth would admit of  just then matilda westlake having finished a hymn and being mindful of the little toe came quietly down to where martha was sitting  why dear child she said in surprise have they not given you something to eat  oh yes maam  but ive  she was going to say ive eaten it but granfather had so earnestly impressed on her mind the sinfulness of telling lies that she felt constrained to hesitate and with a trembling lip finished by saying she had eaten some of it  and what has become of the rest dear  please miss sheve putt it in er pocket said imperence promptly  without noticing the remark matty moved so as to make herself an effectual screen between imperence and martha  tell me dear child she said stooping low and putting a gentle hand on marthas shoulder are you not hungry  oh yes answered the little one quickly im so ungry  you cant think ow ungry but i promised toto  at this point her lip quivered and she began to cry quietly  stay dont tell me anything more about it dear till you have breakfasted  here eat this before you say another word  she took a roll from the basket of a passing worker and put it in the childs hand  nothing loth martha began to eat and drink mingling a warm tear or two with the hot soup and venting a sob now and then as she proceeded  watching her for a few moments matty left her  in passing she stopped and said to imperence in a whisper of terrible intensity if you speak to that girl again you shall haveno more  no more  to be hanged by the neck till you are dead would not have sounded so appalling just at that time  so imperence collapsed  it is not our purpose to go much further into the details of the feast suffice it to say that the poorest of the poor were there that they were encouraged to eat as much as possible and allowed to carry away what they could not eat and there is reason to believe that judging from the prominence of pockets a considerable quantity found its way to hungry mouths which had been found incapable of attending the feast  among those who did great execution in the pocketing line was as you may well believe little martha  finding to her ineffable joy that there was no limit assigned to consumption and that pocketing was not esteemed a sin she proceeded after stuffing herself to stuff to overflowing the pocket with which she had previously wrestled as already described and then attempted to fill the pocket on the other side  she did so in utter and childlike forgetfulness of the fact that she had recently lost several small articles in consequence of the condition of that pocket and her memory was not awakened until having just completed the satisfactory filling of it she beheld or rather felt the entire mass of edibles descending to the floor proving that the pocket was indeed a very bottomless pit  never mind little one said tom westlake coming forward at the moment for he had just closed the meeting ill find a bag for you to put it in  i hope the toe is all right  oh yes sir thank you its quite well answered martha blushing through the dirt on her face as she eyed the fallen food anxiously  tell me now little one continued tom sitting down on the bench and drawing the child gently towards him whom are you pocketing all these good things fornot for yourself im quite sure of that  oh dear no sir its for granfather  indeed  is grandfather very poor  oh yes sir very very poor an hes got nobody but me to take care of him  if that be so who is taking care of him just now asked matty who had joined her brother leaving another worker at the harmonium to play the people outa difficult thing to do by the way for the people seemed very unwilling to go  you see among other things jack frost and sons could gain no footing in that hall and the people knew only too well that the firm was in great force awaiting them outside  nobodys takin care on im maam replied martha somewhat shyly i locked im in an hes takin care of hisself  would you like to give grandfather anything in particular little woman if a fairy were to offer to give it you  oh wouldnt i just  yes  what would you ask for  martha pursed her little mouth and knitted her brows in thought for a minute  then she said slowly id ask for a mug of hot soup an a blanket an some coals andoh  i forgot a teapot for ours is cracked an wont old in now  do you live far from this hall asked tom  no sir quite close  come matty you and i will go with this little one and see grandfather  what is your name child  martha burns sir  well martha give me your hand and come along  they were soon in the shabby little roomfor martha was eager to give the food to the old man  of course jack frost and sons were still in possession but there had come another visitor during the childs absence whom they were scarce prepared to meet  death sat beside the lowly bed  he had not yet laid his hand on his victim but his chill presence was evidently felt  darling im glad youve come said the old man faintly  ive been longing so for you  give me your hand dear  im so coldso cold  he shivered as he spoke until the miserable bed shook  poor martha forgot the food in her anxiety for a striking change had come over granfathersuch as she had never seen before  she took his thin hand in hers and began to weep softly  but matilda westlake did not forget the food  she took up the tin can in which it had been brought there and poured some of the still warm contents into a cracked soup plate that stood on the table  finding a pewter spoon she at once put her hand under the pillow and raising the old mans head gently began to feed him like a child  meanwhile tom westlake took off his thick overcoat and spread it over the bed  then he went out bought some sticks and coal from a neighbour and returning soon kindled a fire in the rusty grate  the old man did not seem surprised  his face wore a dazed yet thoroughly pleased look as he quietly accepted these attentions  all the time he kept fast hold of marthas hand and smiled to her once or twice  it was evident that he relished the soup  only once he broke silence to thank them and say jesus sent you i suppose  yes jesus sent us replied matty thoroughly meaning what she said  at that moment death raised his hand and laid it gently on the old mans brow  the hoary head bowed to the summons and with a soft sigh the glad spirit fled to that region where suffering cannot enter  oh it was sad to witness the childgrief when martha at last came to understand that granfather was really gone  and it required no little persuasion to induce her to leave the lowly sordid room that she had known as home  while his sister comforted the child tom went to the authorities to inform them that an old pauper had gone the way of all flesh  when at last martha permitted her new friends to remove her she was led by miss westlake to the not far distant house of a lady friend whose sympathies with the suffering the sorrowful and the fallen were so keen that she had given up all and gone to dwell in the midst of them in the sanguine hope of rescuing some  to this ladys care martha was in the meantime committed and then tom and his sister went their way  their way led them to a very different scene not far from the same region  were rather late remarked tom consulting his watch as they turned into a narrow street  not too late i think said his sister  i hope not for i should be sorry to go in upon them at dinnertime  they were not too late  david butts whom they were about to visit was a docklabourer  in early youth he had been a footman in which capacity he had made the acquaintance of the westlakes nurserymaid and having captivated her heart had carried her off in triumph and married her  david had not been quite as steady as might have been desired  he had acquired while in service a liking for beer which had degenerated into a decided craving for brandy so that he naturally came down in the world until having lost one situation after another he finally with his poor wife and numerous children was reduced to a state bordering on beggary  but god who never forgets his fallen creatures came to this mans help when the tide with him was at its lowest ebb  a humbleminded city missionary was sent to him  he was the means of bringing him to jesus  the saviour using one of the mans companions as an instrument brought him to a temperance meeting and there an eloquent though uneducated speaker flung out a rope to the struggling man in the shape of a blue ribbon  david butts seized it and held on for life  his wife gladly sewed a bit of it on every garment he possessedincluding his nightshirtand the result was that he got to be known at the docks as a steady dependable man and found pretty constant employment  how far matilda westlake was instrumental in this work of rescue we need not stop to tell  it is enough to say that she had a hand in itfor her heart yearned towards the nurse who had been very kind to her when she was a little child  jack frost and his sons with their usual presumption were in close attendance on the westlakes when they knocked at davids door and when it was opened they rudely brushed past the visitors and sought to enter but a gush of genial heat from a roaring fire effectually stopped jack and the major on the threshold and almost killed them  colonel wind however succeeded in bursting in overturning a few light articles causing the flames to sway leap and roar wildly and scattering ashes all over the room but his triumph was shortlived  the instant the visitors entered he was locked out and the door shut against him with a bang  it do come rather awkward sir avin no entrance all said david as he made the door fast  if we even ad a porch it would elp to keep the wind and snow hout but i aint complainin sir  ive ony too good reason to be thankful  dear miss matilda said the old nurse dusting a wooden chair with her apron and beaming all over with joy its good for sore eyes to see you  dont mind the childn miss an do sit down near the fire  im sure your feet must be wetsuch dreadful weather  no indeed nursethank you said miss westlake laughing as she sat down my feet are not a bit wet  the frost is so hard that everything is quite dry  now its no use to tell me that miss matty said mrs butts with the memory of nursing days strong upon her  you was always such a dear thoughtless child  dont you remember that day when you waded in babys bath an then said you wasnt wet a bit only a very little an you rather liked it  indeed she did you neednt laugh master tom i remember it as well as if it happened yesterday  i dont in the least doubt you mrs butts said tom i was only laughing at my sisters idea of dryness  but you must not let us interrupt you in your cooking operations else we will go away directly just go about it as if we were not here for i have some business matters to talk over with your husband  go away echoed mrs butts you must not talk of going away till youve had a bite of lunch with us  its our dinner you know but lawks what do it matter what you calls it so long as youve got it to eat  an theres such a splendid apple dumplin in the pot miss you see its tommys birthday for he was born on a christmas day an hes very fond of apple dumplin is tommy  the six children of various ages and sizes scattered about the small room betrayed lively interest in this invitationsome hoping that it would be accepted others as evidently hoping that it would be declined as for tommy his fear that the dumpling would be too small for the occasion filled his heart with anxiety that showed itself strongly in his face but he was promptly relieved by miss matty assuring his mother that to stay was impossible as they had other visits to pay that day  thus the lady and nurse chatted of past and present days while tom westlake talked business with the docklabourer  you seem to be getting on pretty comfortably now remarked tom  yes sir thank god i am  ever since i was enabled to cry god be merciful to me a sinner things as gone well with me  an the puttin on o the blue ribbon sir as done me a power o good  you see before that i was sorely tempted by comrades offerin me a glass and by my own wish to ave a glass but when i mounted the blue i was let alone though they chaffed me now an then an i felt it was no use thinkin about it owever much i might wish for it  the missus bless er art sewed a bit o blue on my nightshirt in fun but dee know sir i do believe its that as cured me o dreamin about it as i used to do  im glad to hear that butts said tom with a laugh  now tell me how long is it since you tasted strong drink  six months this very day sir  and are you satisfied that you are better without it  better without it sir repeated butts with energy in course i am better in body and better in soul also in pocket  of course you know sir we dont carry on every day with such fires an dinners as were agoin in for todayfor christmas ony comes once a year and sometimes weve been slack at the docks an once or twice ive bin laid up so that weve bin pinched a bit now an then but weve bin able to make the two ends meet and the older childn is beginnin to turn in a penny now an again so you see sir though the fires aint always bright an jack frost do manage to git in through the key ole rather often just now on the whole were pretty comfortable  im glad to hear it butts very glad to hear it indeed said tom because im anxious to help you and i make it a point only to help those who help themselves  six months of steadiness goes a long way to prove that your craving for drink has been cured and that your reformation is genuine therefore i am able now to offer you a situation as porter in a bank which for some time i have kept open on purpose to be ready for you  how will that suit youeh  whatever david butts replied or meant to reply could only be gathered from his gratified expression for at that moment his voice was drowned by a shriek of delight from the youngest children in consequence of mrs butts at matildas request having removed the lid of the pot which held the dumpling and let out a deliciouslyscented cloud of steam  it was almost too much for the little ones whose mouths watered with anticipation and who felt half inclined to lay violent hands on the pot and begin dinner without delay  now i know by the smell that it is quite ready so we will say goodbye at once said matilda getting up with a smile and drawing her warm cloak round her  be sure to send your eldest girl to me tomorrow along with your husband  and come early butts said tom westlake buttoning up his coat  you may depend on me sir  stand by to shut the door quickly after us added tom as he grasped the handle else the wind will get in and blow the fire about  the brother and sister being young and active were pretty smart in making their exit and david butts being used to doors was not slow to shut his own but they could not altogether baffle the colonel for he was waiting outside  indeed he had been whistling with furious insolence through the keyhole all the time of the visit  sliding in edgewise at the moment of opening he managed to scatter the ashes again and whirl about some of the light articles before he was fairly expelled  thereafter along with his father and brother he went riotously after tom and matilda westlake sometimes shrieking over their heads now and then dashing on in front and whirling round in an eddy plunging straight back into their faces but they could make nothing of it  the brother and sister merely laughed at them and defied them to do their worst even in the joy of their hearts going the length of saying to several utter but beaming strangers that it was splendid christmas weather  and so it wasto the young and strong  not so alas to the old and feeble  it almost seemed as if colonel wind and major snow had taken offence at this last sally for about that time of the day they forsook their father and left londonprobably to visit the country  at all events the clouds cleared away the sky became blue and the sun shone out gloriouslythough without perceptibly diminishing the frost  after spending another hour or two in paying visits during which they passed abruptly more than once from povertystricken scenes of moderate mirth to abodes of sickness and desolation tom and matilda by means of bus and cab at last found themselves in the neighbourhood of the serpentine  what say you to a turn on the ice matty  charming cried matty  society on the serpentine when frozen over is not very select but the brother and sister were not particular on that point just then  they hired skates they skimmed about over the wellswept surface they tripped over innumerable bits of stick or stone or orangepeel they ran into or were run into by various beings whose wrongheadedness induced a preference for skating backwards  in short they conducted themselves as people usually do on skates and returned home pretty well exhausted and blooming  that evening after a family dinner at which a number of young cousins and other relatives were present tom and his sister left the festive circle round the fire and retired to a glass conservatory opening out of the drawingroom  there was a sofa in it and there they found ned westlake extended at full length  he rose at once and made room for them  well ned how have you enjoyed yourself today asked tom  oh splendidly  there was such a jolly party in whartons grounds most of them able to skate splendidly  the pond is so sheltered that the wind scarcely affected us and a staff of sweepers cleared away the snow as fast as it fell  afterwards when it cleared up and the sun shone through the trees it was absolutely magnificent  its the jolliest day ive had on the ice for years though im almost knocked up by it  jovially fatigued in fact  but where have you been  we also have been skating said matilda  indeed  i thought you had intended to spend the day somewhere in the eastend attending some of those free breakfasts and visiting the poor or something of that sortas if there were not enough of city missionaries and sisters of mercy or charity or whatever you call them to look after such things  you are right ned said tom such was our intention and we carried it out too  it was only at the end of the day that we took to skating on the serpentine and considering the number of people we have run into or overturned or tumbled over we found a couple of hours of it quite sufficient  from this point tom westlake harked back and related his experiences of the day  he possessed considerable power of graphic delineation and gradually aroused the interest of his gay and volatile but kindlydisposed brother  ned said he at last do you really believe in the truth of these words blessed are they that consider the poor  yes tom i do replied ned becoming suddenly serious  what tom said to his brother after that we will not relate but the result was that before that christmas evening closed he succeeded in convincing ned that a day of jolly good fun may be rendered inexpressibly more jolly by being commenced with an effort to cheer and lighten the lot of those into whose sad lives there enter but a small amount of jollity and far too little fun    story three chapter 1  a double rescueintroduction  it is a curious and interesting fact that christmastide seemed to have a peculiar influence on the prospects of our hero jack matterby all through his life  all the chief events of his career somehow happened on or about christmas day  jack was born to begin with on a christmas morning  his father who was a farmer in the middle ranks of life rejoiced in the fact esteeming it full of promise for the future  so did his mother  jack himself did not at first seem to have any particular feeling on the subject  if one might judge his opinions by his conduct it seemed that he was rather displeased than otherwise at having been born for he spent all the first part of his natal day in squalling and making faces as though he did not like the world at all and would rather not have come into it  john dear said his mother to his father one day not long after his birth im so glad he is a boy  he might have been a girl you know  no molly he could never have been a girl replied the husband as he gently patted his wifes shoulder  now dont laugh at me john dear  you know what i mean  but what shall we call him  john of course replied the farmer with decision  my father was called john and his father was called john and also his grandfather and so on back i have no doubt to the very beginning of time  nay john returned his wife simply that could hardly be for however many of your ancestors may have been johns the first you know was adam  why molly youre getting to be quite sharp returned the farmer nevertheless this little man is to be john like the rest of us  mrs matterby being meek gave in but she did so with a sigh for she wished the little one to be named joseph after her own deceased father  thus it came to pass that the child was named john  the name was expanded to johnny during the first period of childhood  afterwards it was contracted to jack and did not attain to the simple grandeur of john till the owner of it became a man  in the johnny period of life our hero confined his attention almost exclusively to smashing and overturning  to overturn and to destroy were his chief amusements  he made war on crockery to such an extent that teacups and saucers were usually scarce in the family  he assaulted lookingglasses so constantly that there was ere long barely enough of mirror left for his father to shave in  as to which fact the farmer used to say never mind molly  dont look so downhearted lass  if he only leaves a bit enough to see a corner of my chin and the half of my razor that will do well enough  no window in the family mansion was thoroughly whole and the appearance of a fat little fist on the wrong side of a pane of glass was quite a familiar object in the nursery  as for toysjohnny had none so to speak  he had only a large basket full of bits the misapplication of which to each other gave him many hours of profound recreation  everything that would turn inside out was so turned  whatever was by nature straight he bent whatever bent he straightened  round things he made square when possible and square things round soft things hard and hard things soft  in short nothing was too hard for johnny  everything that came into his clutches was subjected to what we may style the influence of experimental philosophy and if farmer matterby had been a poor man he must soon have been ruined but being what is styled welltodo he only said in reference to these things  go ahead my boy  make hay while the sun shines  if you carry on as youve begun youll make your mark somewhere in this world  alas remarked poor mrs matterby he has made his mark already everywhere and that a little too freely  nevertheless she was proud of her boy and sought to subdue his spirit by teaching him lessons of selfdenial and love out of the word of god johnny listened intently to these lessons gazing with large wondering eyes though he understood little of the teaching at first  it was not all lost on him however and he thoroughly understood and reciprocated the deep love that beamed in his mothers eyes  soon after johnny had slid into the jack period of life he became acquainted with a fisherboy of his own age whose parents dwelt in a cottage on the seashore not a quarter of a mile from his own home and close to the village of blackby  natty grove was as fine a little fellow as one could wish to see fair curlyheaded blueeyed roughjacketed and almost swallowed up in a pair of his fathers seaboots which had been cut down in the legs to fit him  as to the feetwell as his father ned grove remarked there was plenty of room for growth  natty had no mother but he had a little sister about three years of age and a grandmother who might have been about thirty times three  no one could tell her age for certain but she was so old and wrinkled and dried up and withered and small that she might certainly have claimed to be the oldest inhabitant  she had been bedridden for many years because of what her son called rummatticks and her grandson styled rumticks  the name of nattys little sister was nellie that of his grandmother nellold nell as people affectionately called her  now it may perhaps surprise the reader to be told that jack matterby at the age of nine years was deeply in love  he had indeed been in that condition more or less from the age of three but the passion became more decided at nine  he was in love with nellnot blueeyed little nellie but with wrinkled old nell for that antiquated creature was brimming over with love to mankind specially to children  on our hero she poured out such wealth of affection that he was powerfully attracted to her even in the period of johnnyhood and as we have said she captured him entirely when he reached jackhood  old nell was a splendid storyteller  that was one of the baits with which she was fond of hooking young people  it was interesting to sit in the fishermans poor cottage and watch the little ones sitting openmouthed and eyed gazing at the withered little face in which lovingkindness mingling with fun beamed from the old eyes played among the wrinkles smiled on the lips and asserted itself in the gentle tones  jack said mrs matterby on the christmas morning which ushered in her boys ninth birthday come im going to give you a treat today  you always do mammy on my birthdays said jack  i want you to go with a message to a poor woman continued the mother  is that all exclaimed jack with a disappointed look  yes thats allor nearly all replied his mother with a twinkle in her eye however which kept her son from open rebellion  i want you to carry this basket of good things with my best love and christmas goodwishes to old nell grove  oho exclaimed jack brightening up at once im your man here give me the basket  but mother he added with a sudden look of perplexity you called old nell a poor woman and ive heard her sometimes say that she has everything that she needs and more than she deserves she cant be poor if thats true and it must be true for you know that old nell never never tells lies  true jack old nell is not poor in one sense she is rich in faith she has got contentment with godliness and many rich people have not got that  nevertheless she has none too much of the necessaries of this life and none at all of the luxuries so that she is what people usually call poor  thats a puzzler mammypoor and rich both  i daresay it is a puzzler replied mrs matterby with a laugh but be off with your basket and message my son some day you shall understand it better  pondering deeply on this puzzler the boy went off on his mission trudging through the deep snow which whitened the earth and brightened that christmas morning  shes as merry as a cricket today said natty grove who opened the cottage door when his friend knocked  yes as erry as a kiket echoed flaxenhaired nellie who stood beside him  shes always erry said jack giving the little girl a gentle pull of the nose by way of expressing good will  a merry christmas both  how are you  see here what mother has sent to old nell  he opened the lid of the basket  nattie and nellie peeped in and snuffed  oh  i say said the fisherboy  he could say no more for the sight and scent of apples jelly roast fowl homemade pastry and other things was almost too much for him  i expected it dearie said old nell extending her withered hand to the boy as he set the basket on the table  every christmas morning for years gone by she has sent me the same though i dont deserve it and ive no claim on her but helplessness  but its the first time she has sent it by you jack  come ill tell ye a story  jack was already openeyed with expectancy and he was soon openmouthed forgetful of past and future absorbed entirely in the present  natty and nelly were similarly affected and likeminded while the little old woman swept them away to the wilds of siberia and told them of an escape from unjust banishment of wanderings in the icy wilderness and of starvation so dire that the fugitives were reduced to gnawing and sucking the leathern covers of their wallets for dear life  then she told of food sent at the last moment almost by miracle and of hairbreadth escapes and final deliverance  somehowthe listeners could not have told howold nell inserted a reference to the real miracle of jesus feeding the five thousand and she worked round to it so deftly that it seemed an essential part of the story and so indeed it was for nell intended the keystone of the arch of her story to be the fact that when man is reduced to the last extremity god steps in to save  it is certain that little nellie did not understand the moral of the story and it is uncertain how far the boys appreciated it but it was old nells business to sow the seed beside all waters and leave the rest to him who gave the command  yes dearies she said in conclusion laying her hand on the basket i expected this gift this morning but many a time does our father in heaven send a blessin when an where we dont expect it  mind thatmind ye that  jack had more than enough of mental food to digest that morning as he retraced his steps homeward through the deep snow for he found that old nell not less than his mother had treated him to a few puzzlers  poor boy he little knew as he plodded on that he was that day about to enter into one of the darkest clouds of his young life  during his absence a letter had been received by his father intimating that through the failure of a bank he was a ruined man  the shock had paralysed the farmer and when jack entered his home he found him lying on his bed in a state of insensibility from which he could not be rallied  a few days later the old man died  farmer matterbys widow had few relatives and none of these were in circumstances to help her in the day of trial  they and her numerous friends did indeed what they could  besides offering sincere sympathy they subscribed and raised a small sum to enable the bereaved woman and her only child to tide over present difficulties but they could not enable her to continue to work the farm and as most of her late husbands kindred had migrated to canada she had no one from whom she could naturally claim counsel or aid  she was therefore thrown entirely on god and it was with strange and solemn feelings that jack kneeled by her side and heard her pray in tones of anguish for help light and guidance and especially that whatever might become of herself her dear boy might be preserved from evil and guided in ways of righteousness  a few months later and the widow gathering the small remnant of her possessions together set off with her little boy to seek employment in london  how many poor souls in various ranks of life must have turned their steps in days gone by towards that giant city in the sanguine hope of bettering their condition  mrs matterby had no friends to whom she could go in london but she could paint and draw and sing and was fairly educated  she would teach  in the meantime she had a little money to start with  entertaining a suspicion that it might be considered a wildish scheme by her friends and neighbours she resolved to say nothing about her plans to any one save that she was going to london for a time  it was a touching scene the parting of jack and the grove family  the sturdy fisherman was at sea at the time but old nell was in her accustomed corner in the lowly bed with the ragged counterpane where her uneventful yet happy life was spent and little curlyheaded nellie was there playing with the cat and natty was there cutting out a firstrate man of war with a huge knife  granny jack always called her granny like the rest granny ive come to say goodbye  i am going away fffor ever an ever  amen responded natty from the mere force of habit for he was a constant responder at grannys family worship  ye dont know that darlin replied old nell  the lord leads us in ways that we know not an it may be his good pleasure to bring you here again  nno im quite sure ill never see you again returned the boy giving way to the sobs which he could not restrain  mmother says we will never come back againnnever never more  he broke down entirely at this point and a few silent tears trickled over the kind old face of nell  natty was too much of a man to give way out and out but he snivelled a little in spite of himself  as for nellie she stood there in openeyed wonder for she failed to quite understand the situation  we will not prolong the painful scene  when at length jack had taken leave of them allhad kissed the two nells and shaken hands with nattythe younger nell seemed to realise the facts of the case for jack saw her as he glanced back for the last time suddenly shut her large blue eyes throw back her curly little head open wide her pretty little mouth and howl miserably    story three chapter 2  lost in london  london in a fog is too well known to require description  in an uncommonly thick fog on a day in december of the following year mrs matterby hurried along fleet street in the direction of the city leading jack by the hand  both were very wet very cold ravenously hungry and rather poorly clad  it was evident that things had not prospered with the widow  dear jack she said in a choking voice as they hurried along the streets towards the wretched abode in the tower hamlets to which they had been at length reduced dear jack my last human hope has failed mr block has told me that i need not go there again he has no more work for me  jacks experience of life was too limited to enable him to understand fully the depth of distress to which his mother had fallenwith health broken money expended and work not to be had except on terms which rendered life a misery and prolonged existence almost an impossibility but jacks power of sympathy was strong and his passions were vehement  mother he said with tearful eyes as he clung closer to her side i would kill mr block if i could  hush dear boy  you know that would be wrong and could do no good  it is sinful even to feel such a desire  how can i help it mother returned jack indignantly  then he asked what are we going to do now mother  for some time the poor widow did not reply then she spoke in a low tone as if murmuring to herself the last sixpence gone the cupboard empty nothingnothing left to pawn  she stopped short and glanced hastily at her marriage ring  mother said jack have you not often told me that god will not forsake us  does it not seem as if he had forsaken us now  it only seems like it darling returned the widow hurriedly  we dont understand his ways  though he slay me yet will i trust him  it seemed as if god were about to test the faith of his servant for at that moment a cab drove furiously round the corner of a street and knocked her down  jack was overturned at the same time  recovering himself instantly he found his mother in a state of unconsciousness with blood flowing from a deep cut in her forehead  in a state of semibewilderment the poor boy followed the stretcher on which mrs matterby was carried to the nearest hospital where he waited while his mothers injuries were examined  my boy said a young surgeon returning to the waiting room and patting jacks head your mother has been rather badly hurt  we must keep her here to look after her  i daresay we shall soon make her well meanwhile you had better run home and tell your fatherif that is your father is at home i suppose  no sir fathers dead  well then your sister or aunti suppose theres some relative at home older than yourself  no sir none but mother an me whispered jack  no relations of any kind at all in london  none sir  we know nobodyat least not many and theyre all strangers  a sad case murmured the surgeon  your mother is poor i suppose  very poor sir  but of course you have a home of some sort somewhere  yes its not far from here  well them youd better go home just now for you cant see your mother tonight  we dare not let her speak but come back early tomorrow and you shall hear about herperhaps see her  here put that in your pocket  poor jack took the shilling which the sympathetic surgeon thrust into his hand and ran home in a state bordering on distraction but it was not till he entered the shabby little room which he had begun to consider home that he realised the full weight of the calamity that had befallen him  no mothers voice to welcome him no bit of fire in the grate to warm no singing kettle to cheer or light of candle to dispel the gloom of rapidly approaching night  it was christmas day too  in the morning he had gone forth with his mothershe in the sanguine hope of renewing an engagement in a clothiers shop which terminated that day he in the expectation of getting a few jobs of some sortmessages to run or horses to hold such were the circumstances to which they had been reduced in twelve months jack had arranged to call for his mother and walk home with her on the way they were to invest a very small part of the widows earnings in something nice for their christmas supper and spend the evening together chatting about the old home in blackby and father and natty grove and nellie and old nell in the happy days gone by  and now thought jack seating himself on his little bed and glancing at that of his mother which stood empty in the opposite cornernow  but jack could think no more  a tremendous agony rent his breast and a sharp cry escaped from him as he flung himself on his bed and burst into a passion of tears  childlike he sobbed himself to sleep and did not awake till the sun was high next morning  it was some time before he could recall what had occurred  when he did so he began to weep afresh  leaping up he was about to rush out of the house and make for the hospital when he was checked at the door by the landlorda hard grinding heartless man who grew rich in oppressing the poor  you seem to be in a hurry youngster he said dragging the boy back by the collar and looking hurriedly round the room  ive come for the rent  wheres your mother  in a sobbing voice jack told him about the accident  well i dont really believe you said the man with an angry frown but ill soon find out if youre telling lies  ill go to the hospital and inquire for myself  dee know anything about your mothers affairs  no sir said jack meekly for he began to entertain a vague terror of the man  no i thought not  well ill enlighten you  your mother owes me three weeks rent of this here room and has got nothing to pay it with as far as i knows except these sticks o furniture  now if your mother is really in hospital ill come back here and bundle you out an sell the furniture to pay my rent  i aint agoin to be done out o my money because your mother chooses to git rund over  the landlord did not wait for a reply but went out and slammed the door  jack followed him in silent horror  he watched him while he inquired at the gate of the hospital and after he had gone went up timidly rang the bell and asked for his mother  mrs matterby repeated the porter  come in ill make inquiry  the report which he brought back fell like the blow of a sledgehammer on the poor boys heart  his mother they told him was dead  she had died suddenly in the night  there are times of affliction when the human soul fails to find relief in tears or cries  poor jack matterby stood for some time motionless as if paralysed with glaring eyes and a face not unlike to that of death  they sought to rouse him but he could not speak  suddenly observing the front door open he darted out into the street and ran straight home where he flung himself on his mothers bed and burst into an uncontrollable flood of tears  by degrees the passion subsided leaving only a stunned feeling behind under the influence of which he lay perfectly still  the first thing that roused him was the sound of a heavy foot on the stair  the memory of the landlord flashed into his mind and filled him with indescribable dreaddread caused partly by the mans savage aspect and nature but much more by the brutal way in which he had spoken about his mother  the only way in which to avoid a meeting was to rush past the man on the stair  fear and loathing made the poor boy forget for the moment his crushing sorrow  he leaped up opened the door and dashing downstairs almost overturned the man who was coming up  once in the street he ran straight on without thought until he felt that he was safe from pursuit  then he stopped and sat down on a doorstepto think what he should do for having been told that the furniture of his old home was to be sold and himself turned out he felt that returning there would be useless and would only expose him to the risk of meeting the awful landlord  while he was yet buried in thought one of those sprightly creatures of the great city known as street arabs accosted him in a grave and friendly tone  my sweet little toolip he said can i do anythink for you  despite his grief jack could scarcely forbear smiling at the absurdity of the question  no thank you he replied  well now look ere my toolip returned the arab in a confidential tone ive took quite a fancy to you youve got such a look someow of my poor old grandmother  now if youve no objection id like to give you your breakfast  youre ungry i suppose  jack admitted that he was and after a moments hesitation accepted this surprisingly kind and liberal offer  taking him promptly by the arm his new friend hurried him to a pastrycooks shop and bade him smell that referring to the odours that ascended through a grating  aint it eavenly he asked with sparkling eyes  jack admitted that it was very nice  so green an yet so fair murmured the arab casting a look of admiration on his companion  now i means to go into that there shop he added returning to the confidential tone an buy breakfast for youfor both on us  but i couldnt go in you know with this ere shabby coat on cause they wouldnt give me such good wittles if i did just change coats with me for a few minutes  what  you doubt me  no one ever doubted bob snobbins withoutwithout aurtin of his feelins  whatever might have caused jack to hesitate the injured look on young snobbins countenance and the hurt tone were too much for him  he exchanged coats with the young rascal who suddenly directing jacks attention to some imaginary object of interest at one end of the street made off at full speed towards the other end  our hero was however a famous runner  he gave chase caught the arab in a retired alley and gave him an indignant punch in the head  but although jack had plenty of courage and a good deal of strength he was no match for a street warrior like bob snobbins who turned about promptly blackened both his opponents eyes bled his nose swelled his lips and finally knocked him into a pool of dirty water after which he fled just as a policeman came on the scene  the constable was a kindly man  he asked jack a few questions which however the latter was too miserable to answer  well well my boy said the constable gently youd as well give up fightin  it dont pay you see in the long run  besides you dont seem fit for it  cut away home now and get your mother to clean you  this last remark caused jack to run away fast enough with a bursting heart  all day he wandered about the crowded streets and no one took any notice of him save a very few among the thousands who cast on him a passing glance of pity  but what could these do to help him  were not the streets swarming with such boys  and in truth jack matterby was a very pitiable object at least according to the report of shopmirrors which told him that his face was discoloured and bloody his coat indescribably dirty and ragged besides being out of harmony with his trousers and that his person generally was bedaubed with mud  hunger at last induced him to overcome his feelings of shame so far that he entered a bakers shop but he was promptly ordered to be off  later in the day he entered another shop the owner of which seemed to be of a better disposition  changing his shilling he purchased a penny roll with which he retired to a dark passage and dined  when night came on he expended another penny and supped after which he sought for some place of shelter in which to sleep  but wherever he went he found the guardians of the public requiring him to move on several street arabs sought to make his acquaintance but with the memory of bob snobbins strong upon him he declined their friendship at last wearied out and brokenhearted he found a quiet corner under an archway where he sat down and leaned his head against the wall exclaiming im lostlost  then he wept quietly and sought to find temporary relief in slumber  he was indeed lost and more completely so in the feeling of lonely isolation perhaps than he would have been if lost in the backwoods of america  yet he was not utterly lost for the tender shepherd was on his track  some such thought seemed to cross his mind for he suddenly began to pray and thoughts about the old home in blackby and of the grove family comforted him a little until he fell asleep on his hard bed  but for the time being the poor boy was lostlost in london  his disreputable face and discreditable coat argued a dissipated character hence no one would employ him  ere long necessity compelled him to accept the society of street arabs and soon he became quite as sharp though not quite as wicked as they  but day by day he sank lower and lower and evil at which he would have shuddered at first became at last familiar  he did not sink without a struggle however and he would have returned to the place where his mother had died to ask help of the young surgeon who had expressed sympathy with him but with the carelessness of boyhood he had forgotten the name of the hospital and did not know where in the great wilderness of bricks and mortar to search for it as for the home from which he had fled the memory of the landlord still kept him carefully clear of that  but jacks mother was not dead  in hospitalsas in the best of wellregulated familiesmistakes will sometimes happen  the report which had proved so disastrous to our poor hero referred to another woman who had died  a messenger had been at once sent by the young surgeon before mentioned to tell jack of the error but when the messenger arrived the boy had flownas already described  indeed it was he whom jack had passed on the stair  it was long before mrs matterby recovered for the disappearance of her boy caused a relapse and when at last she left the hospital feeble and homeless she went about for many months searching at once for work and for her lost treasure  christmas came again and found jack matterby at nearly the lowest point in his downward career  it is due to him to say however that he had not up to that time been guilty of any criminal act that could bring him with the grasp of human law but in word and deed he had begun more and more to break the law of god so that if poor mrs matterby had at that time succeeded in finding her son it is probable that her joy would have been overwhelmed with terrible grief  it was not exactly christmas morning but it was the christmas season of the year when our little hero wearied in spirit and body with the hard struggle for life sauntered down the now familiar strand in the hope of finding some odd job to do  he paused before a confectioners shop and being very hungry was debating with himself the propriety of giving up the struggle and coolly helping himself to a pie  you may be sure that bad invisible spirits were at his elbow just then to encourage him  but god sent a good angel also and she was visiblebeing in the form of a thin little old lady  youd like a bun i know she said putting a penny into jacks hand  god bless you maamyes burst from the astonished boy  go in and buy one  then come and tell me all about you  the thin little old lady was one of those followers of the lamb who do not wait for christmas to unlock their sympathies  the river of her love and pity was always overflowing so that there was no room for increase to a deluge at christmas timethough she rejoiced to note the increase in the case of others and wished that the flood might become perennial  to this lady jack laid bare his inmost heart and she led him back to the saviour  now jack let me ask you one question she said would you like to go to canada  with tremendous energy jack answered wouldnt i  then said the old lady to canada you shall go    story three chapter 3  the double rescue  and jack matterby went  but before he went he had to go through a preliminary training for his regular schooling had ceased when his father died and he had learned no trade  in those days there were no splendid institutions for waifs and strays such as now exist but it must not be supposed that there was no such thing as hasting to the rescue  thin little old mrs seaford had struck out the idea for herself and had acted on it for some years in her own vigorous way  she took jack home and lodged him in her own house with two or three other boys of the same stampwaifs  jack elected to learn the trade of a carpenter and mrs seaford finding that he had been pretty well grounded in english taught him french as that language she told him was much spoken in canada  above all she taught him those principles of gods law without which a human being is but poorly furnished even for the life that now is to say nothing of that which is to come  in a few months jack was ready for exportation  a few months more and he found himself apprenticed to a farmer not far from the shores of that mighty freshwater sea ontario  time passed and jack matterby became a trusted servant and a thorough farmer  he also became a big dashing and earnest boy  more time passed and jack became a handsome young man the bosom friend of his employer  yet a little more time winged its silent way and jack became john matterby esquire of fair creek farm heir to his former masters property and one of the wealthiest men of the provincenot a common experience of poor emigrant waifs doubtless but on the other hand by no means unprecedented  it must not be supposed that during all those years jack forgot the scenes and people of the old land  on the contrary the longer he absented himself from the old home the more firmly and tenderly did the old memories cling and cluster round his heart and many a story and anecdote did he relate about these especially during the christmas season of each year to his old master and to nancy briggs in the log homestead of ontario  nancy was a waif who had been sent out by the same thin little old lady who had sent jack out  she was very pretty and possessed of delightfully amiable domestic qualities  she grew up to be a very handsome girl and was a very bright sunbeam in the homestead  but jack did not fall in love with her  all unknown to himself his heart was preoccupied  neither did nancy fall in love with jack  all unwittingly she was reserving herself for another lot  of course our hero corresponded diligently with the thin little old lady and gladdened her heart by showing and expressing strong sympathy with the waifs of the great city more than once in his earlier letters mentioning one named bob snobbins about whose fate he felt some curiosity but in regard to whose home if such existed he could give no information  twice during those years jack also wrote to the grove family but as he received no answer on either occasion he concluded that the father must have been drowned that old nell was dead and the family broken up need we add that the memory of his dear mother never faded or grew dim but this was a sacred memory in regard to which he opened his lips to no one  at last there came a day when john matterby being in the prime of life with ample means and time to spare set his heart on a holiday and a visit to the old countrythe thin little old lady being yet alive  it was not so easy however for our hero to get away from home as one might imagine for besides being a farmer he was manager of a branch bank secretary to several philanthropic societies superintendent of a sundayschool and generally a helper of and sympathiser with all who loved the lord and sought to benefit their fellowmen  but being a man of resolution he cut the cords that attached him to these things appointed miss briggs to superintend the sundayschool in his absence and set sail for englandnot in a steamer as most rich men would have done but in a sailing ship because the vessel happened to be bound for the port of blackby the home of his childhood  it was winter when he set sail and the storms of winter were having high jinks and revels on the deep in the usual way at that season of the year  jacks vessel weathered them all till it reached the shores of old england  then the stormfiend broke loose with unwonted fury and as if out of spite cast the good ship on the rocks lying a little to the eastward of the port of blackby  it was a tremendous storm  the oldest inhabitant of blackby said as well as his toothless gums would let him that it wos the wust gale as had blowd since he wos a leetle booyan that warnt yesterdayno nor yet the day before  the gale was at its height in the grey of early morning when the ship struck and all the manhood of the port and neighbouring village were out to render aid if possible and to gaze and sympathise  but who could render aid to a vessel which was rolling on those black rocks in a caldron of white foam with a hundred yards of swirling breakers that raged and roared like a thousand lions between it and the base of the cliffs  even the noble lifeboat would have been useless in such a place  but hark a cry is raisedthe coastguardmen and the rocket yes there is one hope for them yetunder god  far below the men are seen staggering along over the shingle with their lifesaving apparatus in a handcart  soon the tripod is set up and the rocket is fired but the line falls to leeward  another is tried it falls short  still anotherit goes far to windward  again and again they try but without success until all their rockets are expended  but these bold men of the coastguard are not often or easily foiled  they send for more rockets to the next station  meanwhile the terrible waves are doing their awful work dashing the ship on the rocks as if she were a mere toyas indeed she is in their grasp  can nothing be done  shell never hold together till the rockets come said a young seaman stepping out from the crowd  here let me have the line and stand by to pay out  dont try it lad itll be your death  the youth paid no regard to this advice  a man can only die once he remarked in a low voice more as if speaking to himself than replying to the caution while he quickly tied the end of the light rope round his waist and dashed into the sea  oh it is grand and heartstirring to see a stalwart youth imperilling life and limb for the sake of others to see a powerful swimmer breasting the billows with a fixed purpose to do or die  but it is terrible and spiritcrushing to see such a one tossed by the breakers as if he were a mere baby and hurled back helpless on the sand  twice did the young sailor dash in and twice was he caught up like a cork and hurled back while the people on shore finding their remonstrances useless began to talk of using force  the mans object was to dive through the first wave  if he could manage thisand the secondthe rest would not be beyond the power of a strong man  a third time he leaped into the rushing flood and this time was successful  soon he stood panting on the deck of the stranded vessel almost unable to stand and well he knew that there was not a moment to lose for the ship was going to pieces  jack matterby however knew well what to do  he drew out the hawser of the rocket apparatus fixed the various ropes and signalled to those on shore to send out the sling lifebuoy and then the men of the coastguard began to haul the passengers and crew ashore one at a time  the young sailor recovering in a few minutes lent a hand  jack knew him the instant he heard his voice but took no notice of him for it was a stern matter of life or death with them all just then  when jack and the captain stood at last awaiting their turn and watching the last of the crew being dragged over the boiling surf our hero turned suddenly and grasping the young sailors hand with the grip of a vice said god bless you natty grove  nat gazed as if he had been stunned  can it be he exclaimed  we had thought you dead years ago  thank god im not only alive but hearty  here comes the lifebuoy your turn next  but one word beforeold nell andnellie  both well and living with your mother  my jack could not speak a tremendous shock seemed to rend his heart  young grove felt that he had been too precipitate  your mother is alive jack and  he stopped for the captain said quickly now then get in  no time to lose  but jack could not get in  if he had not been a strong man he must have fallen on the deck  as it was he felt stunned and helpless  here captain cried nat grove leaping into the lifebuoy lift him into my arms  the ropes are strong enough for both  scarce knowing what he did jack allowed himself to be halflifted into the buoy in which his old friend held him fast  a few minutes more and they were dragged safely to land and the ringing cheers and congratulations of the assembled multitude  the captain came last so that when the ship finally went to pieces not a human life was lost even the ships cat was among the number of the saved the captain having carried it ashore in his arms  now there are some scenes in this life which will not bear description in detail  such was the meeting of our hero with his longlost mother we refrain from lifting the curtain here  but there is no reason why we should not reintroduce the joyful and grateful pair at a later period of that same eventful day when seated together by the bedside of old nell they recounted their experiencesyes the same old woman but thinner and wrinkleder and smaller in every way and the same bed as far as appearance went though softer and cosier and bigger in all ways  on the other side of the bed sat the manly form of natty grove but who is that fair girl with the curling golden hair whose face exhibits one continuous blush and whose entire body soul and spirit is apparently enchained by an insignificant piece of needlework  can that be nellie grove whom we last saw with her eyes shut and her mouth openhowling  yes it is she andbut let mrs matterby explain  now jack said that lady in a firm tone its of no use your asking question after question of every one in this way and not even waiting for answers and everybody speaking at once  excuse me dearest mother miss nellie grove has not yet spoken at all  miss nellie indeed  times are changedmurmured natty with a look of surprise  her not speaking proves her the wisest of us all resumed the widow looking at old nell who with tremulous head nodded violent approval you must know old nell had become as deaf as a post and being incapable of understanding anything she gratified her natural amiability by approving of everythingat least everything that was uttered by speakers with a visible smile  when they spoke with gravity old nell shook her tremulous head and put on a look of alarmingly solemn sympathy  on the present occasion however the antique old thing seemed to have been affected with some absolutely new and evidently quaint ideas for she laughed frequently and immoderately especially when she gazed hard at jack matterby after having looked long at nellie grove  now jack resumed the widow for the fiftieth time you must know that after i lost you and had given you up for dead i came back here feeling an intense longing to see once more the old home and i began a school  in course of years god sent me prosperity notwithstanding the murmurings of rebellion which rose in my heart when i thought of you the school became so big that i had to take a new housethat in which you now sitand sought about for a teacher to help me  long before that time poor ned grove had been drowned at sea  your old friend natty there had become the first mate to a merchantman and helped to support his grandmother  nellie whose education i had begun as you know when you were a boy had grown into a remarkably clever and pretty girl as no doubt you will admit  she had become a daily governess in the family of a gentleman who had come to live in the neighbourhood  thus she was enabled to assist her brother in keeping up the old home and took care of granny  at this point our hero as he looked at the fair face and modest carriage of his old playmate heartily admitted to himself that she was much more than pretty and felt that he now understood how a fishermans daughter had to his intense surprise grown up with so much of gentle manners and such soft ladylike hands  but he said never a word  most happily for me continued mrs matterby nellie lost her situation at the time i speak of owing to the death of her employer thus i had the chance of securing her at once  and now here we have been together for some years and i hope we may never part as long as we live  we had considerable difficulty in getting old nell to quit the cottage and come here  indeed we should never have succeeded i think had it not been for natty  thats true interrupted nat with a laugh  the dear old woman was too deaf to understand and too obstinate to move so one day i put the bed clothes over her head gathered her and them up in my arms and brought her up here bodily very much as i carried you ashore jack in the lifebuoy without asking leave  and she has been content and happy ever since  what more of this tale there is to tell shall be told reader by excerpts from our heros christmas letter to thin little mrs seaford as follows    pardon my seeming neglect dear old friend  i meant to have run up   to town to see you the instant i set foot in england but you must   admit that my dear longlost mother had prior claims  pardon also   my impudence in now asking you to come and see me  you must come   i will take no denial for i want you to rejoice at my wedding  yes   as old nell once said to me god sends us a blessing sometimes when   we least expect it  he has not only restored to me my mother but   has raised me from the lowest rung in the ladder to the very highest   and given me the sweetest and most  but enough  come and see for   yourself  her name is nellie  but i have more to astonish you with   not only do i take nellie back with me to my home in the new world   but i take my mother also and natty grove and old nell herself   how we got her to understand what we want her to do could not be told   in less than four hundred pages of small type  nat did it by means   of signs symbols and what he styles faciallogarithms  at all   events she has agreed to go and we hope to set sail next june   moreover i expect to get you to join us  dont laugh  i mean it   there is good work to be done  canada needs philanthropic christians   as well as england    you will scarcely credit me when i say that i have become a   matchmakernot one of those little ones in whose welfare you are   so much interested but a real one  my deep design is upon your   partner natty grove  yes your partnerfor were not you the   instrument used in rescuing my soul and he my body so that you   have been partners in this double rescue  well it is my intention to   introduce natty grove to nancy briggs and abide the result  once on   a time i had meant her for bob snobbins but as you have failed to   hunt him up he must be left to suffer the consequences  dyou know i   have quite a pathetic feeling of tenderness for the memory of that too   sharp little boy  little does he know how gladly i would give him the   best coat in my possessionif i could only find him    now dearest of old friends i must stop  nellie is sitting on one   side of me mother on the other and old nell in frontwhich will   account to you in some degree for the madness of my condition    once more in the hope of a joyful meeting i wish you a merry   christmas and a happy new year  the end
