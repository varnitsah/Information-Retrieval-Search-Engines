14594611	stories from the italian poets with lives of the writers   by leigh hunt    in two volumes vol i     mdcccxlvi     to sir percy shelley bart   my dear sir percy  as i know no man who surpasses yourself either in combining a love of the most romantic fiction with the coolest good sense or in passing from the driest metaphysical questions to the heartiest enjoyment of humouri trust that even a modesty so true as yours will not grudge me the satisfaction of inscribing these volumes with your name  that you should possess such varieties of taste is no wonder considering what an abundance of intellectual honours you inherit nor might the world have been the better for it had they been tastes and nothing more but that you should inherit also that zeal for justice to mankind which has become so christian a feature in the character of the age and that you should include in that zeal a special regard for the welfare of your fathers friend are subjects of constant pleasurable reflection to  your obliged and affectionate  leigh hunt    preface   the purpose of these volumes is to add to the stock of tales from the italian writers to retain as much of the poetry of the originals as it is in the power of the writers prose to compass and to furnish careful biographical notices of the authors there have been several collections of stories from the novellists of italy but none from the poets and it struck me that prose versions from these of the kind here offered to the public might not be unwillingly received the stories are selected from the five principal narrative poets dante pulci boiardo ariosto and tasso they comprise the most popular of such as are fit for translation are reduced into one continuous narrative when diffused and interrupted as in the instances of those of angelica and armida are accompanied with critical and explanatory notes and in the case of dante consist of an abstract of the poets whole work the volumes are furthermore interspersed with the most favourite morceaux of the originals followed sometimes with attempts to versify them and in the appendix for the furtherance of the study of the italian language are given entire stories also in the original and occasionally rendered in like manner the book is particularly intended for such students or other lovers of the language as are pleased with any fresh endeavours to recommend it and at the same time for such purely english readers as wish to know something about italian poetry without having leisure to cultivate its acquaintance  i did not intend in the first instance to depart from the plan of selection in the case of dante but when i considered what an extraordinary person he washow intense is every thing which he sayshow widely he has reattracted of late the attention of the worldhow willingly perhaps his poem might be regarded by the reader as being itself one continued story which in fact it is related personally of the writerand lastly what a combination of difficulties have prevented his best translators in verse from giving the public a just idea of his almost scriptural simplicityi began to think that an abstract of his entire work might possibly be looked upon as supplying something of a desideratum i am aware that nothing but verse can do perfect justice to verse but besides the imperfections which are pardonable because inevitable in all such metrical endeavours the desire to impress a grand and worshipful idea of dante has been too apt to lead his translators into a tone and manner the reverse of his passionate practical and creative stylea style which may be said to write things instead of words and thus to render every word that is put out of its place or brought in for help and filling up a misrepresentation i do not mean to say that he himself never does any thing of the sort or does not occasionally assume too much of the oracle and the schoolmaster in manner as well as matter but passion and the absence of the superfluous are the chief characteristics of his poetry fortunately this sincerity of purpose and utterance in dante render him the least pervertible of poets in a sincere prose translation and since i ventured on attempting one i have had the pleasure of meeting with an express recommendation of such a version in an early number of the edinburgh review1  the abstract of dante therefore in these volumes with every deprecation that becomes me of being supposed to pretend to give a thorough idea of any poetry whatsoever especially without its metrical form aspires to be regarded as at all events not exhibiting a false idea of the dantesque spirit in point of feeling and expression it is true i have omitted long tedious lectures of scholastic divinity and other learned absurdities of the time which are among the bars to the poems being read through even in italy which foscolo tells us is never the case and i have compressed the work in other passages not essentially necessary to the formation of a just idea of the author but quite enough remains to suggest it to the intelligent and in no instance have i made additions or alterations there is warranti hope i may say letterfor every thing put down dante is the greatest poet for intensity that ever lived and he excites a corresponding emotion in his readeri wish i could say always on the poets side but his ferocious hates and bigotries too often tempt us to hate the bigot and always compel us to take part with the fellowcreatures whom he outrages at least such is their effect on myself nor will he or his worshippers suffer us to criticise his faults with mere reference to the age in which he lived i should have been glad to do so but the claims made for him even by himself will not allow it we are called upon to look on him as a divine a prophet an oracle in all respects for all time such a man however is the last whom a reporter is inclined to misrepresent we respect his sincerity too much ferocious and arrogant though it be and we like to give him the full benefit of the recoil of his curses and maledictions i hope i have not omitted one on the other hand as little have i closed my feelings against the lovely and enchanting sweetness which this great semibarbarian sometimes so affectingly utters on those occasions he is like an angel enclosed for penance in some furious giant and permitted to weep through the creatures eyes  the stories from goodnatured pulci i have been obliged to compress for other reasonschiefly their excessive diffuseness a paragraph of the version will sometimes comprise many pages those of boiardo and ariosto are more exact and the reader will be good enough to bear in mind that nothing is added to any of the poets different as the case might seem here and there on comparison with the originals an equivalent for whatever is said is to be found in some part of the contextgenerally in letter always in spirit the least characteristically exact passages are some in the lovescenes of tasso for i have omitted the plays upon words and other corruptions in style in which that poet permitted himself to indulge but i have noticed the circumstance in the comment in other respects i have endeavoured to make my version convey some idea of the different styles and genius of the writersof the severe passion of dante of the overflowing gaiety and affecting sympathies of pulci several of whose passages in the battle of roncesvalles are masterpieces of pathos of the romantic and inventive elegance of boiardo the great cheerful universality of ariosto like a healthy anima mundi and the ambitious irritability the fairy imagination and tender but somewhat effeminate voluptuousness of the poet of armida and rinaldo i do not pretend that prose versions of passages from these writers can supersede the necessity of metrical ones supposing proper metrical ones attainable they suffice for them in some respects less than for dante the manner in their case being of more importance to the effect but with all due respect to such translators as harrington rose and wiffen their books are not ariosto and tasso even in manner harrington the gay godson of queen elizabeth is not always unlike ariosto but when not in good spirits he becomes as dull as if her majesty had frowned on him rose was a man of wit and a scholar yet he has undoubtedly turned the ease and animation of his original into inversion and insipidity and wiffen though elegant and even poetical did an unfortunate thing for tasso when he gave an additional line and a number of paraphrastic thoughts to a stanza already tending to the superfluous fairfax himself who upon the whole and with regard to a work of any length is the best metrical translator our language has seen and like chapman a genuine poet strangely aggravated the sins of prettiness and conceit in his original and added to them a love of tautology amounting to that of a lawyer as to hoole he is below criticism and other versions i have not happened to see now if i had no acquaintance with the italian language i confess i would rather get any friend who had to read to me a passage out of dante tasso or ariosto into the first simple prose that offered itself than go to any of the above translators for a taste of it fairfax excepted and we have seen with how much allowance his sample would have to be taken i have therefore with some restrictions only ventured to do for the public what i would have had a friend do for myself  the critical and biographical notices i did not intend to make so long at first but the interest grew upon me and i hope the reader will regard some of themdantes and tassos in particularas being stories themselves after their kindstories alas too true romances of real life the extraordinary character of dante which is personally mixed up with his writings beyond that of any other poet has led me into references to his church and creed unavoidable at any time in the endeavour to give a thorough estimate of his genius and singularly demanded by certain phenomena of the present day i hold those phenomena to be alike feeble and fugitive but only so by reason of their being openly so proclaimed for mankind have a tendency to the absurd if their imaginations are not properly directed and one of the uses of poetry is to keep the faculty in a healthy state and cause it to know its duties dante in the fierce egotism of his passions and the strange identification of his knowledge with all that was knowable would fain have made his poetry both a sword against individuals and a prop for the support of the superstition that corrupted them this was reversing the duty of a christian and a great man and there happen to be existing reasons why it is salutary to chew that he had no right to do so and must not have his barbarism confounded with his strength machiavelli was of opinion that if christianity had not reverted to its first principles by means of the poverty and pious lives of st francis and st dominic2 the faith would have been lost it may have been but such are not the secrets of its preservation in times of science and progression when the spirit of inquiry has established itself among all classes and nothing is taken for granted as it used to be a few persons here and there who confound a small superstitious reaction in england with the reverse of the fact all over the rest of europe may persuade themselves if they please that the world has not advanced in knowledge for the last three centuries and so get up and cry aloud to us out of obsolete hornbooks but the community laugh at them every body else is inquiring into first principles while they are dogmatising on a fortyninth proposition the irish themselves as they ought to do care more for their pastors than for the pope and if any body wishes to know what is thought of his holiness at headquarters let him consult the remarkable and admirable pamphlet which has lately issued from the pen of mr mazzini3 i have the pleasure of knowing excellent roman catholics i have suffered in behalf of their emancipation and would do so again tomorrow but i believe that if even their external form of christianity has any chance of survival three hundred years hence it will have been owing to the appearance meanwhile of some extraordinary man in power who in the teeth of worldly interests or rather in charitable and sage inclusion of them shall have proclaimed that the time had arrived for living in the flower of christian charity instead of the husks and thorns which may have been necessary to guard it if it were possible for some new and wonderful pope to make this change and draw a line between these two christian epochs like that between the old and new testaments the world would feel inclined to prostrate itself again and for ever at the feet of rome in a catholic state of things like that delighted should i be for one to be among the humblest of its communicants how beautiful would their organs be then how ascending to an unperplexing heaven their incense how unselfish their salvation how intelligible their talk about justice and love it would be far more easy however for the church of england to do this than the church of rome since the former would not feel itself hampered with pretensions to infallibility a church once reformed may reform itself again and again till it remove every blemish in the way of its perfection and god grant this may be the lot of the church of my native country its beautiful old ivied places of worship would then want no harmony of accordance with its gentle and tranquil scenery no completeness of attraction to the reflecting and the kind  but if charity and by charity i do not mean mere toleration or any other pretended right to permit others to have eyes like ourselves but whatever the delightful greek word implies of good and lovely if this truly and only divine consummation of all christian doctrine be not thought capable of taking a form of belief strong enough apart from threats that revolt alike the heart and the understanding superstition must look out for some new mode of dictation altogether for the world is outgrowing the old                                       i cannot in gratitude for the facilities afforded to myself as well as for a more obvious and public reason dismiss this preface without congratulating men of letters on the establishment and increasing prosperity of the london library an institution founded for the purpose of accommodating subscribers with such books at their own houses as could only be consulted hitherto at the british museum the sole objection to the museum is thus done away and the literary world has a fair prospect of possessing two bookinstitutions instead of one each with its distinct claims to regard and presenting in combination all that the student can wish for while it is highly desirable that authors should be able to have standard works at their command when sickness or other circumstances render it impossible for them to go to the museum it is undoubtedly requisite that one great collection should exist in which they are sure to find the same works unremoved in case of necessitynot to mention curious volumes of all sorts manuscripts and a world of books of reference   footnote 1 it is probable that a prose translation would give a better idea of the genius and manner of this poet than any metrical one vol i p 310  footnote 2 discorsi

lived in a semibarbarous age as favourable to the intensity of his imagination as it was otherwise to the rest of his pretensions party zeal and the fluctuations of moral and critical opinion have at different periods overrated and depreciated his memory and if in the following attempt to form its just estimate i have found myself compelled in some important respects to differ with preceding writers and to protest in particular against his being regarded as a proper teacher on any one point poetry excepted and as far as all such genius and energy cannot in some degree help being i have not been the less sensible of the wonderful nature of that genius while acting within the circle to which it belongs dante was indeed so great a poet and at the same time exhibited in his personal character such a mortifying exception to what we conceive to be the natural wisdom and temper of great poets in other words he was such a bigoted and exasperated man and sullied his imagination with so much that is contradictory to good feeling in matters divine as well as human that i should not have thought myself justified in assisting however humbly to extend the influence of his writings had i not believed a time to have arrived when the community may profit both from the marvels of his power and the melancholy absurdity of its contradictions  dante alighieri who has always been known by his christian rather than surname partly owing to the italian predilection for christian names and partly to the unsettled state of patronymics in his time was the son of a lawyer of good family in florence and was born in that city on the 14th of may 1265 sixtythree years before the birth of chaucer the stock is said to have been of roman origin of the race of the frangipani but the only certain trace of it is to cacciaguida a florentine cavalier of the house of the elisei who died in the crusades dante gives an account of him in his paradiso2 cacciaguida married a lady of the alighieri family of the valdipado and giving the name to one of his children they subsequently retained it as a patronymic in preference to their own it would appear from the same poem not only that the alighieri were the more important house but that some blot had darkened the scutcheon of the elisei perhaps their having been poor and transplanted as he seems to imply from some disreputable district perhaps they were known to have been of ignoble origin for in the course of one of his most philosophical treatises he bursts into an extraordinary ebullition of ferocity against such as adduce a knowledge of that kind as an argument against a familys acquired nobility affirming that such brutal stuff should be answered not with words but with the dagger3  the elisei however must have been of some standing for macchiavelli in his history of florence mentions them in his list of the early guelph and ghibelline parties where the side which they take is different from that of the poets immediate progenitors4 the arms of the alighieri probably occasioned by the change in that name for it was previously written aldighieri are interesting on account of their poetical and aspiring character they are a golden wing on a field azure5  it is generally supposed that the name dante is an abbreviation of durante but this is not certain though the poet had a nephew so called dante is the name he goes by in the gravest records in lawproceedings in his epitaph in the mention of him put by himself into the mouth of a blessed spirit boccaccio intimates that he was christened dante and derives the name from the ablative case of dans givinga probable etymology especially for a christian appellation as an abbreviation of durante it would correspond in familiarity with the ben of ben jonsona diminutive that would assuredly not have been used by grave people on occasions like those mentioned though a wit of the day gave the masons a shilling to carve o rare ben jonson on his grave stone on the other hand if given at the font the name of ben would have acquired all the legal gravity of benjamin in the english navy list not long ago one of our gallant admirals used to figure as billy douglas  of the mother of dante nothing is known except that she was his fathers second wife and that her christian name was bella or perhaps surname bello it might however be conjectured from the remarkable and only opportunity which our author has taken of alluding to her that he derived his disdainful character rather from his mother than father6 the father appears to have died during the boyhood of his illustrious son  the future poet before he had completed his ninth year conceived a romantic attachment to a little lady who had just entered hers and who has attained a celebrity of which she was destined to know nothing this was the famous beatrice portinari daughter of a rich florentine who founded more than one charitable institution she married another man and died in her youth but retained the platonical homage of her young admirer living and dead and became the heroine of his great poem  it is unpleasant to reduce any portion of a romance to the events of ordinary life but with the exception of those who merely copy from one another there has been such a conspiracy on the part of dantes biographers to overlook at least one disenchanting conclusion to be drawn to that effect from the poets own writings that the probable truth of the matter must here for the first time be stated the case indeed is clear enough from his account of it the natural tendencies of a poetical temperament oftener evinced in a like manner than the world in general suppose not only made the boypoet fall in love but in the truly elysian state of the heart at that innocent and adoring time of life made him fancy he had discovered a goddess in the object of his love and strength of purpose as well as imagination made him grow up in the fancy he disclosed himself as time advanced only by his mannerreceived complacent recognitions in company from the young ladyoffended her by seeming to devote himself to another see the poem in the vita nuova beginning ballata io vorendered himself the sport of her and her young friends by his adoring timidity see the 5th and 6th sonnets in the same workin short constituted her a paragon of perfection and enabled her by so doing to shew that she was none he says that finding himself unexpectedly near her one day in company he trembled so and underwent such change of countenance that many of the ladies present began to laugh with her about himsi gabbavano di me and he adds in verse    con laltre donne mia vista gabbate   e non pensate donna onde si mova   chio vi rassembri sì figura nova   quando riguardo la vostra beltate c          son 5  you laugh with the other ladies to see how i look literally you mock my appearance and do not think lady what it is that renders me so strange a figure at sight of your beauty  and in the sonnet that follows he accuses her of preventing pity of him in others by such killing mockery as makes him wish for death la pietà che l vostro gabbo recinde c7  now it is to be admitted that a young lady if she is not very wise may laugh at her lover with her companions and yet return his love after her fashion but the fair portinari laughs and marries another some less melancholy face some more intelligible courtship triumphed over the questionable flattery of the poets gratuitous worship and the idol of dante alighieri became the wife of messer simone de bardi not a word does he say on that mortifying point it transpired from a clause in her fathers will and yet so bent are the poets biographers on leaving a romantic doubt in ones mind whether beatrice may not have returned his passion that not only do all of them as far as i have observed agree in taking no notice of these sonnets but the author of the treatise entitled dante and the catholic philosophy of the thirteenth century in spite as a critic says of the beatrice his daughter wife of messer simone de bardi of the paternal will describes her as dying in all the lustre of virginity 8 the assumption appears to be thus gloriously stated as a counterpart to the notoriety of its untruth it must be acknowledged that dante himself gave the cue to it by more than silence for he not only vaunts her acquaintance in the next world but assumes that she returns his love in that region as if no such person as her husband could have existed or as if he himself had not been married also this lifelong pertinacity of will is illustrative of his whole career  meantime though the young poets father had died nothing was wanting on the part of his guardians or perhaps his mother to furnish him with an excellent education it was so complete as to enable him to become master of all the knowledge of his time and he added to this learning more than a taste for drawing and music he speaks of himself as drawing an angel in his tablets on the first anniversary of beatrices death9 one of his instructors was brunetto latini the most famous scholar then living and he studied both at the universities of padua and bologna at eighteen perhaps sooner he had shown such a genius for poetry as to attract the friendship of guido cavalcante a young noble of a philosophical as well as poetical turn of mind who has retained a reputation with posterity and it was probably at the same time he became acquainted with giotto who drew his likeness and with casella the musician whom he greets with so much tenderness in the other world  nor were his duties as a citizen forgotten the year before beatrices death he was at the battle of campaldino which his countrymen gained against the people of arezzo and the year after it he was present at the taking of caprona from the pisans it has been supposed that he once studied medicine with a view to it as a profession but the conjecture probably originated in nothing more than his having entered himself of one of the citycompanies which happened to be the medical for the purpose of qualifying himself to accept office a condition exacted of the gentry by the then democratic tendencies of the republic it is asserted also by an early commentator that he entered the franciscan order of friars but quitted it before he was professed and indeed the circumstance is not unlikely considering his agitated and impatient turn of mind perhaps he fancied that he had done with the world when it lost the wife of simone de bardi  weddings that might have taken place but do not are like the reigns of deceased heirsapparent every thing is assumable in their favour checked only by the histories of husbands and kings would the great but splenetic poet have made an angel and a saint of beatrice had he married her he never utters the name of the woman whom he did marry  gemma donati was a kinswoman of the powerful family of that name it seems not improbable from some passages in his works that she was the young lady whom he speaks of as taking pity on him on account of his passion for beatrice10 and in common justice to his feelings as a man and a gentleman it is surely to be concluded that he felt some sort of passion for his bride if not of a very spiritual sort though he afterwards did not scruple to intimate that he was ashamed of it and beatrice is made to rebuke him in the other world for thinking of any body after herself11 at any rate he probably roused what was excitable in his wifes temper with provocations from his own for the nature of the latter is not to be doubted whereas there is nothing but tradition to shew for the bitterness of hers foscolo is of opinion that the tradition itself arose simply from a rhetorical flourish of boccaccios in his life of dante against the marriages of men of letters though boccaccio himself expressly adds that he knows nothing to the disadvantage of the poets wife except that her husband after quitting florence would never either come where she was or suffer her to come to him mother as she was by him of so many childrena statement it must be confessed not a little encouraging to the tradition12 be this as it may dante married in his twentysixth year wrote an adoring account of his first love the vita nuova in his twentyeighth and among the six children which gemma brought him had a daughter whom he named beatrice in honour it is understood of the fair portinari which surely was either a very great compliment or no mean trial to the temper of the mother  we shall see presently how their domestic intercourse was interrupted and what absolute uncertainty there is respecting it except as far as conclusions may be drawn from his own temper and history  italy in those days was divided into the parties of guelphs and ghibellines the former the advocates of general churchascendancy and local government the latter of the pretensions of the emperor of germany who claimed to be the roman cæsar and paramount over the pope in florence the guelphs had for a long time been so triumphant as to keep the ghibellines in a state of banishment dante was born and bred a guelph he had twice borne arms for his country against ghibelline neighbours and now at the age of thirtyfive in the ninth of his marriage and last of his residence with his wife he was appointed chief of the temporary administrators of affairs called priorsfunctionaries who held office only for two months  unfortunately at that moment his party had become subdivided into the factions of the whites and blacks or adherents of two different sides in a dispute that took place in pistoia the consequences becoming serious the blacks proposed to bring in as mediator the french prince charles of valois then in arms for the pope against the emperor but the whites of whom dante was one were hostile to the measure and in order to prevent it he and his brother magistrates expelled for a time the heads of both factions to the satisfaction of neither the whites accused them of secretly leaning to the ghibellines and the blacks of openly favouring the whites who being indeed allowed to come back before their time on the alleged ground of the unwholesomeness of their place of exile which was fatal to dantes friend cavalcante gave a colour to the charge dante answered it by saying that he had then quitted office but he could not shew that he had lost his influence meantime charles was still urged to interfere and dante was sent ambassador to the pope to obtain his disapprobation of the interference but the pope boniface the eighth who had probably discovered that the whites had ceased to care for any thing but their own disputes and who at all events did not like their objection to his representative beguiled the ambassador and encouraged the french prince the blacks in consequence regained their ascendancy and the luckless poet during his absence was denounced as a corrupt administrator of affairs guilty of peculation was severely mulcted banished from tuscany for two years and subsequently for contumaciousness was sentenced to be burnt alive in case he returned ever he never did return  from that day forth dante never beheld again his home or his wife her relations obtained possession of power but no use was made of it except to keep him in exile he had not accorded with them and perhaps half the secret of his conjugal discomfort was owing to politics it is the opinion of some that the married couple were not sorry to part others think that the wife remained behind solely to scrape together what property she could and bring up the children all that is known is that she never lived with him more  dante now certainly did what his enemies had accused him of wishing to do he joined the old exiles whom he had helped to make such the party of the ghibellines he alleges that he never was really of any party but his own a naïve confession probably true in one sense considering his scorn of other people his great intellectual superiority and the large views he had for the whole italian people and indeed he soon quarrelled in private with the individuals composing his new party however stanch he apparently remained to their cause his former associates he had learnt to hate for their differences with him and for their selfseeking he hated the pope for deceiving him he hated the popes french allies for being his allies and interfering with florence and he had come to love the emperor for being hated by them all and for holding out as he fancied the only chance of reuniting italy to their confusion and making her the restorer of himself and the mistress of the world  with these feelings in his heart no money in his purse and no place in which to lay his head except such as chancepatrons afforded him he now began to wander over italy like some lonely lion of a man grudging in his great disdain at one moment he was conspiring and hoping at another despairing and endeavouring to conciliate his beautiful florence now again catching hope from some new movement of the emperors and then not very handsomely threatening and reabusing her but always pondering and grieving or trying to appease his thoughts with some composition chiefly of his great work it is conjectured that whenever anything particularly affected him whether with joy or sorrow he put it hot with the impression into his sacred poem every body who jarred against his sense of right or his prejudices he sent to the infernal regions friend or foe the strangest people who sided with them but certainly no personal foe he exalted to heaven he encouraged if not personally assisted two ineffectual attempts of the ghibellines against florence wrote besides his great work a book of mixed prose and poetry on love and virtue the convito or banquet a latin treatise on monarchy de monarchia recommending the divine right of the emperor another in two parts and in the same language on the vernacular tongue de vulgari eloquio and learnt to know meanwhile as he affectingly tells us how hard it was to climb other peoples stairs and how salt the taste of bread is that is not our own it is even thought not improbable from one awful passage of his poem that he may have placed himself in some public way and stripping his visage of all shame and trembling in his very vitals have stretched out his hand for charity 13an image of suffering which proud as he was yet considering how great a man is almost enough to make ones common nature stoop down for pardon at his feet and yet he should first prostrate himself at the feet of that nature for his outrages on god and man several of the princes and feudal chieftains of italy entertained the poet for a while in their houses but genius and worldly power unless for worldly purposes find it difficult to accord especially in tempers like his there must be great wisdom and amiableness on both sides to save them from jealousy of one anothers pretensions dante was not the man to give and take in such matters on equal terms and hence he is at one time in a palace and at another in a solitude now he is in sienna now in arezzo now in bologna then probably in verona with can grandes elder brother then if we are to believe those who have tracked his steps in casentino then with the marchese moroello malaspina in lunigiana then with the great ghibelline chieftain faggiuola in the mountains near urbino then in romagna in padua in paris arguing with the churchmen some say in germany and at oxford then again in italy in lucca where he is supposed to have relapsed from his fidelity to beatrice in favour of a certain gentucca then again in verona with the new prince the famous can grande where his sarcasms appear to have lost him a doubtful hospitality then in a monastery in the mountains of umbria in udine in ravenna and there at length he put up for the rest of his life with his last and best friend guido novello da polenta not the father but the nephew of the hapless francesca  it was probably in the middle period of his exile that in one of the moments of his greatest longing for his native country he wrote that affecting passage in the convito which was evidently a direct effort at conciliation excusing himself for some harshness and obscurity in the style of that work he exclaims ah would it had pleased the dispenser of all things that this excuse had never been needed that neither others had done me wrong nor myself undergone penalty undeservedlythe penalty i say of exile and of poverty for it pleased the citizens of the fairest and most renowned daughter of romeflorenceto cast me out of her most sweet bosom where i was born and bred and passed half of the life of man and in which with her good leave i still desire with all my heart to repose my weary spirit and finish the days allotted me and so i have wandered in almost every place to which our language extends a stranger almost a beggar exposing against my will the wounds given me by fortune too often unjustly imputed to the sufferers fault truly i have been a vessel without sail and without rudder driven about upon different ports and shores by the dry wind that springs out of dolorous poverty and hence have i appeared vile in the eyes of many who perhaps by some better report had conceived of me a different impression and in whose sight not only has my person become thus debased but an unworthy opinion created of every thing which i did or which i had to do 14  how simply and strongly written how full of the touching yet undegrading commiseration which adversity has a right to take upon itself when accompanied with the consciousness of manly endeavour and a good motive how could such a man condescend at other times to rage with abuse and to delight himself in images of infernal torment  the dates of these fluctuations of feeling towards his native city are not known but it is supposed to have been not very long before his abode with can grande that he received permission to return to florence on conditions which he justly refused and resented in the following noble letter to a kinsman the old spelling of the original in the note is retained as given by foscolo in the article on dante in the edinburgh review vol xxx no 60 and i have retained also with little difference the translation which accompanies it  from your letter which i received with due respect and affection i observe how much you have at heart my restoration to my country i am bound to you the more gratefully inasmuch as an exile rarely finds a friend but after mature consideration i must by my answer disappoint the wishes of some little minds and i confide in the judgment to which your impartiality and prudence will lead you your nephew and mine has written to me what indeed had been mentioned by many other friends that by a decree concerning the exiles i am allowed to return to florence provided i pay a certain sum of money and submit to the humiliation of asking and receiving absolution wherein my father i see two propositions that are ridiculous and impertinent i speak of the impertinence of those who mention such conditions to me for in your letter dictated by judgment and discretion there is no such thing is such an invitation then to return to his country glorious to d all dante allighieri after suffering in exile almost fifteen years is it thus they would recompense innocence which all the world knows and the labour and fatigue of unremitting study far from the man who is familiar with philosophy be the senseless baseness of a heart of earth that could act like a little sciolist and imitate the infamy of some others by offering himself up as it were in chains far from the man who cries aloud for justice this compromise by his money with his persecutors no my father this is not the way that shall lead me back to my country i will return with hasty steps if you or any other can open to me a way that shall not derogate from the fame and honour of d dante but if by no such way florence can be entered then florence i shall never enter what shall i not everywhere enjoy the light of the sun and stars and may i not seek and contemplate in every corner of the earth under the canopy of heaven consoling and delightful truth without first rendering myself inglorious nay infamous to the people and republic of florence bread i hope will not fail me 15  had dantes pride and indignation always vented themselves in this truly exalted manner never could the admirers of his genius have refused him their sympathy and never i conceive need he either have brought his exile upon him or closed it as he did to that close we have now come and it is truly melancholy and mortifying failure in a negotiation with the venetians for his patron guido novello is supposed to have been the last bitter drop which made the cup of his endurance run over he returned from venice to ravenna worn out and there died after fifteen years absence from his country in the year 1231 aged fiftyseven his life had been so agitated that it probably would not have lasted so long but for the solace of his poetry and the glory which he knew it must produce him guido gave him a sumptuous funeral and intended to give him a monument but such was the state of italy in those times that he himself died in exile the year after the monument however and one of a noble sort was subsequently bestowed by the father of cardinal bembo in 1483 and another still nobler as late as 1780 by cardinal gonzaga his countrymen in after years made two solemn applications for the removal of his dust to florence but the just pride of the ravennese refused them  of the exiles family three sons died young the daughter went into a nunnery and the two remaining brothers who ultimately joined their father in his banishment became respectable men of letters and left families in ravenna where the race though extinct in the male line still survives through a daughter in the noble house of serego alighieri no direct descent of the other kind from poets of former times is i believe known to exist  the manners and general appearance of dante have been minutely recorded and are in striking agreement with his character boccaccio and other novelists are the chief relaters and their accounts will be received accordingly with the greater or less trust as the reader considers them probable but the author of the decameron personally knew some of his friends and relations and he intermingles his least favourable reports with expressions of undoubted reverence the poet was of middle height of slow and serious deportment had a long dark visage large piercing eyes large jaws an aquiline nose a projecting underlip and thick curling hairan aspect announcing determination and melancholy there is a sketch of his countenance in his younger days from the immature but sweet pencil of giotto and it is a refreshment to look at it though pride and discontent i think are discernible in its lineaments it is idle and no true compliment to his nature to pretend as his mere worshippers do that his face owes all its subsequent gloom and exacerbation to external causes and that he was in every respect the poor victim of eventsthe infant changed at nurse by the wicked what came out of him he must have had in him at least in the germ and so inconsistent was his nature altogether or at any rate such an epitome of all the graver passions that are capable of coexisting both sweet and bitter thoughtful and outrageous that one is sometimes tempted to think he must have had an angel for one parent andi shall leave his own toleration to say whatfor the other  to continue the account of his manners and inclinations he dressed with a becoming gravity was temperate in his diet a great student seldom spoke unless spoken to but always to the purpose and almost all the anecdotes recorded of him except by himself are full of pride and sarcasm he was so swarthy that a woman as he was going by a door in verona is said to have pointed him out to another with a remark which made the saturnine poet smilethat is the man who goes to hell whenever he pleases and brings back news of the people there on which her companion observedvery likely dont you see what a curly beard he has and what a dark face owing i dare say to the heat and smoke he was evidently a passionate lover of painting and musicis thought to have been less strict in his conduct with regard to the sex than might be supposed from his platonical aspirationsboccaccio says that even a goitre did not repel him from the pretty face of a mountaineercould be very social when he was young as may be gathered from the sonnet addressed to his friend cavalcante about a party for a boatand though his poetry was so intense and weighty the laudable minuteness of a biographer has informed us that his handwriting besides being neat and precise was of a long and particularly thin character meagre is his word  there is a letter said to be nearly coeval with his time and to be written by the prior of a monastery to a celebrated ghibelline leader a friend of dantes which though hitherto accounted apocryphal by most has such an air of truth and contains an image of the poet in his exile so exceedingly like what we conceive of the man that it is difficult not to believe it genuine especially as the handwriting has lately been discovered to be that of boccaccio16 at all events i am sure the reader will not be sorry to have the substance of it the writer says that he perceived one day a man coming into the monastery whom none of its inmates knew he asked him what he wanted but the stranger saying nothing and continuing to gaze on the building as though contemplating its architecture the question was put a second time upon which looking round on his interrogators he answered peace the prior whose curiosity was strongly excited took the stranger apart and discovering who he was shewed him all the attention becoming his fame and then dante took a little book out of his bosom aid observing that perhaps the prior had not seen it expressed a wish to leave it with his new friend as a memorial it was a portion he said of his work the prior received the volume with respect and politely opening it at once and fixing his eyes on the contents in order it would seem to shew the interest he took in it appeared suddenly to check some observation which they suggested dante found that his reader was surprised at seeing the work written in the vulgar tongue instead of latin he explained that he wished to address himself to readers of all classes and concluded with requesting the prior to add some notes with the spirit of which he furnished him and then forward it transcribed i presume by the monks to their common friend the ghibelline chieftaina commission which knowing the priors intimacy with that personage appears to have been the main object of his coming to the place17  this letter has been adduced as an evidence of dantes poem having transpired during his lifetime a thing which in the teeth of boccaccios statement to that effect and indeed the poets own testimony18 foscolo holds to be so impossible that he turns the evidence against the letter he thinks that if such bitter invectives had been circulated a hundred daggers would have been sheathed in the bosom of the exasperating poet19 but i cannot help being of opinion with some writer whom i am unable at present to call to mind schlegel i think that the strong critical reaction of modern times in favour of dantes genius has tended to exaggerate the idea conceived of him in relation to his own that he was of importance and bitterly hated in his native city was a distinction he shared with other partisans who have obtained no celebrity though his poetry no doubt must have increased the bitterness that his genius also became more and more felt out of the city by the few individuals capable of estimating a man of letters in those semibarbarous times may be regarded as certain but that busy politicians in general warmaking statesmen and princes constantly occupied in fighting for their existence with one another were at all alive either to his merits or his invectives or would have regarded him as anything but a poor wandering scholar solacing his foolish interference in the politics of this world with the old clerical threats against his enemies in another will hardly i think be doubted by any one who reflects on the difference between a fame accumulated by ages and the living poverty that is obliged to seek its bread a writer on a monkish subject may have acquired fame with monks and even with a few distinguished persons and yet have been little known and less cared for out of the pale of that very private literary public which was almost exclusively their own when we read nowadays of the great poets being so politely received by can grande lord of verona and sitting at his princely table we are apt to fancy that nothing but his great poetry procured him the reception and that nobody present competed with him in the eyes of his host but to say nothing of the different kinds of retainers that could sit at a princes table in those days can who was more ostentatious than delicate in his munificence kept a sort of caravansera for clever exiles whom he distributed into lodgings classified according to their pursuits20 and dante only shared his bounty with the rest till the more delicate poet could no longer endure either the buffoonery of his companions or the amusement derived from it by the master on one occasion his platter is slily heaped with their bones which provokes him to call them dogs as having none to shew for their own another time can grande asks him how it is that his companions give more pleasure at court than himself to which he answers because like loves like he then leaves the court and his disgusted superiority is no doubt regarded as a pedantic assumption  he stopped long nowhere except with guido novello and when that prince whose downfal was at hand sent him on the journey above mentioned to venice the senate whom the poet had never offended were so little aware of his being of consequence that they declined giving him an audience he went back and broke his heart boccaccio says that he would get into such passions with the very boys and girls in the street who plagued him with partywords as to throw stones at thema thing that would be incredible if persons acquainted with his great but ultrasensitive nation did not know what italians could do in all ages from dantes own age down to the times of alfieri and foscolo it would be as difficult from the evidence of his own works and of the exasperation he created to doubt the extremest reports of his irascible temper as it would be not to give implicit faith to his honesty the charge of peculation which his enemies brought against this great poet the world has universally scouted with an indignation that does it honour he himself seems never to have condescended to allude to it and a biographer would feel bound to copy his silence had not the accusation been so atrociously recorded but on the other hand who can believe that a man so capable of doing his fellowcitizens good and honour would have experienced such excessive enmity had he not carried to excess the provocations of his pride and scorn his whole history goes to prove it not omitting the confession he makes of pride as his chief sin and the eulogies he bestows on the favourite vice of the agerevenge his christianity at least as shewn in his poem was not that of christ but of a furious polemic his motives for changing his party though probably of a mixed nature like those of most human beings may reasonably be supposed to have originated in something better than interest or indignation he had most likely not agreed thoroughly with any party and had become hopeless of seeing dispute brought to an end except by the representative of the cæsars the inconsistency of the personal characters of the popes with the sacred claims of the chair of st peter was also calculated greatly to disgust him but still his own infirmities of pride and vindictiveness spoiled all and when he loaded every body else with reproach for the misfortunes of his country he should have recollected that had his own faults been kept in subjection to his understanding he might possibly have been its saviour dantes modesty has been asserted on the ground of his humbling himself to the fame of virgil and at the feet of blessed spirits but this kind of exalted humility does not repay a mans fellowcitizens for lording it over them with scorn and derision we learn from boccaccio that when he was asked to go ambassador from his party to the pope he put to them the following useless and mortifying queriesif i go who is to stayand if i stay who is to go 21 neither did his pride make him tolerant of pride in others a neighbour applying for his intercession with a magistrate who had summoned him for some offence dante who disliked the man for riding in an overbearing manner along the streets stretching out his legs as wide as he could and hindering people from going by did intercede with the magistrate but it was in behalf of doubling the fine in consideration of the horsemanship the neighbour who was a man of family was so exasperated that sacchetti the novelist says it was the principal cause of dantes expatriation this will be considered the less improbable if as some suppose the delinquent obtained possession of his deriders confiscated property but at all events nothing is more likely to have injured him the bitterest animosities are generally of a personal nature and bitter indeed must have been those which condemned a man of official dignity and of genius to such a penalty as the stake22  that the florentines of old like other halfchristianised people were capable of any extremity against an opponent burning included was proved by the fates of savonarola and others and that dante himself could admire the burners is evident from his eulogies and beatification of such men as folco and st dominic the tragical as well as fantastic tricks which    man proud man   drest in a little brief authority  plays with his energy and bad passions under the guise of duty is among the most perplexing of those spectacles which according to a greater understanding than dantes make the angels weep dante by the way has introduced in his heaven no such angels as those though he has plenty that scorn and denounce lope de vega though a poet was an officer of the inquisition and joined the famous armada that was coming to thumbscrew and roast us into his views of christian meekness whether the author of the story of paulo and francesca could have carried the dominican theories into practice had he been the banisher instead of the banished is a point that may happily be doubted but at all events he revenged himself on his enemies after their own fashion for he answered their decree of the stake by putting them into hell  dante entitled the saddest poem in the world a comedy because it was written in a middle style though some by a strange confusion of ideas think the reason must have been because it ended happily that is because beginning with hell to some it terminated with heaven to others as well might they have said that a mornings work in the inquisition ended happily because while people were being racked in the dungeons the officers were making merry in the drawingroom for the muchinjured epithet of divine dantes memory is not responsible he entitled his poem arrogantly enough yet still not with that impiety of arrogance the comedy of dante alighieri a florentine by nation but not by habits the word divine was added by some transcriber and it heaped absurdity on absurdity too much of it alas being literally infernal tragedy i am not speaking in mockery any further than the fact itself cannot help so speaking i respect what is to be respected in dante i admire in him what is admirable would love if his infernalities would let me what is loveable but this must not hinder one of the human race from protesting against what is erroneous in his fame when it jars against every best feeling human and divine mr cary thinks that dante had as much right to avail himself of the popular creed in all its extravagance as homer had of his gods or shakspeare of his fairies but the distinction is obvious homer did not personally identify himself with a creed or do his utmost to perpetuate the worst parts of it in behalf of a ferocious inquisitorial church and to the risk of endangering the peace of millions of gentle minds  the great poem thus misnomered is partly a system of theology partly an abstract of the knowledge of the day but chiefly a series of passionate and imaginative pictures altogether forming an account of the authors times his friends his enemies and himself written to vent the spleen of his exile and the rest of his feelings good and bad and to reform church and state by a spirit of resentment and obloquy which highly needed reform itself it has also a design strictly selfreferential the author feigns that the beatified spirit of his mistress has obtained leave to warn and purify his soul by shewing him the state of things in the next world she deputes the soul of his master virgil to conduct him through hell and purgatory and then takes him herself through the spheres of heaven where saint peter catechises and confirms him and where he is finally honoured with sights of the virgin mary of christ and even a glimpse of the supreme being  his hell considered as a place is to speak geologically a most fantastical formation it descends from beneath jerusalem to the centre of the earth and is a funnel graduated in circles each circle being a separate place of torment for a different vice or its coordinates and the point of the funnel terminating with satan stuck into ice purgatory is a corresponding mountain on the other side of the globe commencing with the antipodes of jerusalem and divided into exterior circles of expiation which end in a tableland forming the terrestrial paradise from this the hero and his mistress ascend by a flight exquisitely conceived to the stars where the sun and the planets of the ptolemaic system for the true one was unknown in dantes time form a series of heavens for different virtues the whole terminating in the empyrean or region of pure light and the presence of the beatific vision  the boundaries of old and new strange as it may now seem to us were so confused in those days and books were so rare and the latin poets held in such invincible reverence that dante in one and the same poem speaks of the false gods of paganism and yet retains much of its lower mythology nay invokes apollo himself at the door of paradise there was perhaps some mystical and even philosophical inclusion of the past in this medley as recognising the constant superintendence of providence but that dante partook of what may be called the literary superstition of the time even for want of better knowledge is clear from the grave historical use he makes of poetic fables in his treatise on monarchy and in the very arguments which he puts into the mouths of saints and apostles there are lingering feelings to this effect even now among the peasantry of italy where the reader need not be told pagan customs of all sorts including religious and most reverend ones are existing under the sanction of other namesheathenisms christened a tuscan postilion once enumerating to me some of the native poets concluded his list with apollo and a plastercast man over here in london appeared much puzzled when conversing on the subject with a friend of mine how to discrepate samson from hercules  dante accordingly while with the frightful bigotry of the schools he puts the whole pagan world into hellborders with the exception of two or three whose salvation adds to the absurdity mingles the hell of virgil with that of tertullian and st dominic sets minos at the door as judge retains charon in his old office of boatman over the stygian lake puts fabulous people with real among the damned dido and cacus and ephialtes with ezzelino and pope nicholas the fifth and associates the centaurs and the furies with the agents of diabolical torture it has pleased him also to elevate cato of utica to the office of warder of purgatory though the censors poor good wife marcia is detained in the regions below by these and other far greater inconsistencies the whole place of punishment becomes a reductio ad absurdum as ridiculous as it is melancholy so that one is astonished how so great a man and especially a man who thought himself so far advanced beyond his age and who possessed such powers of discerning the good and beautiful could endure to let his mind live in so foul and foolish a region for any length of time and there wreak and harden the unworthiest of his passions genius nevertheless is so commensurate with absurdity throughout the book and there are even such sweet and balmy as well as sublime pictures in it occasionally nay often that not only will the poem ever be worthy of admiration but when those increasing purifications of christianity which our blessed reformers began shall finally precipitate the whole dregs of the author into the mythology to which they belong the world will derive a pleasure from it to an amount not to be conceived till the arrival of that day dante meantime with an impartiality which has been admired by those who can approve the assumption of a theological tyranny at the expense of common feeling and decency has put friends as well as foes into hell tutors of his childhood kinsmen of those who treated him hospitably even the father of his beloved friend guido cavalcantethe last for not believing in a god therein doing the worst thing possible in behalf of the belief and totally differing both with the pious heathen plutarch and the great christian philosopher bacon who were of opinion that a contumelious belief is worse than none and that it is far better and more pious to believe in no god at all than in a god who would eat his children as soon as they were born and dante makes him do worse for the whole unbaptised infant world christian as well as pagan is in his tartarus  milton has spoken of the milder shades of purgatory and truly they possess great beauties even in a theological point of view they are something like a bit of christian refreshment after the horrors of the inferno the first emerging from the hideous gulf to the sight of the blue serenity of heaven is painted in a manner inexpressibly charming so is the seashore with the coming of the angel the valley with the angels in green the repose at night on the rocks and twenty other pictures of gentleness and love and yet special and great has been the escape of the protestant world from this part of roman catholic belief for purgatory is the heaviest stone that hangs about the neck of the old and feeble in that communion hell is avoidable by repentance but purgatory what modest conscience shall escape mr cary in a note on a passage in which dante recommends his readers to think on what follows this expiatory state rather than what is suffered there23 looks upon the poets injunction as an unanswerable objection to the doctrine of purgatory it being difficult to conceive how the best can meet death without horror if they believe it must be followed by immediate and intense suffering luckily assent is not belief and mankinds feelings are for the most part superior to their opinions otherwise the world would have been in a bad way indeed and nature not been vindicated of her children but let us watch and be on our guard against all resuscitations of superstition  as to our florentines heaven it is full of beauties also though sometimes of a more questionable and pantomimical sort than is to be found in either of the other books i shall speak of some of them presently but the general impression of the place is that it is no heaven at all he says it is and talks much of its smiles and its beatitude but always excepting the poetryespecially the similes brought from the more heavenly earthwe realise little but a fantastical assemblage of doctors and doubtful characters far more angry and theological than celestial giddy raptures of monks and inquisitors dancing in circles and saints denouncing popes and florentines in short a heaven libelling itself with invectives against earth and terminating in a great presumption many of the people put there a calvinistic dante would have consigned to the other place and some if now living would not be admitted into decent society at the beginning of one of the cantos the poet congratulates himself with a complacent superiority on his being in heaven and occupied with celestial matters while his poor fellowcreatures are wandering and blundering on earth but he had never got there a divineworthy of that nameof the church of england dr whichcote has beautifully said that heaven is first a temper and then a place according to this truly celestial topography the implacable florentine had not reached its outermost court again his heavenly mistress beatrice besides being far too didactic to sustain the womanly part of her character properly alternates her smiles and her sarcasms in a way that jars horribly against the occasional enchantment of her aspect she does not scruple to burst into taunts of the florentines in the presence of jesus himself and the spirit of his ancestor cacciaguida in the very bosom of christian bliss promises him revenge on his enemies is this the kind of zeal that is to be exempt from objection in a man who objected to all the world or will it be thought a profaneness against such profanity to remind the reader of the philosopher in swift who while gazing on the stars was betrayed by his lower parts into a ditch  the readers time need not be wasted with the allegorical and other mystical significations given to the poem still less on the question whether beatrice is theology or a young lady or both and least of all on the discovery of the ingenious signor rossetti that dante and all the other great old italian writers meant nothing either by their mistresses or their mythology but attacks on the court of rome suffice it that besides all other possible meanings dante himself has told us that his poem has its obvious and literal meaning that he means a spade by a spade purgatory by purgatory and truly and unaffectedly to devote his friends to the infernal regions whenever he does so i confess i think it is a great pity that guido cavalcante did not live to read the poem especially the passage about his father the understanding of guido who had not the admiration for virgil that dante had very likely for reasons that have been thought sound in modern times was in all probability as good as that of his friend in many respects and perhaps more so in one or two and modern criticism might have been saved some of its pains of objection by the poets contemporary  the author did not live to publish in any formal manner his extraordinary poem probably did not intend to do so except under those circumstances of political triumph which he was always looking for but as he shewed portions of it to his friends it was no doubt talked of to a certain extent and must have exasperated such of his enemies as considered him worth their hostility no wonder they did all they could to keep him out of florence what would they have said of him could they have written a counter poem what would even his friends have said of him for we see in what manner he has treated even those and yet how could he possibly know with respect either to friends or enemies what passed between them and their consciences or who was it that gave him his right to generate the boasted distinction between an authors feelings as a man and his assumed office as a theologian and parade the latter at the formers expense his own spleen hatred and avowed sentiments of vengeance are manifest throughout the poem and there is this indeed to be said for the moral and religious inconsistencies both of the man and his verse that in those violent times the spirit of christian charity and even the sentiment of personal shame were so little understood that the author in one part of it is made to blush by a friend for not having avenged him and it is said to have been thought a compliment to put a lady herself into hell that she might be talked of provided it was for something not odious an admirer of this infernal kind of celebrity even in later times declared that he would have given a sum of money i forget to what amount if dante had but done as much for one of his ancestors it has been argued that in all the parties concerned in these curious ethics there is a generous love of distinction and a strong craving after life action and sympathy of some kind or other granted there are all sorts of halfgood halfbarbarous feelings in dantes poem let justice be done to the good half but do not let us take the ferocity for wisdom and piety or pretend in the complacency of our own freedom from superstition to see no danger of harm to the less fortunate among our fellowcreatures in the support it receives from a man of genius bedlams have been filled with such horrors thousands nay millions of feeble minds are suffering by them or from them at this minute all over the world dantes best critic foscolo has said much of the heroical nature of the age in which the poet lived but he adds that its mixture of knowledge and absurdity is almost inexplicable the truth is that like everything else which appears harsh and unaccountable in nature it was an excess of the materials for good working in an overactive and inexperienced manner but knowing this we are bound for the sake of the good not to retard its improvement by ignoring existing impieties or blind ourselves to the perpetuating tendencies of the bigotries of great men oh had the first indoctrinators of christian feeling while enlisting the divine plato into the service of diviner charity only kept the latter just enough in mind to discern the beautiful difference between the philosophers unmalignant and improvable evil and their own malignant and eternal one what a world of folly and misery they might have saved us but as the evil has happened let us hope that even this form of it has had its uses if dante thought it salutary to the world to maintain a system of religious terror the same charity which can hope that it may once have been so has taught us how to commence a better but did he after all or did he not think it salutary did he think so believing the creed himself or did he think it from an unwilling sense of its necessity or lastly did he write only as a mythologist and care for nothing but the exercise of his spleen and genius if he had no other object than that his conscientiousness would be reduced to a low pitch indeed foscolo is of opinion he was not only in earnest but that he was very near taking himself for an apostle and would have done so had his prophecies succeeded perhaps with success to the pretension24 thank heaven his hell has not embittered the mild readingdesks of the church of england  if king george the third himself with all his arbitrary notions and willing religious acquiescence could not endure the creed of st athanasius with its damnatory enjoinments of the impossible what would have been said to the inscription over dantes hellgate or the account of ugolino eating an archbishop in the gentle chapels of queen victoria may those chapels have every beauty in them and every air of heaven that painting and music can bestowdivine gifts not unworthy to be set before their divine bestower but far from them be kept the foul fiends of inhumanity and superstition  it is certainly impossible to get at a thorough knowledge of the opinions of dante even in theology and his morals if judged according to the received standard are not seldom puzzling he rarely thinks as the popes do sometimes not as the church does he is lax for instance on the subject of absolution by the priest at death25 all you can be sure of is the predominance of his will the most wonderful poetry and the notions he entertained of the degrees of vice and virtue towards the errors of love he is inclined to be so lenient some think because he had indulged in them himself that it is pretty clear he would not have put paulo and francesca into hell if their story had not been too recent and their death too sudden to allow him to assume their repentance in the teeth of the evidence required he avails himself of orthodox license to put the harlot rahab into heaven cette bonne fille de jericho as ginguéné calls her nay he puts her into the planet venus as if to compliment her on her profession and one of her companions there is a fair ghibelline sister of the tyrant ezzelino a lady famous for her gallantries of whom the poet goodnaturedly says that she was overcome by her starto wit the said planet venus and yet he makes her the organ of the most unfeminine triumphs over the guelphs but both these ladies it is to be understood repentedfor they had time for repentance their good fortune saved them poor murdered francesca had no time to repent therefore her mischance was her damnation such are the compliments theology pays to the creator in fact nothing is really punished in dantes catholic hell but impenitence deliberate or accidental no delay of repentance however dangerous hinders the most hardhearted villain from reaching his heaven the best man goes to hell for ever if he does not think he has sinned as dante thinks the worst is beatified if he agrees with him the only thing which every body is sure of is some dreadful duration of agony in purgatorythe great horror of catholic death beds protestantism may well hug itself on having escaped it o luther vast was the good you did us o gentle church of england let nothing persuade you that it is better to preach frightful and foolish ideas of god from your pulpits than lovingkindness to all men and peace above all things  if dante had erred only on the side of indulgence humanity could easily have forgiven himfor the excesses of charity are the extensions of hope but unfortunately where he is sweetnatured once he is bitter a hundred times this is the impression he makes on universalists of all creeds and parties that is to say on men who having run the whole round of sympathy with their fellowcreatures become the only final judges of sovereign pretension it is very well for individuals to make a god of dante for some encouragement of their own position or pretension but a god for the world at large he never was or can be and i doubt if an impression to this effect was not always from the very dawn of our literature the one entertained of him by the genius of our native country which could never long endure any kind of unwarrantable dictation chaucer evidently thought him a man who would spare no unnecessary probe to the feelings see the close of his version of ugolino spenser says not a word of him though he copied tasso and eulogised ariosto shakspeare would assuredly have put him into the list of those presumptuous lookers into eternity who take upon themselves to know cymbeline act v sc 4 milton in his sonnet to henry lawes calls him that sad florentinea lamenting epithet by which we do not designate a man whom we desire to resemble the historian of english poetry admirably applying to him a passage out of milton says that hell grows darker at his frown 26  walter scott could not read him at least not with pleasure he tells miss seward that the plan of the poem appeared to him unhappy the personal malignity and strange mode of revenge presumptuous and uninteresting 27 uninteresting i think it is impossible to consider it the known world is there and the unknown pretends to be there and both are surely interesting to most people  landor in his delightful book the pentamerona book full of the profoundest as well as sweetest humanitymakes petrarch follow up boccaccios eulogies of the episode of paulo and francesca with ebullitions of surprise and horror  petrarca perfection of poetry the greater is my wonder at discovering nothing else of the same order or cast in this whole section of the poem he who fainted at the recital of francesca    and he who fell as a dead body falls  would exterminate all the inhabitants of every town in italy what execrations against florence pistoia pisa siena genoa what hatred against the whole human race what exultation and merriment at eternal and immitigable sufferings seeing this i cannot but consider the inferno as the most immoral and impious book that ever was written yet hopeless that our country shall ever see again such poetry and certain that without it our future poets would be more feebly urged forward to excellence i would have dissuaded dante from cancelling it if this had been his intention 28  most happily is the distinction here intimated between the undesirableness of dantes book in a moral and religious point of view and the greater desirableness of it nevertheless as a pattern of poetry for absurdity however potent wears itself out in the end and leaves what is good and beautiful to vindicate even so foul an origin  again petrarch says what an object of sadness and of consternation he who rises up from hell like a giant refreshed  boccaccio strange perversion a pillar of smoke by day and of fire by night to guide no one paradise had fewer wants for him to satisfy than hell had all which he fed to repletion but let us rather look to his poetry than his temper  see also what is said in that admirable book further on p 50 respecting the most impious and absurd passage in all dantes poem the assumption about divine love in the inscription over hellgateone of those monstrosities of conception which none ever had the effrontery to pretend to vindicate except theologians who profess to be superior to the priests of moloch and who yet defy every feeling of decency and humanity for the purpose of explaining their own worldly frightened or hardhearted submission to the mistakes of the most wretched understandings ugo foscolo an excellent critic where his own temper and violence did not interfere sees nothing but jealousy in petrarchs dislike of dante and nothing but jesuitism in similar feelings entertained by such men as tiraboschi but all gentle and considerate hearts must dislike the rage and bigotry in dante even were it true as the dantesque foscolo thinks that italy will never be regenerated till onehalf of it is baptised in the blood of the other29 such men with all their acuteness are incapable of seeing what can be effected by nobler and serener times and the progress of civilisation they fancy no doubt that they are vindicating the energies of nature herself and the inevitable necessity of doing evil that good may come but dante in so doing violated the scripture he professed to revere and men must not assume to themselves that final knowledge of results which is the only warrant of the privilege and the possession of which is to be arrogated by no earthly wisdom one calm discovery of science may do away with all the boasted eternal necessities of the angry and the selfidolatrous the passions that may be necessary to savages are not bound to remain so to civilised men any more than the eating of mans flesh or the worship of jugghernaut when we think of the wonderful things lately done by science for the intercourse of the world and the beautiful and tranquil books of philosophy written by men of equal energy and benevolence and opening the peacefulest hopes for mankind and views of creation to which dantes universe was a nutshellsuch a vision as that of his poem in a theological point of view seems no better than the dream of an hypochondriacal savage and his nutshell a rottenness to be spit out of the mouth  heaven send that the great poets want of charity has not made myself presumptuous and uncharitable but it is in the name of society i speak and words at all events nowadays are not the terrible stakepreceding things they were in his readers in general howevereven those of the literary worldhave little conception of the extent to which dante carries either his cruelty or his abuse the former of which i shall give some examples presently shews appalling habits of personal resentment the latter is outrageous to a pitch of the ludicrouspositively screaming i will give some specimens of it out of foscolo himself who collects them for a different purpose though with all his idolatry of dante he was far from being insensible to his mistakes  the people of sienna according to this national and christian poet were a parcel of coxcombs those of arezzo dogs and of casentino hogs lucca made a trade of perjury pistoia was a den of beasts and ought to be reduced to ashes and the river arno should overflow and drown every soul in pisa almost all the women in florence walked halfnaked in public and were abandoned in private every brother husband son and father in bologna set their women to sale in all lombardy were not to be found three men who were not rascals and in genoa and romagna people went about pretending to be men but in reality were bodies inhabited by devils their souls having gone to the lowest pit of hell to join the betrayers of their friends and kinsmen 30  so much for his beloved countrymen as for foreigners particularly kings edward the first of england and robert of scotland were a couple of grasping fools the emperor albert was an usurper alphonso the second of spain a debauchee the king of bohemia a coward frederick of arragon a coward and miser the kings of portugal and norway forgers the king of naples a man whose virtues were expressed by a unit and his vices by a million and the king of france the descendant of a paris butcher and of progenitors who poisoned st thomas aquinas their descendants conquering with the arms of judas rather than of soldiers and selling the flesh of their daughters to old men in order to extricate themselves from a danger 31  when we add to these invectives damnations of friends as well as foes of companions lawyers men of letters princes philosophers popes pagans innocent people as well as guilty fools and wise capable and incapable men women and childrenit is really no better than a kind of diabolical sublimation of lord thurlows anathemas in the rolliad which begins with    damnation seize ye all  and ends with    damn them beyond what mortal tongue can tell   confound sink plunge them all to deepest blackest hell 32  in the gross indeed this is ridiculous enough  no burlesque can beat it but in the particular one is astonished and saddened at the cruelties in which the poet allows his imagination to riot horrors generally described with too intense a verisimilitude not to excite our admiration with too astounding a perseverance not to amaze our humanity and sometimes with an amount of positive joy and delight that makes us ready to shut the book with disgust and indignation thus in a circle in hell where traitors are stuck up to their chins in ice canto xxxii the visitor in walking about happens to give one of their faces a kick the sufferer weeps and then curses himwith such infernal truth does the writer combine the malignant with the pathetic dante replies to the curse by asking the man his name he is refused it he then seizes the miserable wretch by the hair in order to force him to the disclosure and virgil is represented as commending the barbarity33 but he does worse to barbarity he adds treachery of his own he tells another poor wretch whose face is iced up with his tears as if he had worn a crystal vizor that if he will disclose his name and offence he will relieve his eyes awhile that he may weep the man does so and the ferocious poet then refuses to perform his promise adding mockery to falsehood and observing that ill manners are the only courtesy proper to wards such a fellow34 it has been conjectured that macchiavelli apparently encouraged the enormities of the princes of his time with a design to expose them to indignation it might have been thought of dante if he had not taken a part in the cruelty that he detailed the horrors of his hell out of a wish to disgust the world with its frightful notions of god this is certainly the effect of the worst part of his descriptions in an age like the present black burning gulfs full of outcries and blasphemy feet redhot with fire men eternally eating their fellowcreatures frozen wretches malignantly dashing their iced heads against one another other adversaries mutually exchanging shapes by force of an attraction at once irresistible and loathing and spitting with hate and disgust when it is doneenough enough for gods sake take the disgust out of ones senses o flower of true christian wisdom and charity now beginning to fill the air with fragrance  but it will be said that dante did all this out of his hate of cruelty itself and of treachery itself partly no doubt he did and entirely he thought he did but see how the notions of such retribution react upon the judge and produce in him the bad passions he punishes it is true the punishments are imaginary were a human being actually to see such things he must be dehumanised or he would cry out against them with horror and detestation but the poem draws them as truths the writers creed threatened them he himself contributed to maintain the belief and however we may suppose such a belief to have had its use in giving alarm to ruffian passions and barbarously ignorant times an age arrives when a beneficent providence permits itself to be better understood and dissipates the superfluous horror  many indeed of the absurdities of dantes poem are too obvious nowadays to need remark even the composition of the poem egotistically said to be faultless by such critics as alfieri who thought they resembled him partakes as every bodys style does of the faults as well as good qualities of the man it is nervous concise full almost as it can hold picturesque mighty primeval but it is often obscure often harsh and forced in its constructions defective in melody and wilful and superfluous in the rhyme sometimes also the writer is inconsistent in circumstance probably from not having corrected the poem and he is not above being filthy even in the episode of paulo and francesca which has so often been pronounced faultless and which is unquestionably one of the most beautiful pieces of writing in the world some of these faults are observable particularly in the obscurity of the passage about tolta forma the cessation of the incessant tempest and the nonadjuration of the two lovers in the manner that virgil prescribes  but truly it is said that when dante is great nobody surpasses him i doubt if anybody equals him as to the constant intensity and incessant variety of his pictures and whatever he paints he throws as it were upon its own powers as though an artist should draw figures that started into life and proceeded to action for themselves frightening their creator every motion word and look of these creatures becomes full of sensibility and suggestions the invisible is at the back of the visible darkness becomes palpable silence describes a character nay forms the most striking part of a story a word acts as a flash of lightning which displays some gloomy neighbourhood where a tower is standing with dreadful faces at the window or where at your feet full of eternal voices one abyss is beheld dropping out of another in the lurid light of torment in the present volume a story will be found which tells a long tragedy in halfadozen lines dante has the minute probabilities of a defoe in the midst of the loftiest and most generalising poetry and this feeling of matteroffact is impressed by fictions the most improbable nay the most ridiculous and revolting you laugh at the absurdity you are shocked at the detestable cruelty yet for the moment the thing almost seems as if it must be true you feel as you do in a dream and after ityou wake and laugh but the absurdity seemed true at the time and while you laugh you shudder  enough of this crueller part of his genius has been exhibited but it is seldom you can have the genius without sadness in the circle of hell soothsayers walk along weeping with their faces turned the wrong way so that their tears fall between their shoulders the picture is still more dreadful warton thinks it ridiculous but i cannot help feeling with the poet that it is dreadfully pathetic it is the last mortifying insult to human pretension warton who has a grudge against dante natural to a man of happier piety thinks him ridiculous also in describing the monster geryon lying upon the edge of one of the gulfs of hell like a beaver canto xvii he is of opinion that the writer only does it to shew his knowledge of natural history but surely the idea of so strange and awful a creature a huge mildfaced man ending in a dragons body lying familiarly on the edge of the gulf as a beaver does by the water combines the supernatural with the familiar in a very impressive manner it is this combination of extremes which is the life and soul of the whole poem you have this world in the next the same persons passions remembrances intensified by superhuman despairs or beatitudes the speechless entrancements of bliss the purgatorial trials of hope and patience the supports of hate and anger such as they are in hell itself nay of loving despairs and a selfpity made unboundedly pathetic by endless suffering hence there it no lovestory so affecting as that of paulo and francesca thus told and perpetuated in another world no fathers misery so enforced upon us as ugolinos who for hundreds of years has not grown tired of the revenge to which it wrought him dante even puts this weight and continuity of feeling into passages of mere transient emotion or illustration unconnected with the next world as in the famous instance of the verses about evening and many others which the reader will meet with in this volume indeed if pathos and the most impressive simplicity and graceful beauty of all kinds and abundant grandeur can pay as the reader i believe will think it does even in a prose abstract for the pangs of moral discord and absurdity inflicted by the perusal of dantes poem it may challenge competition with any in point of interest his heaven it is true though containing both sublime and lovely passages is not so good as his earth the more unearthly he tried to make it the less heavenly it became when he is content with earth in heaven itselfwhen he literalises a metaphor and with exquisite felicity finds himself arrived there in consequence of fixing his eyes on the eyes of beatrice then he is most celestial but his endeavours to express degrees of beatitude and holiness by varieties of flame and lightof dancing lights revolving lights lights of smiles of stars of starry crosses of didactic letters and sentences of animal figures made up of stars full of blessed souls with saints forming an eagles beak and david in its eyesuch superhuman attempts become for the most part tricks of theatrical machinery on which we gaze with little curiosity and no respect  his angels however are another matter belief was prepared for those winged human forms and they furnished him with some of his most beautiful combinations of the natural with the supernatural ginguéné has remarked the singular variety as well as beauty of dantes angels miltons indeed are commonplace in the comparison in the eighth canto of the inferno the devils insolently refuse the poet and his guide an entrance into the city of disan angel comes sweeping over the stygian lake to enforce it the noise of his wings makes the shores tremble and is like a crashing whirlwind such as beats down the trees and sends the peasants and their herds flying before it the heavenly messenger after rebuking the devils touches the portals of the city with his wand they fly open and he returns the way he came without uttering a word to the two companions his face was that of one occupied with other thoughts this angel is announced by a tempest another who brings the souls of the departed to purgatory is first discovered at a distance gradually disclosing white splendours which are his wings and garments he comes in a boat of which his wings are the sails and as he approaches it is impossible to look him in the face for its brightness two other angels have green wings and green garments and the drapery is kept in motion like a flag by the vehement action of the wings a fifth has a face like the morning star casting forth quivering beams a sixth is of a lustre so oppressive that the poet feels a weight on his eyes before he knows what is coming anothers presence affects the senses like the fragrance of a maymorning and another is in garments dark as cinders but has a sword in his hand too sparkling to be gazed at dantes occasional pictures of the beauties of external nature are worthy of these angelic creations and to the last degree fresh and lovely you long to bathe your eyes smarting with the fumes of hell in his dews you gaze enchanted on his green fields and his celestial blue skies the more so from the pain and sorrow in midst of which the visions are created  dantes grandeur of every kind is proportionate to that of his angels almost to his ferocity and that is saying every thing it is not always the spiritual grandeur of milton the subjection of the material impression to the moral but it is equally such when he chooses and far more abundant his infernal precipiceshis black whirlwindshis innumerable cries and claspings of handshis very odours of huge loathsomenesshis giants at twilight standing up to the middle in pits like towers and causing earthquakes when they movehis earthquake of the mountain in purgatory when a spirit is set free for heavenhis dignified mantuan sordello silently regarding him and his guide as they go by like a lion on his watchhis blasphemer capaneus lying in unconquered rage and sullenness under an eternal rain of flakes of fire human precursor of miltons satanhis aspect of paradise as if the universe had smiledhis inhabitants of the whole planet saturn crying out so loud in accordance with the antipapal indignation of saint pietro damiano that the poet though among them could not hear what they saidand the blushing eclipse like red clouds at sunset which takes place at the apostle peters denunciation of the sanguinary filth of the court of romeall these sublimities and many more make us not know whether to be more astonished at the greatness of the poet or the raging littleness of the man grievous is it to be forced to bring two such opposites together and i wish for the honour and glory of poetry i did not feel compelled to do so but the swarthy florentine had not the healthy temperament of his brethren and he fell upon evil times compared with homer and shakspeare his very intensity seems only superior to theirs from an excess of the morbid and he is inferior to both in other sovereign qualities of poetryto the one in giving you the healthiest general impression of nature itselfto shakspeare in boundless universalityto most great poets in thorough harmony and delightfulness he wanted generally speaking the music of a happy and a happymaking disposition homer from his large vital bosom breathes like a broad fresh air over the world amidst alternate storm and sunshine making you aware that there is rough work to be faced but also activity and beauty to be enjoyed the feeling of health and strength is predominant life laughs at death itself or meets it with a noble confidenceis not taught to dread it as a malignant goblin shakspeare has all the smiles as well as tears of nature and discerns the soul of goodness in things evil he is comedy as well as tragedythe entire man in all his qualities moods and experiences and he beautifies all and both those truly divine poets make nature their subject through her own inspiriting mediumnot through the darkened glass of one mans spleen and resentment dante in constituting himself the hero of his poem not only renders her in the general impression as dreary as himself in spite of the occasional beautiful pictures he draws of her but narrows her very immensity into his pettiness he fancied alas that he could build her universe over again out of the politics of old rome and the divinity of the schools  dante besides his great poem and a few latin eclogues of no great value wrote lyrics full of platonical sentiment some of which anticipated the loveliest of petrarchs and he was the author of various prose works political and philosophical all more or less masterly for the time in which he lived and all coadjutors of his poetry in fixing his native tongue his account of his early life the vita nuova is a most engaging history of a boyish passion evidently as real and true on his own side as love and truth can be whatever might be its mistake as to its object the treatise on the vernacular tongue de vulgari eloquio shews how critically he considered his materials for impressing the world and what a reader he was of every production of his contemporaries the banquet convito is but an abstruse commentary on some of his minor poems but the book on monarchy de monarchia is a compound of ability and absurdity in which his great genius is fairly overborne by the barbarous pedantry of the age it is an argument to prove that the world must all be governed by one man that this one man must be the successor of the roman emperorgod having manifestly designed the world to be subject for ever to the roman empire and lastly that this emperor is equally designed by god to be independent of the popespiritually subject to him indeed but so far only as a good son is subject to the religious advice of his father and thus making church and state happy for ever in the two divided supremacies and all this assumption of the obsolete and impossible the author gravely proves in all the forms of logic by arguments drawn from the history of Æneas and the providential cackle of the roman geese  how can the patriots of modern italy justified as they are in extolling the poet to the skies see him plunge into such depths of bigotry in his verse and childishness in his prose and consent to perplex the friends of advancement with making a type of their success out of so erring though so great a man such slavishness even to such greatness is a poor and unpromising thing compared with an altogether unprejudiced and forwardlooking selfreliance to have no faith in names has been announced as one of their principles and god and humanity is their motto what therefore has dantes name to do with their principles or what have the semibarbarisms of the thirteenth century to do with the final triumph of god and humanity dantes lauded wish for that union of the italian states which his fame has led them so fondly to identify with their own was but a portion of his greater and prouder wish to see the whole world at the feet of his boasted ancestress rome not of course that he had no view to what he considered good and just government for what sane despot purposes to rule without that but his good and just government was always to be founded on the sine qua non principle of universal italian domination35  all that dante said or did has its interest for us in spite of his errors because he was an earnest and suffering man and a great genius but his fame must ever continue to lie where his greatest blame does in his principal work he was a gratuitous logician a preposterous politician a cruel theologian but his wonderful imagination and considering the bitterness that was in him still more wonderful sweetness have gone into the hearts of his fellowcreatures and will remain there in spite of the moral and religious absurdities with which they are mingled and of the inability which the bestnatured readers feel to associate his entire memory as a poet with their usual personal delight in a poet and his name   footnote 1 as notices of dantes life have often been little but

of the social duty is an assumption not very probable with regard to any body and much less so in a fiery italian of twentysix but the addition of the epithets calm and cold gives it a sort of horror a reader of this article evidently the production of a man of ability but of great wilfulness is tempted to express the disappointment it has given him in plainer terms than might be wished in

hell  argument  the infernal regions according to dante are situate in the globe we inhabit directly beneath jerusalem and consist of a succession of gulfs or circles narrowing as they descend and terminating in the centre so that the general shape is that of a funnel commentators have differed as to their magnitude but the latest calculation gives 315 miles for the diameter of the mouth or crater and a quarter of a mile for that of its terminating point in the middle is the abyss pervading the whole depth and 245 miles in diameter at the opening which reduces the different platforms or territories that surround it to a size comparatively small these territories are more or less varied with land and water lakes precipices c a precipice fourteen miles high divides the first of them from the second the passages from the upper world to the entrance are various and the descents from one circle to another are effected by the poet and his guide in different mannerssometimes on foot through byways sometimes by the conveyance of supernatural beings the crater he finds to be the abode of those who have done neither good nor evil caring for nothing but themselves in the first circle are the whole unbaptised worldheathens and infantsmelancholy though not tormented here also is found the elysium of virgil whose charon and other infernal beings are among the agents of torment in the second circle the torments commence with the sin of incontinence and the punishment goes deepening with the crime from circle to circle through gluttony avarice prodigality wrath sullenness or unwillingness to be pleased with the creation disbelief in god and the soul with which the punishment by fire commences usury murder suicide blasphemy seduction and other carnal enormities adulation

the earth  with the centre of the globe commences the antipodean attraction of its opposite side together with a rocky ascent out of it through a huge ravine the poet and his guide on their arrival at this spot accordingly find their position reversed and so conclude their downward journey upwards till they issue forth to light on the borders of the sea which contains the island of purgatory   the journey through hell  dante says that when he was halfway on his pilgrimage through this life he one day found himself towards nightfall in a wood where he could no longer discern the right path it was a place so gloomy and terrible every thing in it growing in such a strange and savage manner that the horror he felt returned on him whenever he thought of it the pass of death could hardly be more bitter travelling through it all night with a beating heart he at length came to the foot of a hill and looking up as he began to ascend it he perceived the shoulders of the hill clad in the beams of morning a sight which gave him some little comfort he felt like a man who has buffeted his way to land out of a shipwreck and who though still anxious to get farther from his peril cannot help turning round to gaze on the wide waters so did he stand looking back on the pass that contained that dreadful wood after resting a while he again betook him up the hill but had not gone far when he beheld a leopard bounding in front of him and hindering his progress after the leopard came a lion with his head aloft mad with hunger and seeming to frighten the very air1 and after the lion more eager still a shewolf so lean that she appeared to be sharpened with every wolfish want the pilgrim fled back in terror to the wood where he again found himself in a darkness to which the light never penetrated in that place he said the sun never spoke word2 but the wolf was still close upon him3  while thus flying he beheld coming towards him a man who spoke something but he knew not what the voice sounded strange and feeble as if from disuse dante loudly called out to him to save him whether he was a man or only a spirit the apparition at whose sight the wild beasts disappeared said that he was no longer man though man he had been in the time of the false gods and sung the history of the offspring of anchises  and art thou then that virgil said dante who has filled the world with such floods of eloquence o glory and light of all poets thou art my master and thou mine author thou alone the book from which i have gathered beauties that have gained me praise behold the peril i am in and help me for i tremble in every vein and pulse  virgil comforted dante he told him that he must quit the wood by another road and that he himself would be his guide leading him first to behold the regions of woe underground and then the spirits that lived content in fire because it purified them for heaven and then that he would consign him to other hands worthier than his own which should raise him to behold heaven itself for as the pagans of whom he was one had been rebels to the law of him that reigns there nobody could arrive at paradise by their means4  so saying virgil moved on his way and dante closely followed he expressed a fear however as they went lest being neither Æneas nor st paul his journey could not be worthily undertaken nor end in wisdom but virgil after sharply rebuking him for his faintheartedness told him that the spirit of her whom he loved beatrice had come down from heaven on purpose to commend her lover to his care upon which the drooping courage of the pilgrim was raised to an undaunted confidence as flowers that have been closed and bowed down by frosty nights rise all up on their stems in the morning sun5   non vuol che n sua città per me sì vegna  the pagans could not be rebels to a law they never heard of any more than dante could be a rebel to luther but this is one of the absurdities with which the impious effrontery or scarcely less impious admissions of dantes teachers avowedly set reason at defianceretaining meanwhile their right of contempt for the impieties of mahometans and brahmins which is odd as the poet says for being not less absurd or as the others argued much more so they had at least an equal claim on the submission of the reason since the greater the irrationality the higher the theological triumph    through me is the road to the dolorous city   through me is the road to the everlasting sorrows   through me is the road to the lost people   justice was the motive of my exalted maker   i was made by divine power by consummate wisdom and by primal love   before me was no created thing if not eternal and eternal am i also   abandon hope all ye who enter  such were the words which dante beheld written in dark characters over a portal master said he to virgil i find their meaning hard  a man answered virgil must conduct himself at this door like one prepared hither must he bring no mistrust hither can come and live no cowardice we have arrived at the place i told thee of here thou art to behold the dolorous people who have lost all intellectual good 6  so saying virgil placed his hand on dantes looking on him with a cheerful countenance and the florentine passed with him through the dreadful gate  they entered upon a sightless gulf in which was a black air without stars and immediately heard a hubbub of groans and wailings and terrible things said in many languages words of wretchedness outcries of rage voices loud and hoarse and sounds of the smitings of hands one against another dante began to weep the sound was as if the sand in a whirlwind were turned into noises and filled the blind air with incessant conflict  yet these were not the souls of the wicked they were those only who had lived without praise or blame thinking of nothing but themselves these miserable creatures were mixed with the angels who stood neutral in the war with satan heaven would not dull its brightness with those angels nor would lower hell receive them lest the bad ones should triumph in their company  and what is it said dante which makes them so grievously suffer  hopelessness of death said virgil their blind existence here and immemorable former life make them so wretched that they envy every other lot mercy and justice alike disdain them let us speak of them no more look and pass  the companions went on till they came to a great river with a multitude waiting on the banks a hoary old man appeared crossing the river towards them in a boat and as he came he said woe to the wicked never expect to see heaven i come to bear you across to the dark regions of everlasting fire and ice then looking at dante he said get thee away from the dead thou who standest there live spirit  torment thyself not charon said virgil he has a passport beyond thy power to question  the shaggy cheeks of the boatman of the livid lake who had wheels of fire about his eyes fell at these words and he was silent but the naked multitude of souls whom he had spoken to changed colour and gnashed their teeth blaspheming god and their parents and the human species and the place and the hour and the seed of the sowing of their birth and all the while they felt themselves driven onwards by a fear which became a desire towards the cruel riverside which awaits every one destitute of the fear of god the demon charon beckoning to them with eyes like brasiers collected them as they came giving blows to those that lingered with his oar one by one they dropped into the boat like leaves from a bough in autumn till the bough is left bare or as birds drop into the decoy at the sound of the birdcall  there was then an earthquake so terrible that the recollection of it made the poet burst into a sweat at every pore a whirlwind issued from the lamenting ground attended by vermilion flashes and he lost his senses and fell like a man stupefied  a crash of thunder through his brain woke up the pilgrim so hastily that he shook himself like a person roused by force he found that he was on the brink of a gulf from which ascended a thunderous sound of innumerable groanings he could see nothing down it it was too dark with sooty clouds virgil himself turned pale but said we are to go down here i will lead the way  o master said dante if even thou fearest what is to become of myself it is pity not fear replied virgil that makes me change colour  with these words his guide led him into the first circle of hell surrounding the abyss the great noise gradually ceased to be heard as they journeyed inwards till at last they became aware of a world of sighs which produced a trembling in the air they were breathed by the souls of such as had died without baptism men women and infants no matter how good no matter if they worshipped god before the coming of christ for they worshipped him not properly virgil himself was one of them they were all lost for no other reason and their only suffering consisted in hopeless desire  dante was struck with great sorrow when he heard this knowing how many good men must be in that place he inquired if no one had ever been taken out of it into heaven virgil told him there had and he named them to wit adam abel noah moses king david obedient abraham the patriarch and isaac and jacob with their children and rachel for whom jacob did so muchand many more adding however that there was no instance of salvation before theirs  journeying on through spirits as thick as leaves dante perceived a lustre at a little distance and observing shapes in it evidently of great dignity inquired who they were that thus lived apart from the rest virgil said that heaven thus favoured them by reason of their renown on earth a voice was then heard exclaiming honour and glory to the lofty poet lo his shade returns dante then saw four other noble figures coming towards them of aspect neither sad nor cheerful  observe him with the sword in his hand said virgil as they were advancing that is homer the poets sovereign next to him comes horace the satirist then ovid and the last is lucan  and thus i beheld says dante the bright school of the loftiest of poets who flies above the rest like an eagle  for a while the illustrious spirits talked together and then turned to the florentine with a benign salutation at which his master smiled and further honour they did me adds the father of italian poetry for they admitted me of their tribe so that to a band of that high account i added a sixth 7  the spirits returned towards the bright light in which they lived talking with dante by the way and brought him to a magnificent castle girt with seven lofty walls and further defended with a river which they all passed as if it had been dry ground seven gates conducted them into a meadow of fresh green the resort of a race whose eyes moved with a deliberate soberness and whose whole aspects were of great authority their voices sweet and their speech seldom8 dante was taken apart to an elevation in the ground so that he could behold them all distinctly and there on the enamelled green 9 were pointed out to him the great spirits by the sight of whom he felt exalted in his own esteem he saw electra with many companions among whom were hector and Æneas and cæsar in armour with his hawks eyes and on another side he beheld old king latinus with his daughter lavinia and the brutus that expelled tarquin and lucretia and julia and catos wife marcia and the mother of the gracchi and apart by himself the sultan saladin he then raised his eyes a little and beheld the master of those who know 10 aristotle sitting amidst the family of philosophers and honoured by them all socrates and plato were at his side among the rest was democritus who made the world a chance and diogenes and heraclitus c and dioscorides the good gatherer of simples orpheus also he saw and cicero and the moral seneca and euclid and hippocrates and avicen and averroes who wrote the great commentary and others too numerous to mention the company of six became diminished to two and virgil took him forth on a far different road leaving that serene air for a stormy one and so they descended again into darkness  it was the second circle into which they now camea sphere narrower than the first and by so much more the wretcheder minos sat at the entrance gnarlinghe that gives sentence on every one that comes and intimates the circle into which each is to be plunged by the number of folds into which he casts his tail round about him minos admonished dante to beware how he entered unbidden and warned him against his conductor but virgil sharply rebuked the judge and bade him not set his will against the will that was power  the pilgrims then descended through hellmouth till they came to a place dark as pitch that bellowed with furious crosswinds like a sea in a tempest it was the first place of torment and the habitation of carnal sinners the winds full of stifled voices buffeted the souls for ever whirling them away to and fro and dashing them against one another whenever it seized them for that purpose the wailing and the shrieking was loudest crying out against the divine power sometimes a whole multitude came driven in a body like starlings before the wind now hither and thither now up now down sometimes they went in a line like cranes when a company of those birds is beheld sailing along in the air uttering its dolorous clangs  dante seeing a group of them advancing inquired of virgil who they were who are these said he coming hither scourged in the blackest part of the hurricane  she at the head of them said virgil was empress over many nations so foul grew her heart with lust that she ordained license to be law to the end that herself might be held blameless she is semiramis of whom it is said that she gave suck to ninus and espoused him leading the multitude next to her is dido she that slew herself for love and broke faith to the ashes of sichaeus and she that follows with the next is the luxurious woman cleopatra  dante then saw helen who produced such a world of misery and the great achilles who fought for love till it slew him and paris and tristan and a thousand more whom his guide pointed at naming their names every one of whom was lost through love  the poet stood for a while speechless for pity and like one bereft of his wits he then besought leave to speak to a particular couple who went side by side and who appeared to be borne before the wind with speed lighter than the rest his conductor bade him wait till they came nigher and then to entreat them gently by the love which bore them in that manner and they would stop and speak with him dante waited his time and then lifted up his voice between the gusts of wind and adjured the two weary souls to halt and have speech with him if none forbade their doing so upon which they came to him like doves to the nest11  there was a lull in the tempest as if on purpose to let them speak and the female addressed dante saying that as he showed such pity for their state they would have prayed heaven to give peace and repose to his life had they possessed the friendship of heaven12  love she said which is soon kindled in a gentle heart seized this my companion for the fair body i once inhabitedhow deprived of it my spirit is bowed to recollect love which compels the beloved person upon thoughts of love seized me in turn with a delight in his passion so strong that as thou seest even here it forsakes me not love brought us both to one end the punishment of cain awaits him that slew us  the poet was struck dumb by this story he hung down his head and stood looking on the ground so long that his guide asked him what was in his mind alas answered he such then was this love so full of sweet thoughts and such the pass to which it brought them oh francesca he cried turning again to the sad couple thy sufferings make me weep but tell me i pray thee what was it that first made thee know for a certainty that his love was returnedthat thou couldst refuse him thine no longer  there is not a greater sorrow answered she than calling to mind happy moments in the midst of wretchedness13 but since thy desire is so great to know our story to the root hear me tell it as well as i may for tears it chanced one day that we sat reading the tale of sir launcelot how love took him in thrall we were alone and had no suspicion often as we read our eyes became suspended14 and we changed colour but one passage alone it was that overcame us when we read how genevra smiled and how the lover out of the depth of his love could not help kissing that smile he that is never more to be parted from me kissed me himself on the mouth all in a tremble never had we gobetween but that book the writer was the betrayer that day we read no more  while these words were being uttered by one of the spirits the other wailed so bitterly that the poet thought he should have died for pity his senses forsook him and he fell flat on the ground as a dead body falls15  on regaining his senses the poet found himself in the third circle of hell a place of everlasting wet darkness and cold one heavy slush of hail and mud emitting a squalid smell the tripleheaded dog cerberus with red eyes and greasy black beard large belly and hands with claws barked above the heads of the wretches who floundered in the mud tearing skinning and dismembering them as they turned their sore and soddened bodies from side to side when he saw the two living men he showed his fangs and shook in every limb for desire of their flesh virgil threw lumps of dirt into his mouth and so they passed him  it was the place of gluttons the travellers passed over them as if they had been ground to walk upon but one of them sat up and addressed the florentine as his acquaintance dante did not know him for the agony in his countenance he was a man nicknamed hog ciacco and by no other name does the poet or any one else mention him his countryman addressed him by it though declaring at the same time that he wept to see him hog prophesied evil to his discordant native city adding that there were but two just men in itall the rest being given up to avarice envy and pride dante inquired by name respecting the fate of five other florentines who had done good and was informed that they were all for various offences in lower gulfs of hell hog then begged that he would mention having seen him when he returned to the sweet world and so looking at him a little bent his head and disappeared among his blinded companions  satan hoa satan roared the demon plutus as the poets were descending into the fourth circle  peace cried virgil with thy swollen lip thou accursed wolf no one can hinder his coming down god wills it 16  flat fell plutus collapsed like the sails of a vessel when the mast is split  this circle was the most populous one they had yet come to the sufferers gifted with supernatural might kept eternally rolling round it one against another with terrific violence and so dashing apart and returning why grasp cried the onewhy throw away cried the other and thus exclaiming they dashed furiously together  they were the avaricious and the prodigal multitudes of them were churchmen including cardinals and popes not all the gold beneath the moon could have purchased them a moments rest dante asked if none of them were to be recognised by their countenances virgil said no for the stupid and sullied lives which they led on earth swept their faces away from all distinction for ever  in discoursing of fortune they descend by the side of a torrent black as ink into the fifth circle or place of torment for the angry the sullen and the proud here they first beheld a filthy marsh full of dirty naked bodies that in everlasting rage tore one another to pieces in a quieter division of the pool were seen nothing but bubbles carried by the ascent from its slimy bottom of the stifled words of the sullen they were always saying we were sad and dark within us in the midst of the sweet sunshine and now we live sadly in the dark bogs the poets walked on till they came to the foot of a tower which hung out two blazing signals to another just discernible in the distance a boat came rapidly towards them ferried by the wrathful phlegyas17 who cried out aha felon and so thou hast come at last  thou errest said virgil we come for no longer time than it will take thee to ferry us across thy pool  phlegyas looked like one defrauded of his right but proceeded to convey them during their course a spirit rose out of the mire looking dante in the face and said who art thou that comest before thy time  who art thou said dante  thou seest who i am answered the other one among the mourners  then mourn still and howl accursed spirit returned the florentine i know thee all over filth as thou art  the wretch in fury laid hold of the boat but virgil thrust him back exclaiming down with thee down among the other dogs  then turning to dante he embraced and kissed him saying o soul that knows how to disdain blessed be she that bore thee arrogant truly upon earth was this sinner nor is his memory graced by a single virtue hence the furiousness of his spirit now how many kings are there at this moment lording it as gods who shall wallow here as he does like swine in the mud and be thought no better of by the world i should like to see him smothering in it said dante before we go  a right wish said virgil and thou shalt to thy hearts content  on a sudden the wretchs muddy companions seized and drenched him so horribly that exclaims dante i laud and thank god for it now at this moment  have at him cried they have at filippo argenti and the wild fool of a florentine dashed his teeth for rage into his own flesh18  the poets attention was now drawn off by a noise of lamentation and he perceived that he was approaching the city of dis19 the turrets glowed vermilion with the fire within it the walls appeared to be of iron and moats were round about them the boat circuited the walls till the travellers came to a gate which phlegyas with a loud voice told them to quit the boat and enter but a thousand fallen angels crowded over the top of the gate refusing to open it and making furious gestures at length they agreed to let virgil speak with them inside and he left dante for a while standing in terror without the parley was in vain they would not let them pass virgil however bade his companion be of good cheer and then stood listening and talking to himself disclosing by his words his expectation of some extraordinary assistance and at the same time his anxiety for its arrival on a sudden three raging figures arose over the gate coloured with gore green hydras twisted about them and their fierce temples had snakes instead of hair  look said virgil the furies the one on the left is megæra alecto is she that is wailing on the right and in the middle is tisiphone virgil then hushed the furies stood clawing their breasts smiting their hands together and raising such hideous cries that dante clung to his friend  bring the gorgons head cried the furies looking down turn him to adamant  turn round said virgil and hide thy face for if thou beholdest the gorgon never again wilt thou see the light of day and with these words he seized dante and turned him round himself clapping his hands over his companions eyes  and now was heard coming over the water a terrible crashing noise that made the banks on either side of it tremble it was like a hurricane which comes roaring through the vain shelter of the woods splitting and hurling away the boughs sweeping along proudly in a huge cloud of dust and making herds and herdsmen fly before it now stretch your eyesight across the water said virgil letting loose his handsthere where the smoke of the foam is thickest dante looked and saw a thousand of the rebel angels like frogs before a serpent swept away into a heap before the coming of a single spirit who flew over the tops of the billows with unwet feet the spirit frequently pushed the gross air from before his face as if tired of the base obstacle and as he came nearer dante who saw it was a messenger from heaven looked anxiously at virgil virgil motioned him to be silent and bow down  the angel with a face full of scorn as soon as he arrived at the gate touched it with a wand that he had in his hand and it flew open  outcasts of heaven said he despicable race whence this fantastical arrogance do ye forget that your torments are laid oil thicker every time ye kick against the fates do ye forget how your cerberus was bound and chained till he lost the hair off his neck like a common dog  so saying he turned swiftly and departed the way he came not addressing a word to the travellers his countenance had suddenly a look of some other business totally different from the one he had terminated  the companions passed in and beheld a place full of tombs redhot it was the region of arch heretics and their followers dante and his guide passed round betwixt the walls and the sepulchres as in a churchyard and came to the quarter which held epicurus and his sect who denied the existence of spirit apart from matter the lids of the tombs remaining unclosed till the day of judgment the soul of a noble florentine farinata degli uberti hearing dante speak addressed him as a countryman asking him to stop20 dante alarmed beheld him rise half out of his sepulchre looking as lofty as if he scorned hell itself finding who dante was he boasted of having three times expelled the guelphs perhaps so said the poet but they came back again each time an art which their enemies have not yet acquired  a visage then appeared from out another tomb looking eagerly as if it expected to see some one else being disappointed the tears came into its eyes and the sufferer said if it is thy genius that conducts thee hither where is my son and why is he not with thee  it is not my genius that conducts me said dante but that of one whom perhaps thy son held in contempt  how sayest thou cried the shadeheld in contempt he is dead then he beholds no longer the sweet light and with these words he dropped into his tomb and was seen no more it was cavalcante cavalcanti the father of the poets friend guido21  the shade of farinata who had meantime been looking on now replied to the taunt of dante prophesying that he should soon have good reason to know that the art he spoke of had been acquired upon which dante speaking with more considerateness to the lofty sufferer requested to know how the gift of prophecy could belong to spirits who were ignorant of the time present farinata answered that so it was just as there was a kind of eyesight which could discern things at a distance though not at hand dante then expressed his remorse at not having informed cavalcante that his son was alive he said it was owing to his being overwhelmed with thought on the subject he had just mentioned and entreated farinata to tell him so  quitting this part of the cemetery virgil led him through the midst of it towards a descent into a valley from which there ascended a loathsome odour they stood behind one of the tombs for a while to accustom themselves to the breath of it and then began to descend a wild fissure in a rock near the mouth of which lay the infamy of crete the minotaur the monster beholding them gnawed himself for rage and on their persisting to advance began plunging like a bull when he is stricken by the knife of the butcher they succeeded however in entering the fissure before he recovered sufficiently from his madness to run at them and at the foot of the descent came to a river of boiling blood on the strand of which ran thousands of centaurs armed with bows and arrows in the blood more or less deep according to the amount of the crime and shrieking as they boiled were the souls of the inflicters of violence and if any of them emerged from it higher than he had a right to do the centaurs drove him down with their arrows nessus the one that bequeathed hercules the poisoned garment came galloping towards the pilgrims bending his bow and calling out from a distance to know who they were but virgil disdaining his hasty character would explain himself only to chiron the centaur who instructed achilles chiron in consequence bade nessus accompany them along the river and there they saw tyrants immersed up to the eyebrowsalexander the great among them dionysius of syracuse and ezzelino the paduan there was one of the pazzi of florence and rinieri of corneto infestors of the public ways now shedding bloody tears and attila the scourge and pyrrhus king of epirus further on among those immersed up to the throat was guy de montfort the englishman who slew his fathers slayer prince henry during divine service in the bosom of god and then by degrees the river became shallower and shallower till it covered only the feet and here the centaur quitted the pilgrims and they crossed over into a forest  the forest was a trackless and dreadful forestthe leaves not green but blackthe boughs not freely growing but knotted and twistedthe fruit no fruit but thorny poison the harpies wailed among the trees occasionally showing their human faces and on every side of him dante heard lamenting human voices but could see no one from whom they came pluck one of the boughs said virgil dante did so and blood and a cry followed it  why pluckest thou me said the trunk men have we been like thyself but thou couldst not use us worse had we been serpents the blood and words came out together as a green bough hisses and spits in the fire  the voice was that of piero delle vigne the good chancellor of the emperor frederick the second just though he had been to others he was thus tormented for having been unjust to himself for envy having wronged him to his sovereign who sentenced him to lose his eyes he dashed his brains out against a wall piero entreated dante to vindicate his memory the poet could not speak for pity so virgil made the promise for him inquiring at the same time in what manner it was that suicides became thus identified with trees and how their souls were to rejoin their bodies at the day of judgment piero said that the moment the fierce selfmurderers spirit tore itself from the body and passed before charon it fell like a grain of corn into that wood and so grew into a tree the harpies then fed on its leaves causing both pain and a vent for lamentation the body it would never again enter having thus cast away itself but it would finally drag the body down to it by a violent attraction and every suicides carcass will be hung upon the thorn of its wretched shade  the naked souls of two men whose profusion had brought them to a violent end here came running through the wood from the fangs of black female mastiffsleaving that of a suicide to mourn the havoc which their passage had made of his tree he begged his countryman to gather his leaves up and lay them at the foot of his trunk and dante did so and then he and virgil proceeded on their journey  they issued from the wood on a barren sand flaming hot on which multitudes of naked souls lay down or sat huddled up or restlessly walked about trying to throw from them incessant flakes of fire which came down like a fall of snow they were the souls of the impious among them was a great spirit who lay scornfully submitting himself to the fiery shower as though it had not yet ripened him22 overhearing dante ask his guide who he was he answered for himself and said the same dead as living jove will tire his flames out before they conquer me  capaneus exclaimed virgil thy pride is thy punishment no martyrdom were sufficient for thee equal to thine own rage the besieger of thebes made no reply  in another quarter of the fiery shower the pilgrims met a crowd of florentines mostly churchmen whose offence is not to be named after which they beheld usurers and then arrived at a huge waterfall which fell into the eighth circle or that of the fraudulent here virgil by way of bait to the monster geryon or fraud let down over the side of the waterfall the cord of st francis which dante wore about his waist23 and presently the dreadful creature came up and sate on the margin of the fall with his serpents tail hanging behind him in the air after the manner of a beaver but the point of the tail was occasionally seen glancing upwards he was a gigantic reptile with the face of a just man very mild he had shaggy claws for arms and a body variegated all over with colours that ran in knots and circles each within the other richer than any eastern drapery virgil spoke apart to him and then mounted on his back bidding his companion who was speechless for terror do the salve geryon pushed back with them from the edge of the precipice like a ship leaving harbour and then turning about wheeled like a sullen successless falcon slowly down through the air in many a circuit dante would not have known that he was going downward but for the air that struck up wards on his face presently they heard the crash of the waterfall on the circle below and then distinguished flaming fires and the noises of suffering the monster geryon ever sullen as the falcon who seats himself at a distance from his dissatisfied master shook his riders from off his back to the waters side and then shot away like an arrow  this eighth circle of hell is called evilbudget24 and consists of ten compartments or gulfs of torment crossed and connected with one another by bridges of flint in the first were beheld pimps and seducers scourged like children by horned devils in the second flatterers begrimed with ordure in the third simonists who were stuck like plugs into circular apertures with their heads downwards and their legs only discernible the soles of their feet glowing with a fire which made them incessantly quiver dante going down the side of the gulf with virgil was allowed to address one of them who seemed in greater agony than the rest and doing so the sufferer cried out in a malignant rapture aha is it thou that standest there boniface25 thou hast come sooner than it was prophesied it was the soul of pope nicholas the third that spoke dante undeceived and then sternly rebuked him for his avarice and depravity telling him that nothing but reverence for the keys of st peter hindered him from using harsher words and that it was such as he that the evangelist beheld in the vision when he saw the woman with seven heads and ten horns who committed whoredom with the kings of the earth  o constantine exclaimed the poet of what a world of evil was that dowry the mother which first converted the pastor of the church into a rich man 26 the feet of the guilty pope spun with fiercer agony at these words and virgil looking pleased on dante returned with him the way he came till they found themselves on the margin of the fourth gulf the habitation of the souls of false prophets  it was a valley in which the souls came walking along silent and weeping at the pace of choristers who chant litanies their faces were turned the wrong way so that the backs of their heads came foremost and their tears fell on their loins dante was so overcome at the sight that he leant against a rock and wept but virgil rebuked him telling him that no pity at all was the only pity fit for that place27 there was amphiaraus whom the earth opened and swallowed up at thebes and tiresias who was transformed from sex to sex and aruns who lived in a cavern on the side of the marble mountains of carrara looking out on the stars and ocean and manto daughter of tiresias her hind tresses over her bosom who wandered through the world till she came and lived in the solitary fen whence afterwards arose the city of mantua and michael scot the magician with his slender loins28 and eurypylus the grecian augur who gave the signal with calchas at troy when to cut away the cables for home he came stooping along projecting his face over his swarthy shoulders guido bonatti too was there astrologer of forli and ardente shoemaker of parma who now wishes he had stuck to his last and the wretched women who quit the needle and the distaff to wreak their malice with herbs and images such was the punishment of those who desiring to see too far before them now looked only behind them and walked the reverse way of their looking  the fifth gulf was a lake of boiling pitch constantly heaving and subsiding throughout and bubbling with the breath of those within it they were public peculators winged black devils were busy about the lake pronging the sinners when they occasionally darted up their backs for relief like dolphins or thrust out their jaws like frogs dante at first looked eagerly down into the gulf like one who feels that he shall turn away instantly out of the very horror that attracts him seelook behind thee said virgil dragging him at the same time from the place where he stood to a covert behind a crag dante looked round and beheld a devil coming up with a newlyarrived sinner across his shoulders whom he hurled into the lake and then dashed down after him like a mastiff let loose on a thief it was a man from lucca where every soul was a false dealer except bonturo29 the devil called out to other devils and a heap of them fell upon the wretch with hooks as he rose to the surface telling him that he must practise there in secret if he practised at all and thrusting him back into the boiling pitch as cooks thrust back flesh into the pot the devils were of the lowest and most revolting habits of which they made disgusting jest and parade  some of them on a sudden perceived dante and his guide and were going to seize them when virgil resorted to his usual holy rebuke for a while they let him alone and dante saw one of them haul a sinner out of the pitch by the clotted locks and hold him up sprawling like an otter the rest then fell upon him and flayed him  it was ciampolo a peculator in the service of the good thiebault king of navarre one of his companions under the pitch was friar gomita governor of gallura and another michael zanche also a sardinian ciampolo ultimately escaped by a trick out of the hands of the devils who were so enraged that they turned upon the two pilgrims but virgil catching up dante with supernatural force as a mother does a child in a burning house plunged with him out of their jurisdiction into the borders of gulf the sixth the region of hypocrites  the hypocrites in perpetual tears walked about in a wearisome and exhausted manner as if ready to faint they wore huge cowls which hung over their eyes and the outsides of which were gilded but the insides of lead two of them had been rulers of florence and dante was listening to their story when his attention was called off by the sight of a cross on which caiaphas the high priest was writhing breathing hard all the while through his beard with sighs it was his office to see that every soul which passed him on its arrival in the place was oppressed with the due weight his fatherinlaw annas and all his council were stuck in like manner on crosses round the borders of the gulf the pilgrims beheld little else in this region of weariness and soon passed into the borders of one of the most terrible portions of evilbudget the land of the transformation of robbers  the place was thronged with serpents of the most appalling and unwonted description among which ran tormented the naked spirits of the robbers agonised with fear their hands were bound behind them with serpentstheir bodies pierced and enfolded with serpents dante saw one of the monsters leap up and transfix a man through the nape of the neck when lo sooner than a pen could write o or i the sufferer burst into flames burnt up fell to the earth a heap of asheswas again brought together and again became a man aghast with his agony and staring about him sighing30 virgil asked him who he was  i was but lately rained down into this dire gullet said the man amidst a shower of tuscans the beast vanni fucci am i who led a brutal life like the mule that i was in that den pistoia  compel him to stop said dante and relate what brought him hither i knew the bloody and choleric wretch when he was alive  the sinner who did not pretend to be deaf to these words turned round to the speaker with the most painful shame in his face and said i feel more bitterly at being caught here by thee in this condition than when i first arrived a power which i cannot resist compels me to let thee know that i am here because i committed sacrilege and charged another with the crime but now mark me that thou mayest hear something not to render this encounter so pleasant pistoia hates thy party of the whites and longs for the blacks back again it will have them and so will florence and there will be a bloody cloud shall burst over the battlefield of piceno which will dash many whites to the earth i tell thee this to make thee miserable  so saying the wretch gave a gesture of contempt with his thumb and finger towards heaven and said take it goda fig for thee 31  from that instant said dante the serpents and i were friends for one of them throttled him into silence and another dashed his hands into a knot behind his back o pistoia pistoia why art not thou thyself turned into ashes and swept from the face of the earth since thy race has surpassed in evil thine ancestors never through the whole darkness of hell beheld i a blasphemer so dire as thisnot even capaneus himself  the pistoian fled away with the serpents upon him followed by a centaur who came madly galloping up crying where is the caitiff it was the monsterthief cacus whose den upon earth often had a pond of blood before it and to whom hercules in his rage when he slew him gave a whole hundred blows with his club though the wretch perceived nothing after the ninth he was all over adders up to the mouth and upon his shoulders lay a dragon with its wings open breathing fire on whomsoever it met  the centaur tore away and dante and virgil were gazing after him when they heard voices beneath the bank on which they stood crying who are ye the pilgrims turned their eyes downwards and beheld three spirits one of whom looking about him said wheres cianfa dante made a sign to virgil to say nothing  cianfa came forth a man lately but now a serpent with six feet32  if thou art slow to believe reader what i am about to tell thee says the poet be so it is no marvel for i myself even now scarcely credit what i beheld  the sixfooted serpent sprang at one of the three men front to front clasping him tightly with all its legs and plunging his fangs into either cheek ivy never stuck so close to a tree as the horrible monster grappled with every limb of that pinioned man the two forms then gradually mingled into one another like melting wax the colours of their skin giving way at the same time to a third colour as the white in a piece of burning paper recedes before the brown till it all becomes black the other two human shapes looked on exclaiming oh how thou changest agnello see thou art neither two nor yet one and truly though the two heads first became one there still remained two countenances in the face the four arms then became but two and such also became the legs and thighs and the two trunks became such a body as was never beheld and the hideous twofold monster walked slowly away33  a small black serpent on fire now flashed like lightning on to the body of one of the other two piercing him in the navel and then falling on the ground and lying stretched before him the wounded man fascinated and mute stood looking at the adders eyes and endeavouring to stand steady on his legs yawning the while as if smitten with lethargy or fever the adder on his part looked up at the eyes of the man and both of them breathed hard and sent forth a smoke that mingled into one volume  and now let lucan never speak more of the wretched sabellus or nisidius but listen and be silent and now let ovid be silent nor speak again of his serpent that was cadmus or his fountain that was arethusa for says the tuscan poet i envy him not never did he change the natures of two creatures face to face so that each received the form of the other  with corresponding impulse the serpent split his train into a fork while the man drew his legs together into a train the skin of the serpent grew soft while the mans hardened the serpent acquired tresses of hair the man grew hairless the claws of the one projected into legs while the arms of the other withdrew into his shoulders the face of the serpent as it rose from the ground retreated towards the temples pushing out human ears that of the man as he fell to the ground thrust itself forth into a muzzle withdrawing at the same time its ears into its head as the slug does its horns and each creature kept its impious eyes fixed on the others while the features beneath the eyes were changing the soul which had become the serpent then turned to crawl away hissing in scorn as he departed and the serpent which had become the man spat after him and spoke words at him the new humanlooking soul then turned his back on his late adversary and said to the third spirit who remained unchanged let buoso now take to his crawl as i have done  the two then hastened away together leaving dante in a state of bewildered amazement yet not so confused but that he recognised the unchanged one for another of his countrymen puccio the lame joy to thee florence cried the poet not content with having thy name bruited over land and sea it flourishes throughout hell  the pilgrims now quitted the seventh and looked down from its barrier into the eighth gulf where they saw innumerable flames distinct from one another flickering all over the place like fireflies  in those flames said virgil are souls each tormented with the fire that swathes it  i observe one said dante divided at the summit are the theban brothers in it  no replied virgil in that flame are diomed and ulysses the sinners punished in this gulf were evil counsellors and those two were the advisers of the stratagem of the trojan horse  virgil addressed ulysses who told him the conclusion of his adventures not to be found in books how he tired of an idle life and sailed forth again into the wide ocean and how he sailed so far that he came into a region of new stars and in sight of a mountain the loftiest he ever saw when unfortunately a hurricane fell upon them from the shore thrice whirled their vessel round then dashed the stern up in air and the prow under water and sent the billows over their heads  enough said virgil i trouble thee no more the soul of guido di montefeltro overhearing the great mantuan speak in a lombard dialect asked him news of the state of things in romagna and then told him how he had lost his chance of paradise by thinking pope boniface could at once absolve him from his sins and use them for his purposes34 he was going to heaven he said by the help of st francis who came on purpose to fetch him when a black angel met them and demanded his absolved indeed but unrepented victim to repent evil and to will to do it at one and the same time are said the dreadful angel impossible therefore wrong me not  oh how i shook said the unhappy guido when he laid his hands upon me and with these words the flame writhed and beat itself about for agony and so took its way  the pilgrims crossed over to the banks of the ninth gulf where the sowers of scandal the schismatics heretics and founders of false religions underwent the penalties of such as load themselves with the sins of those whom they seduce  the first sight they beheld was mahomet tearing open his own bowels and calling out to them to mark him before him walked his soninlaw ali weeping and cloven to the chin and the divisions in the church were punished in like manner upon all the schismatics in the place they all walked round the circle their gashes closing as they went and on their reaching a certain point a fiend hewed them open again with a sword the arabian prophet ere he passed on bade the pilgrims warn friar dolcino how he suffered himself to be surprised in his mountainhold by the starvations of wintertime if he did not wish speedily to follow him35  among other mangled wretches they beheld piero of medicina a sower of dissension exhibiting to them his face and throat all over wounds and curio compelled to shew his tongue cut out for advising cæsar to cross the rubicon and mosca de lamberti an adviser of assassination and one of the authors of the guelf and ghibelline miseries holding up the bleeding stumps of his arms which dripped on his face remember mosca cried he remember him alas who said a deed done is a thing ended a bad saying of mine was that for the tuscan nation  and death to thy family cried dante  the assassin hurried away like a man driven mad with grief upon grief and dante now beheld a sight which if it were not he says for the testimony of a good consciencethat best of friends which gives a man assurance of himself under the breastplate of a spotless innocence36he should be afraid to relate without further proof he sawand while he was writing the account of it he still appeared to seea headless trunk about to come past him with the others it held its severed head by the hair like a lantern and the head looked up at the two pilgrims and said woe is me the head was in fact a lantern to the paths of the trunk and thus there were two separated things in one and one in two and how that could be he only can tell who ordained it as the figure came nearer it lifted the head aloft that the pilgrims might hear better what it said behold it said behold thou that walkest living among the dead and say if there be any punishment like this i am bertrand de born he that incited john of england to rebel against his father father and son i set at varianceclosest affections i set at varianceand hence do i bear my brain severed from the body on which it grew in me behold the work of retribution 37  the eyes of dante were so inebriate with all that diversity of bleeding wounds that they longed to stay and weep ere his guide proceeded further something also struck them on the sudden which added to his desire to stop but virgil asked what ailed him and why he stood gazing still on the wretched multitude thou hast not done so continued he in any other portion of this circle and the valley is twentytwo miles further about and the moon already below us thou hast more yet to see than thou wottest of and the time is short  dante excusing himself for the delay and proceeding to follow his leader said he thought he had seen in the cavern at which he was gazing so hard a spirit that was one of his own familyand it was so it was the soul of geri del bello a cousin of the poets virgil said that he had observed him while dante was occupied with bertrand de born pointing at his kinsman in a threatening manner waste not a thought on him concluded the roman but leave him as he is o honoured guide said dante he died a violent death which his kinsmen have not yet avenged and hence it is that he disdained to speak to me and i must needs feel for him the more on that account 38  they came now to the last partition of the circle of evilbudget and their ears were assailed with such a burst of sharp wailings that dante was fain to close his with his hands the misery there accompanied by a horrible odour was as if all the hospitals in the sultry marshes of valdichiana had brought their maladies together into one infernal ditch it was the place of punishment for pretended alchemists coiners personators of other people false accusers and impostors of all such descriptions they lay on one another in heaps or attempted to crawl aboutsome itching madly with leprosiessome swollen and gasping with dropsiessome wetly reeking like hands washed in wintertime one was an alchemist of sienna a nation vainer than the french another a florentine who tricked a man into making a wrong will another sinon of troy another myrrha another the wife of potiphar their miseries did not hinder them from giving one another malignant blows and dante was listening eagerly to an abusive conversation between sinon and a brescian coiner when virgil rebuked him for the disgraceful condescension and said it was a pleasure fit only for vulgar minds39  the blushing poet felt the reproof so deeply that he could not speak for shame though he manifested by his demeanour that he longed to do so and thus obtained the pardon he despaired of he says he felt like a man that during an unhappy dream wishes himself dreaming while he is so and does not know it virgil understood his emotion and as achilles did with his spear healed the wound with the tongue that inflicted it  a silence now ensued between the companions for they had quitted evilbudget and arrived at the ninth great circle of hell on the mound of which they passed along looking quietly and steadily before them daylight had given place to twilight and dante was advancing his head a little and endeavouring to discern objects in the distance when his whole attention was called to one particular spot by a blast of a horn so loud that a thunder clap was a whisper in comparison orlando himself blew no such terrific blast after the dolorous rout when charlemagne was defeated in his holy enterprise40 the poet raised his head thinking he perceived a multitude of lofty towers he asked virgil to what region they belonged but virgil said those are no towers they are giants standing each up to his middle in the pit that goes round this circle dante looked harder and as objects clear up by little and little in the departing mist he saw with alarm the tremendous giants that warred against jove standing half in and half out of the pit like the towers that crowned the citadel of monteseggione the one whom he saw plainest and who stood with his arms hanging down on each side appeared to him to have a face as huge as the pinnacle of st peters and limbs throughout in proportion the monster as the pilgrims were going by opened his dreadful mouth fit for no sweeter psalmody and called after them in the words of some unknown tongue rafel maee amech zabee almee41 dull wretch exclaimed virgil keep to thine horn and so vent better whatsoever frenzy or other passion stuff thee feel the chain round thy throat thou confusion see what a clenching hoop is about thy gorge then he said to dante his howl is its own mockery this is nimrod he through whose evil ambition it was that mankind ceased to speak one language pass him and say nothing for every other tongue is to him as his is to thee  the companions went on for about the length of a slings throw when they passed the second giant who was much fiercer and linger than nimrod he was fettered round and round with chains that fixed one arm before him and the other behind himephialtes his name the same that would needs make trial of his strength against jove himself the hands which he then wielded were now motionless but he shook with passion and dante thought he should have died for terror the effect on the ground about him was so fearful it surpassed that of a tower shaken by an earthquake the poet expressed a wish to look at briareus but he was too far off he saw however antæus who not having fought against heaven was neither tongueconfounded nor shackled and virgil requested the taker of a thousand lions by the fame which the living poet had it in his power to give him to bear the travellers in his arms down the steep descent into this deeper portion of hell which was the region of tormenting cold antmus stooping like the leaning tower of bologna to take them up gathered them in his arms and depositing them in the gulf below raised himself to depart like the mast of a ship42  had i hoarse and rugged words equal to my subject says the poet i would now make them fuller of expression to suit the rocky horror of this hole of anguish but i have not and therefore approach it with fear since it is no jesting enterprise to describe the depths of the universe nor fit for a tongue that babbles of father and mother43 let such of the muses assist me as turned the words of amphion into theban walls so shall the speech be not too far different from the matter  oh illstarred creatures wretched beyond all others to inhabit a place so hard to speak ofbetter had ye been sheep or goats  the poet was beginning to walk with his guide along the place in which the giant had set them down and was still looking up at the height from which he had descended when a voice close to him said have a care where thou treadest hurt not with thy feet the heads of thy unhappy brethren  dante looked down and before him and saw that he was walking on a lake of ice in which were murderous traitors up to their chins their teeth chattering their faces held down their eyes locked up frozen with tears dante saw two at his feet so closely stuck together that the very hairs of their heads were mingled he asked them who they were and as they lifted up their heads for astonishment and felt the cold doubly congeal them they dashed their heads against one another for hate and fury they were two brothers who had murdered each other44 near them were other tuscans one of whom the cold had deprived of his ears and thousands more were seen grinning like dogs for the pain  dante as he went along kicked the face of one of them whether by chance or fate or will45 he could not say the sufferer burst into tears and cried out wherefore dost thou torment me art thou come to revenge the defeat at montaperto the pilgrim at this question felt eager to know who he was but the unhappy wretch would not tell his countryman seized him by the hair to force him but still he said he would not tell were he to be scalped a thousand times dante upon this began plucking up his hairs by the roots the man barking46 with his eyes squeezed up at every pull when another soul exclaimed why bocca what the devil ails thee must thou needs bark for cold as well as chatter 47  now accursed traitor betrayer of thy countrys standard said dante be dumb if thou wilt for i shall tell thy name to the world  tell and begone said bocca but carry the name of this babbler with thee tis buoso who left the pass open to the enemy between piedmont and parma and near him is the traitor for the pope beccaria and ganellone who betrayed charlemagne and tribaldello who opened faenza to the enemy at nighttime  the pilgrims went on and beheld two other spirits so closely locked up together in one hole of the ice that the head of one was right over the others like a cowl and dante to his horror saw that the upper head was devouring the lower with all the eagerness of a man who is famished the poet asked what could possibly make him skew a hate so brutal adding that if there were any ground for it he would tell the story to the world48  the sinner raised his head from the dire repast and after wiping his jaws with the hair of it said you ask a thing which it shakes me to the heart to think of it is a story to renew all my misery but since it will produce this wretch his due infamy hear it and you shall see me speak and weep at the same time how thou tamest hither i know not but i perceive by thy speech that thou art florentine  learn then that i was the count ugolino and this man was ruggieri the archbishop how i trusted him and was betrayed into prison there is no need to relate but of his treatment of me there and how cruel a death i underwent bear and then judge if he has offended me  i had been imprisoned with my children a long time in the tower which has since been called from me the tower of famine and many a new moon had i seen through the hole that served us for a window when i dreamt a dream that foreshadowed to me what was coming methought that this man headed a great chase against the wolf in the mountains between pisa and lucca among the foremost in his party were gualandi sismondi and lanfranchi and the hounds were thin and eager and highbred and in a little while i saw the hounds fasten on the flanks of the wolf and the wolfs children and tear them at that moment i awoke with the voices of my own children in my ears asking for bread truly cruel must thou be if thy heart does not ache to think of what i thought then if thou feel not for a pang like that what is it for which thou art accustomed to feel we were now all awake and the time was at hand when they brought us bread and we had all dreamt dreams which made us anxious at that moment i heard the key of the horrible tower turn in the lock of the door below and fasten it i looked at my children and said not a word i did not weep i made a strong effort upon the soul within me but my little anselm said father why do you look so is any thing the matter nevertheless i did not weep nor say a word all the day nor the night that followed in the morning a ray of light fell upon us through the window of our sad prison and i beheld in those four little faces the likeness of my own face and then i began to gnaw my hands for misery my children thinking i did it for hunger raised themselves on the floor and said father we should be less miserable if you would eat our own flesh it was you that gave it us take it again then i sat still in order not to make them unhappier and that day and the next we all remained without speaking on the fourth day gaddo stretched himself at my feet and said father why wont you help me and there he died and as surely as thou lookest on me so surely i beheld the whole three die in the same manner so i began in my misery to grope about in the dark for them for i had become blind and three days i kept calling on them by name though they were dead till famine did for me what grief had been unable to do  with these words the miserable man his eyes starting from his head seized that other wretch again with his teeth and ground them against the skull as a dog does with a bone  o pisa scandal of the nations since thy neighbours are so slow to punish thee may the very islands tear themselves up from their roots in the sea and come and block up the mouth of thy river and drown every soul within thee what if this count ugolino did as report says he did betray thy castles to the enemy his children had not betrayed them nor ought they to have been put to an agony like this their age was their innocence and their deaths have given thee the infamy of a second thebes49  the pilgrims passed on and beheld other traitors frozen up in swathes of ice with their heads upside down their very tears had hindered them from shedding more for their eyes were encrusted with the first they shed so as to be enclosed with them as in a crystal visor which forced back the others into an accumulation of anguish one of the sufferers begged dante to relieve him of this ice in order that he might vent a little of the burden which it repressed the poet said he would do so provided he would disclose who he was the man said he was the friar alberigo who invited some of his brotherhood to a banquet in order to slay them  what exclaimed dante art thou no longer then among the living  perhaps i appear to be answered the friar for the moment any one commits a treachery like mine his soul gives up his body to a demon who thenceforward inhabits it in the mans likeness thou knowest branca doria who murdered his fatherinlaw zanche he seems to be walking the earth still and yet he has been in this place many years 50  impossible cried dante branca doria is still alive he eats drinks and sleeps like any other man  i tell thee returned the friar that the soul of the man he slew had not reached that lake of boiling pitch in which thou sawest him ere the soul of his slayer was in this place and his body occupied by a demon in its stead but now stretch forth thy hand and relieve mine eyes  dante relieved them not ill manners he said were the only courtesy fit for such a wretch51  o ye genoese he exclaimsmen that are perversity all over and full of every corruption to the core why are ye not swept from the face of the earth there is one of you whom you fancy to be walking about like other men and he is all the while in the lowest pit of hell  look before thee said virgil as they advanced behold the banners of the king of hell  dante looked and beheld something which appeared like a windmill in motion as seen from a distance on a dark night a wind of inconceivable sharpness came from it  the souls of those who had been traitors to their benefactors were here frozen up in depths of pellucid ice where they were seen in a variety of attitudes motionless some upright some downward some bent double head to foot  at length they came to where the being stood who was once eminent for all fair seeming52 this was the figure that seemed tossing its arms at a distance like a windmill  satan whispered virgil and put himself in front of dante to reassure him halting him at the same time and bidding him summon all his fortitude dante stood benumbed though conscious as if he himself had been turned to ice he felt neither alive nor dead  the lord of the dolorous empire each of his arms as big as a giant stood in the ice halfway up his breast he had one head but three faces the middle vermilion the one over the right shoulder a pale yellow the other black his sails of wings huger than ever were beheld at sea were in shape and texture those of a bat and with these be constantly flapped so as to send forth the wind that froze the depths of tartarus from his six eyes the tears ran down mingling at his three chins with bloody foam for at every mouth he crushed a sinner with his teeth as substances are broken up by an engine the middle sinner was the worst punished for he was at once broken and flayed and his head and trunk were inside the mouth it was judas iscariot  of the other two whose heads were hanging out one was brutus and the other cassius cassius was very largelimbed brutus writhed with agony but uttered not a word53  night has returned said virgil and all has been seen it is time to depart onward  dante then at his bidding clasped as virgil did the huge inattentive being round the neck and watching their opportunity as the wings opened and shut they slipped round it and so down his shaggy and frozen sides from pile to pile clutching it as they went till suddenly with the greatest labour and pain they were compelled to turn themselves upside down as it seemed but in reality to regain their proper footing for they had passed the centre of gravity and become antipodes  then looking down at what lately was upward they saw lucifer with his feet towards them and so taking their departure ascended a gloomy vault till at a distance through an opening above their heads they beheld the loveliness of the stars54   footnote 1 parea che laer ne temesse  footnote 2 là dove l sol tace the sun to me is dark and silent is the moon hid in her vacant interlunar cavemilton  footnote 3 there is great difference among the commentators respecting the meaning of the three beasts some supposing them passions others political troubles others personal enemies c the point is not of much importance especially as a mystery was intended but nobody as mr cary says can doubt that the passage was suggested by one in the prophet jeremiah v 6 wherefore a lion out of the forest shall slay them and a wolf of the evenings shall spoil them a leopard shall watch over their cities  footnote 4    che quello mperador che là su regna   perch i furibellante à la sua legge   non vuol che n sua città per me

are bowed and closed soon as the sun returns   rise on their stems all open and upright  footnote 6 this loss of intellectual good and the confession of the poet that he finds the inscription over hellportal hard to understand il senso lor mè duro are among the passages in dante which lead some critics to suppose that his hell is nothing but an allegory intended at once to imply his own disbelief in it as understood by the vulgar part of mankind and his employment of it nevertheless as a salutary check both to the foolish and the reflectingto the foolish as an alarm and to the reflecting as a parable it is possible in the teeth of many appearances to the contrary that such may have been the case but in the doubt that it affects either the foolish or the wise to any good purpose and in the certainty that such doctrines do a world of mischief to tender consciences and the cause of sound piety such monstrous contradictions in terms of every sense of justice and charity which god has implanted in the heart of man are not to be passed over without indignant comment  footnote 7 it is seldom that a boast of this kindnot it must be owned bashfulhas been allowed by posterity to be just nay in four out of the five instances below its claims  footnote 8    genti veran con occhi tardi e gravi   di grande autorita ne lor sembianti   parlavan rado con voci soavi

famous episode of paulo and francesca she was daughter to count guido da polenta lord of ravenna and wife to giovanni malatesta one of the sons of the lord of rimini paulo was her brotherinlaw they were surprised together by the husband and slain on the spot particulars of their history will be found in the appendix together with the whole original passage    quali colombe dal disio chiamate

ricordarsi del tempo felice   ne la miseria   footnote 14    per più fiate gli occhi ci sospinse   quella lettura to look at one another says boccaccio and his interpretation has been followed by cary and foscolo but with deference to such authorities i beg leave to think that the poet meant no more than he says namely that their eyes were simply suspendedhung as it were over the book without being able to read on which is what i intended to express if i may allude to a production of which both those critics were pleased to speak well when in my youthful attempt to enlarge this story i wrote and oer the book they hung and nothing said and every lingering page grew longer as they read  story of rimini  footnote 15    mentre che luno spirto questo disse   laltro piangeva sì che di pietade   i venni men così comio morisse   e caddi come corpo morto cade  this last line has been greatly admired for the corresponding deadness of its expression    while thus one spoke the other spirit mournd   with wail so woful that at his remorse   i felt as though i should have died i turnd   stonestiff and to the ground fell like a corse  the poet fell thus on the ground some of the commentators think because he had sinned in the same way and if foscolos opinion could be establishedthat the incident of the book is inventiontheir conclusion would receive curious collateral evidence the circumstance of the perusal of the romance in company with a lady being likely enough to have occurred to dante but the same probability applies in the case of the lovers the reading of such books was equally the taste of their own times and nothing is more likely than the volumes having been found in the room where they perished the pagans could not be rebels to a law they never heard of any more than dante could be a rebel to luther but this is one of the absurdities with which the impious effrontery or scarcely less impious admissions of dantes teachers avowedly set reason at defianceretaining meanwhile their right of contempt for the impieties of mahometans and brahmins which is odd as the poet says for being not less absurd or as the others argued much more so they had at least an equal claim on the submission of the reason since the greater the irrationality the higher the theological triumph  footnote 16 plutuss exclamation about satan is a great chokepear to the commentators the line in the original is    pape satan pape satan aleppe  the words as thus written are not italian it is not the business of this abstract to discuss such points and therefore i content myself with believing that the context implies a call of alarm on the prince of hell at the sight of the living creature and his guide  footnote 17 phlegyas a son of mars was cast into hell by apollo for setting the gods temple on fire in resentment for the violation of his daughter coronis the actions of gods were not to be questioned in dantes opinion even though the gods turned out to be false jugghanaut is as good as any while he lasts it is an ethicotheological puzzle involving very nice questions but at any rate had our poet been a brahmin of benares we know how he would have written about it in sanscrit  footnote 18 filippo argenti philip silverso called from his shoeing his horse with the precious metal was a florentine remarkable for bodily strength and extreme irascibility what a barbarous strength and confusion of ideas is there in this whole passage about him arrogance punished by arrogance a christian mother blessed for the unchristian disdainfulness of her son revenge

valise latin bulga hippopera greek ippopetha greek in reference to valises which open lengthways like a chest dante uses the word to signify those compartments which he feigns in his hell per similitudine di quelle valigie che saprono per lo lungo a guisa di cassa significa quegli spartimenti che dante finge nell inferno the reader will think of the homely figurative names in bunyan and the contempt which great and awful states of mind have for conventional notions of rank in phraseology it is a part if well considered of their grandeur  footnote 25 boniface the eighth was the pope then living and one of the causes of dantes exile it is thus the poet contrives to put his enemies in hell before their time  footnote 26 an allusion to the pretended gift of the lateran by constantine to pope sylvester ridiculed so strongly by ariosto and others  footnote 27 a truly infernal sentiment the original is    quì vive la pietà quand è ben morta   here pity lives when it is quite dead    chi è più scellerato continues the poet di colui   chal giudicio divin passion porta  that is who is wickeder than he that sets his impassioned feelings against the judgments of god the answer is he that attributes judgments to god which are to render humanity pitiless  footnote 28 ne fianchi così poco michael scot had been in florence to which circumstance we are most probably indebted for this curious particular respecting his shape the consignment of such men to hell is a mortifying instance of the great poets participation in the vulgarest errors of his time it is hardly however worth notice considering what we see him swallowing every moment or pretending to swallow  footnote 29 bonturo must have sold him something cheap exclaimed a hearer of this passage nothe exception is an irony there was not one honest man in all lucca  footnote 30    intorno si mira   tutto smarrito da la grande angoscia   chegli ha sofferta e guardando sospira  this is one of the most terribly natural pictures of agonised astonishment ever painted  footnote 31 i retain this passage horrible as it is to protestant ears because it is not only an instance of dantes own audacity but a salutary warning specimen of the extremes of impiety generated by extreme superstition for their first cause is the degradation of the divine character another no doubt is the impulsive vehemence of the south i have heard more blasphemies in the course of half an hour from the lips of an italian postilion than are probably uttered in england by people not out of their senses for a whole year yet the words after all were mere words for the man was a goodnatured fellow and i believe presented no image to his mind of anything he was saying dante however would certainly not have taught him better by attempting to frighten him a violent word would have only produced more violence yet this was the idle round which the great poet thought it best to run  footnote 32 cianfa probably a condottiere of mrs radcliffes sort and robber on a large scale is said to have been one of the donati family connexions of the poet by marriage  footnote 33 this and the transformation that follows may well excite the pride of such a poet as dante though it is curious to see how he selects inventions of this kind as special grounds of selfcomplacency they are the most appalling ever yet produced  footnote 34 guido conte di montefeltro a celebrated soldier of that day became a franciscan in his old age in order to repent of his sins but being consulted in his cloister by pope boniface on the best mode of getting possession of an estate belonging to the colonna family and being promised absolution for his sins in the lump including the opinion requested he recommended the holy father to promise much and perform nothing molto promettere e nulla attendere  footnote 35 dolcino was a lombard friar at the beginning of the fourteenth century who is said to have preached a community of goods including women and to have pretended to a divine mission for reforming the church he appears to have made a considerable impression having thousands of followers but was ultimately seized in the mountains where they lived and burnt with his female companion margarita and many others landino says he was very eloquent and that both he and margarita endured their fate with a firmness worthy of a better cause probably his real history is not known for want of somebody in such times bold enough to write it  footnote 36 literally under the breastplate of knowing himself to be pure    sotto losbergo del sentirsi pura  the expression is deservedly admired but it is not allowable in english and it is the only one admitting no equivalent which i have met with in the whole poem it might be argued perhaps against the perfection of the passage that a good conscience and a mans knowing himself to be pure are a tautology for dante himself has already used that word    conscienzia massicura   la buona compagnia che luom francheggia   sotto losbergo c  but still we feel the impulsive beauty of the phrase and i wish i could have kept it  foonote 37 this ghastly fiction is a rare instance of the meeting of physical horror with the truest pathos  footnote 38 the reader will not fail to notice this characteristic instance of the ferocity of the time  footnote 39 this is admirable sentiment and it must have been no ordinary consciousness of dignity in general which could have made dante allow himself to be the person rebuked for having forgotten it perhaps it was a sort of penance for his having on some occasion fallen into the unworthiness  footnote 40 by the saracens in roncesvalles afterwards so favourite a topic with the poets the circumstance of the horn is taken from the chronicle of the pretended archbishop turpin chapter xxiv  footnote 41 the gaping monotony of this jargon full of the vowel a is admirably suited to the mouth of the vast halfstupid speaker it is like a babble of the gigantic infancy of the world  footnote 42    nè sì chinato li fece dimora   e come albero in nave si levò  a magnificent image i have retained the idiomatic expression of the original raised himself instead of saying rose because it seemed to me to give the more grand and deliberate image  footnote 43 of màmma and bàbbo says the primitive poet we have corresponding words in english but the feeling they produce is not identical the lesser fervour of the northern nations renders them in some respects more sophisticate than they suspect compared with the artful italians  footnote 44 alessandro and napoleon degli alberti sons of alberto lord of the valley of falterona in tuscany after their fathers death they tyrannised over the neighbouring districts and finally had a mortal quarrel the name of napoleon used to be so rare till of late years even in italian books that it gives one a kind of interesting surprise to meet with it  footnote 45    se voler fu o destino o fortuna   non so  what does the christian reader think of that  footnote 46 latrando  footnote 47 bocca degli abbati whose soul barks like a dog occasioned the defeat of the guelfs at montaperto in the year 1260 by treacherously cutting off the hand of the standardbearer  footnote 48 this is the famous story of ugolino who betrayed the castles of pisa to the florentines and was starved with his children in the tower of famine  footnote 49 i should be loath to disturb the inimitable pathos of this story if there did not seem grounds for believing that the poet was too hasty in giving credit to parts of it particularly the ages of some of his fellowprisoners and the guilt of the archbishop see the appendix to this volume  footnote 50 this is the most tremendous lampoon as far as i am aware in the whole circle of literature  footnote 51 cortesia fu lui esser villano this is the foulest blot which dante has cast on his own character in all his poem short of the cruelties he thinks fit to attribute to god it is argued that he is cruel and false out of hatred to cruelty and falsehood but why then add to the sum of both and towards a man too supposed to be suffering eternally it is idle to discern in such barbarous inconsistencies any thing but the writers own contributions to the stock of them the utmost credit for right feeling is not to be given on every occasion to a man who refuses it to every one else  footnote 52 la creatura chebbe il bel sembiante  this is touching but the reader may as well be prepared for a total failure in dantes conception of satan especially the english reader accustomed to the sublimity of miltons granting that the roman catholic poet intended to honour the fallen angel with no sublimity but to render him an object of mere hate and dread he has overdone and degraded the picture into caricature a great stupid being stuck up in ice with three faces one of which is yellow and three mouths each eating a sinner one of those sinners being brutus is an object for derision and the way in which he eats these his everlasting bonnesbouches divides derision with disgust the passage must be given otherwise the abstract of the poem would be incomplete but i cannot help thinking it the worst anticlimax ever fallen into by a great poet  footnote 53 this silence is at all events a compliment to brutus especially from a man like dante and the more because it is extorted dante no doubt hated all treachery particularly treachery to the leader of his beloved roman emperors forgetting three things first that cæsar was guilty of treachery himself to the roman people second that he dante has put curio in hell for advising cæsar to cross the rubicon though he has put the crosser among the good pagans and third that brutus was educated in the belief that the punishment of such treachery as cæsars by assassination was one of the first of duties how differently has shakspeare himself an aristocratic rather than democratic poet and full of just doubt of the motives of assassins in general treated the error of the thoughtful conscientious platonic philosopher  footnote 54 at the close of this medley of genius pathos absurdity sublimity horror and revoltingness it is impossible for any reflecting heart to avoid asking cui bono what is the good of it to the poor wretches if we are to suppose it true and what to the worldexcept indeed as a poetic study and a warning against degrading notions of godif we are to take it simply as a fiction theology disdaining both questions has an answer confessedly incomprehensible humanity replies assume not premises for which you have worse than no proofs    ii   the journey through purgatory  argument  purgatory in the system of dante is a mountain at the antipodes on the top of which is the terrestrial paradise once the seat of adam and eve it forms the principal part of an island in a sea and possesses a pure air its lowest region with one or two exceptions of redeemed pagans is occupied by excommunicated penitents and by delayers of penitence all of whom are compelled to lose time before their atonement commences the other and greater portion of the ascent is divided into circles or plains in which are expiated the seven deadly sins the poet ascends from circle to circle with virgil and statius and is met in a forest on the top by the spirit of beatrice who transports him to heaven   the journey through purgatory  when the pilgrims emerged from the opening through which they beheld the stars they found themselves in a scene which enchanted them with hope and joy it was dawn a sweet pure air came on their faces and they beheld a sky of the loveliest oriental sapphire whose colour seemed to pervade the whole serene hollow from earth to heaven the beautiful planet which encourages loving thoughts made all the orient laugh obscuring by its very radiance the stars in its train and among those which were still lingering and sparkling in the southern horizon dante saw four in the shape of a cross never beheld by man since they gladdened the eyes of our first parents heaven seemed to rejoice in their possession o widowed northern pole bereaved art thou indeed since thou canst not gaze upon them1  the poet turned to look at the north where he had been accustomed to see stars that no longer appeared and beheld at his side an old man who struck his beholder with a veneration like that of a son for his father he had grey hairs and a long beard which parted in two down his bosom and the four southern stars beamed on his face with such lustre that his aspect was as radiant as if he had stood in the sun  who are ye said the old man that have escaped from the dreadful prisonhouse can the laws of the abyss be violated or has heaven changed its mind that thus ye are allowed to come from the regions of condemnation into mine  it was the spirit of cato of utica the warder of the ascent of purgatory  the roman poet explained to his countryman who they were and how dante was under heavenly protection and then he prayed leave of passage of him by the love he bore to the chaste eyes of his marcia who sent him a message from the pagan circle hoping that he would still own her  cato replied that although he was so fond of marcia while on earth that he could deny her nothing he had ceased in obedience to new laws to have any affection for her now that she dwelt beyond the evil river but as the pilgrim his companion was under heavenly protection he would of course do what he desired2 he then desired him to gird his companion with one of the simplest and completest rushes he would see by the waters side and to wash the stain of the lower world out of his face and so take their journey up the mountain before them by a path which the rising sun would disclose and with these words he disappeared3  the pilgrims passed on with the eagerness of one who thinks every step in vain till he finds the path he has lost the full dawn by this time had arisen and they saw the trembling of the sea in the distance4 virgil then dipped his hands into a spot of dewy grass where the sun had least affected it and with the moisture bathed the face of dante who held it out to him suffused with tears5 and then they went on till they came to a solitary shore whence no voyager had ever returned and there the loins of the florentine were girt with the rush  on this shore they were standing in doubt how to proceedmoving onward as it were in mind while yet their feet were stayingwhen they be held a light over the water at a distance rayless at first as the planet mars when he looks redly out of the horizon through a fog but speedily growing brighter and brighter with amazing swiftness dante had but turned for an instant to ask his guide what it was when on looking again it had grown far brighter two splendid phenomena he knew not what then developed themselves from it on either side and by degrees another below it the two splendours quickly turned out to be wings and virgil who had hitherto watched its coming in silence cried out down downon thy knees it is gods angel clasp thine hands now thou shalt behold operancy indeed lo how he needs neither sail nor oar coming all this way with nothing but his wings lo how he holds them aloft using the air with them at his will and knowing they can never be weary  the divine bird grew brighter and brighter as he came so that the eye at last could not sustain the lustre and dante turned his to the ground a boat then rushed to shore which the angel had brought with him so light that it drew not a drop of water the celestial pilot stood at the helm with bliss written in his face and a hundred spirits were seen within the boat who lifting up their voices sang the psalm beginning when israel came out of egypt at the close of the psalm the angel blessed them with the sign of the cross and they all leaped to shore upon which he turned round and departed as swiftly as he came  the newcomers after gazing about them for a while in the manner of those who are astonished to see new sights inquired of virgil and his companion the best way to the mountain virgil explained who they were and the spirits pale with astonishment at beholding in dante a living and breathing man crowded about him in spite of their anxiety to shorten the period of their trials one of them came darting out of the press to embrace him in a manner so affectionate as to move the poet to return his warmth but his arms again and again found themselves crossed on his own bosom having encircled nothing the shadow smiling at the astonishment in the others face drew back and dante hastened as much forward to shew his zeal in the greeting when the spirit in a sweet voice recommended him to desist the florentine then knew who it wascasella a musician to whom he had been much attached after mutual explanations as to their meeting dante requested his friend if no ordinance opposed it to refresh his spirit awhile with one of the tender airs that used to charm away all his troubles on earth casella immediately began one of his friends own productions commencing with the words  love that delights to talk unto my soul of all the wonders of my ladys nature  and he sang it so beautifully that the sweetness rang within the poets heart while recording the circumstance the other spirits listened with such attention that they seemed to have forgotten the very purpose of their coming when suddenly the voice of cato was heard sternly rebuking their delay and the whole party speeded in trepidation towards the mountain6  the two pilgrims who had at first hastened with the others in a little while slackened their steps and dante found that his body projected a shadow while the form of virgil had none when arrived at the foot of the mountain they were joined by a second party of spirits of whom virgil inquired the way up it one of the spirits of a noble aspect but with a gaping wound in his forehead stepped forth and asked dante if he remembered him the poet humbly answering in the negative the stranger disclosed a second wound that was in his bosom and then with a smile announced himself as manfredi king of naples who was slain in battle against charles of anjou and died excommunicated manfredi gave dante a message to his daughter costanza queen of arragon begging her to shorten the consequences of the excommunication by her prayers since he like the rest of the party with him though repenting of his contumacy against the church would have to wander on the outskirts of purgatory three times as long as the presumption had lasted unless relieved by such petitions from the living7  dante went on with his thoughts so full of this request that he did not perceive he had arrived at the path which virgil asked for till the wandering spirits called out to them to say so the pilgrims then with great difficulty began to ascend through an extremely narrow passage and virgil after explaining to dante how it was that in this antipodal region his eastward face beheld the sun in the north instead of the south was encouraging him to proceed manfully in the hope of finding the path easier by degrees and of reposing at the end of it when they heard a voice observing that they would most likely find it expedient to repose a little sooner the pilgrims looked about them and observed close at hand a crag of a rock in the shade of which some spirits were standing as men stand idly at noon another was sitting down as if tired out with his arms about his knees and his face bent down between them8  dearest master exclaimed dante to his guide what thinkest thou of a croucher like this for manful journeying verily he seems to have been twinborn with idleness herself  the croucher lifting up his eyes at these words looked hard at dante and said since thou art so stout push on  dante then saw it was belacqua a pleasant acquaintance of his famous for his indolence  that was a good lesson said belacqua that was given thee just now in astronomy  the poet could not help smiling at the manner in which his acquaintance uttered these words it was so like his ways of old belacqua pretended even in another world that it was of no use to make haste since the angel had prohibited his going higher up the mountain he and his companions had to walk round the foot of it as many years as they had delayed repenting unless as in the case of manfredi their time was shortened by the prayers of good people  a little further on the pilgrims encountered the spirits of such delayers of penitence as having died violent deaths repented at the last moment one of them buonconte da montefeltro who died in battle and whose body could not be found described how the devil having been hindered from seizing him by the shedding of a single tear had raised in his fury a tremendous tempest which sent the body down the river arno and buried it in the mud9  another spirit a female said to dante ah when thou returnest to earth and shalt have rested from thy long journey remember mepia sienna gave me life the marshes took it from me this he knows who put on my finger the weddingring10  the majority of this party were so importunate with the florentine to procure them the prayers of their friends that he had as much difficulty to get away as a winner at dice has to free himself from the mercenary congratulations of the bystanders on resuming their way dante quoted to virgil a passage in the Æneid decrying the utility of prayer and begged him to explain how it was to be reconciled with what they had just heard virgil advised him to wait for the explanation till he saw beatrice whom he now said he should meet at the top of the mountain dante at this information expressed a desire to hasten their progress and virgil seeing a spirit looking towards them as they advanced requested him to acquaint them with the shortest road  the spirit maintaining a lofty and reserved aspect was as silent as if he had not heard the request intimating by his manner that they might as well proceed without repeating it and eyeing them like a lion on the watch virgil however went up to him and gently urged it but the only reply was a question as to who they were and of what country the latin poet beginning to answer him had scarcely mentioned the word mantua when the stranger went as eagerly up to his interrogator as the latter had done to him and said mantua my own country my name is sordello and the compatriots embraced  o degenerate italy exclaims dante land without affections without principle without faith in any one good thing here was a man who could not hear the sweet sound of a fellowcitizens voice without feeling his heart gush towards him and there are no people now in any one of thy towns that do not hate and torment one another  sordello in another tone now exclaimed but who are ye  virgil disclosed himself and sordello fell at his feet11  sordello now undertook to accompany the great roman poet and his friend to a certain distance on their ascent towards the penal quarters of the mountain but as evening was drawing nigh and the ascent could not be made properly in the dark he proposed that they should await the dawning of the next day in a recess that overlooked a flowery hollow the hollow was a lovely spot of ground enamelled with flowers that surpassed the exquisitest dyes and green with a grass brighter than emeralds newly broken12 there rose from it also a fragrance of a thousand different kinds of sweetness all mingled into one that was new and indescribable and with the fragrance there ascended the chant of the prayer beginning hail queen of heaven13 which was sung by a multitude of souls that appeared sitting on the flowery sward  virgil pointed them out they were penitent delayers of penitence of sovereign rank among them however were spirits who sat mute one of whom was the emperor rodolph who ought to have attended better to italy the garden of the empire and another ottocar king of bohemia his enemy who now comforted him and another with a small nose14 philip the third of france who died a fugitive shedding the leaves of the lily he sat beating his breast and with him was henry the third of navarre sighing with his cheek on his hand one was the father and one the fatherinlaw of philip the handsome the bane of france and it was on account of his unworthiness they grieved  but among the singers virgil pointed out the stronglimbed king of arragon pedro and charles king of naples with his masculine nose these two were singing together and henry the third of england the king of the simple life sitting by himself15 and below these but with his eyes in heaven guglielmo marquis of montferrat  it was now the hour when men at sea think longingly of home and feel their hearts melt within them to remember the day on which they bade adieu to beloved friends and now too was the hour when the pilgrim new to his journey is thrilled with the like tenderness when he hears the vesperbell in the distance which seems to mourn for the expiring day16 at this hour of the coming darkness dante beheld one of the spirits in the flowery hollow arise and after giving a signal to the others to do as he did stretch forth both hands palm to palm towards the east and with softest emotion commence the hymn beginning  thee before the closing light17  upon which all the rest devoutly and softly followed him keeping their eyes fixed on the heavens at the end of it they remained with pale countenances in an attitude of humble expectation and dante saw the angels issue from the quarter to which they looked and descend towards them with flaming swords in their hands broken short of the point their wings were as green as the leaves in spring and they wore garments equally green which the fanning of the wings kept in a state of streaming fluctuation behind them as they came one of them took his stand on a part of the hill just over where the pilgrims stood and the other on a hill opposite so that the party in the valley were between them dante could discern their heads of hair notwithstanding its brightness but their faces were so dazzling as to be undistinguishable  they come from marys bosom whispered sordello to protect the valley from the designs of our enemy yonderthe serpent  dante looked in trepidation towards the only undefended side of the valley and beheld the serpent of eve coming softly among the grass and flowers occasionally turning its head and licking its polished back before he could take off his eyes from the evil thing the two angels had come down like falcons and at the whirring of their pinions the serpent fled the angels returned as swiftly to their stations  aurora was now looking palely over the eastern cliff on the other side of the globe and the stars of midnight shining over the heads of dante and his friends when they seated themselves for rest on the mountains side the florentine being still in the flesh lay down for weariness and was overcome with sleep in his sleep he dreamt that a golden eagle flashed down like lightning upon him and bore him up to the region of fire where the heat was so intense that it woke him staring and looking round about with a pale face his dream was a shadowing of the truth he had actually come to another placeto the entrance of purgatory itself sordello had been left behind virgil alone remained looking him cheerfully in the face saint lucy had come from heaven and shortened the fatigue of his journey by carrying him upwards as he slept the heathen poet following them on arriving where they stood the fair saint intimated the entrance of purgatory to virgil by a glance thither of her beautiful eyes and then vanished as dante woke18  the portal by which purgatory was entered was embedded in a cliff it had three steps each of a different colour and on the highest of these there sat mute and watching an angel in ashcoloured garments holding a naked sword which glanced with such intolerable brightness on dante whenever he attempted to look that he gave up the endeavour the angel demanded who they were and receiving the right answer gently bade them advance  dante now saw that the lowest step was of marble so white and clear that he beheld his face in it the colour of the next was a deadly black and it was all rough scorched and full of cracks the third was of flaming porphyry red as a mans blood when it leaps forth under the lancet19 the angel whose feet were on the porphyry sat on a threshold which appeared to be rockdiamond dante ascending the steps with the encouragement of virgil fell at the angels feet and after thrice beating himself on the breast humbly asked admittance the angel with the point of his sword inscribed the first letter of the word peccatum sin seven times on the petitioners forehead then bidding him pray with tears for their erasement and be cautious how he looked back opened the portal with a silver and a golden key20 the hinges roared as they turned like thunder and the pilgrims on entering thought they heard mingling with the sound a chorus of voices singing we praise thee o god21 it was like the chant that mingles with a cathedral organ when the words that the choristers utter are at one moment to be distinguished and at another fade away  the companions continued ascending till they reached a plain it stretched as far as the eye could see and was as lonely as roads across deserts  this was the first flat or tableland of the ascending gradations of purgatory and the place of trial for the souls of the proud it was bordered with a mound or natural wall of white marble sculptured all over with stories of humility dante beheld among them the annunciation represented with so much life that the sweet action of the angel seemed to be uttering the very word hail and the submissive spirit of the virgin to be no less impressed like very wax in her demeanour the next story was that of david dancing and harping before the arkan action in which he seemed both less and greater than a king michal was looking out upon him from a window like a lady full of scorn and sorrow next to the story of david was that of the emperor trajan when he did a thing so glorious as moved st gregory to gain the greatest of all his conqueststhe delivering of the emperors soul from hell  a widow in tears and mourning was laying hold of his bridle as he rode amidst his court with a noise of horses and horsemen while the roman eagles floated in gold over his head the miserable creature spoke out loudly among them all crying for vengeance on the murderers of her sons the emperor seemed to say wait till i return  but she in the hastiness of her misery said suppose thou returnest not  then my successor will attend to thee replied the emperor  and what hast thou to do with the duties of another man cried she if thou attendest not to thine own  now be of good comfort concluded trajan for verily my duty shall be done before i go justice wills it and pity arrests me  dante was proceeding to delight himself further with these sculptures when virgil whispered hint to look round and see what was coming he did so and beheld strange figures advancing the nature of which he could not make out at first for they seemed neither human nor aught else which he could call to mind they were souls of the proud bent double under enormous burdens  o proud miserable woebegone christians exclaims the poet ye who in the shortness of your sight see no reason for advancing in the right path know ye not that we are worms born to compose the angelic butterfly provided we throw off the husks that impede our flight22  the souls came slowly on each bending down in proportion to his burden they looked like the crouching figures in architecture that are used to support roofs or balconies and that excite piteous fancies in the beholders the one that appeared to have the most patience yet seemed as if he said i can endure no further  the sufferers notwithstanding their anguish raised their voices in a paraphrase on the lords prayer which they concluded with humbly stating that they repeated the clause against temptation not for themselves but for those who were yet living  virgil wishing them a speedy deliverance requested them to spew the best way of going up to the next circle who it was that answered him could not be discerned on account of their all being so bent down but a voice gave them the required direction the speaker adding that he wished he could raise his eyes so as to see the living creature that stood near him he said that his name was ombertothat he came of the great tuscan race of aldobrandescoand that his countrymen the siennese murdered him on account of his arrogance  dante had bent down his own head to listen and in so doing he was recognised by one of the sufferers who eyeing him as well as he could addressed him by name the poet replied by exclaiming art thou not oderisi the glory of agubbio the master of the art of illumination  ah said oderisi franco of bologna has all the glory now his colours make the pages of books laugh with beauty compared with what mine do23 i could not have owned it while on earth for the sin which has brought me hither but so it is and so will it ever be let a mans fame be never so green and flourishing unless he can secure a dull age to come after him cimabue in painting lately kept the field against all comers and now the cry is giotto thus in song a new guido has deprived the first of his glory and he perhaps is born who shall drive both out of the nest24 fame is but a wind that changes about from all quarters what does glory amount to at best that a man should prefer living and growing old for it to dying in the days of his nurse and his papboat even if it should last him a thousand years a thousand yearsthe twinkling of an eye behold this man who weeps before me his name resounded once over all our tuscany and now it is scarcely whispered in his native place he was lord there at the time that your once proud but now loathsome florence had such a lesson given to its frenzy at the battle of arbia  and what is his name inquired dante  salvani returned the limner he is here because he had the presumption to think that he could hold sienna in the hollow of his hand fifty years has he paced in this manner such is the punishment for audacity  but why is he here at all said dante and not in the outer region among the delayers of repentance  because exclaimed the other in the height of his ascendancy he did not disdain to stand in the public place in sienna and trembling in every vein beg money from the people to ransom a friend from captivity do i appear to thee to speak with mysterious significance thy countrymen shall too soon help thee to understand me25  virgil now called dante away from oderisi and bade him notice the ground on which they were treading it was pavement wrought all over with figures like sculptured tombstones there was lucifer among them struck flaming down from heaven and briareus pinned to the earth with the thunderbolt and with the other giants amazing the gods with his hugeness and nimrod standing confounded at the foot of babel and niobe with her despairing eyes turned into stone amidst her children and saul dead on his own sword in gilboa and arachne now half spider at fault on her own broken web and rehoboam for all his insolence flying in terror in his chariot and alcmæon who made his mother pay with her life for the ornament she received to betray his father and sennacherib left dead by his son in the temple and the head of cyrus thrown by the motherless woman into the goblet of blood that it might swill what it had thirsted for and holofernes beheaded and his assyrians flying at his death and troy all become cinders and hollow places oh what a fall from pride was there now maintain the loftiness of your looks ye sons of eve and walk with proud steps bending not your eyes on the dust ye were lest ye perceive the evil of your ways26  behold said virgil there is an angel coming  the angel came on clad in white with a face that sent trembling beams before it like the morning star he skewed the pilgrims the way up to the second circle and then beating his wings against the forehead of dante on which the seven initials of sin were written told him he should go safely and disappeared  on reaching the new circle dante instead of the fierce wailings that used to meet him at every turn in hell heard voices singing blessed are the poor in spirit27 as he went he perceived that he walked lighter and was told by virgil that the angel had freed him from one of the letters on his forehead he put his hand up to make sure as a man does in the street when people take notice of something on his head of which he is not aware and virgil smiled  in this new circle the sin of envy was expiated after the pilgrims had proceeded a mile they heard the voices of invisible spirits passing them uttering sentiments of love and charity for it was charity itself that had to punish envy  the souls of the envious clad in sackcloth sat leaning for support and humiliation partly against the rocky wall of the circle and partly on one anothers shoulders after the manner of beggars that ask alms near places of worship their eyes were sewn up like those of hawks in training but not so as to hinder them from shedding tears which they did in abundance and they cried mary pray for usmichael peter and all the saints pray for us  dante spoke to them and one a female lifted up her chin as a blind person does when expressing consciousness of notice and said she was sapia of sienna who used to be pleased at peoples misfortunes and had rejoiced when her countrymen lost the battle of colle sapia was my name she said but sapient i was not28 for i prayed god to defeat my countrymen and when he had done so as he had willed to do i raised my bold face to heaven and cried out to him now do thy worst for i fear thee not i was like the bird in the fable who thought the fine day was to last for ever what i should have done in my latter days to make up for the imperfect amends of my repentance i know not if the holy piero pettignano had not assisted me with his prayers but who art thou that goest with open eyes and breathest in thy talk  mine eyes answered dante may yet have to endure the blindness in this place though for no long period far more do i fear the sufferings in the one that i have just left i seem to feel the weight already upon me29  the florentine then informed sapia how he came thither which she said was a great sign that god loved him and she begged his prayers the conversation excited the curiosity of two spirits who overheard it and one of them guido del duca a noble romagnese asked the poet of what country he was dante without mentioning the name of the river intimated that he came from the banks of the arno upon which the other spirit rinier da calboli asked his friend why the stranger suppressed the name as though it was something horrible guido said he well might for the river throughout its course beheld none but bad men and persecutors of virtue first he said it made its petty way by the sties of those brutal hogs the people of casentino and then arrived at the dignity of watering the kennels of the curs of arezzo who excelled more in barking than in biting then growing unluckier as it grew larger like the cursed and miserable ditch that it was it found in florence the dogs become wolves and finally ere it went into the sea it passed the den of those foxes the pisans who were full of such cunning that they held traps in contempt  it will be well continued guido for this man to remember what he hears and then after prophesying evil to florence and confessing to dante his sin of envy which used to make him pale when any one looked happy he added this is rinieri the glory of that house of calboli which now inherits not a spark of it not a spark of it did i say in the house of calboli where is there a spark in all romagna where is the good liziowhere manardi traversaro carpigna the romagnese have all become bastards a mechanic founds a house in bologna a bernardin di fosco finds his doggrass become a tree in faenza wonder not tuscan to see me weep when i think of the noble spirits that we have lived withof the guidos of prata and the ugolins of azzoof federigo tignoso and his bandof the traversaros and anastagios families now ruinedand all the ladies and the cavaliers the alternate employments and delights which wrapped us in a round of love and courtesy where now there is nothing but illwill o castle of brettinoro why dost thou not fall well has the lord of bagnacavallo done who will have no more children who would propagate a race of counties from such blood as the castrocaros and the conios is not the son of pagani called the demon and would it not be better that such a son were swept out of the family nay let him live to chew to what a pitch of villany it has arrived ubaldini alone is blest for his name is good and he is too old to leave a child after him go tuscango for i would be left to my tears  dante and virgil turned to move onward and had scarcely done so when a tremendous voice met them splitting the air like peals of thunder and crying out whoever finds me will slay me then dashed apart like the thunderbolt when it falls it was cain the air had scarcely recovered its silence when a second crash ensued from a different quarter near them like thunder when the claps break swiftly into one another i am aglauros it said that was turned into stone dante drew closer to his guide and there ensued a dead silence30  the sun was now in the west and the pilgrims were journeying towards it when dante suddenly felt such a weight of splendour on his eyes as forced him to screen them with both his hands it was an angel coming to show them the ascent to the next circle a way that was less steep than the last while mounting they heard the angels voice singing behind them blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy and on his leaving them to proceed by themselves the second letter on dantes forehead was found to have been effaced by the splendour  the poet looked round in wonder on the new circle where the sin of anger was expiated and beheld as in a dream three successive spectacles illustrative of the virtue of patience the first was that of a crowded temple on the threshold of which a female said to her son in the sweet manner of a mother son why hast thou thus dealt with us behold thy father and i have sought thee sorrowing31and here she became silent and the vision ended the next was the lord of athens pisistratus calmly reproving his wife for wishing him to put to death her daughters lover who in a transport had embraced her in public if we are to be thus severe said pisistratus with those that love us what is to be done with such as hate the last spectacle was that of a furious multitude shouting and stoning to death a youth who as he fell to the ground still kept his face towards heaven making his eyes the gates through which his soul reached it and imploring forgiveness for his murderers32  the visions passed away leaving the poet staggering as if but half awake they were succeeded by a thick and noisome fog through which he followed his leader with the caution of a blind man virgil repeatedly telling him not to quit him a moment here they heard voices praying in unison for pardon to the lamb of god who taketh away the sins of the world they were the spirits of the angry dante conversed with one of them on freewill and necessity and after quitting him and issuing by degrees from the cloud beheld illustrative visions of anger such as the impious mother who was changed into the bird that most delights in singing haman retaining his look of spite and rage on the cross and lavinia mourning for her mother who slew herself for rage at the death of turnus33  these visions were broken off by a great light as sleep is broken and dante heard a voice out of it saying the ascent is here he then as virgil and he ascended into the fourth circle felt an air on his face as if caused by the fanning of wings accompanied by the utterance of the words blessed are the peacemakers and his forehead was lightened of the third letter34  in this fourth circle was expiated lukewarmness or defect of zeal for good the sufferers came speeding and weeping round the mountain making amends for the old indifference by the haste and fire of the new love that was in them blessed mary made haste cried one to salute elizabeth and cæsar cried another to smite pompey at lerida35 and the disobedient among the israelites cried others died before they reached the promised land and the tired among the trojans preferred ease in sicily to glory in latiumit was now midnight and dante slept and had a dream  his dream was of a woman who came to him having a tongue that tried ineffectually to speak squinting eyes feet whose distortion drew her towards the earth stumps of hands and a pallid face dante looked earnestly at her and his look acted upon her like sunshine upon cold her tongue was loosened her feet made straight she stood upright her paleness became a lovely rosecolour and she warbled so beautifully that the poet could not have refused to listen had he wished it  i am the sweet syren she said who made the mariners turn pale for pleasure in the sea i drew ulysses out of his course with my song and he that harbours with me once rarely departs ever so well i pay him for what he abandons  her lips were not yet closed when a lady of holy and earliest countenance came up to shame her o virgil she cried angrily who is this virgil approached with his eyes fixed on the lady and the lady tore away the garments of the woman and spewed her to be a creature so loathly that the sleeper awoke with the horror36  virgil said i have called thee three times to no purpose let us move and find the place at which we are to go higher  it was broad day with a sun that came warm on the shoulders and dante was proceeding with his companion when the softest voice they ever heard directed them where to ascend and they found an angel with them who pointed his swanlike wings upward and then flapped them against the pilgrims taking away the fourth letter from the forehead of dante blessed are they that mourn said the angel for they shall be comforted  the pilgrims ascended into the fifth circle and beheld the expiators of avarice grovelling on the ground and exclaiming as loud as they could for the tears that choked them my soul hath cleaved to the dust dante spoke to one who turned out to be pope adrian the fifth the poet fell on his knees but adrian bade him arise and err not i am no longer said he spouse of the church here but fellowservant with thee and with all others go thy ways and delay not the time of my deliverance  the pilgrims moving onward dante heard a spirit exclaim in the struggling tones of a woman in childbed o blessed virgin that was a poor roof thou hadst when thou wast delivered of thy sacred burden o good fabricius virtue with poverty was thy choice and not vice with riches and then it told the story of nicholas who hearing that a father was about to sacrifice the honour of his three daughters for want of money threw bags of it in at his window containing portions for them all  dante earnestly addressed this spirit to know who he was and the spirit said it would tell him not for the sake of help for which it looked elsewhere but because of the shining grace that was in his questioner though yet alive  i was root said the spirit of that evil plant which overshadows all christendom to such little profit hugh capet was i ancestor of the philips and louises of france offspring of a butcher of paris when the old race of kings was worn out37 we began by seizing the government in paris then plundered in provence then to make amends laid hold of poitou normandy and gascony then still to make amends put conradin to death and seized naples then always to make amends gave saint aquinas his dismissal to heaven by poison i see the time at hand when a descendant of mine will be called into italy and the spear that judas jousted with38 shall transfix the bowels of florence another of my posterity sells his daughter for a sum of money to a marquis of ferrara another seizes the pope in alagna and mocks christ over again in the person of his vicar a fourth rends the veil of the temple solely to seize its money o lord how shall i rejoice to see the vengeance which even now thou huggest in delight to thy bosom39  of loving and liberal things continued capet we speak while it is light such as thou heardest me record when i addressed myself to the blessed virgin but when night comes we take another tone then we denounce pygmalion39 the traitor the robber and the parricide each the result of his gluttonous love of gold and midas who obtained his wish to the laughter of all time and the thief achan who still seems frightened at the wrath of joshua and sapphira and her husband whom we accuse over again before the apostles and heliodorus whom we bless the hoofs of the angels horse for trampling40 and crassus on whom we call with shouts of derision to tell us the flavour of his molten gold thus we record our thoughts in the nighttime now high now low now at greater or less length as each man is prompted by his impulses and it was thus thou didst hear me recording also by daytime though i had no respondent near me  the pilgrims quitted hugh capet and were eagerly pursuing their journey when to the terror of dante they felt the whole mountain of purgatory tremble as though it were about to fall in the island of delos shook not so awfully when latona hiding there brought forth the twin eyes of heaven a shout then arose on every side so enormous that virgil stood nigher to his companion and bade him be of good heart glory be to god in the highest cried the shout but dante could gather the words only from those who were near him  it was purgatory rejoicing for the deliverance of a soul out of its bounds41  the soul overtook the pilgrims as they were journeying in amazement onwards and it turned out to be that of statius who had been converted to christianity in the reign of domitian42 mutual astonishment led to inquiries that explained who the other latin poet was and statius fell at his masters feet  statius had expiated his sins in the circle of avarice not for that vice but for the opposite one of prodigality  an angel now as before took the fifth letter from dantes forehead and the three poets having ascended into the sixth round of the mountain were journeying on lovingly together dante listening with reverence to the talk of the two ancients when they came up to a sweetsmelling fruittree upon which a clear stream came tumbling from a rock beside it and diffusing itself through the branches the latin poets went up to the tree and were met by a voice which said be chary of the fruit mary thought not of herself at galilee but of the visitors when she said they have no wine the women of oldest rome drank water the beautiful age of gold feasted on acorns its thirst made nectar out of the rivulet the baptist fed on locusts and wild honey and became great as you see him in the gospel  the poets went on their way and dante was still listening to the others when they heard behind them a mingled sound of chanting and weeping which produced an effect at once sad and delightful it was the psalm o lord open thou our lips and the chanters were expiators of the sin of intemperance in meats and drinks they were condemned to circuit the mountain famished and to long for the fruit and waters of the tree in vain they soon came up with the poetsa pallid multitude with hollow eyes and bones staring through the skin the sockets of their eyes looked like rings from which the gems had dropped43 one of them knew and accosted dante who could not recognise him till he heard him speak it was forese donati one of the poets most intimate connexions dante who had wept over his face when dead could as little forbear weeping to see him thus hungering and thirsting though he had expected to find him in the outskirts of the place among the delayers of repentance he asked his friend how he had so quickly got higher forese said it was owing to the prayers and tears of his good wife nella and then he burst into a strain of indignation against the contrast exhibited to her virtue by the general depravity of the florentine women whom he described as less modest than the halfnaked savages in the mountains of sardinia  what is to be said of such creatures continued he o my dear cousin i see a day at hand when these impudent women shall be for bidden from the pulpit to go exposing their naked bosoms what savages or what infidels ever needed that oh if they could see what heaven has in store for them their mouths would be this instant opened wide for howling44  forese then asked dante to explain to himself and his astonished fellowsufferers how it was that he stood there a living body of flesh and blood casting a shadow with his substance  if thou callest to mind said dante what sort of life thou and i led together the recollection may still grieve thee sorely he that walks here before us took me out of that life and through his guidance it is that i have visited in the body the world of the dead and am now traversing the mountain which leads us to the right path45  after some further explanation forese pointed out to his friend among the expiators of intemperance buonaggiunta of lucca the poet and pope martin the fourth with a face made sharper than the rest for the eels which he used to smother in wine and ubaldino of pila grinding his teeth on air and archbishop boniface of ravenna who fed jovially on his flock and rigogliosi of forli who had had time enough to drink in the other world and yet never was satisfied buonaggiunta and dante eyed one another with curiosity and the former murmured something about a lady of the name of gentucca  thou seemest to wish to speak with me said dante  thou art no admirer i believe of my native place said buonaggiunta and yet if thou art he whom i take thee to be there is a damsel there shall make it please thee art thou not author of the poem beginning  ladies that understand the lore of love46  i am one replied dante who writes as love would have him heeding no manner but his dictators and uttering simply what he suggests47  ay that is the sweet new style returned buonaggiunta and i now see what it was that hindered the notary and guittone and myself from hitting the right natural point and here he ceased speaking looking like one contented to have ascertained a truth48  the whole multitude then except forese skimmed away like cranes swift alike through eagerness and through leanness forese lingered a moment to have a parting word with his friend and to prophesy the violent end of the chief of his family corso run away with and dragged at the heels of his horse faster and faster till the frenzied animal smites him dead having given the poet this information the prophet speeded after the others  the companions now came to a second fruittree to which a multitude were in vain lifting up their hands just as children lift them to a man who tantalises them with shewing something which he withholds but a voice out of a thicket by the roadside warned the travellers not to stop telling them that the tree was an offset from that of which eve tasted call to mind said the voice those creatures of the clouds the centaurs whose feasting cost them their lives remember the hebrews how they dropped away from the ranks of gideon to quench their effeminate thirst49  the poets proceeded wrapt in thought till they heard another voice of a nature that made dante start and shake as if he had been some paltry hackney  of what value is thought said the voice if it lose its way the path lies hither  dante turned toward the voice and beheld a shape glowing red as in a furnace with a visage too dazzling to be looked upon it met him nevertheless as he drew nigh with an air from the fanning of its wings fresh as the first breathing of the wind on a may morning and fragrant as all its flowers and dante lost the sixth letter on his forehead and ascended with the two other poets into the seventh and last circle of the mountain  this circle was all in flames except a narrow path on the edge of its precipice along which the pilgrims walked a great wind from outside of the precipice kept the flames from raging beyond the path and in the midst of the fire went spirits expiating the sin of incontinence they sang the hymn beginning god of consummate mercy50 dante was compelled to divide his attention between his own footsteps and theirs in order to move without destruction at the close of the hymn they cried aloud i know not a man51 and then recommenced it after which they again cried aloud saying diana ran to the wood and drove calisto out of it because she knew the poison of venus and then again they sang the hymn and then extolled the memories of chaste women and husbands and so they went on without ceasing as long as their time of trial lasted  occasionally the multitude that went in one direction met another which mingled with and passed through it individuals of both greeting tenderly by the way as emmets appear to do when in passing they touch the antennæ of one another these two multitudes parted with loud and sorrowful cries proclaiming the offences of which they had been guilty and then each renewed their spiritual songs and prayers  the souls here as in former circles knew dante to be a living creature by the shadow which he cast and after the wonted explanations he learned who some of them were one was his predecessor in poetry guido guinicelli from whom he could not take his eyes for love and reverence till the sufferer who told him there was a greater than himself in the crowd vanished away through the fire as a fish does in water the greater one was arnauld daniel the provençal poet who after begging the prayers of the traveller disappeared in like manner  the sun by this time was setting on the fires of purgatory when an angel came crossing the road through them and then standing on the edge of the precipice with joy in his looks and singing blessed are the pure in heart invited the three poets to plunge into the flames themselves and so cross the road to the ascent by which the summit of the mountain was gained dante clasping his hands and raising them aloft recoiled in horror the thought of all that he had just witnessed made him feel as if his own hour of death was come his companion encouraged him to obey the angel but he could not stir virgil said now mark me son this is the only remaining obstacle between thee and beatrice and then himself and statius entering the fire dante followed them  i could have cast myself said he into molten glass to cool myself so raging was the furnace virgil talked of beatrice to animate him he said methinks i see her eyes beholding us there was indeed a great light upon the quarter to which they were crossing and out of the light issued a voice which drew them onwards singing come blessed of my father behold the sun is going down and the night cometh and the ascent is to be gained  the travellers gained the ascent issuing out of the fire and the voice and the light ceased and night was come unable to ascend farther in the darkness they made themselves a bed each of a stair in the rock and dante in his happy humility felt as if he had been a goat lying down for the night near two shepherds  towards dawn at the hour of the rising of the star of love he had a dream in which he saw a young and beautiful lady coming over a lea and bending every now and then to gather flowers and as she bound the flowers into a garland she sang i am leah gathering flowers to adorn myself that my looks may seem pleasant to me in the mirror but my sister rachel abides before the mirror flowerless contented with her beautiful eyes to behold is my sisters pleasure and to work is mine52  when dante awoke the beams of the dawn were visible and they now produced a happiness like that of the traveller who every time he awakes knows himself to be nearer home virgil and statius were already up and all three resuming their way to the mountains top stood upon it at last and gazed round about them on the skirts of the terrestrial paradise the sun was sparkling bright over a green land full of trees and flowers virgil then announced to dante that here his guidance terminated and that the creature of flesh and blood was at length to be master of his own movements to rest or to wander as he pleased the tried and purified lord over himself  the florentine eager to taste his new liberty left his companions awhile and strolled away through the celestial forest whose thick and lively verdure gave coolness to the senses in the midst of the brightest sun a fragrance came from every part of the soil a sweet unintermitting air streamed against the walkers face and as the fullhearted birds warbling on all sides welcomed the mornings radiance into the trees the trees themselves joined in the concert with a swelling breath like that which rises among the pines of chiassi when eolus lets loose the southwind and the gathering melody comes rolling through the forest from bough to bough53  dante had proceeded far enough to lose sight of the point at which he entered when he found himself on the bank of a rivulet compared with whose crystal purity the limpidest waters on earth were clouded and yet it flowed under a perpetual depth of shade which no beam either of sun or moon penetrated nevertheless the darkness was coloured with endless diversities of mayblossoms and the poet was standing in admiration looking up at it along its course when he beheld something that took away every other thought to wit a lady all alone on the other side of the water singing and culling flowers  ah lady said the poet who to judge by the cordial beauty in thy looks hast a heart overflowing with love be pleased to draw thee nearer to the stream that i may understand the words thou singest thou remindest me of proserpine of the place she was straying in and of what sort of creature she looked when her mother lost her and she herself lost the springtime on earth  as a lady turns in the dance when it goes smoothest moving round with lovely selfpossession and scarcely seeming to put one foot before the other so turned the lady towards the water over the yellow and vermilion flowers dropping her eyes gently as she came and singing so that dante could hear her then when she arrived at the water she stopped and raised her eyes towards him and smiled shewing him the flowers in her hands and shifting them with her fingers into a display of all their beauties never were such eyes beheld not even when venus herself was in love the stream was a little stream yet dante felt it as great an intervention between them as if it had been leanders hellespont  the lady explained to him the nature of the place and how the rivulet was the lethe of paradiselethe where he stood but called eunoe higher up the drink of the one doing away all remembrance of evil deeds and that of the other restoring all remembrance of good54 it was the region she said in which adam and eve had lived and the poets had beheld it perhaps in their dreams on mount parnassus and hence imagined their golden ageand at these words she looked at virgil and statius who by this time had come up and who stood smiling at her kindly words  resuming her song the lady turned and passed up along the rivulet the contrary way of the stream dante proceeding at the same rate of time on his side of it till on a sudden she cried behold and listen and a light of exceeding lustre came streaming through the woods followed by a dulcet melody the poets resumed their way in a rapture of expectation and saw the air before them glowing under the green boughs like fire a divine spectacle ensued of holy mystery with evangelical and apocalyptic images which gradually gave way and disclosed a car brighter than the chariot of the sun accompanied by celestial nymphs and showered upon by angels with a cloud of flowers in the midst of which stood a maiden in a white veil crowned with olive  the love that had never left dantes heart from childhood told him who it was and trembling in every vein he turned round to virgil for encouragement virgil was gone at that moment paradise and beatrice herself could not requite the pilgrim for the loss of his friend and the tears ran down his cheeks  dante said the veiled maiden across the stream weep not that virgil leaves thee weep thou not yet the stroke of a sharper sword is coming at which it will behove thee to weep then assuming a sterner attitude and speaking in the tone of one who reserves the bitterest speech for the last she added observe me well i am as thou suspectest beatrice indeedbeatrice who has to congratulate thee on deigning to seek the mountain at last and hadst thou so long indeed to learn that here only can man be happy  dante casting down his eyes at these words beheld his face in the water and hastily turned aside he saw it so full of shame  beatrice had the dignified manner of an offended parent such a flavour of bitterness was mingled with her pity  she held her peace and the angels abruptly began singing in thee o lord have i put my trust but went no farther in the psalm than the words thou hast set my feet in a large room the tears of dante had hitherto been suppressed but when the singing began they again rolled down his cheeks  beatrice in a milder tone said to the angels this man when he proposed to himself in his youth to lead a new life was of a truth so gifted that every good habit ought to have thrived with him but the richer the soil the greater peril of weeds for a while the innocent light of my countenance drew him the right way but when i quitted mortal life he took away his thoughts from remembrance of me and gave himself to others when i had risen from flesh to spirit and increased in worth and beauty then did i sink in his estimation and he turned into other paths and pursued false images of good that never keep their promise in vain i obtained from heaven the power of interfering in his behalf and endeavoured to affect him with it night and day so little was he concerned and into such depths he fell that nothing remained but to shew him the state of the condemned and therefore i went to their outer regions and commended him with tears to the guide that brought him hither the decrees of heaven would be nought if lethe could be passed and the fruit beyond it tasted without any payment of remorse55  o thou she continued addressing herself to dante who standest on the other side of the holy stream say have i not spoken truth  dante was so confused and penitent that the words failed as they passed his lips  what could induce thee resumed his monitress when i had given thee aims indeed to abandon them for objects that could end in nothing  dante said thy face was taken from me and the presence of false pleasure led me astray  never didst thou behold cried the maiden loveliness like mine and if bliss failed thee because of my death how couldst thou be allured by mortal inferiority that first blow should have taught thee to disdain all perishable things and aspire after the soul that had gone before thee how could thy spirit endure to stoop to further chances or to a childish girl or any other fleeting vanity the bird that is newly out of the nest may be twice or thrice tempted by the snare but in vain surely is the net spread in sight of one that is older56  dante stood as silent and abashed as a sorry child  if but to hear me said beatrice thus afflicts thee lift up thy beard and see what sight can do  dante though feeling the sting intended by the word beard did as he was desired the angels had ceased to scatter their clouds of flowers about the maiden and be beheld her though still beneath her veil as far surpassing her former self in loveliness as that self had surpassed others the sight pierced him with such pangs that the more he had loved any thing else the more he now loathed it and he fell senseless to the ground  when he recovered his senses he found himself in the hands of the lady he had first seen in the place who bidding him keep firm hold of her drew him into the river lethe and so through and across it to the other side speeding as she went like a weavers shuttle and immersing him when she arrived the angels all the while singing wash me and i shall be whiter than snow57 she then delivered him into the hands of the nymphs that had danced about the carnymphs on earth but stars and cardinal virtues in heaven a song burst from the lips of the angels and faith hope and charity calling upon beatrice to unveil her face she did so and dante quenched the tenyears thirst of his eyes in her ineffable beauty58  after a while he and statius were made thoroughly regenerate with the waters of eunoe and he felt pure with a new being and fit to soar into the stars   footnote 1    dolce color doriental zaffiro   che saccoglieva nel serenoaspetto   de laer puro infino al

that again they felt assured and glad   soon as they issued forth from the dead air   where every sight and thought had made them sad    the beauteous star which lets no love despair   made all the orient laugh with loveliness   veiling the fish that glimmered in its hair    i turned me to the right to gaze and bless   and saw four more never of living wight   beheld since adam brought us our distress    heaven seemed rejoicing in their happy light   o widowed northern pole bereaved indeed   since thou hast had no power to see that sight  readers who may have gone thus far with the italian pilgrims progress will allow me to congratulate them on arriving at this lovely scene one of the most admired in the poem  this is one of the passages which make the religious admirers of dante inclined to pronounce him divinely inspired for how could he otherwise have seen stars they ask us which were not discovered till after his time and which compose the constellation of the cross but other commentators are of opinion that the cross though not so named till subsequently and dante we see gives no prophetic hint about the name had been seen probably by stray navigators an arabian globe is even mentioned by m artaud see cary in which the southern cross is set down mr cary in his note on the passage refers to senecas prediction of the discovery of america most likely suggested by similar information but whatever he adds may be thought of this it is certain that the four stars are here symbolical of the four cardinal virtues and he refers to canto xxxi where those virtues are retrospectively associated with these stars the symbol however is not necessary dante was a very curious inquirer on all subjects and evidently acquainted with ships and seamen as well as geography and his imagination would eagerly have seized a magnificent novelty like this and used it the first opportunity columbuss discovery as the reader will see was anticipated by pulci  footnote 2 generous and disinterestedcato the republican enemy of cæsar and committer of suicide is not luckily chosen for his present office by the poet who has put brutus into the devils mouth in spite of his agreeing with cato and the suicide piero delle vigne into hell in spite of his virtues but dante thought catos austere manners like his own  footnote 3 the girding with the rush giunco schietto is supposed by the commentators to be an injunction of simplicity and patience perhaps it is to enjoin sincerity especially as the region of expiation has now been entered and sincerity is the first step to repentance it will be recollected that dantes former girdle the cord of the franciscan friars has been left in the hands of fraud  footnote 4    lalba vinceva lora mattutina   che fuggia nnanzi sì che di lontano   conobbi il tremolar de la marina    the lingering shadows now began to flee   before the whitening dawn so that mine eyes   discerned far off the trembling of the sea    conobbi il tremolar de la marina is a beautiful verse both for the picture and the sound  footnote 5 this evidence of humility and gratitude on the part of dante would be very affecting if we could forget all the pride and passion he has been shewing elsewhere and the torments in which he has left his fellowcreatures with these recollections upon us it looks like an overweening piece of selfcongratulation at other peoples expense  footnote 6    amor che ne la mente mi ragiona   de la mia donna disiosamente  is the beginning of the ode sung by dantes friend the incident is beautifully introduced and casellas being made to select a production from the pen of the man who asks him to sing very delicately implies a graceful cordiality in the musicians character  milton alludes to the passage in his sonnet to henry lawes    thou honourst verse and verse must lend her wing   to honour thee the priest of phoebus quire   that tunst their happiest lines in hymn or story   dante shall give fame leave to set thee higher   than his casella whom he wooed to sing   met in the milder shades of purgatory    footnote 7 manfredi was the natural son of the emperor frederick the second he was lively and agreeable in his manners observes mr cary and delighted in poetry music and dancing but he was luxurious and ambitious void of religion and in his philosophy an epicurean translation of dante smiths edition p 77 thus king manfredi ought to have been in a redhot tomb roasting for ever with epicurus himself and with the father of the poets beloved friend guido cavalcante but he was the son of an emperor and a foe to the house of anjou so dante gives him a passport to heaven there is no ground whatever for the repentance assumed in the text  footnote 8 the unexpected bit of comedy here ensuing

reports and suspicions continually reviving led to a frightful catastrophe it is not easy to determine at this day if his wife was altogether innocent but dante has represented her as such her husband carried her with him into the marshes of volterra celebrated then as now for the pestiferous effects of the air never would he tell his wife the reason of her banishment into so dangerous a place his pride did not deign to pronounce either complaint or accusation he lived with her alone in a deserted tower of which i have been to see the ruins on the seashore he never broke his disdainful silence

lucy lucia supposed to be derived from lux lucis is the goddess i was almost going to say who in roman catholic countries may be said to preside over light and who is really invoked in maladies of the

writings dante had an esteem and the poet who is to chase them from the nest caccerà di nido as the not very friendly metaphor states it is with good reason supposed to be himself he was right but was the statement becoming it was certainly not necessary dante notwithstanding his friendship with guido appears to have had a grudge against both the cavalcanti probably for some scorn they had shewn to his superstition far they could be proud themselves and the son has the reputation of scepticism as well as the father see the decameron giorn vi nov 9  footnote 25 this is the passage from which it is conjectured that dante knew what it was to tremble in every vein from the awful necessity of begging mr cary with some other commentators thinks that the trembling implies fear of being refused but does it not rather mean the agony of the humiliation in salvanis case it certainly does for it was in consideration of the pang to his pride that the good deed rescued him from worse punishment  footnote 26 the reader will have noticed the extraordinary mixture of paganism and the bible in this passage especially the introduction of such fables as niobe and arachne it would be difficult not to suppose it intended to work out some half sceptical purpose if we did not call to mind the grave authority given to fables in the poets treatise on monarchy and the whole strange spirit at once logical and gratuitous of the learning of his age when the acuter the mind the subtler became the reconcilement with absurdity  footnote 27 beati pauperes spiritu blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heavenone of the beautiful passages of the beautiful sermon on the mount how could the great poet read and admire such passages and yet fill his books so full of all which they renounced oh say his idolators he did it out of his very love for them and his impatience to see them triumph so said the inquisition the evil was continued for the sake of the good which it prevented the result in the longrun may be so but not for the reasons they supposed or from blindness to the indulgence of their bad passions  footnote 28    sàvia non fui avvegna che sapìa   fosse chiamata the pun is poorer even than it sounds in english for though the italian name may possibly remind its readers of sapienza sapience there is the difference of a v in the adjective savia which is also accented on the first syllable it is almost as bad as if she had said in english sophist i found myself though sophia is my name it is pleasant however to see the great saturnine poet among the punstersit appears from the commentators that sapia was in exile at the time of the battle but they do not say for what probably from some zeal of faction  footnote 29 we are here let into dantes confessions he owns to a little envy but far more pride    gli occhi diss io mi fieno ancor qui tolti   ma picciol tempo che poch è loffesa   fatta per esser con invidia volti   troppa è più la paura ond è sospesa   lanima mia del tormento di sotto   che già lo ncarco di là giù mi pesa  the first confession is singularly ingenuous and modest the second affecting it is curious to guess what sort of persons dante could have allowed himself to envyprobably those who were more acceptable to women  footnote 29 aglauros daughter of cecrops king of athens was turned to stone by mercury for disturbing with her envy his passion for her sister herse  the passage about cain is one of the sublimest in dante truly wonderful and characteristic is the way in which he has made physical noise and violence express the anguish of the wanderers mind we are not to suppose i conceive that we see cain we know he has passed us by his thunderous and headlong words dante may well make him invisible for his words are thingsveritable thunderbolts  cain comes in rapid successions of thunderclaps the voice of aglauros is thunderclaps crashing into one anotherbroken thunder this is exceedingly fine also and wonderful as a variation upon that awful music but cain is the astonishment and the overwhelmingness if it were not however for the second thunder we should not have had the two silences for i doubt whether they are not better even than one at all events the final silence is tremendous  footnote 30 st luke ii 48  footnote 31 the stoning of stephen  footnote 32 these illustrative spectacles are not among the best inventions of dante their introduction is forced and the instances not always pointed a murderess too of her son changed into such a bird as the nightingale was not a happy association of ideas in homer where dante found it and i am surprised he made use of it intimate as he must have been with the less inconsistent story of her namesake philomela in the metamorphoses  footnote 33 so at least i conceive by what appears afterwards and i may here add once for all that i have supplied the similar requisite intimations at each successive step in purgatory the poet seemingly having forgotten to do so it is necessary to what he implied in the outset the whole poem it is to be remembered is thought to have wanted his final revision  footnote 34 what an instance to put among those of haste to do good but the fame and accomplishments of cæsar and his being at the head of our ghibellines beloved emperors fairly overwhelmed dantes boasted impartiality  footnote 35 a masterly allegory of worldly pleasure but the close of it in the original has an intensity of the revolting which outrages the last recesses of feeling and disgusts us with the denouncer  footnote 36 the fierce hugh capet soliloquising about the virgin in the tones of a lady in childbed is rather too ludicrous an association of ideas it was for calling this prince the son of a butcher that francis the first prohibited the admission of dantes poem into his dominions mr cary thinks the king might have been mistaken in his interpretation of the passage and that butcher may be simply a metaphorical term for the bloodthirstiness of capets father but when we find the man called not the butcher or that butcher or butcher in reference to his species but in plain local parlance a butcher of paris un beccaio di parigi and when this designation is followed up by the allusion to the extinction of the previous dynasty the ordinary construction of the words appears indisputable dante seems to have had no ground for what his aristocratical pride doubtless considered a hard blow and what king francis indeed condescended to feel as such he met with the notion somewhere and chose to believe it in order to vex the french and their princes the spirit of the taunt contradicts his own theories elsewhere for he has repeatedly said that the only true nobility is in the mind but his writings poetical truth excepted are a heap of contradictions  footnote 37 mr cary thought he had seen an old romance in which there is a combat of this kind between jesus and his betrayer i have an impression to the same effect  footnote 38    o signor mio quando sarò io lieto   a veder la vendetta the nascosa   fa dolce lira tua nel tuo segreto  the spirit of the blasphemous witticism attributed to another italian viz that the reason why god prohibited revenge to mankind was its being too delicate a morsel for any but himself is here gravely anticipated as a positive compliment to god by the fierce poet of the thirteenth century who has been held up as a great christian divine god hugs revenge to his bosom with delight the supreme being confounded with a poor grinning florentine  footnote 39 a ludicrous anticlimax this to modern ears the allusion is to the pygmalion who was didos brother and who murdered her husband the priest sichæus for his riches the term parricide is here applied in its secondary sense ofthe murderer of any one to whom we owe reverence  footnote 40 heliodorus was a plunderer of the temple thus supernaturally punished the subject has been nobly treated by raphael  footnote 41 a grand and beautiful fiction  footnote 42 readers need hardly be told that there is no foundation for this fancy except in the invention of the churchmen dante in another passage not necessary to give confounds the poet statius who was from naples with a rhetorician of the same name from thoulouse  footnote 43    parèn locchiaje anella senza gemme  this beautiful and affecting image is followed in the original by one of the most fantastical conceits of the time the poet says that the physiognomist who reads the word omo homo man written in the face of the human being might easily have seen the letter m in theirs    chi nel viso de gli uomini legge o m o   bene avria quivi conosciuto lemme  the meaning is that the perpendicular lines of the nose and temples form the letter m and the eyes the two os the enthusiast for roman domination must have been delighted to find that nature wrote in latin  footnote 44    se le svergognate fosser certe   di quel che l ciel veloce loro ammanna   gia per urlare avrian le bocche aperte  this will remind the reader of the style of that gentle christian john knox who instead of offering his own cheek to the smiters delighted to smite the cheeks of women fury was his mode of preaching meekness and threats of everlasting howling his reproof of a tune on sundays but it will be said he looked to consequences yes and produced the worst himself both spiritual and temporal let the whiskyshops answer him however he helped to save scotland from purgatory so we must take good and bad together and hope the best in the end  forese like many of dantes preachers seems to have been one of those selfignorant or selfexasperated denouncers who compound for sins they are inclined to by damning those they have no mind to he was a glutton who could not bear to see ladies too little clothed the defacing of gods image in his own person he considered nothing  footnote 45 the passage respecting his past life is unequivocal testimony to the fact confidently disputed by some of dantes having availed himself of the license of the time though in justice to such candour we are bound not to think worse of it than can be helped the words in the original are    se ti riduci a mente   qual fosti meco e quale io teco fui   ancor fia grave il memorar presente  literally if thou recallest to mind what sort of person thou wast with me and what i was with thee the recollection may oppress thee still  his having been taken out of that kind of life by virgil construed in the literal sense in which among other senses he has directed us to construe him may imply either that the delight of reading virgil first made him think of living in a manner more becoming a man of intellect or possibly that the latin poets description of Æneass descent into hell turned his thoughts to religious penitence be this as it may his life though surely it could at no time have been of any very licentious kind never if we are to believe boccaccio became spotless  footnote 46 the mention of gentucca might be thought a compliment to the lady if dante had not made beatrice afterwards treat his regard for any one else but herself with so much contempt see page 216 of the present volume under that circumstance it is hardly acting like a gentleman to speak of her at all unless indeed he thought her a person who would be pleased with the notoriety arising even from the record of a fugitive regard and in that case the good taste of the record would still remain doubtful the probability seems to be that dante was resolved at all events to take this opportunity of bearding some rumour  footnote 47 a celebrated and charming passage    io mi son un che quando   amore spira noto e a quel modo   che detta dentro vo significando    i am one that notes   when love inspires and what he speaks i tell   in his own way embodying but his thoughts  footnote 48 exquisite truth of painting and a very elegant compliment to the handsome nature of buonaggiunta jacopo da lentino called the notary and fra guittone of arezzo were celebrated versewriters of the day the latter in a sonnet given by mr cary in the notes to his translation says he shall be delighted to hear the trumpet at the last day dividing mankind into the happy and the tormented sufferers under crudel martire because an inscription will then be seen on his forehead shewing that he had been a slave to love an odd way for a poet to shew his feelings and a friar his religion  footnote 49 judges vii 6  footnote 50 summæ deus clementiæ the ancient beginning of a hymn in the roman catholic church now altered say the commentators to summæ parens clementiæ  footnote 51 virum non cognosco then said mary unto the angel how shall this be seeing i know not a manluke i 34  the placing of marys interview with the angel and ovids story of calisto upon apparently the same identical footing of authority by spirits in all the sincerity of agonised penitence is very remarkable a dissertation by some competent antiquary on the curious question suggested by these anomalies would be a welcome novelty in the world of letters  footnote 52 an allegory of the active and contemplative lifenot i think a happy one though beautifully painted it presents apart from its terminating comment no necessary intellectual suggestion is rendered by the comment itself hardly consistent with leahs express love of ornament and if it were not for the last sentence might be taken for a picture of two different forms of vanity  footnote 53    tal qual di ramo in

cose gravi ed illustri see his dante in that collection vol ii p 297  footnote 56 the allusion to the childish girl pargoletta or any other fleeting vanity    o altra vanità con sì breve use  is not handsome it was not the fault of the childish girls that he liked them and he should not have taunted them whatever else they might have been what answer could they make to the great poet  nor does beatrice make a good figure throughout this scene whether as a woman or an allegory if she is theology or heavenly grace c the sternness of the allegory should not have been put into female shape and when she is to be taken in her literal sense as the poet also tells us she is her treatment of the poor submissive lover with leave of signor rubbi is no better than snubbingto say nothing of the vanity with which she pays compliments to her own beauty  i must furthermore beg leave to differ with the poets thinking it an exalted symptom on his part to hate every thing he had loved before out of supposed compliment the transcendental object of his affections and his own awakened merits all the heights of love and wisdom terminate in charity and charity by very reason of its knowing the poorness of so many things hates nothing besides it is any thing but handsome or highminded to turn round upon objects whom we have helped to lower with our own gratified passions and pretend a right to scorn them  footnote 57  tu asperges me et mundabor c purge me with hyssop and i shall be clean wash me and i shall be whiter than snowpsalm li 7  footnote 58 beatrice had been dead ten years   iii  the journey through heaven argument  the paradise or heaven of dante in whose time the received system of astronomy was the ptolemaic consists of the seven successive planets according to that system or the moon mercury venus the sun mars jupiter and saturn of the eighth sphere beyond these or that of the fixed stars of the primum mobile or first mover of them all round the moveless earth and of the empyrean or region of pure light in which is the beatific vision each of these ascending spheres is occupied by its proportionate degree of faith and virtue and dante visits each under the guidance of beatrice receiving many lessons as he goes on theological and other subjects here left out and being finally admitted after the sight of christ and the virgin to a glimpse of the great first cause   the journey through heaven  it was evening now on earth and morning on the top of the hill in purgatory when beatrice having fixed her eyes upon the sun dante fixed his eyes upon hers and suddenly found himself in heaven  he had been transported by the attraction of love and beatrice was by his side  the poet beheld from where he stood the blaze of the empyrean and heard the music of the spheres yet he was only in the first or lowest heaven the circle of the orb of the moon  this orb with his new guide he proceeded to enter it had seemed outside as solid though as lucid as diamond yet they entered it as sunbeams are admitted into water without dividing the substance it now appeared as it enclosed them like a pearl through the essence of which they saw but dimly and they beheld many faces eagerly looking at them as if about to speak but not more distinct from the surrounding whiteness than pearls themselves are from the forehead they adorn1 dante thought them only reflected faces and turned round to see to whom they belonged when his smiling companion set him right and he entered into discourse with the spirit that seemed the most anxious to accost him it was piccarda the sister of his friend forese donati whom he had met in the sixth region of purgatory he did not know her by reason of her wonderful increase in beauty she and her associates were such as had been vowed to a life of chastity and religion but had been compelled by others to break their vows this had been done in piccardas instance by her brother corso2 on  dantes asking if they did not long for a higher state of bliss she and her sisterspirits gently smiled and then answered with faces as happy as first love3 that they willed only what it pleased god to give them and therefore were truly blest the poet found by this answer that every place in heaven was paradise though the bliss might be of different degrees piccarda then shewed him the spirit at her side lustrous with all the glory of the region costanza daughter of the king of sicily who had been forced out of the cloister to become the wife of the emperor henry having given him this information she began singing ave maria and while singing disappeared with the rest as substances disappear in water4  a loving will transported the two companions as before to the next circle of heaven where they found themselves in the planet mercury the residence of those who had acted rather out of desire of fame than love of god the spirits here as in the former heaven crowded towards them as fish in a clear pond crowd to the hand that offers them food their eyes sparkled with celestial joy and the more they thought of their joy the brighter they grew till one of them who addressed the poet became indistinguishable for excess of splendour it was the soul of the emperor justinian justinian told him the whole story of the roman empire up to his time and then gave an account of one of his associates in bliss romèo who had been minister to raymond beranger count of provence four daughters had been born to raymond beranger and every one became a queen and all this had been brought about by romèo a poor stranger from another country the courtiers envying romèo incited raymond to demand of him an account of his stewardship though he had brought his masters treasury twelvefold for every ten it disbursed romeo quitted the court poor and old and if the world said justinian could know the heart such a man must have had begging his bread as he went crust by crustpraise him as it does it would praise him a great deal more5    hosanna holy god of sabaoth   superillumining with light of light   the happy fires of these thy malahoth6  thus began singing the soul of the emperor justinian and then turning as he sang vanished with those about him like sparks of fire  dante now found himself before he was aware in the third heaven or planet venus the abode of the amorous7 he only knew it by the increased loveliness in the face of his companion  the spirits in this orb who came and went in the light of it like sparks in fire or like voices chanting in harmony with voice were spun round in circles of delight each with more or less swiftness according to its share of the beatific vision several of them came sweeping out of their dance towards the poet who had sung of love among whom was his patron charles martel king of hungary who shewed him the reason why diversities of natures must occur in families and cunizza sister of the tyrant ezzelino who was overcome by this her star when on earth and folco the troubadour whose place was next cunizza in heaven and rahab the harlot who favoured the entrance of the jews into the holy land and whose place was next folco8 cunizza said that she did not at all regret a lot which carried her no higher whatever the vulgar might think of such an opinion she spoke of the glories of the jewel who was close to her folcocontrasted his zeal with the inertness of her contemptible countrymenand foretold the bloodshed that awaited the latter from wars and treacheries the troubadour meanwhile glowed in his aspect like a ruby stricken with the sun for in heaven joy is expressed by effulgence as on earth by laughter he confessed the lawless fires of his youth as great he said as those of dido or hercules but added that he had no recollection of them except a joyous one not for the fault which does not come to mind in heaven but for the good which heaven brings out of it folco concluded with explaining how rahab had come into the third heaven and with denouncing the indifference of popes and cardinals those adulterers of the church to every thing but accursed moneygetting9  in an instant before he could think about it dante was in the fourth heaven the sun the abode of blessed doctors of the church a band of them came encircling him and his guide as a halo encircles the moon singing a song the beauty of which like jewels too rich to be exported was not conveyable by expression to mortal fancy the spirits composing the band were those of st thomas aquinas albertus magnus gratian the benedictine pietro lombardo solomon saint dionysius the areopagite paulus orosius boetius isidore the venerable bede richard of st victor and sigebert of gemblours st thomas was the namer of them to dante their song had paused that he might speak but when he had done speaking they began resuming it one by one and circling as they moved like the wheels of churchclocks that sound one after another with a sweet tinkling when they summon the hearts of the devout to morning prayer10  again they stopped and again st thomas addressed the poet he was of the order of st dominic but with generous grace he held up the founder of the franciscans with his vow of poverty as the example of what a pope should be and reproved the errors of no order but his own on the other hand a new circle of doctors of the church making their appearance and enclosing the first as rainbow encloses rainbow rolling round with it in the unison of a twofold joy a voice from the new circle attracted the poets ear as the pole attracts the needle and saint buonaventura a franciscan opened upon the praises of st dominic the loving minion of christianity the holy wrestlerbenign to his friends and cruel to his enemies11and so confined his reproofs to his own franciscan order he then as st thomas had done with the doctors in the inner circle named those who constituted the outer to wit illuminato and agostino and hugues of st victor and petrus comestor and pope john the twentyfirst nathan the prophet chrysostom anselmo of canterbury donatus who deigned to teach grammar raban of mentz and joachim of calabria the two circles then varied their movement by wheeling round one another in counter directions and after they had chanted not of bacchus or apollo but of three persons in one st thomas who knew dantes thoughts by intuition again addressed him discoursing of mysteries human and divine exhorting him to be slow in giving assent or denial to propositions without examination and bidding him warn people in general how they presumed to anticipate the divine judgment as to who should be saved and who not12 the spirit of solomon then related how souls could resume their bodies glorified and the two circles uttering a rapturous amen glowed with such intolerable brightness that the eyes of beatrice only were able to sustain it dante gazed on her with a delight ineffable and suddenly found himself in the fifth heaven  it was the planet mars the receptacle of those who had died fighting for the cross in the middle of its ruddy light stood a cross itself of enormous dimensions made of light still greater and exhibiting first in the body of it the crucified presence glittering all over with indescribable flashes like lightning and secondly in addition to and across the presence innumerable sparkles of the intensest mixture of white and red darting to and fro through the whole extent of the crucifix the movement was like that of motes in a sunbeam and as a sweet dinning arises from the multitudinous touching of harps and viols before the ear distinguishes the notes there issued in like manner from the whole glittering ferment a harmony indistinct but exquisite which entranced the poet beyond all he had ever felt he heard even the words arise and conquer as one who hears and yet hears not  on a sudden with a glide like a falling star there ran down from the right horn of the cross to the foot of it one of the lights of this cluster of splendours distinguishing itself as it went like flame in alabaster  o flesh of my flesh it exclaimed to dante o superabounding divine grace when was the door of paradise ever twice opened as it shall have been to thee13 dante in astonishment turned to beatrice and saw such a rapture of delight in her eyes that he seemed at that instant as if his own had touched the depth of his acceptance and of his heaven14  the light resumed its speech but in words too profound in their meaning for dante to comprehend they seemed to be returning thanks to god this rapturous absorption being ended the speaker expressed in more human terms his gratitude to beatrice and then after inciting dante to ask his name declared himself thus  o branch of mine whom i have long desired to behold i am the root of thy stock of him thy greatgrandsire who first brought from his mother the familyname into thy house and whom thou sawest expiating his sin of pride on the first circle of the mountain

his family and of the old state of florence the beatified soldier resumed he would not however speak of his own predecessors he said it would be more becoming to say nothing as to who they were or the place they came from all he disclosed was that his father and mother lived near the gate san piero17 with regard to florence he continued the number of the inhabitants fit to carry arms was at that time not a fifth of its present amount but then the blood of the whole city was pure it had not been mixed up with that of campi and certaldo and figghine it ran clear in the veins of the humblest

and what will soon become of sinigaglia too and of chiusi and if cities perish what is to be expected of families in my time the ughi the catellini the filippi were great names so were the alberichi the ormanni and twenty others the golden sword of knighthood was then to be seen in the house of galigaio the column verrey was then a great thing in the heralds eye the galli the sacchetti were great so was the old trunk of the calfucci so was that of the peculators who now blush to hear of a measure of wheat and the sizii and the arrigucci were drawn in pomp to their civic chairs oh how mighty i saw them then and how low has their pride brought them florence in those days deserved her name she flourished indeed and the balls of gold were ever at the top of the flower18 and now the descendants of these men sit in priestly stalls and grow fat the overweening adimari who are such dragons when their foes run and such lambs when they turn were then of note so little that albertino donato was angry with bellincion his fatherinlaw for making him brother to one of their females on the other hand thy foes the amidei the origin of all thy tears through the just anger which has slain the happiness of thy life were honoured in those days and the honour was par taken by their friends o buondelmonte why didst thou break thy troth to thy first love and become wedded to another many who are now miserable would have been happy had god given thee to the river ema when it rose against thy first coming to florence but the arno had swept our palladium from its bridge and florence was to be the victim on its altar19  cacciaguida was again silent but his descendant begged him to speak yet a little more he had heard as he came through the nether regions alarming intimations of the ill fortune that awaited him and he was anxious to know from so high and certain an authority what it would really be  cacciaguida said as hippolytus was forced to depart from athens by the wiles of his cruel stepdame so must even thou depart out of florence such is the wish such this very moment the plot and soon will it be the deed of those the business of whose lives is to make a traffic of christ with rome thou shalt quit every thing that is dearest to thee in the world that is the first arrow shot from the bow of exile thou shalt experience how salt is the taste of bread eaten at the expense of others how hard is the going up and down others stairs but what shall most bow thee down is the worthless and disgusting company with whom thy lot must be partaken for they shall all turn against thee the whole mad heartless and ungrateful set nevertheless it shall not be long first before themselves and not thou shall have cause to hang down their heads for shame the brutishness of all they do will shew how well it became thee to be of no party but the party of thyself20  thy first refuge thou shalt owe to the courtesy of the great lombard who bears the ladder charged with the holy bird21 so benignly shall he regard thee that in the matter of asking and receiving the customary order of things shall be reversed between you two and the gift anticipate the request with him thou shalt behold the mortal born under so strong an influence of this our star that the nations shall take note of him they are not aware of him yet by reason of his tender age but ere the gascon practise on the great henry sparkles of his worth shall break forth in his contempt of money and of ease and when his munificence appears in all its lustre his very enemies shall not be able to hold their tongues for admiration22 look thou to this second benefactor also for many a change of the lots of people shall he make both rich and poor and do thou bear in mind but repeat not what further i shall now tell thee of thy life here the spirit says the poet foretold things which afterwards appeared incredible to their very beholdersand then added such my son is the heart and mystery of the things thou hast desired to learn the snares will shortly gather about thee but wish not to change places with the contrivers for thy days will outlast those of their retribution  again was the spirit silent and yet again once more did his descendant question him anxious to have the advice of one that saw so far and that spoke the truth so purely and loved him so well  too plainly my father said dante do i see the time coming when a blow is to be struck me heaviest ever to the man that is not true to himself for which reason it is fit that i so far arm myself beforehand that in losing the spot dearest to me on earth i do not let my verses deprive me of every other refuge now i have been down below through the region whose grief is without end and i have scaled the mountain from the top of which i was lifted by my ladys eyes and i have come thus far through heaven from luminary to luminary and in the course of this my pilgrimage i have heard things which if i tell again may bitterly disrelish with many yet on the other hand if i prove but a timid friend to truth i fear i shall not survive with the generations by whom the present times will be called times of old  the light that enclosed the treasure which its descendant had found in heaven first flashed at this speech like a golden mirror against the sun and then it replied thus  let the consciences blush at thy words that have reason to blush do thou far from shadow of misrepresentation make manifest all which thou hast seen and let the sore places be galled that deserve it thy bitter truths shall carry with them vital nourishmentthy voice as the wind does shall smite loudest the loftiest summits and no little shall that redound to thy praise it is for this reason that in all thy journey thou hast been shewn none but spirits of note since little heed would have been taken of such as excite doubt by their obscurity  the spirit of cacciaguida now relapsed into the silent joy of its reflections and the poet was standing absorbed in the mingled feelings of his own when beatrice said to him change the current of thy thoughts consider how near i am in heaven to one that repayeth every wrong  dante turned at the sound of this comfort and felt no longer any other wish than to look upon her eyes but she said with a smile turn thee round again and attend i am not thy only paradise and dante again turned and saw his ancestor prepared to say more  cacciaguida bade him look again on the cross and he should see various spirits as he named them flash over it like lightning and they did so that of joshua which was first mentioned darted along the cross in a stream the light of judas maccabeus went spinning as if joy had scourged it23 charlemagne and orlando swept away together pursued by the poets eyes guglielmo24 followed and rinaldo and godfrey of bouillon and robert guiscard of naples and the light of cacciaguida himself darted back to its place and uttering another sort of voice began shewing how sweet a singer he too was amidst the glittering choir  dante turned to share the joy with beatrice and by the lovely paling of her cheek like a maidens when it delivers itself of the burden of a blush25 knew that he was in another and whiter star it was the planet jupiter the abode of blessed administrators of justice  here he beheld troops of dazzling essences warbling as they flew and shaping their flights hither and thither like birds when they rise from the banks of rivers and rejoice with one another in newfound pasture but the figures into which the flights were shaped were of a more special sort being mystical compositions of letters of the alphabet now a d now an i now an l and so on till the poet observed that they completed the whole text of scripture which says diligite justitiam qui judicatis terramlove righteousness ye that be judges of the earth the last letter m they did not decompose like the rest but kept it entire for a while and glowed so deeply within it that the silvery orb thereabout seemed burning with gold other lights with a song of rapture then descended like a crown of lilies on the top of the letter and then from the body of it rose thousands of sparks as from a shaken firebrand and gradually expanding into the form of an eagle the lights which had descended like lilies distributed themselves over the whole bird encrusting it with rubies flashing in the sun  but what says the poet was never yet heard of written or imaginedthe beak of the eagle spoke it uttered many minds in one voice just as one heat is given out by many embers and proclaimed itself to have been thus exalted because it united justice and mercy while on earth  dante addressed this splendid phenomenon and prayed it to ease his mind of the perplexities of its worldly reason respecting the divine nature and government and the exclusion from heaven of goodness itself unless within the christian pale  the celestial bird rousing itself into motion with delight like a falcon in the conscious energy of its will and beauty when upon being set free from its hood it glances above it into the air and claps its selfcongratulating wings answered nevertheless somewhat disdainfully that it was impossible for man in his mortal state to comprehend such things and that the astonishment he feels at them though doubtless it would be excusable under other circumstances must rest satisfied with the affirmations of scripture  the bird then bent over its questioner as a stork does over the nestling newly fed when it looks up at her and then wheeling round and renewing its warble concluded it with saying as my notes are to thee that understandest them not so are the judgments of the eternal to thine earthly brethren none ever yet ascended into these heavenly regions that did not believe in christ either after he was crucified or before it yet many who call christ christ shall at the last day be found less near to him than such as knew him not what shall the kings of islam say to your christian kings when they see the book of judgment opened and hear all that is set down in it to their dishonour in that book shall be read the desolation which albert will inflict on bohemia26in that book the woes inflicted on paris by that adulterator of his kingdoms money who shall die by the hogs teethin that book the ambition which makes such mad fools of the scotch and english kings that they cannot keep within their boundsin that book the luxury of the spaniard and the effeminate life of the bohemian who neither knows nor cares for any thing worthyin that book the lame wretch of jerusalem whose value will be expressed by a unit and his worthlessness by a millionin that book the avarice and cowardice of the warder of the isle of fire in which old anchises died and that the record may answer the better to his abundant littleness the writing shall be in shorthand and his uncles and his brothers filthy doings shall be read in that bookthey who have made such rottenness of a good old house and two diadems and there also shall the portuguese and the norwegian be known for what they are and the coiner of dalmatia who beheld with such covetous eyes the venetian ducat o blessed hungary if thou wouldst resolve to endure no longero blessed navarre if thou wouldst but keep out the frenchman with thy mountain walls may the cries and groans of nicosia and famagosta be an earnest of those happier days proclaiming as they do the vile habits of the beast who keeps so close in the path of the herd his brethren  the blessed bird for a moment was silent but as at the going down of the sun the heavens are darkened and then break forth into innumerable stars which the sun lights up27 so the splendours within the figure of the bird suddenly became more splendid and broke forth into songs too beautiful for mortal to remember  o dulcet love that dost shew thee forth in smiles how ardent was thy manifestation in the lustrous sparkles which arose out of the mere thoughts of those pious hearts  after the gems in that glittering figure had ceased chiming their angelic songs the poet seemed to hear the murmur of a river which comes falling from rock to rock and chews by the fulness of its tone the abundance of its mountain spring and as the sound of the guitar is modulated on the neck of it and the breath of the pipe is accordant to the spiracle from which it issues so the murmuring within the eagle suddenly took voice and rising through the neck again issued forth in words the bird now bade the poet fix his attention on its eye because of all the fires that composed its figure those that sparkled in the eye were the noblest the spirit it said which dante beheld in the pupil was that of the royal singer who danced before the ark now enjoying the reward of his superiority to vulgar discernment of the five spirits that composed the eyebrow the one nearest the beak was trajan now experienced above all others in the knowledge of what it costs not to follow christ by reason of his having been in hell before he was translated to heaven next to trajan was hezekiah whose penitence delayed for him the hour of his death next hezekiah constantine though in letting the pope become a prince instead of a pastor he had unwittingly brought destruction on the world next constantine william the good of sicily whose death is not more lamented than the lives of those who contest his crown and lastly next william riphaeus the trojan what erring mortal cried the bird would believe it possible to find riphæus the trojan among the blestbut so it is and he now knows more respecting the divine grace than mortals do though even he discerns it not to the depth28  the bird again relapsing into silence appeared to repose on the happiness of its thoughts like the lark which after quivering and expatiating through all its airy warble becomes mute and content having satisfied its soul to the last drop of its sweetness29  but again dante could not help speaking being astonished to find pagans in heaven and once more the celestial figure indulged his curiosity it told him that trajan had been delivered from hell for his love of justice by the prayers of st gregory and that riphaeus for the same reason had been gifted with a prophetic knowledge of the redemption and then it ended with a rapture on the hidden mysteries of predestination and on the joy of ignorance itself when submitting to the divine will the two blessed spirits meanwhile whom the bird mentioned like the fingers of sweet lutenist to sweet singer when they quiver to his warble as it goes manifested the delight they experienced by movements of accord simultaneous as the twinkling of two eyes30  dante turned to receive his own final delight from the eyes of beatrice and he found it though the customary smile on her face was no longer there she told him that her beauty increased with such intensity at every fresh ascent among the stars that he would no longer have been able to bear the smile and they were now in the seventh heaven or the planet saturn the retreat of those who had passed their lives in holy contemplation  in this crystal sphere called after the name of the monarch who reigned over the age of innocence dante looked up and beheld a ladder the hue of which was like gold when the sun glisters it and the height so great that its top was out of sight and down the steps of this ladder he saw coming such multitudes of shining spirits that it seemed as if all the lights of heaven must have been there poured forth but not a sound was in the whole splendour it was spared to the poet for the same reason that he missed the smile of beatrice when they came to a certain step in the ladder some of the spirits flew off it in circles or other careers like rooks when they issue from their trees in the morning to dry their feathers in the sun part of them going away without returning others returning to the point they left and others contenting themselves with flying round about it one of them came so near dante and beatrice and brightened with such ardour that the poet saw it was done in affection towards them and begged the loving spirit to tell them who it was  between the two coasts of italy said the spirit and not far from thine own country the stony mountains ascend into a ridge so lofty that the thunder rolls beneath it catria is its name beneath it is a consecrated cell and in that cell i was called pietro damiano31 i so devoted myself to the service of god that with no other sustenance than the juice of the olive i forgot both heat and cold happy in heavenly meditation that cloister made abundant returns in its season to these granaries of the lord but so idle has it become now that it is fit the world should know its barrenness the days of my mortal life were drawing to a close when i was besought and drawn into wearing the hat which descends every day from bad head to worse32 st peter and st paul came lean and barefoot getting their bread where they could but pastors nowadays must be lifted from the ground and have ushers going before them and trainbearers behind them and ride upon palfreys covered with their spreading mantles so that two beasts go under one skin33 o lord how long  at these words dante saw more splendours come pouring down the ladder and wheel round and round and become at every wheel more beautiful the whole dazzling body then gathered round the indignant speaker and shouted something in a voice so tremendous that the poet could liken it to nothing on earth the thunder was so overwhelming that he did not even hear what they said34  pallid and stunned he turned in affright to beatrice who comforted him as a mother comforts a child that wants breath to speak the shout was prophetic of the vengeance about to overtake the church beatrice then directed hisattention to a multitude of small orbs which increased one anothers beauty by interchanging their splendours they enclosed the spirits of those who most combined meditation with love one of them was saint benedict and others macarius and romoaldo35 the light of st benedict issued forth from among its companions to address the poet and after explaining how its occupant was unable farther to disclose himself inveighed against the degeneracy of the religious orders it then rejoined its fellows and the whole company clustering into one meteor swept aloft like a whirlwind beatrice beckoned the poet to ascend after them he did so gifted with the usual virtue by her eyes and found himself in the twin light of the gemini the constellation that presided over his birth he was now in the region of the fixed stars  thou art now said his guide so near the summit of thy prayers that it behoves thee to take a last look at things below thee and see how little they should account in thine eyes dante turned his eyes downwards through all the seven spheres and saw the earth so diminutive that he smiled at its miserable appearance wisest thought he is the man that esteems it least and truly worthy he that sets his thoughts on the world to come he now saw the moon without those spots in it which made him formerly attribute the variation to dense and rare he sustained the brightness of the face of the sun and discerned all the signs and motions and relative distances of the planets finally he saw as he rolled round with the sphere in which he stood and by virtue of his gifted sight the petty arena from hill to harbour which filled his countrymen with such ferocious ambition and then he turned his eyes to the sweet eyes beside him36  beatrice stood wrapt in attention looking earnestly towards the south as if she expected some appearance she resembled the bird that sits among the dewy leaves in the darkness of night yearning for the coming of the morning that she may again behold her young and have light by which to seek the food that renders her fatigue for them a joy so stood beatrice looking which caused dante to watch in the same direction with the feelings of one that is already possessed of some new delight by the assuredness of his expectation37  the quarter on which they were gazing soon became brighter and brighter and beatrice exclaimed behold the armies of the triumph of christ her face appeared all fire and her eyes so full of love that the poet could find no words to express them  as the moon when the depths of heaven are serene with her fulness looks abroad smiling among her eternal handmaids the stars that paint every gulf of the great hollow with beauty38 so brightest above myriads of splendours around it appeared a sun which gave radiance to them all even as our earthly sun gives light to the constellations  o beatrice exclaimed dante overpowered sweet and beloved guide  overwhelming said beatrice is the virtue with which nothing can compare what thou hast seen is the wisdom and the power by whom the path between heaven and earth has been laid open39  dantes soullike the fire which falls to earth out of the swollen thundercloud instead of rising according to the wont of firehad grown too great for his still mortal nature and he could afterwards find within him no memory of what it did  open thine eyes said beatrice and see me now indeed thou hast beheld things that empower thee to sustain my smiling  dante while doing as he was desired felt like one who has suddenly waked up from a dream and endeavours in vain to recollect it  never said he can that moment be erased from the book of the past if all the tongues were granted me that were fed with the richest milk of polyhymnia and her sisters they could not express one thousandth part of the beauty of that divine smile or of the thorough perfection which it made of the whole of her divine countenance  but beatrice said why dost thou so enamour thee of this face and lose the sight of the beautiful guide blossoming beneath the beams of christ behold the rose in which the word was made flesh40 behold the lilies by whose odour the way of life is tracked  dante looked and gave battle to the sight with his weak eyes41  as flowers on a cloudy day in a meadow are suddenly lit up by a gleam of sunshine he beheld multitudes of splendours effulgent with beaming rays that smote on them from above though he could not discern the source of the effulgence he had invoked the name of the virgin when he looked and the gracious fountain of the light had drawn itself higher up within the heaven to accommodate the radiance to his faculties he then beheld the virgin herself bodily presenther who is fairest now in heaven as she was on earth and while his eyes were being painted with her beauty42 there fell on a sudden a seraphic light from heaven which spinning into a circle as it came formed a diadem round her head still spinning and warbling as it spun the sweetest melody that ever drew the soul to it on earth would have seemed like the splitting of a thundercloud compared with the music that sung around the head of that jewel of paradise43  i am angelic love said the light and i spin for joy of the womb in which our hope abided and ever o lady of heaven must i thus attend thee as long as thou art pleased to attend thy son journeying in his lovingkindness from sphere to sphere  all the other splendours now resounded the name of mary the virgin began ascending to pursue the path of her son and dante unable to endure her beauty as it rose turned his eyes to the angelical callers on the name of mary who remained yearning after her with their hands outstretched as a babe yearns after the bosom withdrawn from his lips then rising after her themselves they halted ere they went out of sight and sung o queen of heaven so sweetly that the delight never quitted the air  a flame now approached and thrice encircled beatrice singing all the while so divinely that the poet could retain no idea expressive of its sweetness mortal imagination cannot unfold such wonder it was saint peter whom she had besought to come down from his higher sphere in order to catechise and discourse with her companion on the subject of faith  the catechising and the discourse ensued and were concluded by the apostles giving the poet the benediction and encircling his forehead thrice with his holy light so well says dante was he pleased with my answers44  if ever continued the florentine the sacred poem to which heaven and earth have set their hands and which for years past has wasted my flesh in the writing shall prevail against the cruelty that shut me out of the sweet fold in which i slept like a lamb wishing harm to none but the wolves that beset itwith another voice and in another guise than now will i return a poet and standing by the fount of my baptism assume the crown that belongs to me for i there first entered on the faith which gives souls to god and for that faith did peter thus encircle my forehead45  a flame enclosing saint james now succeeded to that of saint peter and after greeting his predecessor as doves greet one another murmuring and moving round proceeded to examine the mortal visitant on the subject of hope the examination was closed amidst resounding anthems of let their hope be in thee46 and a third apostolic flame ensued enclosing saint john who completed the catechism with the topic of charity dante acquitted himself with skill throughout the spheres resounded with songs of holy holy beatrice joining in the warble and the poet suddenly found adam beside him the parent of the human race knew by intuition what his descendant wished to learn of him and manifesting his assent before he spoke as an animal sometimes does by movements and quiverings of the flesh within its coat corresponding with its goodwill47 told him that his fall was not owing to the fruit which he tasted but to the violation of the injunction not to taste it that he remained in the limbo on hellborders upwards of five thousand years and that the language he spoke had become obsolete before the days of nimrod  the gentle fire of saint peter now began to assume an awful brightness such as the planet jupiter might assume if mars and it were birds and exchanged the colour of their plumage48 silence fell upon the celestial choristers and the apostle spoke thus  wonder not if thou seest me change colour thou wilt see while i speak all which is round about us colour in like manner he who usurps my place on earthmy place i sayay minewhich before god is now vacanthas converted the city in which my dust lies buried into a commonsewer of filth and blood so that the fiend who fell from hence rejoices himself down there  at these words of the apostle the whole face of heaven was covered with a blush red as dawn or sunset and beatrice changed colour like a maiden that shrinks in alarm from the report of blame in another the eclipse was like that which took place when the supreme died upon the cross  saint peter resumed with a voice not less awfully changed than his appearance  not for the purpose of being sold for money was the spouse of christ fed and nourished with my blood and with the blood of linusthe blood of cletus sextus did not bleed for it nor pius nor callixtus nor urban men for whose deaths all christendom wept they died that souls might be innocent and go to heaven never was it intention of ours that the sitters in the holy chair should divide one half of christendom against the other should turn my keys into ensigns of war against the faithful and stamp my very image upon mercenary and lying documents which make me here in heaven blush and turn cold to think of arm of god why sleepest thou men out of gascony and cahors are even now making ready to drink our blood o lofty beginning to what vile conclusion must thou come but the high providence which made scipio the sustainer of the roman sovereignty of the world will fail not its timely succour and thou my son that for weight of thy mortal clothing must again descend to earth see thou that thou openest thy mouth and hidest not from others what has not been hidden from thyself  as white and thick as the snows go streaming athwart the air when the sun is in capricorn so the angelical spirits that had been gathered in the air of saturn streamed away after the apostle as he turned with the other saints to depart and the eyes of dante followed them till they became viewless49  the divine eyes of beatrice recalled him to herself and at the same instant the two companions found themselves in the ninth heaven or primum mobile the last of the material heavens and the mover of those beneath it  footnote 49 in spite of the unheavenly nature of invective of something of a lurking conceit in the making an eclipse out of a blush and in the positive bathos and i fear almost indecent irrelevancy of the introduction of beatrice at all on such an occasion much more under the feeble aspect of one young lady blushing for anotherthis scene altogether is a very grand one and the violence itself of the holy invective awful  here he had a glimpse of the divine essence in likeness of a point of inconceivably sharp brightness enringed with the angelic hierarchies all earth and heaven and nature hung from it beatrice explained many mysteries to him connected with that sight and then vehemently denounced the false and foolish teachers that quit the authority of the bible for speculations of their own and degrade the preaching of the gospel with ribald jests and legends of saint anthony and his pig50  returning however to more celestial thoughts her face became so full of beauty that dante declares he must cease to endeavour to speak of it and that he doubts whether the sight can ever be thoroughly enjoyed by any save its maker51 her look carried him upward as before and he was now in the empyrean or region of pure lightof light made of intellect full of love love of truth full of joy joy transcendant above all sweetness  streams of living radiance came rushing and flashing round about him swathing him with light as the lightning sometimes enwraps and dashes against the blinded eyes but the light was love here and instead of injuring gave new power to the object it embraced  with this new infusion of strength into his organs of vision dante looked and saw a vast flood of it effulgent with flashing splendours and pouring down like a river between banks painted with the loveliest flowers fiery living sparkles arose from it on all sides and pitched themselves into the cups of the flowers where they remained awhile like rubies set in gold till inebriated with the odours they recast themselves into the bosom of the flood and ever as one returned another leaped forth beatrice bade him dip his eyes into the light that he might obtain power to see deeper into its nature for the river and the jewels that sprang out of it to and fro and the laughing flowers on the banks were themselves but shadows of the truth which they included not indeed in their essential selves but inasmuch as without further assistance the beholders eyes could not see them as they were dante rushed to the stream as eagerly as the lips of an infant to the breast when it has slept beyond its time and his eyelashes had no sooner touched it than the length of the river became a breadth and a circle and its real nature lay unveiled before him like a face when a mask is taken off it was the whole two combined courts of heaven the angelical and the human in circumference larger than would hold the sun and all blazing beneath a light which was reflected downwards in its turn upon the sphere of the primum mobile below it the mover of the universe and as a green cliff by the waters side seems to delight in seeing itself reflected from head to foot with all its verdure and its flowers so round about on all sides upon thousands of thrones the blessed spirits that once lived on earth sat beholding themselves in the light and yet even all these together formed but the lowest part of the spectacle which ascended above them tier upon tier in the manner of an immeasurable roseall dilating itself doubling still and doubling and all odorous with the praises of an eververnal sun into the base of it as into the yellow of the flower with a dumb glance that yet promised to speak beatrice drew forward her companion and said behold the innumerable assemblage of the white garments behold our city how large its circuit behold our seats which are nevertheless so full that few comers are wanted to fill them on that lofty one at which thou art looking surmounted with the crown and which shall be occupied before thou joinest this bridal feast shall be seated the soul of the great henry who would fain set italy right before she is prepared for it52 the blind waywardness of which ye are sick renders ye like the bantling who while he is dying of hunger kicks away his nurse and rome is governed by one that cannot walk in the same path with such a man whatever be the road53 but god will not long endure him he will be thrust down into the pit with simon magus and his feet when he arrives there will thrust down the man of alagna still lower54  in the form then of a white rose the blessed multitude of human souls lay manifest before the eyes of the poet and now he observed that the winged portion of the blest the angels who fly up with their wings nearer to him that fills them with love came to and fro upon the rose like bees now descending into its bosom now streaming back to the source of their affection their faces were all fire their wings golden their garments whiter than snow whenever they descended on the flower they went from fold to fold fanning their loins and communicating the peace and ardour which they gathered as they gave dante beheld allevery flight and action of the whole winged multitudewithout let or shadow for he stood in the region of light itself and light has no obstacle where it is deservedly vouchsafed  oh cries the poet if the barbarians that came from the north stood dumb with amazement to behold the magnificence of rome thinking they saw unearthly greatness in the lateran what must i have thought who had thus come from human to divine from time to eternity from the people of florence to beings just and sane  dante stood without a wish either to speak or to hear he felt like a pilgrim who has arrived within the place of his devotion and who looks round about him hoping some day to relate what he sees he gazed upwards and downwards and on every side round about and saw movements graceful with every truth of innocence and faces full of loving persuasion rich in their own smiles and in the light of the smiles of others  he turned to beatrice but she was gonegone as a messenger from herself told him to resume her seat in the blessed rose which the messenger accordingly pointed out she sat in the third circle from the top as far from dante as the bottom of the sea is from the region of thunder and yet he saw her as plainly as if she had been close at hand he addressed words to her of thanks for all she had done for him and a hope for her assistance after death and she looked down at him and smiled  the messenger was st bernard he bade the poet lift his eyes higher and dante beheld the virgin mary sitting above the rose in the centre of an intense redness of light like another dawn thousands of angels were hanging buoyant around her each having its own distinct splendour and adornment and all were singing and expressing heavenly mirth and she smiled on them with such loveliness that joy was in the eyes of all the blessed  at marys feet was sitting eve beautifulshe that opened the wound which mary closed and at the feet of eve was rachel with beatrice and at the feet of rachel was sarah and then judith then rebecca then ruth ancestress of him out of whose penitence came the song of the miserere55 and so other hebrew women down all the gradations of the flower dividing by the line which they made the christians who lived before christ from those who lived after a line which on the opposite side of the rose was answered by a similar one of founders of the church at the top of whom was john the baptist the rose also was divided horizontally by a step which projected beyond the others and underneath which known by the childishness of their looks and voices were the souls of such as were too young to have attained heaven by assistance of good works  st bernard then directed his companion to look again at the virgin and gather from her countenance the power of beholding the face of christ as god her aspect was flooded with gladness from the spirits around her while the angel who had descended to her on earth now hailed her above with ave maria singing till the whole host of heaven joined in the song st bernard then prayed to her for help to his companions eyesight beatrice with others of the blest was seen joining in the prayer their hands stretched upwards and the virgin after benignly looking on the petitioners gazed upwards herself shewing the way with her own eyes to the still greater vision dante then looked also and beheld what he had no words to speak or memory to endure  he awoke as from a dream retaining only a sense of sweetness that ever trickled to his heart  earnestly praying afterwards however that grace might be so far vouchsafed to a portion of his recollection as to enable him to convey to his fellowcreatures one smallest glimpse of the glory of what he saw his ardour was so emboldened by help of the very mystery at whose sight he must have perished had he faltered that his eyes unblasted attained to a perception of the sum of infinitude he beheld concentrated in one spotwritten in one volume of loveall which is diffused and can become the subject of thought and study throughout the universeall substance and accident and modeall so compounded that they become one light he thought he beheld at one and the same time the oneness of this knot and the universality of all which it implies because when it came to his recollection his heart dilated and in the course of one moment he felt ages of impatience to speak of it  but thoughts as well as words failed him and though ever afterwards he could no more cease to yearn towards it than he could take defect for completion or separate the idea of happiness from the wish to attain it still the utmost he could say of what he remembered would

compelled her to go in a secular garment to her nuptials before the spouse of christ came together with her new husband she knelt down before a crucifix and recommended her virginity to christ soon after her whole body was smitten with leprosy so as to strike grief and horror into the beholders and thus in a few days through the divine disposal she passed with a palm of virginity to the lord

saw him scratching the top of his head with the tip of his finger that he might not discompose the locks   footnote 17    chi ei si furo e onde venner quivi   più è tacer che ragionare onesto  some

seem to intimate some corroboration of this and is a curious specimen of republican pride and scorn this horror of ones neighbours is neither good christianity nor surely any very good omen of that

danteopere minori 12mo vol ii p xvii foscolos conjecture seems hardly borne out by the context but i think dante had boldness and selfestimation enough to have advanced any claim whatsoever had events

edition of dante ut sup vol iii p 845 we are informed that a gentleman of naples the cavaliere giuseppe de cesare was the first to notice not long since i presume the curious circumstance of dantes having terminated the three portions of his poem with the word stars he thinks that it was done as a happy augury of life and renown to the subject the literal intention however seems to have been to shew us how all his aspirations terminated    pulci   critical notice  of  pulcis life and genius  pulci who is the first genuine romantic poet in point of time after dante seems at first sight in the juxtaposition like farce after tragedy and indeed in many parts of his poem he is not only what he seems but follows his saturnine countryman with a peculiar propriety of contrast much of his liveliest banter being directed against the absurdities of dantes theology but hasty and most erroneous would be the conclusion that he was nothing but a banterar he was a true poet of the mixed order grave as well as gay had a reflecting mind a susceptible and most affectionate heart and perhaps was never more in earnest than when he gave vent to his dislike of bigotry in his most laughable sallies  luigi pulci son of jacopo pulci and brigida de bardi was of a noble family so ancient as to be supposed to have come from france into tuscany with his hero charlemagne he was born in florence on the 3d of december 1431 and was the youngest of three brothers all possessed of a poetical vein though it did not flow with equal felicity bernardo the eldest was the earliest translator of the eclogues of virgil and lucca wrote a romance called the ciriffo calvaneo and is commended for his heroic epistles little else is known of these brothers and not much more of luigi himself except that he married a lady of the name of lucrezia degli albizzi journeyed in lombardy and elsewhere was one of the most intimate friends of lorenzo de medici and his literary circle and apparently led a life the most delightful to a poet always meditating some composition and buried in his woods and gardens nothing is known of his latter days an unpublished work of little credit zilioli on the italian poets and an earlier printed book which according to tiraboschi is of not much greater scardeone de antiquitatibus orbis patavinæ say that he died miserably in padua and was refused christian burial on account of his impieties it is not improbable that during the eclipse of the fortunes of the medici family after the death of lorenzo pulci may have partaken of its troubles and there is certainly no knowing how badly his or their enemies may have treated him but miserable ends are a favourite allegation with theological opponents the calvinists affirm of their master the burner of servetus that he died like a saint but i have seen a biography in italian which attributed the most horrible deathbed not only to the atrocious genevese but to the genial luther calling them both the greatest villains sceleratissimi and adding that one of them i forget which was found dashed on the floor of his bedroom and torn limb from limb  pulci appears to have been slender in person with small eyes and a ruddy face i gather this from the caricature of him in the poetical paperwar carried on between him and his friend matteo franco a florentine canon which is understood to have been all in good humoursport to amuse their friendsa perilous speculation besides his share in these verses he is supposed to have had a hand in his brothers romance and was certainly the author of some devout poems and of a burlesque panegyric on a country damsel la beca in emulation of the charming poem la nencia the first of its kind written by that extraordinary person his illustrious friend lorenzo who in the midst of his cares and glories as the balancer of the power of italy was one of the liveliest of the native wits and wrote songs for the people to dance to in carnival time  the intercourse between lorenzo and pulci was of the most familiar kind pulci was sixteen years older but of a nature which makes no such differences felt between associates he had known lorenzo from the latters youth probably from his birthis spoken of in a tone of domestic intimacy by his wifeand is enumerated by him among his companions in a very special and characteristic manner in his poem on hawking la caccia col falcone when calling his fellowsportsmen about him and missing luigi one of them says that he has strolled into a neighbouring wood to put something which has struck his fancy into a sonnet  luigi pulci ov è che non si sente egli se n andò dianzi in quel boschetto che qualche fantasia ha per la mente vorr à fantasticar forse un sonetto  and wheres luigi pulci i saw him oh in the wood there gone depend upon it to vent some fancy in his brainsome whim that will not let him rest till its a sonnet  in a letter written to lorenzo when the future statesman then in his seventeenth year was making himself personally acquainted with the courts of italy pulci speaks of himself as struggling hard to keep down the poetic propensity in his friends absence if you were with me he says i should produce heaps of sonnets as big as the clubs they make of the cherryblossoms for mayday i am always muttering some verse or other betwixt my teeth but i say to myself my lorenzo is not herehe who is my only hope and refuge and so i suppress it such is the first and of a like nature are the latest accounts we possess of the sequestered though companionable poet he preferred one congenial listener who understood him to twenty critics that were puzzled with the vivacity of his impulses most of the learned men patronised by lorenzo probably quarrelled with him on account of it plaguing him in somewhat the same spirit though in more friendly guise as the della cruscans and others afterwards plagued tasso so he banters them in turn and takes refuge from their critical rules and commonplaces in the larger indulgence of his friend politian and the laughing wisdom of lorenzo  so che andar diritto mi bisogna ch io non ci mescolassi una bugia che questa non è storia da menzogna che come in esco un passo de la via  chi gracchia chi riprende e chi rampogna ognun poi mi riesce la pazzia  tanto ch eletto ho solitaria vita che la turba di questi è infinita  la mia accademia un

lorenzo for encouraging the greek language doubtless with the laughing approbation of the founder who was sometimes not a little troubled himself with the squabbles of his literati  our author probably had good reason to call his illustrious friend his refuge the morgante maggiore the work which has rendered the name of pulci renowned was an attempt to elevate the popular and homely narrative poetry chanted in the streets into the dignity of a production that should last the age was in a state of transition on all points the dogmatic authority of the schoolmen in matters of religion which prevailed in the time of dante had come to nought before the advance of knowledge in general and the indifference of the court of rome the council of trent as crescimbeni advised the critics had not then settled what christendom was to believe and men provided they complied with forms and admitted certain main articles were allowed to think and even in great measure talk as they pleased the lovers of the platonic philosophy took the opportunity of exalting some of its dreams to an influence which at one time was supposed to threaten christianity itself and which in fact had already succeeded in affecting christian theology to an extent which the scorners of paganism little suspect most of these hellenists pushed their admiration of greek literature to an excess they were opposed by the virgilian predilections of pulcis friend politian who had nevertheless universality enough to sympathise with the delight the other took in their native tuscan and its liveliest and most idiomatic effusions from all these circumstances in combination arose first pulcis determination to write a poem of a mixed order which should retain for him the ear of the many and at the same time give rise to a poetry of romance worthy of higher auditors second his banter of what he considered unessential and injurious dogmas of belief in favour of those principles of the religion of charity which inflict no contradiction on the heart and understanding third the trouble which seems to have been given him by critics sacred and profane in consequence of these originalities and lastly a doubt which has strangely existed with some as to whether he intended to write a serious or a comic poem or on any one point was in earnest at all one writer thinks he cannot have been in earnest because he opens every canto with some pious invocation another asserts that the piety itself is a banter a similar critic is of opinion that to mix levities with gravities proves the gravities to have been nought and the levities all in all a fourth allows him to have been serious in his description of the battle of roncesvalles but says he was laughing in all the rest of his poem while a fifth candidly gives up the question as one of those puzzles occasioned by the caprices of the human mind which it is impossible for reasonable people to solve even sismondi who was well acquainted with the age in which pulci wrote and who if not a profound is generally an acute and liberal critic confesses himself to be thus confounded pulci he says commences all his cantos by a sacred invocation and the interests of religion are constantly intermingled with the adventures of his story in a manner capricious and little instructive we know not how to reconcile this monkish spirit with the semipagan character of society under lorenzo di medici nor whether we ought to accuse pulci of gross bigotry or of profane derision 1 sismondi did not consider that the lively and impassioned people of the south take what may be called householdliberties with the objects of their worship greater than northerns can easily conceive that levity of manner therefore does not always imply the absence of the gravest belief that be this as it may the belief may be as grave on some points as light on others perhaps the more so for that reason and that although some poems like some people are altogether grave or the reverse there really is such a thing as tragicomedy both in the world itself and in the representations of it a jesting writer may be quite as much in earnest when he professes to be so as a pleasant companion who feels for his own or for other peoples misfortunes and who is perhaps obliged to affect or resort to his very pleasantry sometimes because he feels more acutely than the gravest the sources of tears and smiles lie close to ay and help to refine one another if dante had been capable of more levity he would have been guilty of less melancholy absurdities if rabelais had been able to weep as well as to laugh and to love as well as to be licentious he would have had faith and therefore support in something earnest and not have been obliged to place the consummation of all things in a winebottle peoples everyday experiences might explain to them the greatest apparent inconsistencies of pulcis muse if habit itself did not blind them to the illustration was nobody ever present in a wellordered family when a lively conversation having been interrupted by the announcement of dinner the company after listening with the greatest seriousness to a grace delivered with equal seriousness perhaps by a clergyman resumed it the instant afterwards in all its gaiety with the first spoonful of soup well the sacred invocations at the beginning of pulcis cantos were compliances of the like sort with a custom they were recited and listened to just as gravely at lorenzo di medicis table and yet neither compromised the reciters nor were at all associated with the enjoyment of the fare that ensued so with regard to the intermixture of grave and gay throughout the poem how many campaigning adventures have been written by gallant officers whose animal spirits saw food for gaiety in half the circumstances that occurred and who could crack a jest and a helmet perhaps with almost equal vivacity and yet be as serious as the gravest at a moments notice mourn heartily over the deaths of their friends and shudder with indignation and horror at the outrages committed in a captured city it is thus that pulci writes full no less of feeling than of whim and mirth and the whole honest round of humanity not only warrants his plan but in the twofold sense of the word embraces it  if any thing more were necessary to shew the gravity with which our author addressed himself to his subject it is the fact related by himself of its having been recommended to him by lorenzos mother lucrezia tornabuoni a good and earnest woman herself a poetess who wrote a number of sacred narratives and whose virtues he more than once records with the greatest respect and tenderness the morgante concludes with an address respecting this lady to the virgin and with a hope that her devout and sincere spirit may obtain peace for him in paradise these are the last words in the book is it credible that expressions of this kind and employed on such an occasion could have had no serious meaning or that lorenzo listened to such praises of his mother as to a jest  i have no doubt that making allowance for the age in which he lived pulci was an excellent christian his orthodoxy it is true was not the orthodoxy of the times of dante or st dominic nor yet of that of the council of trent his opinions respecting the mystery of the trinity appear to have been more like those of sir isaac newton than of archdeacon travis and assuredly he agreed with origen respecting eternal punishment rather than with calvin and mr toplady but a man may accord with newton and yet be thought not unworthy of the starry spheres he may think with origen that god intends all his creatures to be ultimately happy2 and yet be considered as loving a follower of christ as a dealer of damnation round the land or the burner of a fellowcreature  pulci was in advance of his time on more subjects than one he pronounced the existence of a new and inhabited world before the appearance of columbus3 he made the conclusion doubtless as columbus did from the speculations of more scientific men and the rumours of seamen but how rare are the minds that are foremost to throw aside even the most innocent prejudices and anticipate the enlargements of the public mind how many also are calumniated and persecuted for so doing whose memories for the same identical reason are loved perhaps adored by the descendants of the calumniators in a public library in pulcis native place is preserved a little withered relic to which the attention of the visitor is drawn with reverential complacency it stands pointing upwards under a glasscase looking like a mysterious bit of parchment and is the finger of galileoof that galileo whose hand possessing that finger is supposed to have been tortured by the inquisition for writing what every one now believes he was certainly persecuted and imprisoned by the inquisition milton saw and visited him under the restraint of that scientific body in his own house yet galileo did more by his disclosures of the stars towards elevating our ideas of the creator than all the socalled saints and polemics that screamed at one another in the pulpits of east and west  like the commedia of dante pulcis commedia for such also in regard to its general cheerfulness4 and probably to its mediocrity of style he calls it is a representative in great measure of the feeling and knowledge of his time and though not entirely such in a learned and eclectic sense and not to be compared to that sublime monstrosity in point of genius and power is as superior to it in liberal opinion and in a certain pervading lovingness as the authors affectionate disposition and his countrys advance in civilisation combined to render it the editor of the parnaso italiano had reason to notice this engaging personal character in our authors work he says speaking of the principal romantic poets of italy that the reader will admire tasso will adore ariosto but will love pulci5 and all minds in which lovingness produces love will agree with him  the morgante maggiore is a history of the fabulous exploits and death of orlando the great hero of italian romance and of the wars and calamities brought on his fellow paladins and their sovereign charlemagne by the envy ambition and treachery of the misguided monarchs favourite gail of magauza mayence count of poictiers it is founded on the pseudohistory of archbishop turpin which though it received the formal sanction of the church is a manifest forgery and became such a jest with the wits that they took a delight in palming upon it their most incredible fictions the title morgante the great seems to have been either a whim to draw attention to an old subject or the result of an intention to do more with the giant so called than took place for though he is a conspicuous actor in the earlier part of the poem he dies when it is not much more than half completed orlando the champion of the faith is the real hero of it and gan the antihero or vice charlemagne the reader hardly need be told is represented for the most part as a very different person from what he appears in history in truth as ellis and panizzi have shewn he is either an exaggeration still misrepresented of charles martel the armorican chieftain who conquered the saracens at poictiers or a concretion of all the charleses of the carlovingian race wise and simple potent and weak6  the story may be thus briefly told orlando quits the court of charlemagne in disgust but is always ready to return to it when the emperor needs his help the best paladins follow to seek him he meets with and converts the giant morgante whose aid he receives in many adventures among which is the taking of babylon the other paladins his cousin rinaldo especially have their separate adventures all more or less mixed up with the treacheries and thanklessness of gan for they assist even him and the provoking trust reposed in him by charlemagne and at length the villain crowns his infamy by luring orlando with most of the paladins into the pass of roncesvalles where the hero himself and almost all his companions are slain by the armies of gans fellowtraitor marsilius king of spain they die however victorious and the two royal and noble scoundrels by a piece of prosaical justice better than poetical are despatched like common malefactors with a halter  there is perhaps no pure invention in the whole of this enlargement of old ballads and chronicles except the characters of another giant and of a rebel angel for even morgantes history though told in a very different manner has its prototype in the fictions of the pretended archbishop7 the paladins are well distinguished from one another orlando as foremost alike in prowess and magnanimity rinaldo by his vehemence ricciardetto by his amours astolfo by an ostentatious rashness and selfcommittal but in all these respects they appear to have been made to the authors hand neither does the poem exhibit any prevailing force of imagery or of expression apart from popular idiomatic phraseology still less though it has plenty of infernal magic does it present us with any magical enchantments of the alluring order as in ariosto or with lovestories as good as boiardos or even with any of the luxuries of landscape and description that are to be found in both of those poets albeit in the fourteenth canto there is a long catalogue raisonné of the whole animal creation which a lady has worked for rinaldo on a pavilion of silk and gold  to these negative faults must be added the positive ones of too many trifling unconnected and uninteresting incidents at least to readers who cannot taste the flavour of the racy tuscan idiom great occasional prolixity even in the best as well as worst passages not excepting orlandos dying speeches harshness in spite of his fluency according to foscolo and even bad grammar too many low or overfamiliar forms of speech so the graver critics allege though perhaps from want of animal spirits or a more comprehensive discernment and lastly to say nothing of the question as to the gravity or levity of the theology the strange exhibition of whole successive stanzas containing as many questions or affirmations as lines and commencing each line with the same words they meet the eye like palisadoes or a file of soldiers and turn truth and pathos itself into a jest they were most likely imitated from the popular ballads the following is the order of words in which a young lady thinks fit to complain of a desert into which she has been carried away by a giant after seven initiatory os addressed to her friends and to life in general she changes the key into e  e questa la mia patria dov io nacqui e questo il mio palagio e l mio castello e questo il nido ov alcun tempo giacqui e questo il padre e l mio dolce fratello e questo il popol dov io tanto piacqui e questo il regno giusto antico e bello e questo il porto de la mia salute e questo il premio d ogni mia virtute  ove son or le mie purpuree veste ove son or le gemme e le ricchezze ove son or già le notturne feste ove son or le mie delicatezze ove son or le mie compagne oneste ove son or le fuggite dolcezze ove son or le damigelle mie ove son dice omè non son già quie8  is this the country then where i was born is this my palace and my castle this is this the nest i woke in every morn is this my fathers and my brothers kiss is this the land they bred me to adorn is this the good old bower of all my bliss is this the haven of my youth and beauty is this the sure reward of all my duty  where now are all my wardrobes and their treasures where now are all my riches and my rights where now are all the midnight feasts and measures where now are all the delicate delights where now are all the partners of my pleasures where now are all the sweets of sounds and sights where now

answerthe counterpoint of the former close  ove son l aspre selve e i lupi adesso e gli orsi e i draghi e i tigri son qui presso  where now are all the woods and forests drear wolves tigers bears and dragons alas here  these are all very natural thoughts and such no doubt as would actually pass through the mind of the young lady in the candour of desolation but the mechanical iteration of her mode of putting them renders them irresistibly ludicrous it reminds us of the wager laid by the poor queen in the play of richard the second when she overhears the discourse of the gardener  my wretchedness unto a roar of pins theyll talk of state  did pulci expect his friend lorenzo to keep a grave face during the recital of these passages or did he flatter himself that the comprehensive mind of his hearer could at one and the same time be amused with the banter of some old song and the pathos of the new one9  the want both of good loveepisodes and of descriptions of external nature in the morgante is remarkable for pulcis tenderness of heart is constantly manifest and he describes himself as being almost absorbed in his woods that he understood love well in all its force and delicacy is apparent from a passage connected with this pavilion the fair embroiderer in presenting it to her idol rinaldo undervalues it as a gift which his great heart nevertheless will not disdain to accept adding with the true lavishment of the passion that she wishes she could give him the sun and that if she were to say after all that it was her own hands which had worked the pavilion she should be wrong for love himself did it rinaldo wishes to thank her but is so struck with her magnificence and affection that the words die on his lips the way also in which another of these loving admirers of paladins conceives her affection for one of them and persuades a vehemently hostile suitor quietly to withdraw his claims by presenting him with a ring and a graceful speech is in a taste as high as any thing in boiardo and superior to the more animal passion of the love in their great successor10 yet the tenderness of pulci rather shews itself in the friendship of the paladins for one another and in perpetual little escapes of generous and affectionate impulse this is one of the great charms of the morgante the first adventure in the book is orlandos encounter with three giants in behalf of a good abbot in whom he discovers a kinsman and this goodness and relationship combined move the achilles of christendom to tears morgante one of these giants who is converted becomes a sort of squire to his conqueror and takes such a liking to him that seeing him one day deliver himself not without peril out of the clutches of a devil he longs to go and set free the whole of the other world from devils indeed there is no end to his affection for him rinaldo and other paladins meantime cannot rest till they have set out in search of orlando they never meet or part with him without manifesting a tenderness proportionate to their valourthe old homeric candour of emotion the devil ashtaroth himself who is a great and proud devil assures rinaldo for whom he has conceived a regard that there is good feeling gentilezza even in hell and rinaldo not to hurt the feeling answers that he has no doubt of it or of the capability of friendship in that quarter and he says he is as sorry to part with him as with a brother the passage will be found in our abstract there are no such devils as these in dante though milton has something like them    devil with devil damnd   firm concord holds men only disagree  it is supposed that the character of ashtaroth which is a very new and extraordinary one and does great honour to the daring goodness of pulcis imagination was not lost upon milton who was not only acquainted with the poem but expressly intimates the pleasure he took in it11 rinaldo advises this devil as burns did lucifer to take a thought and mend ashtaroth who had been a seraph takes no notice of the advice except with a waving of the recollection of happier times he bids the hero farewell and says he has only to summon him in order to receive his aid this retention of a sense of his former angelical dignity has been noticed by foscolo and panizzi the two best writers on these italian poems12 a calvinist would call the expression of the sympathy hardened a humanist knows it to be the result of a spirit exquisitely softened an unbounded tenderness is the secret of all that is beautiful in the serious portion of our authors genius orlandos goodnatured giant weeps even for the death of the scoundrel margutte and the awful hero himself at whose death nature is convulsed and the heavens open begs his dying horse to forgive him if ever he has wronged it  a charm of another sort in pulci and yet in most instances perhaps owing the best part of its charmingness to its being connected with the same feeling is his wit foscolo it is true says it is in general more severe than refined and it is perilous to differ with such a critic on such a point for much of it unfortunately is lost to a foreign reader in consequence of its dependance on the piquant old tuscan idiom and on popular sayings and allusions yet i should think it impossible for pulci in general to be severe at the expense of some more agreeable quality and i am sure that the portion of his wit most obvious to a foreigner may claim if not to have originated at least to have been very like the style of one who was among its declared admirersand who was a very polished writervoltaire it consists in treating an absurdity with an air as if it were none or as if it had been a pure matter of course erroneously mistaken for an absurdity thus the good abbot whose monastery is blockaded by the giants for the virtue and simplicity of his character must be borne in mind after observing that the ancient fathers in the desert had not only locusts to eat but manna which he has no doubt was rained down on purpose from heaven laments that the relishes provided for himself and his brethren should have consisted of showers of stones the stones while the abbot is speaking come thundering down and he exclaims for gods sake knight come in for the manna is falling this is exactly in the style of the dictionnaire philosophique so when margutte is asked what he believes in and says he believes in neither black nor blue but in a good capon whether roast or boiled the reader is forcibly reminded of voltaires traveller scarmentado who when he is desired by the tartars to declare which of their two parties he is for the party of the blackmutton or the whitemutton answers that the dish is equally indifferent to him provided it is tender voltaire however does injustice to pulci when he pretends that in matters of belief he is like himselfa mere scoffer the friend of lucrezia tornabuoni has evidently the tenderest veneration for all that is good and lovely in the catholic faith and whatever liberties he might have allowed himself in professed extravaganzas when an age without churchauthority encouraged them and a reverend canon could take part in those it must be acknowledged unseemly high jinks he never in the morgante when speaking in his own person and not in that of the worst characters intimates disrespect towards any opinion which he did not hold to be irrelevant to a right faith it is observable that his freest expressions are put in the mouth of the giant margutte the lowest of these characters who is an invention of the authors and a most extraordinary personage he is the first unmitigated blackguard in fiction and is the greatest as well as first pulci is conjectured with great probability to have designed him as a caricature of some real person for margutte is a greek who in point of morals has been horribly brought up and some of the greek refugees in italy were greatly disliked for the cynicism of their manners and the grossness of their lives margutte is a glutton a drunkard a liar a thief and a blasphemer he boasts of having every vice and no virtue except fidelity which is meant to reconcile morgante to his company but though the latter endures and even likes it for his amusement he gives him to understand that he looks on his fidelity as only securable by the bastinado and makes him the subject of his practical jokes the respectable giant morgante dies of the bite of a crab as if to spew on what trivial chances depends the life of the strongest margutte laughs himself to death at sight of a monkey putting his boots on and off as though the goodnatured poet meant at once to express his contempt of a merely and grossly antiserious mode of existence and his consideration nevertheless towards the poor selfish wretch who had had no better training  to this wit and this pathos let the reader add a style of singular ease and fluencyrhymes often the most unexpected but never at a lossa purity of tuscan acknowledged by every body and ranking him among the authorities of the languageand a modesty in speaking of his own pretensions equalled only by his enthusiastic extolments of genius in others and the reader has before him the lively and affecting hopeful charitable largehearted luigi pulci the precursor and in some respects exemplar of ariosto and in miltons opinion a poet worth reading for the good use that may be made of him it has been strangely supposed that his friend politian and ficino the platonist not merely helped him with their books as he takes a pride in telling us but wrote a good deal of the latter part of the morgante particularly the speculations in matters of opinion as if to say nothing of the difference of style a man of genius however lively did not go through the gravest reflections in the course of his life or could not enter into any theological or metaphysical question to which he chose to direct his attention animal spirits themselves are too often but a counterbalance to the most thoughtful melancholy and one fit of jaundice or hypochondria might have enabled the poet to see more visions of the unknown and the inscrutable in a single day than perhaps ever entered the imagination of the elegant latin scholar or even the disciple of plato   footnote 1 literature of the south of europe thomas roscoes translation vol ii p54 for the

twelve paladins had the emperor charlemagne in his court and the most wise and famous of them was orlando it is of him i am about to speak and of his friend morgante and of gan the traitor who beguiled him to his death in roncesvalles where he sounded his horn so mightily after the dolorous rout  it was easter and charles had all his court with him in paris making high feast and triumph there was orlando the first among them and ogier the dane and astolfo the englishman and ansuigi and there came angiolin of bayonne and uliviero and the gentle berlinghieri and there was also avolio and avino and otho of normandy and richard and the wise namo and the aged salamon and walter of monlione and baldwin who was the son of the wretched gan the good emperor was too happy and oftentimes fairly groaned for joy at seeing all his paladins together now morgante the only surviving brother had a palace made after giants fashion of earth and boughs and shingles in which he shut himself up at night orlando knocked and disturbed him from his sleep so that he came staring to the door like a madman for he had had a bewildering dream  who knocks there quoth he  you will know too soon answered orlando i am come to make you do penance for your sins like your brothers divine providence has sent me to avenge the wrongs of the monks upon the whole set of you doubt it not for passamonte and alabastro are already as cold as a couple of pilasters  noble knight said morgante do me no ill but if you are a christian tell me in courtesy who you are  i will satisfy you of my faith replied orlando i adore christ and if you please you may adore him also  i have had a strange vision replied morgante with a low voice was assailed by a dreadful serpent and called upon mahomet in vain then i called upon your god who was crucified and he succoured me and i was delivered from the serpent so i am disposed to become a christian  if you keep in this mind returned orlando you shall worship the true god and come with me and be my companion and i will love you with perfect love your idols are false and vain the true god is the god of the christians deny the unjust and villanous worship of your mahomet and be baptised in the name of my god who alone is worthy  i am content said morgante  then orlando embraced him and said i will lead you to the abbey  let us go quickly replied morgante for he was impatient to make his peace with the monks  orlando rejoiced saying my good brother and devout withal you must ask pardon of the abbot for god has enlightened you and accepted you and he would have you practise humility  yes said morgante thanks to you your god shall henceforth be my god tell me your name and afterwards dispose of me as you will and he told him that he was orlando  but fortune stands watching in secret to baffle our designs while charles was thus hugging himself with delight orlando governed every thing at court and this made gan burst with envy so that he began one day talking with charles after the following mannerare we always to have orlando for our master i have thought of speaking to you about it a thousand times orlando has a great deal too much presumption here are we counts dukes and kings at your service but not at his and we have resolved not to be governed any longer by one so much younger than ourselves you began in aspramont to give him to understand how valiant he was and that he did great things at that fountain whereas if it had not been for the good gerard i know very well where the victory would have been the truth is he has an eye upon the crown this charles is the worthy who has deserved so much all your generals are afflicted at it as for me i shall repass those mountains over which i came to you with seventytwo counts do you take him for a mars  orlando happened to hear these words as he sat apart and it displeased him with the lord of pontiers that he should speak so but much more that charles should believe him he would have killed gan if uliviero had not prevented him and taken his sword out of his hand nay he would have killed charlemagne but at last he went from paris by himself raging with scorn and grief he borrowed as he went of ermillina the wife of ogier the danes sword cortana and his horse rondel and proceeded on his way to brava his wife alda the fair hastened to embrace him but while she was saying welcome my orlando he was going to strike her with his sword for his head was bewildered and he took her for the traitor the fair alda marvelled greatly but orlando recollected himself and she took hold of the bridle and he leaped from his horse and told her all that had passed and rested himself with her for some days  he then took his leave being still carried away by his disdain and resolved to pass over into heathendom and as he rode he thought every step of the way of the traitor gan and so riding on wherever the road took him he reached the confines between the christian countries and the pagan and came upon an abbey situate in a dark place in a desert  now above the abbey was a great mountain inhabited by three fierce giants one of whom was named passamonte another alabastro and the third morgante and these giants used to disturb the abbey by throwing things down upon it from the mountain with slings so that the poor little monks could not go out to fetch wood or water orlando knocked but nobody would open till the abbot was spoken to at last the abbot came himself and opening the door bade him welcome the good man told him the reason of the delay and said that since the arrival of the giants they had been so perplexed that they did not know what to do our ancient fathers in the desert quoth he were rewarded according to their holiness it is not to be supposed that they lived only upon locusts doubtless it also rained manna upon them from heaven but here one is regaled with stones which the giants pour on us from the mountain these are our nice bits and relishes the fiercest of the three morgante plucks up pines and other great trees by the roots and casts them on us while they were talking thus in the cemetery there came a stone which seemed as if it would break rondels back  for gods sake cavalier said the abbot come in for the manna is falling  my dear abbot answered orlando this fellow methinks does not wish to let my horse feed he wants to cure him of being restive the stone seems as if it came from a good arm yes replied the holy father i did not deceive you i think some day or other they will cast the mountain itself on us  orlando quieted his horse and then sat down to a meal after which he said abbot i must go and return the present that has been made to my horse the abbot with great tenderness endeavoured to dissuade him but in vain upon which he crossed him on the forehead and said go then and the blessing of god be with you  orlando scaled the mountain and came where passamonte was who seeing him alone measured him with his eyes and asked him if he would stay with him for a page promising to make him comfortable stupid saracen said orlando i come to you according to the will of god to be your death and not your footboy you have displeased his servants here and are no longer to be endured dog that you are  the giant finding himself thus insulted ran in a fury to his weapons and returning to orlando slung at him a large stone which struck him on the head with such force as not only made his helmet ring again but felled him to the earth passamonte thought he was dead what could have brought that paltry fellow here said he as he turned away but christ never forsakes his followers while passamonte was going away orlando recovered and cried aloud how now giant do you fancy you have killed me turn back for unless you have wings your escape is out of the question dog of a renegade the giant greatly marvelling turned back and stooping to pick up a stone orlando who had cortana naked in his hand cleft his skull upon which cursing mahomet the monster tumbled dying and blaspheming to the ground blaspheming fell the sourhearted and cruel wretch but orlando in the mean while thanked the father and the word  the paladin went on seeking for alabastro the second giant who when he saw him endeavoured to pluck up a great piece of stony earth by the roots ho ho cried orlando you too are for throwing stones are you then alabastro took his sling and flung at him so large a fragment as forced orlando to defend himself for if it had struck him he would no more have needed a surgeon1 but collecting his strength he thrust his sword into the giants breast and the loggerhead fell dead  blessed jesus be thanked said the giant for i have always heard you called a perfect knight and as i said i will follow you all my life long  and so conversing they went together towards the abbey and by the way orlando talked with morgante of the dead giants and sought to comfort him saying they had done the monks a thousand injuries and our scripture says the good shall be rewarded and the evil punished and we must submit to the will of god the doctors of our church continued he are all agreed that if those who are glorified in heaven were to feel pity for their miserable kindred who lie in such horrible confusion in hell their beatitude would come to nothing and this you see would plainly be unjust on the part of god but such is the firmness of their faith that what appears good to him appears good to them do what he may they hold it to be done well and that it is impossible for him to err so that if their very fathers and mothers are suffering everlasting punishment it does not disturb them an atom this is the custom i assure you in the choirs above2  a word to the wise said morgante you shall see if i grieve for my brethren and whether or no i submit to the will of god and behave myself like an angel so dust to dust and now let us enjoy ourselves i will cut off their hands all four of them and take them to these holy monks that they may be sure they are dead and not fear to go out alone into the desert they will then be certain also that the lord has purified me and taken me out of darkness and assured to me the kingdom of heaven so saying the giant cut off the hands of his brethren and left their bodies to the beasts and birds  they went to the abbey where the abbot was expecting orlando in great anxiety but the monks not knowing what had happened ran to the abbot in great haste and alarm saying will you suffer this giant to come in and when the abbot saw the giant he changed countenance orlando perceiving him thus disturbed made haste and said abbot peace be with you the giant is a christian he believes in christ and has renounced his false prophet mahomet and morgante shewing the hands in proof of his faith the abbot thanked heaven with great contentment of mind  the abbot did much honour to morgante comparing him with st paul and they rested there many days one day wandering over the house they entered a room where the abbot kept a quantity of armour and morgante saw a bow which pleased him and he fastened it on now there was in the place a great scarcity of water and orlando said like his good brother morgante i wish you would fetch us some water command me as you please said he and placing a great tub on his shoulders he went towards a spring at which he had been accustomed to drink at the foot of the mountain having reached the spring he suddenly heard a great noise in the forest he took an arrow from the quiver placed it in the bow and raising his head saw a great herd of swine rushing towards the spring where he stood morgante shot one of them clean through the head and laid him sprawling another as if in revenge ran towards the giant without giving him time to use a second arrow so he lent him a cuff on the head which broke the bone and killed him also which stroke the rest seeing fled in haste through the valley morgante then placed the tub full of water upon one of his shoulders and the two porkers on the other and returned to the abbey which was at some distance without spilling a drop  the monks were delighted to see the fresh water but still more the pork for there is no animal to whom food comes amiss they let their breviaries therefore go to sleep a while and fell heartily to work so that the cats and dogs had reason to lament the polish of the bones  but why do we stay here doing nothing said orlando one day to morgante and he shook hands with the abbot and told him he must take his leave i must go said he and make up for lost time i ought to have gone long ago my good father but i cannot tell you what i feel within me at the content i have enjoyed here in your company i shall bear in mind and in heart with me for ever the abbot the abbey and this desert so great is the love they have raised in me in so short a time the great god who reigns above must thank you for me in his own abode bestow on us your benediction and do not forget us in your prayers  when the abbot heard the county orlando talk thus his heart melted within him for tenderness and he said knight if we have failed in any courtesy due to your prowess and great gentleness and indeed what we have done has been but little pray put it to the account of our ignorance and of the place which we inhabit we are but poor men of the cloister better able to regale you with masses and orisons and paternosters than with dinners and suppers you have so taken this heart of mine by the many noble qualities i have seen in you that i shall be with you still wherever you go and on the other hand you will always be present here with me this seems a contradiction but you are wise and will take my meaning discreetly you have saved the very life and spirit within us for so much perplexity had those giants cast about our place that the way to the lord among us was blocked up may he who sent you into these woods reward the justice and piety by which we are delivered from our trouble thanks be to him and to you we shall all be disconsolate at your departure we shall grieve that we cannot detain you among us for months and years but you do not wear these weeds you bear arms and armour and you may possibly merit as well in carrying those as in wearing this cap you read your bible and your virtue has been the means of shewing the giant the way to heaven go in peace then and prosper whoever you may be i do not seek your name but if ever i am asked who it was that came among us i shall say that it was an angel from god if there is any armour or other thing that you would have go into the room where it is and take it  if you have any armour that would suit my companion replied orlando that i will accept with pleasure  come and see said the abbot and they went to a room that was full of armour morgante looked all about but could find nothing large enough except a rusty breastplate which fitted him marvellously it had belonged to an enormous giant who was killed there of old by orlandos father milo of angrante there was a painting on the wall which told the whole story how the giant had laid cruel and long siege to the abbey and how he had been overthrown at last by the great milo orlando seeing this said within himself o god unto whom all things are known how came milo here who destroyed this giant and reading certain inscriptions which were there he could no longer keep a firm countenance but the tears ran down his cheeks  when the abbot saw orlando weep and his brow redden and the light of his eyes become childlike for sweetness he asked him the reason but finding him still dumb with emotion he said i do not know whether you are overpowered by admiration of what is painted in this chamber you must know that i am of high descent though not through lawful wedlock i believe i may say i am nephew or sisters son to no less a man than that rinaldo who was so great a paladin in the world though my own father was not of a lawful mother ansuigi was his name my own out in the world was chiaramonte and this milo was my fathers brother ah gentle baron for blessed jesus sake tell me what name is yours  orlando all glowing with affection and bathed in tears replied my dear abbot and cousin he before you is your orlando upon this they ran for tenderness into each others arms weeping on both sides with a sovereign affection too high to be expressed the abbot was so overjoyed that he seemed as if he would never have done embracing orlando by what fortune said the knight do i find you in this obscure place tell me my dear abbot how was it you became a monk and did not follow arms like myself and the rest of us  it is the will of god replied the abbot hastening to give his feelings utterance many and divers are the paths he points out for us by which to arrive at his city some walk it with the swordsome with pastoral staff nature makes the inclination different and therefore there are different ways for us to take enough if we all arrive safely at one and the same place the last as well as the first we are all pilgrims through many kingdoms we all wish to go to rome orlando but we go picking out our journey through different roads such is the trouble in body and soul brought upon us by that sin of the old apple day and night am i here with my book in handday and night do you ride about holding your sword and sweating oft both in sun and shadow and all to get round at last to the home from which we departedi say all out of anxiety and hope to get back to our home of old and the giant hearing them talk of these things shed tears also  the paladin and the giant quitted the abbey the one on horseback and the other on foot and journeyed through the desert till they came to a magnificent castle the door of which stood open they entered and found rooms furnished in the most splendid mannerbeds covered with cloth of gold and floors rejoicing in variegated marbles there was even a feast prepared in the saloon but nobody to eat it or to speak to them  orlando suspected some trap and did not quite like it but morgante thought nothing worth considering but the feast who cares for the host said he when theres such a dinner let us eat as much as we can and bear off the rest i always do that when i have the picking of castles  they accordingly sat down and being very hungry with their days journey devoured heaps of the good things before them eating with all the vigour of health and drinking to a pitch of weakness3 they sat late in this manner enjoying themselves and then retired for the night into rich beds  but what was their astonishment in the morning at finding that they could not get out of the place there was no door all the entrances had vanished even to any feasible window  we must be dreaming said orlando  my dinner was no dream ill swear said the giant as for the rest let it be a dream if it pleases  continuing to search up and down they at length found a vault with a tomb in it and out of the tomb came a voice saying you must encounter with me or stay here for ever lift therefore the stone that covers me  do you hear that said morgante ill have him out if its the devil himself perhaps its two devils filthydog and foulmouth or itching and eviltail4  have him out said orlando whoever he is even were it as many devils as were rained out of heaven into the centre  morgante lifted up the stone and out leaped surely enough a devil in the likeness of a driedup dead body black as a coal orlando seized him and the devil grappled with orlando morgante was for joining him but the paladin bade him keep back it was a hard struggle and the devil grinned and laughed till the giant who was a master of wrestling could bear it no longer so he doubled him up and in spite of all his efforts thrust him back into the tomb  youll never get out said the devil if you leave me shut up  why not inquired the paladin  because your giants baptism and my deliverance must go together answered the devil if he is not baptised you can have no deliverance and if i am not delivered i can prevent it still take my word for it  orlando baptised the giant the two companions then issued forth and hearing a mighty noise in the house looked back and saw it all vanished  i could find it in my heart said morgante to go down to those same regions below and make all the devils disappear in like manner why shouldnt we do it wed set free all the poor souls there egad id cut off minoss tailid pull out charons beard by the rootsmake a sop of phlegyas and a sup of phlegethonunseat plutokill cerberus and the furies with a punch of the face apieceand set beelzebub scampering like a dromedary  you might find more trouble than you wot of quoth orlando and get worsted besides better keep the straight path than thrust your head into outoftheway places  morgante took his lords advice and went straightforward with him through many great adventures helping him with loving goodwill as often as he was permitted sometimes as his pioneer and sometimes as his finisher of troublesome work such as a slaughter of some thousands of infidels now he chucked a spy into a rivernow felled a rude ambassador to the earth for he didnt stand upon ceremonynow cleared a space round him in battle with the clapper of an old bell which he had found at the monasterynow doubled up a king in his tent and bore him away tent and all and a paladin with him because he would not let the paladin go  in the course of these services the giant was left to take care of a lady and lost his master for a time but the office being at an end he set out to rejoin him and arriving at a crossroad met with a very extraordinary personage  this was a giant huger than himself swarthyfaced horrible brutish he came out of a wood and appeared to be journeying somewhere morgante who had the great bellclapper in his hand abovementioned struck it on the ground with astonishment as much as to say who the devil is this and then set himself on a stone by the wayside to observe the creature  whats your name traveller said morgante as it came up  my names margutte said the phenomenon i intended to be a giant myself but altered my mind you see and stopped halfway so that i am only twenty feet or so  im glad to see you quoth his brothergiant but tell me are you christian or saracen do you believe in christ or in apollo  to tell you the truth said the other i believe neither in black nor blue but in a good capon whether it be roast or boiled i believe sometimes also in butter and when i can get it in new wine particularly the rough sort but above all i believe in wine thats good and old mahomets prohibition of it is all moonshine i am the son you must know of a greek nun and a turkish bishop and the first thing i learned was to play the fiddle i used to sing homer to it i was then concerned in a brawl in a mosque in which the old bishop somehow happened to be killed so i tied a sword to my side and went to seek my fortune accompanied by all the possible sins of turk and greek people talk of the seven deadly sins but i have seventyseven that never quit me summer or winter by which you may judge of the amount of my venial ones i am a gambler a cheat a ruffian a highwayman a pickpocket a glutton at beef or blows have no shame whatever love to let every body know what i can do lie besides about what i cant do have a particular attachment to sacrilege swallow perjuries like figs never give a farthing to any body but beg of every body and abuse them into the bargain look upon not spilling a drop of liquor as the chief of all the cardinal virtues but must own i am not much given to assassination murder being inconvenient and one thing i am bound to acknowledge which is that i never betrayed a messmate  thats as well observed morgante because you see as you dont believe in any thing else id have you believe in this bellclapper of mine so now as you have been candid with me and i am well instructed in your ways well pursue our journey together  the best of giants in those days were not scrupulous in their modes of living so that one of the best and one of the worst got on pretty well together emptying the larders on the road and paying nothing but douses on the chops when they could find no inn they hunted elephants and crocodiles morgante who was the braver of the two delighted to banter and sometimes to cheat margutte and he ate up all the fare which made the other notwithstanding the credit he gave himself for readiness of wit and tongue cut a very sorry figure and seriously remonstrate i reverence you said margutte in other matters but in eating you really dont behave well he who deprives me of my share at meals is no friend at every mouthful of which he robs me i seem to lose an eye im for sharing every thing to a nicety even if it be no better than a fig  you are a fine fellow said morgante you gain upon me very much you are the master of those who know6  so saying he made him put some wood on the fire and perform a hundred other offices to render every thing snug and then he slept and next day he cheated his great scoundrelly companion at drink as he had done the day before at meat and the poor shabby devil complained and morgante laughed till he was ready to burst and again and again always cheated him  there was a levity nevertheless in margutte which restored his spirits on the slightest glimpse of good fortune and if he realised a hearty meal he became the happiest beastliest and most confident of giants the companions in the course of their journey delivered a damsel from the clutches of three other giants she was the daughter of a great lord and when she got home she did honour to morgante as to an equal and put margutte into the kitchen where he was in a state of bliss he did nothing but swill stuff surfeit be sick play at dice cheat filch go to sleep guzzle again laugh chatter and tell a thousand lies  morgante took leave of the young lady who made him rich presents margutte seeing this and being always drunk and impudent daubed his face like a christmas clown and making up to her with a fryingpan in his hand demanded something for the cook the fair hostess gave him a jewel and the vagabond skewed such a brutal eagerness in seizing it with his filthy hands and making not the least acknowledgment that when they got out of the house morgante was ready to fell him to the earth he called him scoundrel and poltroon and said he had disgraced him for ever  softly said the brutebeast didnt you take me with you knowing what sort of fellow i was didnt i tell you i had every sin and shame under heaven and have i deceived you by the exhibition of a single virtue  morgante could not help laughing at a candour of this excessive nature so they went on their way till they came to a wood where they rested themselves by a fountain and margutte fell fast asleep he had a pair of boots on which morgante felt tempted to draw off that he might see what he would do on waking he accordingly did so and threw them to a little distance among the bushes the sleeper awoke in good time and looking and searching round about suddenly burst into roars of laughter a monkey had got the boots and sat pulling them on and off making the most ridiculous gestures the monkey busied himself and the lightminded drunkard laughed and at every fresh gesticulation of the new bootwearer the laugh grew louder and more tremendous till at length it was found impossible to be restrained the glutton had a laughingfit in vain he tried to stop himself in vain his fingers would have loosened the buttons of his doublet to give his lungs room to play they couldnt do it so he laughed and roared till he burst the snap was like the splitting of a cannon morgante ran up to him but it was of no use he was dead  alas it was not the only death it was not even the most trivial cause of a death giants are big fellows but deaths a bigger though he may come in a little shape morgante had succeeded in joining his master he helped him to take babylon he killed a whale for him at sea that obstructed his passage he played the part of a mainsail during a storm holding out his arms and a great hide but on coming to shore a crab bit him in the heel and behold the lot of the great gianthe died he laughed and thought it a very little thing but it proved a mighty one  he made the east tremble said orlando and the bite of a crab has slain him  o life of ours weak and a fallacy7  orlando embalmed his huge friend and had him taken to babylon and honourably interred and after many an adventure in which he regretted him his own days were closed by a far baser though not so petty a cause  how shall i speak of it exclaims the poet how think of the horrible slaughter about to fall on the christians and their greatest men so that not a dry eye shall be left in france how express my disgust at the traitor gan whose heart a thousand pardons from his sovereign and the most undeserved rescues of him by the warrior he betrayed could not shame or soften how mourn the weakness of charles always deceived by him and always trusting how dare to present to my mind the good the great the evergenerous orlando brought by the traitor into the doleful pass of roncesvalles and the hands of myriads of his enemies so that even his superhuman strength availed not to deliver him out of the slaughterhouse and he blew the blast with his dying breath which was the mightiest the farthest heard and the most melancholy sound that ever came to the ears of the undeceived  gan was known well to every body but his confiding sovereign the paladins knew him well and in their moments of indignant disgust often told him so though they spared him the consequences of his misdeeds and even incurred the most frightful perils to deliver him out of the hands of his enemies but he was brave he was in favour with the sovereign who was also their kinsman and they were loyal and loving men and knew that the wretch envied them for the greatness of their achievements and might do the state a mischief so they allowed themselves to take a kind of scornful pleasure in putting up with him their cousin malagigi the enchanter had himself assisted gan though he knew him best of all and had prophesied that the innumerable endeavours of his envy to destroy his king and country would bring some terrible evil at last to all chistendom the evil alas is at hand the doleful time has come it will be followed it is true by a worse fate of the wretch himself but not till the valleys of the pyrenees have run rivers of blood and all france is in mourning   footnote 1 a common pleasantry in the old romancesgalaor went in and then the halberders attacked him on one side and the knight on the other he snatched an

quanti   e porterolle a que monaci santi  this doctrine which is horrible blasphemy in the eyes of natural feeling is good reasoning in catholic and calvinistic theology they first make the deitys

at his feet meantime they think themselves qualified to denounce moloch and jugghanaut  footnote 3    e furno al here infermi al mangiar sani  i am not sure that i am right in my construction of this passage perhaps pulci means to say that they had the appetites of men in health and the thirst of a fever  footnote 5 cagnazzo farfarello libicocco and malacoda names of devils in dante  footnote 6 il maestro di color che sanno a jocose application of dantes praise of aristotle  footnote 7 o vita nostra debole e fallace    the  battle of roncesvalles  notice  this is the    sad and fearful story   of the roncesvalles fight  an event which national and religious exaggeration impressed deeply on the popular mind of europe hence italian romances and spanish ballads hence the famous passage in milton    when charlemain with all his peerage fell   by fontarabbia  hence dantes record of the dolorosa rotta dolorous rout in the inferno where he compares the voice of nimrod with the horn sounded by the dying orlando hence the peasant in cervantes who is met by don quixote singing the battle as he comes along the road in the morning and hence the song of roland actually thundered forth by the army of william the conqueror as they advanced against the english  but charlemagne did not fall as milton has stated nor does pulci make him do so in this respect if in little else the italian poet adhered to the fact the whole story is a remarkable instance of what can be done by poetry and popularity towards misrepresenting and aggrandising a petty though striking adventure the simple fact was the cutting off the rear of charlemagnes army by the revolted gascons as he returned from a successful expedition into spain two or three only of his nobles perished among whom was his nephew roland the obscure warden of his marches of brittany but charlemagne was the temporal head of christendom the poets constituted his nephew its champion and hence all the glories and superhuman exploits of the orlando of pulci and ariosto the whole assumption of the wickedness of the saracens particularly of the then saracen king of spain whom pulcis authority the pseudoarchbishop turpin strangely called marsilius was nothing but a pious fraud the pretended marsilius having been no less a person than the great and good abdoùlrahmaùn the first who wrested the dominion of that country out of the hands of the usurpers of his familyrights yet so potent and longlived are the most extravagant fictions when genius has put its heart into them that to this day we read of the devoted orlando and his friends not only with gravity but with the liveliest emotion    the  battle of roncesvalles  a miserable man am i cries the poet for orlando beyond a doubt died in roncesvalles and die therefore he must in my verses altogether impossible is it to save him i thought to make a pleasant ending of this my poem so that it should be happier somehow throughout than melancholy but though gan will die at last orlando must die before him and that makes a tragedy of all i had a doubt whether consistently with the truth i could give the reader even that sorry satisfaction for at the beginning of the dreadful battle orlandos cousin rinaldo who is said to have joined it before it was over and there as well as afterwards to have avenged his death was far away from the seat of slaughter in egypt and how was i to suppose that he could arrive soon enough in the valleys of the pyrenees but an angel upon earth shewed me the secret even angelo poliziano the glory of his age and country he informed me how arnauld the provençal poet had written of this very matter and brought the paladin from egypt to france by means of the wonderful skill in occult science possessed by his cousin malagigia wonder to the ignorant but not so marvellous to those who know that all the creation is full of wonders and who have different modes of relating the same events by and by a great many things will be done in the world of which we have no conception now and people will be inclined to believe them works of the devil when in fact they will be very good works and contribute to angelical effects whether the devil be forced to have a hand in them or not for evil itself can work only in subordination to good so listen when the astonishment comes and reflect and think the best meantime we must speak of another and more truly devilish astonishment and of the pangs of mortal flesh and blood  the traitor gan for the fiftieth time had secretly brought the infidels from all quarters against his friend and master the emperor charles and charles by the help of orlando had conquered them all the worst of them marsilius king of spain had agreed to pay the court of france tribute and gan in spite of all the suspicions he excited in this particular instance and his known villany at all times had succeeded in persuading his credulous sovereign to let him go ambassador into spain where he put a final seal to his enormities by plotting the destruction of his employer and the special overthrow of orlando charles was now old and whitehaired and gan was so too but the one was only confirmed in his credulity and the other in his crimes the traitor embraced orlando over and over again at taking leave praying him to write if he had any thing to say before the arrangements with marsilius and taking such pains to seem loving and sincere that his villany was manifest to every one but the old monarch he fastened with equal tenderness on uliviero who smiled contemptuously in his face and thought to himself you may make as many fair speeches as you choose but you lie all the other paladins who were present thought the same and they said as much to the emperor adding that on no account should gan be sent ambassador to marsilius but charles was infatuated his beard and his credulity had grown old together  gan was received with great honour in spain by marsilius the king attended by his lords came fifteen miles out of saragossa to meet him and then conducted him into the city amid tumults of delight there was nothing for several days but balls and games and exhibitions of chivalry the ladies throwing flowers on the heads of the french knights and the people shouting france france mountjoy and st denis  gan made a speech like a demosthenes to king marsilius in public but he made him another in private like nobody but himself the king and he were sitting in a garden they were traitors both and began to understand from one anothers looks that the real object of the ambassador was yet to be discussed marsilius accordingly assumed a more than usually cheerful and confidential aspect and taking his visitor by the hand said you know the proverb mr ambassadorat dawn the mountain afternoon the fountain different things at different hours so here is a fountain to accommodate us  it was a very beautiful fountain so clear that you saw your face in it as in a mirror and the spot was encircled with fruittrees that quivered with the fresh air gan praised it very much contriving to insinuate on one subject his satisfaction with the glimpses he got into another marsilius understood him and as he resumed the conversation and gradually encouraged a mutual disclosure of their thoughts gan without appearing to look him in the face was enabled to do so by contemplating the royal visage in the water where he saw its expression become more and more what he desired marsilius meantime saw the like symptoms in the face of gan by degrees he began to touch on that dissatisfaction with charlemagne and his court which he knew was in both their minds he lamented not as to the ambassador but as to the friend the injuries which he said he had received from charles in the repeated attacks on his dominions and the emperors wish to crown orlando king of them till at length he plainly uttered his belief that if that tremendous paladin were but dead good men would get their rights and his visitor and himself have all things at their disposal  gan heaved a sigh as if he was unwillingly compelled to allow the force of what the king said but unable to contain himself long he lifted up his face radiant with triumphant wickedness and exclaimed every word you utter is truth die he must and die also must uliviero who struck me that foul blow at court is it treachery to punish affronts like those i have planned every thingi have settled every thing already with their besotted master orlando could not be expected to be brought hither where he has been accustomed to look for a crown but he will come to the spanish bordersto roncesvallesfor the purpose of receiving the tribute charles will await him at no great distance in st john pied de port orlando will bring but a small band with him you when you meet him will have secretly your whole army at your back you surround him and who receives tribute then  the new judas had scarcely uttered these words when the delight of him and his associate was interrupted by a change in the face of nature the sky was suddenly overcast it thundered and lightened a laurel was split in two from head to foot the fountain ran into burning blood there was an earthquake and the carobtree under which gan was sitting and which was of the species on which judas iscariot hung himself dropped some of its fruit on his head the hair of the head rose in horror  marsilius as well as gan was appalled at this omen but on assembling his soothsayers they came to the conclusion that the laureltree turned the omen against the emperor the successor of the cæsars though one of them renewed the consternation of gan by saying that he did not understand the meaning of the tree of judas and intimating that perhaps the ambassador could explain it gan relieved his consternation with anger the habit of wickedness prevailed over all considerations and the king prepared to march for roncesvalles at the head of all his forces  gan wrote to charlemagne to say how humbly and properly marsilius was coming to pay the tribute into the hands of orlando and how handsome it would be of the emperor to meet him halfway as agreed upon at st john pied de port and so be ready to receive him after the payment at his footstool he added a brilliant account of the tribute and its accompanying presents they included a crown in the shape of a garland which had a carbuncle in it that gave light in darkness two lions of an immeasurable length and aspects that frightened every body some lively buffalos leopards crocodiles and giraffes arms and armour of all sorts and apes and monkeys seated among the rich merchandise that loaded the backs of the camels this imaginary treasure contained furthermore two enchanted spirits called floro and faresse who were confined in a mirror and were to tell the emperor wonderful things particularly floro for there is nothing so nice in its details as lying and orlando was to have heaps of caravans full of eastern wealth and a hundred white horses all with saddles and bridles of gold there was a beautiful vest too for uliviero all over jewels worth ten thousand seraffi or more  the good emperor wrote in turn to say how pleased he was with the ambassadors diligence and that matters were arranged precisely as he wished his court however had its suspicions still nobody could believe that gan had not some new mischief in contemplation little nevertheless did they imagine after the base endeavours he had but lately made against them that he had immediately plotted a new and greater one and that his object in bringing charles into the neighbourhood of roncesvalles was to deliver him more speedily into the hands of marsilius in the event of the latters destruction of orlando  orlando however did as his lord and sovereign desired he went to roncesvalles accompanied by a moderate train of warriors not dreaming of the atrocity that awaited him gan himself meantime had hastened on to france before marsilius in order to shew himself free and easy in the presence of charles and secure the success of his plot while marsilius to make assurance doubly sure brought into the passes of roncesvalles no less than three armies who were successively to fall on the paladin in case of the worst and so extinguish him with numbers he had also by gans advice brought heaps of wine and good cheer to be set before his victims in the first instance for that said the traitor will render the onset the more effective the feasters being unarmed and supposing prodigies of valour to await even the attack of your second army you will have no trouble with your third one thing however i must not forget added he my son baldwin is sure to be with orlando you must take care of his life for my sake i give him this vest off my own body said the king let him wear it in the battle and have no fear my soldiers shall be directed not to touch him  gan went away rejoicing to france he embraced the court and his sovereign all round with the air of a man who had brought them nothing but blessings and the old king wept for very tenderness and delight  something is going on wrong and looks very black thought malagigi the good wizard and rinaldo is not here and it is indispensably necessary that he should be i must find out where he is and ricciardetto too and send for them with all speed and at any price malagigi called up by his art a wise terrible and cruel spirit named ashtarothno light personage to deal withno little spirit such as plays tricks with you like a fairy a much blacker visitant was this  tell me and tell me truly of rinaldo said malagigi to the spirit  hard looked the demon at the paladin and said nothing his aspect was clouded and violent he wished to see whether his summoner retained all the force of his art  the enchanter with an aspect still cloudier bade ashtaroth lay down that look while giving this order he also made signs indicative of a disposition to resort to angrier compulsion and the devil apprehending that he would confine him in some hateful place loosened his tongue and said you have not told me what you desire to know of rinaldo  i desire to know what he has been doing and where he is returned the enchanter  he has been conquering and baptising the world east and west said the demon and is now in egypt with ricciardetto  and what has gan been plotting with marsilius inquired malagigi and what is to come of it  on neither of those points can i enlighten you said the devil i was not attending to gan at the time and we fallen spirits know not the future had we done so we had not been so willing to incur the danger of falling all i discern is that by the signs and comets in the heavens something dreadful is about to happensomething very strange treacherous and bloody and that gan has a seat ready prepared for him in hell  within three days cried the enchanter loudly fetch rinaldo and ricciardetto into the pass of roncesvalles do it and i hereby undertake never to summon thee more  suppose they will not trust themselves with me said the spirit  enter rinaldos horse and bring him whether he trust thee or not  it shall be done returned the demon and my servingdevil foulmouth or firered shall enter the horse of ricciardetto doubt it not am i not wise and thyself powerful  there was an earthquake and ashtaroth disappeared  marsilius has now made his first movement towards the destruction of orlando by sending before him his vassalking blanchardin with his presents of wines and other luxuries the temperate but courteous hero took them in good part and distributed them as the traitor wished and then blanchardin on pretence of going forward to salute charlemagne at st john pied de port returned and put himself at the head of the second army which was the post assigned him by his liege lord the device on his flag was an apollo on a field azure king falseron whose son orlando had slain in battle headed the first army the device of which was a black figure of the devil belphegor on a dapplegrey field the third army was under king balugante and had for ensign a mahomet with golden wings in a field of red marsilius made a speech to them at night in which he confessed his ill faith but defended it on the ground of charless hatred of their religion and of the example of judith and holofernes he said that he had not come there to pay tribute and sell his countrymen for slaves but to make all christendom pay tribute to them as conquerors and he concluded by recommending to their goodwill the son of his friend gan whom they would know by the vest he had sent him and who was the only soul among the christians they were to spare  this son of gan meantime and several of the paladins who were disgusted with charless credulity and anxious at all events to be with orlando had joined the hero in the fated valley so that the little christian host considering the tremendous valour of their lord and his friends and the comparative inefficiency of that of the infidels were at any rate not to be sold for nothing rinaldo alas the second thunderbolt of christendom was destined not to be there in time to save their lives he could only avenge the dreadful tragedy and prevent still worse consequences to the whole christian court and empire the paladins had in vain begged orlando to be on his guard against treachery and send for a more numerous body of men the great heart of the champion of the faith was unwilling to think the worst as long as he could help it he refused to summon aid that might be superfluous neither would he do any thing but what his liege lord had desired and yet he could not wholly repress a misgiving a shadow had fallen on his heart great and cheerful as it was the anticipations of his friends disturbed him in spite of the face with which he met them i am not sure that he did not by a certain instinctive foresight expect death itself but he felt bound not to encourage the impression besides time pressed the moment of the lookedfor tribute was at hand and little combinations of circumstances determine often the greatest events  king blanchardin had brought orlandos people a luxurious supper king marsilius was to arrive early next day with the tribute and uliviero accordingly with the morning sun rode forth to reconnoitre and see if he could discover the peaceful pomp of the spanish court in the distance guottibuoffi was with him a warrior who had expected the very worst and repeatedly implored orlando to believe it possible uliviero and he rode up the mountain nearest them and from the top of it beheld the first army of marsilius already forming in the passes  o guottibuoffi exclaimed he behold thy prophecies come true behold the last day of the glory of charles every where i see the arms of the traitors around us i feel paris tremble all the way through france to the ground beneath my feet o malagigi too much in the right wert thou o devil gan this then is the consummation of thy good offices  uliviero put spurs to his horse and galloped back down the mountain to orlando  well cried the hero what news  bad news said his cousin such as you would not hear of yesterday marsilius is here in arms and all the world has come with him  the paladins pressed round orlando and entreated him to sound his horn in token that he needed help his only answer was to mount his horse and ride up the mountain with sansonetto  as soon however as he cast forth his eyes and beheld what was round about him he turned in sorrow and looked down into roncesvalles and said o valley miserable indeed the blood that is shed in thee this day will colour thy name for ever  many of the paladins had ridden after him and they again pressed him to sound his horn if only in pity to his own people he said if cæsar and alexander were here scipio and hannibal and nebuchadnezzar with all his flags and death stared me in the face with his knife in his hand never would i sound my horn for the baseness of fear  orlandos little camp were furious against the saracens they armed themselves with the greatest impatience there was nothing but lacing of helmets and mounting of horses and good archbishop turpin went from rank to rank exhorting and encouraging the warriors of christ accoutrements and habiliments were put on the wrong way words and deeds mixed in confusion men running against one another out of very absorption in themselves all the place full of cries of arm arm the enemy and the trumpets clanged over all against the mountainechoes  orlando and his captains withdrew for a moment to consultation he fairly groaned for sorrow and at first had not a word to say so wretched he felt at having brought his people to die in roncesvalles  uliviero spoke first he could not resist the opportunity of comforting himself a little in his despair with referring to his unheeded advice  you see cousin said he what has come at last would to god you had attended to what i said to what malagigi said to what we all said i told you marsilius was nothing but an anointed scoundrel yet forsooth he was to bring us tribute and charles is this moment expecting his mummeries at st john pied de port did ever any body believe a word that gan said but charles and now you see this rotten fruit has come to a headthis medlar has got its crown  orlando said nothing in answer to uliviero for in truth he had nothing to say he broke away to give orders to the camp bade them take refreshment and then addressing both officers and men he said i confess that if it had entered my heart to conceive the king of spain to be such a villain never would you have seen this day he has exchanged with me a thousand courtesies and good words and i thought that the worse enemies we had been before the better friends we had become now i fancied every human being capable of this kind of virtue on a good opportunity saving indeed such basehearted wretches as can never forgive their very forgivers and of these i certainly did not suppose him to be one let us die if we must die like honest and gallant men so that it shall be said of us it was only our bodies that died it becomes our souls to be invincible and our glory immortal our motto must be a good heart and no hope the reason why i did not sound the horn was partly because i thought it did not become us and partly because our liege lord could be of little use even if he heard it let gan have his glut of us like a carrion crow but let him find us under heaps of his saracens an example for all time heaven my friends is with us if earth is against us methinks i see it open this moment ready to receive our souls amidst crowns of glory and therefore as the champion of gods church i give you my benediction and the good archbishop here will absolve you and so please god we shall all go to heaven and be happy  and with these words orlando sprang to his horse crying away against the saracens but he had no sooner turned his face than he wept bitterly and said o holy virgin think not of me the sinner orlando but have pity on these thy servants  archbishop turpin did as orlando said giving the whole band his benediction at once and absolving them from their sins so that every body took comfort in the thought of dying for christ and thus they embraced one another weeping and then lance was put to thigh and the banner was raised that was won in the jousting at aspramont  and now with a mighty dust and an infinite sound of horns and tambours and trumpets which came filling the valley the first army of the infidels made its appearance horses neighing and a thousand pennons flying in the air king falseron led them on saying to his officers now gentlemen recollect what i said the first battle is for the leaders onlyand above all let nobody dare to lay a finger on orlando he belongs to myself the revenge of my sons death is mine i will cut the man down that comes between us  now friends said orlando every man for himself and st michael for us all there is no one here that is not a perfect knight  and he might well say it for the flower of all france was there except rinaldo and ricciardetto every man a picked man all friends and constant companions of orlando there was richard of normandy and guottibuoffi and uliviero and count anselm and avolio and avino and the gentle berlinghieri and his brother and sansonetto and the good duke egibard and astolfo the englishman and angiolin of bayona and all the other paladins of france excepting those two whom i have mentioned and so the captains of the little troop and of the great array sat looking at one another and singling one another out as the latter came on and then either side began raising their warcries and the mob of the infidels halted and the knights put spear in rest and ran for a while two and two in succession each one against the other  astolfo was the first to move he ran against arlotto of soria and angiolin then ran against malducco and mazzarigi the renegade came against avino and uliviero was borne forth by his horse rondel who couldnt stand still against malprimo the first of the captains of falseron  and now lances began to be painted red without any brush but themselves and the new colour extended itself to the bucklers and the cuishes and the cuirasses and the trappings of the steeds  astolfo thrust his antagonists body out of the saddle and his soul into the other world and angiolin gave and took a terrible blow with malducco but his horse bore him onward and avino had something of the like encounter with mazzarigi but uliviero though he received a thrust which hurt him sent his lance right through the heart of malprimo  falseron was daunted at this blow verily thought he this is a miracle uliviero did not press on among the saracens his wound was too painful but orlando now put himself and his whole band into motion and you may guess what an uproar ensued the sound of the rattling of the blows and helmets was as if the forge of vulcan had been thrown open falseron beheld orlando coming so furiously that he thought him a lucifer who had burst his chain and was quite of another mind than when he proposed to have him all to himself on the contrary he recommended himself to his gods and turning away begged for a more auspicious season of revenge but orlando hailed and arrested him with a terrible voice saying o thou traitor was this the end to which old quarrels were made up dost thou not blush thou and thy fellowtraitor marsilius to have kissed me on the cheek like a judas when last thou wert in france  orlando had never shewn such anger in his countenance as he did that day he dashed at falseron with a fury so swift and at the same time a mastery of his lance so marvellous that though he plunged it in the mans body so as instantly to kill him the body did not move in the saddle the hero himself as he rushed onwards was fain to see the end of a stroke so perfect and turning his horse back he touched the carcass with his sword and it fell on the instant they say that it had no sooner fallen than it disappeared people got off their horses to lift up the body for it seemed to be there still the armour being left but when they came to handle the armour it was found as empty as the shell that is cast by a lobster o new and strange and portentous eventproof manifest of the anger with which god regards treachery  when the first infidel army beheld their leader dead such fear fell upon them that they were for leaving the field to the paladins but they were unable marsilius had drawn the rest of his forces round the valley like a net so that their shoulders were turned in vain orlando rode into the thick of them with count anselm by his side he rushed like a tempest and wherever he went thunderbolts fell upon helmets the paladins drove here and there after them each making a whirlwind round about him and a bloody circle uliviero was again in the mêlée and walter of amulion threw himself into it and baldwin roared like a lion and avino and avolio reaped the wretches heads like a turnipfield and blows blinded mens eyes and archbishop turpin himself had changed his crozier for a lance and chased a new flock before him to the mountains  yet what could be done against foes without number multitudes fill up the spaces left by the dead without stopping marsilius from his anxious and raging post constantly pours them in the paladins are as units to thousands why tarry the horses of rinaldo and ricciardetto  the horses did not tarry but fate had been quicker than enchantment ashtaroth nevertheless had presented himself to rinaldo in egypt as though he had issued out of a flash of lightning after telling his mission and giving orders to hundreds of invisible spirits round about him for the air was full of them he and foulmouth his servant entered the horses of rinaldo and ricciardetto which began to neigh and snort and leap with the fiends within them till off they flew through the air over the pyramids crowds of spirits going like a tempest before them ricciardetto shut his eyes at first on perceiving himself so high in the air but he speedily became used to it though he looked down on the sun at last in this manner they passed the desert and the seacoast and the ocean and swept the tops of the pyrenees ashtaroth talking to them of wonders by the way for he was one of the wisest of the devils and knew a great many things which were then unknown to man he laughed for instance as they went over sea at the notion among other vain fancies that nothing was to be found beyond the pillars of hercules for said he the earth is round and the sea has an even surface all over it and there are nations on the other side of the globe who walk with their feet opposed to yours and worship other gods than the christians  hah said rinaldo and may i ask whether they can be saved  it is a bold thing to ask said the devil but do you take the redeemer for a partisan and fancy he died for you only be assured he died for the whole world antipodes and all perhaps not one soul will be left out the pale of salvation at last but the whole human race adore the truth and find mercy the christian is the only true religion but heaven loves all goodness that believes honestly whatsoever the belief may be  rinaldo was mightily taken with the humanity of the devils opinions but they were now approaching the end of their journey and began to hear the noise of the battle and he could no longer think of any thing but the delight of being near orlando and plunging into the middle of it  you shall be in the very heart of it instantly said his bearer i love you and would fain do all you desire do not fancy that all nobleness of spirit is lost among us people below you know what the proverb says theres never a fruit however degenerate but will taste of its stock i was of a different order of beings once andbut it is as well not to talk of happy times yonder is marsilius and there goes orlando farewell and give me a place in your memory  rinaldo could not find words to express his sense of the devils goodwill nor of that of foul mouth himself he said ashtaroth i am as sorry to part with you as if you were a brother and i certainly do believe that nobleness of spirit exists as you say among your people below i shall be glad to see you both sometimes if you can come and i pray god if my poor prayer be worth any thing that you may all repent and obtain his pardon for without repentance you know nothing can be done for you  if i might suggest a favour returned ashtaroth since you are so good as to wish to do me one persuade malagigi to free me from his service and i am yours for ever to serve you will be a pleasure to me you will only have to say ashtaroth and my good friend here will be with you in an instant  i am obliged to you cried rinaldo and so is my brother i will write malagigi not merely a letter but a whole packetfull of your praises and so i will to orlando and you shall be set free depend on it your company has been so perfectly agreeable  your humble servant said ashtaroth and vanished with his companion like lightning  but they did not go far  there was a little chapel by the roadside in roncesvalles which had a couple of bells and on the top of that chapel did the devils place themselves in order that they might catch the souls of the infidels as they died and so carry them off to the infernal regions guess if their wings had plenty to do that day guess if minos and rhadamanthus were busy and charon sung in his boat and lucifer hugged himself for joy guess also if the tables in heaven groaned with nectar and ambrosia and good old st peter had a dry hair in his beard  the two paladins on their horses dropped right into the middle of the saracens and began making such havoc about them that marsilius who overlooked the fight from a mountain thought his soldiers had turned one against the other he therefore descended in fury with his third army and rinaldo seeing him coming said to ricciardetto we had better be off here and join orlando and with these words he gave his horse one turn round before he retreated so as to enable his sword to make a bloody circle about him and stories say that he sheared off twenty heads in the whirl of it he then dashed through the astonished beholders towards the battle of orlando who guessed it could be no other than his cousin and almost dropped from his horse out of desire to meet him ricciardetto followed rinaldo and uliviero coming up at the same moment the rapture of the whole party is not to be expressed they almost died for joy after a thousand embraces and questions and explanations and expressions of astonishment for the infidels held aloof awhile to take breath from the horror and mischief they had undergone orlando refreshed his little band of heroes and then drew rinaldo apart and said o my brother i feel such delight at seeing you i can hardly persuade myself i am not dreaming heaven be praised for it i have no other wish on earth now that i see you before i die why didnt you write but never mind here you are and i shall not die for nothing  i did write said rinaldo and so did ricciardetto but villany intercepted our letters tell me what to do my dear cousin for time presses and all the world is upon us  gan has brought us here said orlando under pretence of receiving tribute from marsiliusyou see of what sort and charles poor old man is waiting to receive his homage at the town of st john i have never seen a lucky day since you left us i believe i have done for charles more than in duty bound and that my sins pursue me and i and mine must all perish in roncesvalles  look to marsilius exclaimed rinaldo he is right upon us  marsilius was upon them surely enough at once furious and frightened at the coming of the new paladins for his camp numerous as it was had not only held aloof but turned about to fly like herds before the lion so he was forced to drive them back and bring up his other troops reasonably thinking that such numbers must overwhelm at last if they could but be kept together  not the less however for this did the paladins continue to fight as if with joy they killed and trampled wheresoever they went rinaldo fatiguing himself with sending infinite numbers of souls to ashtaroth and orlando making a bloody passage towards marsilius whom he hoped to settle as he had done falseron  in the course of this his tremendous progress the hero struck a youth on the head whose helmet was so good as to resist the blow but at the same time flew off and orlando seized him by the hair to kill him hold cried the youth as loud as want of breath could let him you loved my fatherim bujaforte  the paladin had never seen bujaforte but he saw the likeness to the good old man of the mountain his father and he let go the youths hair and embraced and kissed him o bujaforte said he i loved him indeed my good old man but what does his son do here fighting against his friend  bujaforte was a long time before he could speak for weeping at length he said orlando let not your noble heart be pained with ill thoughts of my fathers son i am forced to be here by my lord and master marsilius i had no friend left me in the world and he took me into his court and has brought me here before i knew what it was for and i have made a shew of fighting but have not hurt a single christian treachery is on every side of you baldwin himself has a vest given him by marsilius that every body may know the son of his friend gan and do him no injury see therelook how the lances avoid him  put your helmet on again said orlando and behave just as you have done never will your fathers friend be an enemy to the son only take care not to come across rinaldo  the hero then turned in fury to look for baldwin who was hastening towards him at that moment with friendliness in his looks  tis strange said baldwin i have done my duty as well as i could yet no body will come against me i have slain right and left and cannot comprehend what it is that makes the stoutest infidels avoid me  take off your vest cried orlando contemptuously and you will soon discover the secret if you wish to know it your father has sold us to marsilius all but his honourable son  if my father cried baldwin impetuously tearing off the vest has been such a villain and i escape dying any longer by god i will plunge this sword through his heart but i am no traitor orlando and you do me wrong to say it you do me foul dishonour and ill not survive it never more shall you behold me alive  baldwin spurred off into the fight not waiting to hear another word from orlando but constantly crying out you have done me dishonour and orlando was very sorry for what he had said for he perceived that the youth was in despair  and now the fight raged beyond all it had done before and the paladins themselves began to fall the enemy were driven forward in such multitudes by marsilius there was unhorsing of foes and reseating of friends and great cries and anguish and unceasing labour and twenty pagans went down for one christian but still the christians fell one paladin disappeared after another having too much to do for mortal men some could not make way through the press for very fatigue of killing and others were hampered with the falling horses and men sansonetto was thus beaten to earth by the club of grandonio and walter damulion had his shoulders broken and angiolin of bayona having lost his lance was thrust down by marsilius and angiolin of bellonda by sirionne and berlinghieri and ottone are gone and then astolfo went in revenge of whose death orlando turned the spot on which he died into a gulf of saracen blood rinaldo met the luckless bujaforte who had just begun to explain how he seemed to be fighting on the side which his father hated when the impatient hero exclaimed he who is not with me is against me and gave him a volley of such horrible cuffs about the head and ears that bujaforte died without being able to speak another word orlando cutting his way to a spot in which there was a great struggle and uproar found the poor youth baldwin the son of gan with two spears in his breast i am no traitor now said baldwin and so saying fell dead to the earth and orlando lifted up his voice and wept for he was bitterly sorry to have been the cause of his death he then joined rinaldo in the hottest of the tumult and all the surviving paladins gathered about them including turpin the archbishop who fought as hardily as the rest and the slaughter was lavish and horrible so that the eddies of the wind chucked the blood into the air and earth appeared a very seethingcauldron of hell at length down went uliviero himself he had become blind with his own blood and smitten orlando without knowing him who had never received such a blow in his life  how now cousin cried orlando have you too gone over to the enemy  o my lord and master orlando cried the other i ask your pardon if i have struck you i can see nothingi am dying the traitor arcaliffe has stabbed me in the back but i killed him for it if you love me lead my horse into the thick of them so that i may not die unavenged  i shall die myself before long said orlando out of very toil and grief so we will go together i have lost all hope all pride all wish to live any longer but not my love for uliviero comelet us give them a few blows yet let them see what you can do with your dying hands one faith one death one only wish be ours  orlando led his cousins horse where the press was thickest and dreadful was the strength of the dying man and of his halfdying companion they made a street through which they passed out of the battle and orlando led his cousin away to his tent and said wait a little till i return for i will go and sound the horn on the hill yonder  tis of no use said uliviero and my spirit is fast going and desires to be with its lord and saviour he would have said more but his words came from him imperfectly like those of a man in a dream only his cousin gathered that he meant to commend to him his sister orlandos wife alda the fair of whom indeed the great paladin had not thought so much in this world as he might have done and with these imperfect words he expired  but orlando no sooner saw him dead than he felt as if he was left alone on the earth and he was quite willing to leave it only he wished that charles at st john pied de port should hear how the case stood before he went and so he took up the horn and blew it three times with such force that the blood burst out of his nose and mouth turpin says that at the third blast the horn broke in two  in spite of all the noise of the battle the sound of the horn broke over it like a voice out of the other world they say that birds fell dead at it and that the whole saracen army drew back in terror but fearfuller still was its effect at st john pied de port charlemagne was sitting in the midst of his court when the sound reached him and gan was there the emperor was the first to hear it  do you hear that said he to his nobles did you hear the horn as i heard it  upon this they all listened and gan felt his heart misgive him  the horn sounded the second time  what is the meaning of this said charles  orlando is hunting observed gan and the stag is killed he is at the old pastime that he was so fond of in aspramonte  but when the horn sounded yet a third time and the blast was one of so dreadful a vehemence every body looked at the other and then they all looked at gan in fury charles rose from his seat this is no hunting of the stag said he the sound goes to my very heart and i confess makes me tremble i am awakened out of a great dream o gan o gan not for thee do i blush but for myself and for nobody else o my god what is to be done but whatever is to be done must be done quickly take this villain gentlemen and keep him in hard prison o foul and monstrous villain would to god i had not lived to see this day o obstinate and enormous folly o malagigi had i but believed thy foresight tis thou went the wise man and i the greyheaded fool  ogier the dane and namo and others in the bitterness of their grief and anger could not help reminding the emperor of all which they had foretold but it was no time for words they put the traitor into prison and then charles with all his court took his way to roncesvalles grieving and praying  it was afternoon when the horn sounded and half an hour after it when the emperor set out and meantime orlando had returned to the fight that he might do his duty however hopeless as long as he could sit his horse and the paladins were now reduced to four and though the saracens suffered themselves to be mowed down like grass by them and their little band he found his end approaching for toil and fever and so at length he withdrew out of the fight and rode all alone to a fountain which he knew of where he had before quenched his thirst  his horse was wearier still than he and no sooner had its master alighted than the beast kneeling down as if to take leave and to say i have brought you to your place of rest fell dead at his feet orlando cast water on him from the fountain not wishing to believe him dead but when he found it to no purpose he grieved for him as if he had been a human being and addressed him by name in tears and asked forgiveness if ever he had done him wrong they say that the horse at these words once more opened his eyes a little and looked kindly at his master and so stirred never more  they say also that orlando then summoning all his strength smote a rock near him with his beautiful sword durlindana thinking to shiver the steel in pieces and so prevent its falling into the hands of the enemy but though the rock split like a slate and a deep fissure remained ever after to astonish the eyes of pilgrims the sword remained unhurt  o strong durlindana cried he o noble and worthy sword had i known thee from the first as i know thee now never would i have been brought to this pass  and now rinaldo and ricciardetto and turpin came up having given chase to the saracens till they were weary and orlando gave joyful welcome to his cousin and they told him how the battle was won and then orlando knelt before turpin his face all in tears and begged remission of his sins and confessed them and turpin gave him absolution and suddenly a light came down upon him from heaven like a rainbow accompanied with a sound of music and an angel stood in the air blessing him and then disappeared upon which orlando fixed his eyes on the hilt of his sword as on a crucifix and embraced it and said lord vouchsafe that i may look on this poor instrument as on the symbol of the tree upon which thou sufferedst thy unspeakable martyrdom and so adjusting the sword to his bosom and embracing it closer he raised his eyes and appeared like a creature seraphical and transfigured and in bowing his head he breathed out his pure soul a thunder was then heard in the heavens and the heavens opened and seemed to stoop to the earth and a flock of angels was seen like a white cloud ascending with his spirit who were known to be what they were by the trembling of their wings the white cloud shot out golden fires so that the whole air was full of them and the voices of the angels mingled in song with the instruments of their brethren above which made an inexpressible harmony at once deep and dulcet the priestly warrior turpin and the two paladins and the heros squire terigi who were all on their knees forgot their own beings in following the miracle with their eyes  it was now the office of that squire to take horse and ride off to the emperor at saint john pied de port and tell him of all that had occurred but in spite of what he had just seen he lay for a time overwhelmed with grief he then rose and mounted his steed and left the paladins and the archbishop with the dead body who knelt about it guarding it with weeping love  the good squire terigi met the emperor and his cavalcade coming towards roncesvalles and alighted and fell on his knees telling him the miserable news and how all his people were slain but two of his paladins and himself and the good archbishop charles for anguish began tearing his white locks but terigi comforted him against so doing by giving an account of the manner of orlandos death and how he had surely gone to heaven nevertheless the squire himself was brokenhearted with grief and toil and he had scarcely added a denouncement of the traitor gan and a hope that the emperor would appease heaven finally by giving his body to the winds than he said the cold of death is upon me and so he fell dead at the emperors feet  charles was ready to drop from his saddle for wretchedness he cried out let nobody comfort me more i will have no comfort cursed be gan and cursed this horrible day and this place and every thing let us go on like blind miserable men that we are into roncesvalles and have patience if we can out of pure misery like job till we do all that can be done  so charles rode on with his nobles and they say that for the sake of the champion of christendom and the martyrs that died with him the sun stood still in the sky till the emperor had seen orlando and till the dead were buried  horrible to his eyes was the sight of the field of roncesvalles the saracens indeed had forsaken it conquered but all his paladins but two were left on it dead and the slaughtered heaps among which they lay made the whole valley like a great dumb slaughterhouse trampled up into blood and dirt and reeking to the heat the very trees were dropping with blood and every thing so to speak seemed tired out and gone to a horrible sleep  charles trembled to his hearts core for wonder and agony after dumbly gazing on the place he again cursed it with a solemn curse and wished that never grass might grow within it again nor seed of any kind neither within it nor on any of its mountains around with their proud shoulders but the anger of heaven abide over it for ever as on a pit made by hell upon earth  then he rode on and came up to where the body of orlando awaited him with the paladins and the old man weeping threw himself as if he had been a reckless youth from his horse and embraced and kissed the dead body and said i bless thee orlando i bless thy whole life and all that thou wast and all that thou ever didst and thy mighty and holy valour and the father that begot thee and i ask pardon of thee for believing those who brought thee to thine end they shall have their reward o thou beloved one but indeed it is thou that livest and i that am worse than dead  and now behold a wonder for the emperor in the fervour of his heart and of the memory of what had passed between them called to mind that orlando had promised to give him his sword should he die before him and he lifted up his voice more bravely and adjured him even now to return it to him gladly and it pleased god that the dead body of orlando should rise on its feet and kneel as he was wont to do at the feet of his liege lord and gladly and with a smile on its face return the sword to the emperor charles as orlando rose the paladins and turpin knelt down out of fear and horror especially seeing him look with a stern countenance but when they saw that he knelt also and smiled and returned the sword their hearts became reassured and charles took the sword like his liege lord though trembling with wonder and affection and in truth he could hardly clench his fingers around it  orlando was buried in a great sepulchre in aquisgrana and the dead paladins were all embalmed and sent with majestic cavalcades to their respective counties and principalities and every christian was honourably and reverently put in the earth and recorded among the martyrs of the church  but meantime the flying saracens thinking to bury their own dead and ignorant of what still awaited them came back into the valley and rinaldo beheld them with a dreadful joy and shewed them to charles now the emperors cavalcade had increased every moment and they fell upon the saracens with a new and unexpected battle and the old emperor addressing the sword of orlando exclaimed my strength is little but do thou do thy duty to thy master thou famous sword seeing that he returned it to me smiling and that his revenge is in my hands and so saying he met balugante the leader of the infidels as he came borne along by his frightened horse and the old man raising the sword with both hands cleaved him with a delighted mind to the chin  o sacred emperor charles o welllived old man defender of the faith light and glory of the old time thou hast cut off the other ear of malchus and shown how rightly thou wert born into the world to save it a second time from the abyss  again fled the saracens never to come to christendom more but charles went after them into spain he and rinaldo and ricciardetto and the good turpin and they took and fired saragossa and marsilius was hung to the carobtree under which he had planned his villany with gan and gan was hung and drawn and quartered in roncesvalles amidst the execrations of the country  and if you ask how it happened that charles ever put faith in such a wretch i shall tell you that it was because the good old emperor with all his faults was a divine man and believed in others out of the excellence of his own heart and truth and such was the case with orlando himself    appendix  no i  story of paulo and francesca    poscia ch i ebbi il mio dottore udito   nomar le donne antiche e i cavalieri

cried oh if i ask nought ill   poor weary souls have speech with me i pray    as doves that leave some bevy circling still   set firm their open wings and through the air   sweep homewards wafted by

one grave the hand that slew   is doomd to mourn us in the pit of cain   such were the words that told me of those two    downcast i stood looking so full of pain   to think how hard and sad a case it was   that my guide askd what held me in that vein    his voiced aroused me and i said alas   all their sweet thoughts then all the steps that led   to love but brought them to this dolorous pass

lover mothlike in his flame   drawn by her sweet smile kissd it o then he   whose lot and mine are now for aye the same    all in a tremble on the mouth kissd me   the book did all our hearts within us burnd   through that alone that day no more read we    while thus one spoke the other spirit mournd   with wail so woful that at his remorse   i felt as though i should have died i turned    stonestiff and to the ground fell like a corse   no ii  accounts given by different writers of the circumstances relating to paulo and francesca concluding with the only facts ascertained  boccaccios account  translated from his commentary on the passage  you must know that this lady madonna francesca was daughter of messer guido the elder lord of ravenna and of cervia and that a long and grievous war having been waged between him and the lords malatesta of rimini a treaty of peace by certain mediators was at length concluded between them the which to the end that it might be the more firmly established it pleased both parties to desire to fortify by relationship and the matter of this relationship was so discoursed that the said messer guido agreed to give his young and fair daughter in marriage to gianciotto the son of messer malatesta now this being made known to certain of the friends of messer guido one of them said to him take care what you do for if you contrive not matters discreetly such relationship will beget scandal you know what manner of person your daughter is and of how lofty a spirit and if she see gianciotto before the bond is tied neither you nor any one else will have power to persuade her to marry him therefore if it so please you it seems to me that it would be good to conduct the matter thus namely that gianciotto should not come hither himself to marry her but that a brother of his should come and espouse her in his name  gianciotto was a man of great spirit and hoped after his fathers death to become lord of rimini in the contemplation of which event albeit he was rude in appearance and a cripple messer guido desired him for a soninlaw above any one of his brothers discerning therefore the reasonableness of what his friend counselled he secretly disposed matters according to his device and a day being appointed polo a brother of gianciotto came to ravenna with full authority to espouse madonna francesca polo was a handsome man very pleasant and of a courteous breeding and passing with other gentlemen over the courtyard of the palace of messer guido a damsel who knew him pointed him out to madonna francesca through an opening in the casement saying that is he that is to be your husband and so indeed the poor lady believed and incontinently placed in him her whole affection and the ceremony of the marriage having been thus brought about and the lady conveyed to rimini she became not aware of the deceit till the morning ensuing the marriage when she beheld gianciotto rise from her side the which discovery moved her to such disdain that she became not a whit the less rooted in her love for polo nevertheless that it grew to be unlawful i never heard except in what is written by this author dante and possibly it might so have become albeit i take what he says to have been an invention framed on the possibility rather than any thing which he knew of his own knowledge be this as it may polo and madonna francesca living in the same house and gianciotto being gone into a certain neighbouring district as governor they fell into great companionship with one another suspecting nothing but a servant of gianciottos noting it went to his master and told him how matters looked with the which gianciotto being fiercely moved secretly returned to rimini and seeing polo enter the room of madonna francesca the while he himself was arriving went straight to the door and finding it locked inside called to his lady to come out for madonna francesca and polo having descried him polo thought to escape suddenly through an opening in the wall by means of which there was a descent into another room and therefore thinking to conceal his fault either wholly or in part he threw himself into the opening telling the lady to go and open the door but his hope did not turn out as he expected for the hem of a mantle which he had on caught upon a nail and the lady opening the door meantime in the belief that all would be well by reason of polos not being there gianciotto caught sight of polo as he was detained by the hem of the mantle and straightway ran with his dagger in his hand to kill him whereupon the lady to prevent it ran between them but gianciotto having lifted the dagger and put the whole force of his arm into the blow there came to pass what he had not desirednamely that he struck the dagger into the bosom of the lady before it could reach polo by which accident being as one who had loved the lady better than himself he withdrew the dagger and again struck at polo and slew him and so leaving them both dead he hastily went his way and betook him to his wonted affairs and the next morning the two lovers with many tears were buried together in the same grave  the reader of this account will have observed that while dante assumes the guilt of all parties and puts them into the infernal regions the goodnatured boccaccio is for doubting it and consequently for sending them all to heaven he will ignore as much of the business as a gentleman can boldly doubts any guilt in the case says nothing of the circumstance of the book and affirms that the husband loved his wife and was miserable at having slain her there is however one negative point in common between the two narrators they both say nothing of certain particulars connected with the date of francescas marriage and not a little qualifying the first romantic look of the story  now it is the absence of these particulars combined with the tradition of the fathers artifice omitted perhaps by dante out of personal favour and with that of the husbands ferocity of character the belief in which boccaccio did not succeed in displacing that has left the prevailing impression on the minds of posterity which is thisthat francesca was beguiled by her father into the marriage with the deformed and unamiable giovanni and that the unconscious medium of the artifice was the amiable and handsome paulo that one or both of the victims of the artifice fell in love with the other that their intercourse whatever it was took place not long after the marriage and that when paulo and francesca were slain in consequence they were young lovers with no other ties to the world  it is not pleasant in general to dispel the illusions of romance though dantes will bear the operation with less hurt to a readers feelings than most and i suspect that if nine out of ten of all the implied conclusions of other narratives in his poem could be compared with the facts he would be found to be one of the greatest of romancers in a new and not very desirable sense however excusable he may have been in his partyprejudice but a romance may be displaced only to substitute perhaps matters of fact more really touching by reason of their greater probability the following is the whole of what modern inquirers have ascertained respecting paulo and francesca future enlargers on the story may suppress what they please as dante did but if any one of them like the writer of the present remarks is anxious to speak nothing but the truth i advise him especially if he is for troubling himself with making changes in his story not to think that he has seen all the authorities on the subject or even remembered all he has seen until he has searched every corner of his library and his memory all the poems hitherto written upon this popular subject are indeed only to be regarded as so many probable pieces of fancy that of dante himself included                                       the only particulars hitherto really ascertained respecting the history of paulo and francesca  francesca was daughter of guido novello da polenta lord of ravenna  she was married to giovanni surnamed the lame one of the sons of malatesta da verrucchio lord of rimini  giovanni the lame had a brother named paulo the handsome who was a widower and left a son  twelve years after francescas marriage by which time she had become mother of a son who died and of a daughter who survived her she and her brotherinlaw paulo were slain together by the husband and buried in one grave  two hundred years afterwards the grave was opened and the bodies found lying together in silken garments the silk itself being entire  now a far more touching history may have lurked under these facts than in the halfconcealed and misleading circumstances of the received storylong patience long duty struggling conscience exhausted hope  on the other hand it may have been a mere heartless case of intrigue and folly  but tradition is to be allowed its reasonable weight and the probability is that the marriage was an affair of state the lady unhappy and the brothers too different from one another  the event took place in dantes twentyfourth year so that he who looks so much older to our imaginations than his heroine was younger and this renders more than probable what the latest biographers have assertednamely that the lord of ravenna at whose house he finished his days was not her father guido da polenta the third of that name but her nephew guido the fifth                                       no iiii  story of ugolino

ugolino  and chaucers feeling respecting the poem  chaucer has told the greater part of this story beautifully in his canterbury tales but he had not the heart to finish it he refers for the conclusion to his original hight dant the grete poete of itaille adding that dante will not fail his readers a single wordthat is to say not an atom of the cruelty  our great gentlehearted countryman who tells fortune that it was    great cruelty   such birdes for to put in such a cage  adds a touch of pathos in the behaviour of one of the children which dante does not seem to have thought of    there day by day this child began to cry   till in his fathers barme lap adown he lay   and said farewell father i muste die   and kissd his father and died the same day  it will be a relief perhaps instead of a disappointment to the readers of this appalling story to hear that dantes particulars of it are as little to be relied on as those of the paulo and francesca the only facts known of ugolino are that he was an ambitious traitor who did actually deliver up the fortified places as dante acknowledges and that his rivals infamous as he or more infamous prevailed against him and did shut him up and starve him and some of his family but the little children are an invention of the poets or probably his belief when he was a young man and first heard the story for some of ugolinos fellowprisoners may have been youths but others were grown upnone so childish as he intimates and they were not all his own sons some were his nephews  and as to archbishop ruggieri there is no proof whatever of his having had any share in the businesshardly a ground of suspicion so that historians look upon him as an illused gentleman dante in all probability must have learnt the real circumstances of the case as he advanced in years but if charity is bound to hope that he would have altered the passage accordingly had he revised his poem it is forced to admit that he left it unaltered and that his will and pleasure might have found means of reconciling the retention to his conscience pride unfortunately includes the power to do things which it pretends to be very foreign to its nature and in proportion as detraction is easy to it retraction becomes insupportable3  rabelais to shew his contempt for the knights of chivalry has made them galleyslaves in the next world

dimmi se non ch io tuccido   di questo tradimento appunto e come   e se tu il di de la morte ti fido   e vo che tu mi dica presto il nome   onde il pagan rispose con gran grido   aspetta bujaforte io te lo dico   de la montagna del veglio tuo amico    orlando quando intese il giovinetto   subito al padre suo raffigurollo   lasciò la chioma e poi labbracciò stretto   per tenerezza e con lelmo baciollo   e disse o bujaforte il vero hai detto   il veglio mio e da canto tirollo   di questo tradimento dimmi appunto   poi the così la fortuna m ha giunto    ma ben ti dico per la fede mia   che di combatter con mie genti hai torto   e so che l padre tuo dovunque e sia   non ti perdona questo così morto   bujaforte piangeva tuttavia   poi disse orlando mio datti conforto   il mio signore a forza quà mi manda   e obbedir convien quel che comanda    io son de la mia patria sbandeggiato   marsilio in corte sua m ha ritenuto   e promesso rimettermi in istato   io vo cercando consiglio ed ajuto   poi ch io son da ognuno abbandonato   e per questa cagion quà son venuto   e bench i mostri far grande schermaglia   non ho morto nessun ne la battaglia    io t ho tanto per fama ricordare   sentito a tutto il mondo che nel core   sempre poi t ebbi e mi puoi comandare   e so del padre mio lantico amore   del tradimento tu tel puoi pensare   sai che gano e marsilio è traditore   e so per discrezion tu intendi bene   che tanta gente per tua morte viene    e baldovin di marsilio ha la vesta   che così il vostro gano ba ordinato   vedi che ignun non gli pon lancia in resta   che l signor nostro ce lha comandato   disse orlando rimetti lelmo in testa   e torna a la battaglia al modo usato   vedrem che segnirà tanto ti dico   ch io tarò sempre come il veglio amico    poi disse aspetta un poco intendi saldo   che non ti punga qualche strana ortica   sappi ch egli è ne la zuffa rinaldo   guarda che il nome per nulla non dica   che non dicesse in quella furia caldo   dunque tu se da la parte nimica   si che tu giuochi netto destro e largo   che ti bisogua aver quì gli occhi dargo    rispose bujaforte bene hai detto   se la battaglia passerà a tuo modo   ti mostrerò che amico son perfetto   come fu il padre mio ch ancor ne godo  the poor youth takes his way through the fight and unfortunately meets with rinaldo    rinaldo ritrovò quel bujaforte   al mio parer che sarebbe scoppiato   se non avesse trovato la morte   e come egli ebbe a parlar cominciato   del re marsilio e di stare in suo corte   rinaldo gli rispose infuriato   chi non è ineco avverso me sia detto   e cominciogli a trassinar lelmetto   e trasse un mandiretto e due e tre   con tanta furia e quattro e cinque e sei   che non ebbe agio a domandar merzè   e morto cadde sanza dire omei    orlando and baldwin    orlando poi che lasciò bujaforte   pargli millanni trovar baldovino   che cerca pure e non truova la morte   e ricognobbe il caval vegliantino   per la battaglia e va correndo forte   dov era orlando e diceva il meschino   sappi ch io ho fatto oggi il mio dovuto   e contra me nessun mai e venuto    molti pagani ho pur fatti morire   però quel che ciò sia pensar non posso   se non ch io veggo la gente fuggire   rispose orlando tu ti fai ben grosso   di questo fatto stu ti vuoi chiarire   la soppravvesta ti cava di dosso   vedrai che gan come tu te la cavi   ci ha venduti a marsilio per ischiavi    rispose baldwin se il padre mio   ci ha qui condotti come traditore   s i posso oggi campar pel nostro iddio   con questa spada passerogli il core   ma traditore orlando non so io   ch io t ho seguito con perfetto amore   non mi potresti dir maggiore ingiuria   poi si stracciò la vesta con gran furia    e disse io tornerò ne la battaglia   poi che tu m hai per traditore scorto   io non son traditor se dio mi vaglia   non mi vedrai più oggi se non morto   e in verso loste de pagan si scaglia   dicendo sempre tu m hai fatto torto   orlando si pentea daver cio detto   che disperato vide il giovinetto    per la battaglia cornea baldovino   e riscontrò quel crudel mazzarigi   e disse tu se qui can saracino   per distrugger la gente di parigi   o marran rinnegato paterino   tu sarai presto giù ne bassi stigi   e trasse con la spada in modo a questo   che lo mandò dov egli disse presto  orlando meets again with baldwin who has kept his word    orlando corse a le grida e l romore   e trovò baldovino il poveretto   ch era gia presso a lultime sue ore   e da due lance avea passato il petto   e disse or non son io più traditore   e cadde in terra morto così detto   de la qual cosa duolsi orlando forte   e pianse esser cagion de la sua morte   footnote 1 sì the italian yes a similar territorial designation is familiar to the reader in the word languedoc meaning langue
