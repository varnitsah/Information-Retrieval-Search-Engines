47723969	when william came   chapter i the singingbird and the barometer   cicely yeovil sat in a low swing chair alternately looking at herself in a mirror and at the other occupant of the room in the flesh  both prospects gave her undisguised satisfaction  without being vain she was duly appreciative of good looks whether in herself or in another and the reflection that she saw in the mirror and the young man whom she saw seated at the piano would have come with credit out of a more severely critical inspection  probably she looked longer and with greater appreciation at the piano player than at her own image her good looks were an inherited possession that had been with her more or less all her life while ronnie storre was a comparatively new acquisition discovered and achieved so to speak by her own enterprise selected by her own good taste  fate had given her adorable eyelashes and an excellent profile  ronnie was an indulgence she had bestowed on herself  cicely had long ago planned out for herself a complete philosophy of life and had resolutely set to work to carry her philosophy into practice  when love is over how little of love even the lover understands she quoted to herself from one of her favourite poets and transposed the saying into while life is with us how little of life even the materialist understands  most people that she knew took endless pains and precautions to preserve and prolong their lives and keep their powers of enjoyment unimpaired few very few seemed to make any intelligent effort at understanding what they really wanted in the way of enjoying their lives or to ascertain what were the best means for satisfying those wants  fewer still bent their whole energies to the one paramount aim of getting what they wanted in the fullest possible measure  her scheme of life was not a wholly selfish one no one could understand what she wanted as well as she did herself therefore she felt that she was the best person to pursue her own ends and cater for her own wants  to have others thinking and acting for one merely meant that one had to be perpetually grateful for a lot of wellmeant and usually unsatisfactory services  it was like the case of a rich man giving a community a free library when probably the community only wanted free fishing or reduced tramfares  cicely studied her own whims and wishes experimented in the best method of carrying them into effect compared the accumulated results of her experiments and gradually arrived at a very clear idea of what she wanted in life and how best to achieve it she was not by disposition a selfcentred soul therefore she did not make the mistake of supposing that one can live successfully and gracefully in a crowded world without taking due notice of the other human elements around one  she was instinctively far more thoughtful for others than many a person who is genuinely but unseeingly addicted to unselfishness  also she kept in her armoury the weapon which can be so mightily effective if used sparingly by a really sincere individualthe knowledge of when to be a humbug  ambition entered to a certain extent into her life and governed it perhaps rather more than she knew  she desired to escape from the doom of being a nonentity but the escape would have to be effected in her own way and in her own time to be governed by ambition was only a shade or two better than being governed by convention  the drawingroom in which she and ronnie were sitting was of such proportions that one hardly knew whether it was intended to be one room or several and it had the merit of being moderately cool at two oclock on a particularly hot july afternoon  in the coolest of its many alcoves servants had noiselessly set out an improvised luncheon table a tempting array of caviare crab and mushroom salads cold asparagus slender hock bottles and highstemmed wine goblets peeped out from amid a setting of charlotte klemm roses  cicely rose from her seat and went over to the piano  come she said touching the young man lightly with a fingertip on the top of his very sleek copperhued head were going to have picniclunch today up here its so much cooler than any of the downstairs rooms and we shant be bothered with the servants trotting in and out all the time  rather a good idea of mine wasnt it  ronnie after looking anxiously to see that the word picnic did not portend tongue sandwiches and biscuits gave the idea his blessing  what is young storres profession some one had once asked concerning him  he has a great many friends who have independent incomes had been the answer  the meal was begun in an appreciative silence a picnic in which three kinds of red pepper were available for the caviare demanded a certain amount of respectful attention  my heart ought to be like a singingbird today i suppose said cicely presently  because your good man is coming home asked ronnie  cicely nodded  hes expected some time this afternoon though im rather vague as to which train he arrives by  rather a stifling day for railway travelling  and is your heart doing the singingbird business asked ronnie  that depends said cicely if i may choose the bird  a misselthrush would do perhaps it sings loudest in stormy weather i believe  ronnie disposed of two or three stems of asparagus before making any comment on this remark  is there going to be stormy weather he asked  the domestic barometer is set rather that way said cicely  you see murrey has been away for ever so long and of course there will be lots of things he wont be used to and im afraid matters may be rather strained and uncomfortable for a time  do you mean that he will object to me asked ronnie  not in the least said cicely hes quite broadminded on most subjects and he realises that this is an age in which sensible people know thoroughly well what they want and are determined to get what they want  it pleases me to see a lot of you and to spoil you and pay you extravagant compliments about your good looks and your music and to imagine at times that im in danger of getting fond of you i dont see any harm in it and i dont suppose murrey will eitherin fact i shouldnt be surprised if he takes rather a liking to you  no its the general situation that will trouble and exasperate him hes not had time to get accustomed to the fait accompli like we have  it will break on him with horrible suddenness  he was somewhere in russia when the war broke out wasnt he said ronnie  somewhere in the wilds of eastern siberia shooting and bird collecting miles away from a railway or telegraph line and it was all over before he knew anything about it it didnt last very long when you come to think of it  he was due home somewhere about that time and when the weeks slipped by without my hearing from him i quite thought hed been captured in the baltic or somewhere on the way back  it turned out that he was down with marsh fever in some outoftheway spot and everything was over and finished with before he got back to civilisation and newspapers  it must have been a bit of a shock said ronnie busy with a welldevised salad still i dont see why there should be domestic storms when he comes back  you are hardly responsible for the catastrophe that has happened  no said cicely but hell come back naturally feeling sore and savage with everything he sees around him and he wont realise just at once that weve been through all that ourselves and have reached the stage of sullen acquiescence in what cant be helped  he wont understand for instance how we can be enthusiastic and excited over gorla mustelfords debut and things of that sort hell think we are a set of callous revellers fiddling while rome is burning  in this case said ronnie rome isnt burning its burnt  all that remains to be done is to rebuild itwhen possible  exactly and hell say were not doing much towards helping at that  but protested ronnie the whole thing has only just happened rome wasnt built in a day and we cant rebuild our rome in a day  i know said cicely but so many of our friends and especially murreys friends have taken the thing in a tragical fashion and cleared off to the colonies or shut themselves up in their country houses as though there was a sort of moral leprosy infecting london  i dont see what good that does said ronnie  it doesnt do any good but its what a lot of them have done because they felt like doing it and murrey will feel like doing it too  that is where i foresee trouble and disagreement  ronnie shrugged his shoulders  i would take things tragically if i saw the good of it he said as matters stand its too late in the day and too early to be anything but philosophical about what one cant help  for the present weve just got to make the best of things  besides you cant very well turn down gorla at the last moment  im not going to turn down gorla or anybody said cicely with decision  i think it would be silly and silliness doesnt appeal to me  that is why i foresee storms on the domestic horizon  after all gorla has her career to think of  do you know she added with a change of tone i rather wish you would fall in love with gorla it would make me horribly jealous and a little jealousy is such a good tonic for any woman who knows how to dress well  also ronnie it would prove that you are capable of falling in love with some one of which ive grave doubts up to the present  love is one of the few things in which the makebelieve is superior to the genuine said ronnie it lasts longer and you get more fun out of it and its easier to replace when youve done with it  still its rather like playing with coloured paper instead of playing with fire objected cicely  a footman came round the corner with the trained silence that tactfully contrives to make itself felt  mr luton to see you madam he announced shall i say you are in  mr luton  oh yes said cicely hell probably have something to tell us about gorlas concert she added turning to ronnie  tony luton was a young man who had sprung from the people and had taken care that there should be no recoil  he was scarcely twenty years of age but a tightly packed chronicle of vicissitudes lay behind his sprightly insouciant appearance  since his fifteenth year he had lived heaven knew how getting sometimes a minor engagement at some minor music hall sometimes a temporary job as secretaryvaletcompanion to a roving invalid dining now and then on plovers eggs and asparagus at one of the smarter west end restaurants at other times devouring a kipper or a sausage in some stuffy edgware road eatinghouse always seemingly amused by life and always amusing  it is possible that somewhere in such heart as he possessed there lurked a rankling bitterness against the hard things of life or a scrap of gratitude towards the one or two friends who had helped him disinterestedly but his most intimate associates could not have guessed at the existence of such feelings  tony luton was just a merryeyed dancing faun whom fate had surrounded with streets instead of woods and it would have been in the highest degree inartistic to have sounded him for a heart or a heartache  the dancing of the faun took one day a livelier and more assured turn the joyousness became more real and the worst of the vicissitudes seemed suddenly over  a musical friend gifted with mediocre but marketable abilities supplied tony with a song for which he obtained a trial performance at an east end hall  dressed as a jockey for no particular reason except that the costume suited him he sang they quaff the gay bubbly in eccleston square to an appreciative audience which included the manager of a famous west end theatre of varieties  tony and his song won the managerial favour and were immediately transplanted to the west end house where they scored a success of which the drooping musichall industry was at the moment badly in need  it was just after the great catastrophe and men of the london world were in no humour to think they had witnessed the inconceivable befall them they had nothing but political ruin to stare at and they were anxious to look the other way  the words of tonys song were more or less meaningless though he sang them remarkably well but the tune with its air of slyness and furtive joyousness appealed in some unaccountable manner to people who were furtively unhappy and who were trying to appear stoically cheerful  what must be must be and its a poor heart that never rejoices were the popular expressions of the london public at that moment and the men who had to cater for that public were thankful when they were able to stumble across anything that fitted in with the prevailing mood  for the first time in his life tony luton discovered that agents and managers were a leisured class and that office boys had manners  he entered cicelys drawingroom with the air of one to whom assurance of manner has become a sheathed weapon a court accessory rather than a trade implement  he was more quietly dressed than the usual run of music hall successes he had looked critically at life from too many angles not to know that though clothes cannot make a man they can certainly damn him  thank you i have lunched already he said in answer to a question from cicely  thank you he said again in a cheerful affirmative as the question of hock in a tall icecold goblet was propounded to him  ive come to tell you the latest about the gorla mustelford evening he continued  old laurent is putting his back into it and its really going to be rather a big affair  shes going to outrussian the russians  of course she hasnt their technique nor a tenth of their training but shes having tons of advertisement  the name gorla is almost an advertisement in itself and then theres the fact that shes the daughter of a peer  she has temperament said cicely with the decision of one who makes a vague statement in a good cause  so laurent says observed tony  he discovers temperament in every one that he intends to boom  he told me that i had temperament to the finger tips and i was too polite to contradict him  but i havent told you the really important thing about the mustelford debut  it is a profound secret more or less so you must promise not to breathe a word about it till halfpast four when it will appear in all the six oclock newspapers  tony paused for dramatic effect while he drained his goblet and then made his announcement  majesty is going to be present  informally and unofficially but still present in the flesh  a sort of casual dropping in carefully heralded by unconfirmed rumour a week ahead  heavens exclaimed cicely in genuine excitement what a bold stroke lady shalem has worked that i bet  i suppose it will go down all right  trust laurent to see to that said tony he knows how to fill his house with the right sort of people and hes not the one to risk a fiasco  he knows what hes about  i tell you its going to be a big evening  i say exclaimed ronnie suddenly give a supper party here for gorla on the night and ask the shalem woman and all her crowd  it will be awful fun  cicely caught at the suggestion with some enthusiasm  she did not particularly care for lady shalem but she thought it would be just as well to care for her as far as outward appearances went  grace lady shalem was a woman who had blossomed into sudden importance by constituting herself a sort of fostermother to the fait accompli  at a moment when london was denuded of most of its aforetime social leaders she had seen her opportunity and made the most of it  she had not contented herself with bowing to the inevitable she had stretched out her hand to it and forced herself to smile graciously at it and her polite attentions had been reciprocated  lady shalem without being a beauty or a wit or a grand lady in the traditional sense of the word was in a fair way to becoming a power in the land others more capable and with stronger claims to social recognition would doubtless overshadow her and displace her in due course but for the moment she was a person whose good graces counted for something and cicely was quite alive to the advantage of being in those good graces  it would be rather fun she said running over in her mind the possibilities of the suggested supperparty  it would be jolly useful put in ronnie eagerly you could get all sorts of interesting people together and it would be an excellent advertisement for gorla  ronnie approved of supperparties on principle but he was also thinking of the advantage which might accrue to the drawingroom concert which cicely had projected with himself as the chief performer if he could be brought into contact with a wider circle of music patrons  i know it would be useful said cicely it would be almost historical theres no knowing who might not come to itand things are dreadfully slack in the entertaining line just now  the ambitious note in her character was making itself felt at that moment  lets go down to the library and work out a list of people to invite said ronnie  a servant entered the room and made a brief announcement  mr yeovil has arrived madam  bother said ronnie sulkily  now youll cool off about that supper party and turn down gorla and the rest of us  it was certainly true that the supper already seemed a more difficult proposition in cicelys eyes than it had a moment or two ago     youll not forget my only daughter    een though saphia has crossed the sea  quoted tony with mocking laughter in his voice and eyes  cicely went down to greet her husband  she felt that she was probably very glad that he was home once more she was angry with herself for not feeling greater certainty on the point  even the wellbeloved however can select the wrong moment for return  if cicely yeovils heart was like a singingbird it was of a kind that has frequent lapses into silence     chapter ii the homecoming   murrey yeovil got out of the boattrain at victoria station and stood waiting in an attitude something between listlessness and impatience while a porter dragged his light travelling kit out of the railway carriage and went in search of his heavier baggage with a handtruck yeovil was a greyfaced young man with restless eyes and a rather wistful mouth and an air of lassitude that was evidently only a temporary characteristic  the hot dusty station with its blended crowds of dawdling and scurrying people its little streams of suburban passengers pouring out every now and then from this or that platform like ants swarming across a garden path made a wearisome climax to what had been a rather wearisome journey  yeovil glanced quickly almost furtively around him in all directions with the air of a man who is constrained by morbid curiosity to look for things that he would rather not see  the announcements placed in german alternatively with english over the booking office leftluggage office refreshment buffets and so forth the crowned eagle and monogram displayed on the post boxes caught his eye in quick succession  he turned to help the porter to shepherd his belongings on to the truck and followed him to the outer yard of the station where a string of taxi cabs was being slowly absorbed by an outpouring crowd of travellers  portmanteaux wraps and a trunk or two much belabelled and travelworn were stowed into a taxi and yeovil turned to give the direction to the driver  twentyeight berkshire street  berkschirestrasse achtundzwanzig echoed the man a bulky spectacled individual of unmistakable teuton type  twentyeight berkshire street repeated yeovil and got into the cab leaving the driver to retranslate the direction into his own language  a succession of cabs leaving the station blocked the roadway for a moment or two and yeovil had leisure to observe the fact that viktoria strasse was lettered side by side with the familiar english name of the street  a notice directing the public to the neighbouring swimming baths was also written up in both languages  london had become a bilingual city even as warsaw  the cab threaded its way swiftly along buckingham palace road towards the mall  as they passed the long front of the palace the traveller turned his head resolutely away that he might not see the alien uniforms at the gates and the eagle standard flapping in the sunlight  the taxi driver who seemed to have combative instincts slowed down as he was turning into the mall and pointed to the white pile of memorial statuary in front of the palace gates  grossmutter denkmal yes he announced and resumed his journey  arrived at his destination yeovil stood on the steps of his house and pressed the bell with an odd sense of forlornness as though he were a stranger drifting from nowhere into a land that had no cognisance of him a moment later he was standing in his own hall the object of respectful solicitude and attention  sprucely garbed and groomed lackeys busied themselves with his battered travelsoiled baggage the door closed on the gutturalvoiced taxi driver and the glaring july sunshine  the wearisome journey was over  poor dear how dreadfully pulleddown you look said cicely when the first greetings had been exchanged  its been a slow business getting well said yeovil  im only three quarter way there yet  he looked at his reflection in a mirror and laughed ruefully  you should have seen what i looked like five or six weeks ago he added  you ought to have let me come out and nurse you said cicely you know i wanted to  oh they nursed me well enough said yeovil and it would have been a shame dragging you out there a small finnish health resort out of the season is not a very amusing place and it would have been worse for any one who didnt talk russian  you must have been buried alive there said cicely with commiseration in her voice  i wanted to be buried alive said yeovil  the news from the outer world was not of a kind that helped a despondent invalid towards convalescence  they spoke to me as little as possible about what was happening and i was grateful for your letters because they also told me very little  when one is abroad among foreigners ones countrys misfortunes cause one an acuter more personal distress than they would at home even  well you are at home now anyway said cicely and you can jog along the road to complete recovery at your own pace  a little quiet shooting this autumn and a little hunting just enough to keep you fit and not to overtire you you mustnt overtax your strength  im getting my strength back all right said yeovil  this journey hasnt tired me half as much as one might have expected  its the awful drag of listlessness mental and physical that is the worst aftereffect of these marsh fevers they drain the energy out of you in bucketfuls and it trickles back again in teaspoonfuls  and just now untiring energy is what i shall need even more than strength i dont want to degenerate into a slacker  look here murrey said cicely after weve had dinner together to night im going to do a seemingly unwifely thing  im going to go out and leave you alone with an old friend  doctor holham is coming in to drink coffee and smoke with you  i arranged this because i knew it was what you would like  men can talk these things over best by themselves and holham can tell you everything that happenedsince you went away  it will be a dreary story im afraid but you will want to hear it all  it was a nightmare time but now one sees it in a calmer perspective  i feel in a nightmare still said yeovil  we all felt like that said cicely rather with the air of an elder person who tells a child that it will understand things better when it grows up time is always something of a narcotic you know  things seem absolutely unbearable and then bit by bit we find out that we are bearing them  and now dear ill fill up your notification paper and leave you to superintend your unpacking  robert will give you any help you want  what is the notification paper asked yeovil  oh a stupid form to be filled up when any one arrives to say where they come from and their business and nationality and religion and all that sort of thing  were rather more bureaucratic than we used to be you know  yeovil said nothing but into the sallow greyness of his face there crept a dark flush that faded presently and left his colour more grey and bloodless than before  the journey seemed suddenly to have recommenced he was under his own roof his servants were waiting on him his familiar possessions were in evidence around him but the sense of being at home had vanished  it was as though he had arrived at some wayside hotel and been asked to register his name and status and destination  other things of disgust and irritation he had foreseen in the london he was coming tothe alterations on stamps and coinage the intrusive teuton element the alien uniforms cropping up everywhere the new orientation of social life such things he was prepared for but this personal evidence of his subject state came on him unawares at a moment when he had so to speak laid his armour aside  cicely spoke lightly of the hateful formality that had been forced on them would he too come to regard things in the same acquiescent spirit     chapter iii the metskie tsar   i was in the early stages of my fever when i got the first inkling of what was going on said yeovil to the doctor as they sat over their coffee in a recess of the big smokingroom just able to potter about a bit in the daytime fighting against depression and inertia feverish as evening came on and delirious in the night  my game tracker and my attendant were both buriats and spoke very little russian and that was the only language we had in common to converse in  in matters concerning food and sport we soon got to understand each other but on other subjects we were not easily able to exchange ideas  one day my tracker had been to a distant tradingstore to get some things of which we were in need the store was eighty miles from the nearest point of railroad eighty miles of terribly bad roads but it was in its way a centre and transmitter of news from the outside world  the tracker brought back with him vague tidings of a conflict of some sort between the metskie tsar and the angliskie tsar and kept repeating the russian word for defeat  the angliskie tsar i recognised of course as the king of england but my brain was too sick and dull to read any further meaning into the mans reiterated gabble  i grew so ill just then that i had to give up the struggle against fever and make my way as best i could towards the nearest point where nursing and doctoring could be had  it was one evening in a lonely resthut on the edge of a huge forest as i was waiting for my boy to bring the meal for which i was feverishly impatient and which i knew i should loathe as soon as it was brought that the explanation of the word metskie flashed on me  i had thought of it as referring to some oriental potentate some rebellious rajah perhaps who was giving trouble and whose followers had possibly discomfited an isolated british force in some outoftheway corner of our empire  and all of a sudden i knew that nemetskie tsar german emperor had been the name that the man had been trying to convey to me i shouted for the tracker and put him through a breathless crossexamination he confirmed what my fears had told me  the metskie tsar was a big european ruler he had been in conflict with the angliskie tsar and the latter had been defeated swept away the man spoke the word that he used for ships and made energetic pantomime to express the sinking of a fleet  holham there was nothing for it but to hope that this was a false groundless rumour that had somehow crept to the confines of civilisation  in my saner balanced moments it was possible to disbelieve it but if you have ever suffered from delirium you will know what raging torments of agony i went through in the nights how my brain fought and refought that rumoured disaster  the doctor gave a murmur of sympathetic understanding  then continued yeovil i reached the small siberian town towards which i had been struggling  there was a little colony of russians there traders officials a doctor or two and some army officers  i put up at the primitive hotelrestaurant which was the general gathering place of the community  i knew quickly that the news was true  russians are the most tactful of any european race that i have ever met they did not stare with insolent or pitying curiosity but there was something changed in their attitude which told me that the travelling briton was no longer in their eyes the interesting respectcommanding personality that he had been in past days  i went to my own room where the samovar was bubbling its familiar tune and a smiling redshirted russian boy was helping my buriat servant to unpack my wardrobe and i asked for any back numbers of newspapers that could be supplied at a moments notice  i was given a bundle of wellthumbed sheets odd pieces of the novoe vremya the moskovskie viedomosti one or two complete numbers of local papers published at perm and tobolsk  i do not read russian well though i speak it fairly readily but from the fragments of disconnected telegrams that i pieced together i gathered enough information to acquaint me with the extent of the tragedy that had been worked out in a few crowded hours in a corner of northwestern europe  i searched frantically for telegrams of later dates that would put a better complexion on the matter that would retrieve something from the ruin presently i came across a page of the illustrated supplement that the novoe vremya publishes once a week  there was a photograph of a longfronted building with a flag flying over it labelled the new standard floating over buckingham palace  the picture was not much more than a smudge but the flag possibly touched up was unmistakable  it was the eagle of the nemetskie tsar  i have a vivid recollection of that plainlyfurnished little room with the inevitable gilt ikon in one corner and the samovar hissing and gurgling on the table and the thrumming music of a balalaika orchestra coming up from the restaurant below the next coherent thing i can remember was weeks and weeks later discussing in an impersonal detached manner whether i was strong enough to stand the fatigue of the long railway journey to finland  since then holham i have been encouraged to keep my mind as much off the war and public affairs as possible and i have been glad to do so  i knew the worst and there was no particular use in deepening my despondency by dragging out the details  but now i am more or less a live man again and i want to fill in the gaps in my knowledge of what happened  you know how much i know and how little those fragments of russian newspapers were about all the information that i had  i dont even know clearly how the whole thing started  yeovil settled himself back in his chair with the air of a man who has done some necessary talking and now assumes the role of listener  it started said the doctor with a wholly unimportant disagreement about some frontier business in east africa there was a slight attack of nerves in the stock markets and then the whole thing seemed in a fair way towards being settled  then the negotiations over the affair began to drag unduly and there was a further flutter of nervousness in the money world  and then one morning the papers reported a highly menacing speech by one of the german ministers and the situation began to look black indeed  he will be disavowed every one said over here but in less than twentyfour hours those who knew anything knew that the crisis was on usonly their knowledge came too late  war between two such civilised and enlightened nations is an impossibility one of our leaders of public opinion had declared on the saturday by the following friday the war had indeed become an impossibility because we could no longer carry it on  it burst on us with calculated suddenness and we were just not enough everywhere where the pressure came  our ships were good against their ships our seamen were better than their seamen but our ships were not able to cope with their ships plus their superiority in aircraft  our trained men were good against their trained men but they could not be in several places at once and the enemy could  our halftrained men and our untrained men could not master the science of war at a moments notice and a moments notice was all they got  the enemy were a nation apprenticed in arms we were not even the idle apprentice we had not deemed apprenticeship worth our while  there was courage enough running loose in the land but it was like unharnessed electricity it controlled no forces it struck no blows  there was no time for the heroism and the devotion which a drawnout struggle however hopeless can produce the war was over almost as soon as it had begun after the reverses which happened with lightning rapidity in the first three days of warfare the newspapers made no effort to pretend that the situation could be retrieved editors and public alike recognised that these were blows over the heart and that it was a matter of moments before we were counted out  one might liken the whole affair to a snap checkmate early in a game of chess one side had thought out the moves and brought the requisite pieces into play the other side was hampered and helpless with its resources unavailable its strategy discounted in advance  that in a nutshell is the history of the war  yeovil was silent for a moment or two then he asked  and the sequel the peace  the collapse was so complete that i fancy even the enemy were hardly prepared for the consequences of their victory  no one had quite realised what one disastrous campaign would mean for an island nation with a closely packed population  the conquerors were in a position to dictate what terms they pleased and it was not wonderful that their ideas of aggrandisement expanded in the hour of intoxication  there was no european combination ready to say them nay and certainly no one power was going to be rash enough to step in to contest the terms of the treaty that they imposed on the conquered  annexation had probably never been a dream before the war after the war it suddenly became temptingly practical  warum nicht became the theme of leaderwriters in the german press they pointed out that britain defeated and humiliated but with enormous powers of recuperation would be a dangerous and inevitable enemy for the germany of tomorrow while britain incorporated within the hohenzollern empire would merely be a disaffected province without a navy to make its disaffection a serious menace and with great taxpaying capabilities which would be available for relieving the burdens of the other imperial states  wherefore why not annex  the warum nicht party prevailed  our king as you know retired with his court to delhi as emperor in the east with most of his overseas dominions still subject to his sway  the british isles came under the german crown as a reichsland a sort of alsacelorraine washed by the north sea instead of the rhine we still retain our parliament but it is a clipped and pruneddown shadow of its former self with most of its functions in abeyance when the elections were held it was difficult to get decent candidates to come forward or to get people to vote  it makes one smile bitterly to think that a year or two ago we were seriously squabbling as to who should have votes  and of course the old party divisions have more or less crumbled away  the liberals naturally are under the blackest of clouds for having steered the country to disaster though to do them justice it was no more their fault than the fault of any other party  in a democracy such as ours was the government of the day must more or less reflect the ideas and temperament of the nation in all vital matters and the british nation in those days could not have been persuaded of the urgent need for military apprenticeship or of the deadly nature of its danger  it was willing now and then to be halffrightened and to have halfmeasures or one might better say quartermeasures taken to reassure it and the governments of the day were willing to take them but any political party or group of statesmen that had said the danger is enormous and immediate the sacrifices and burdens must be enormous and immediate would have met with certain defeat at the polls  still of course the liberals as the party that had held office for nearly a decade incurred the odium of a people maddened by defeat and humiliation one minister who had had less responsibility for military organisation than perhaps any of them was attacked and nearly killed at newcastle another was hiding for three days on exmoor and escaped in disguise  and the conservatives  they are also under eclipse but it is more or less voluntary in their case  for generations they had taken their stand as supporters of throne and constitution and when they suddenly found the constitution gone and the throne filled by an alien dynasty their political orientation had vanished  they are in much the same position as the jacobites occupied after the hanoverian accession  many of the leading tory families have emigrated to the british lands beyond the seas others are shut up in their country houses retrenching their expenses selling their acres and investing their money abroad  the labour faction again are almost in as bad odour as the liberals because of having hobnobbed too effusively and ostentatiously with the german democratic parties on the eve of the war exploiting an evangel of universal brotherhood which did not blunt a single teuton bayonet when the hour came  i suppose in time party divisions will reassert themselves in some form or other there will be a socialist party and the mercantile and manufacturing interests will evolve a sort of bourgeoise party and the different religious bodies will try to get themselves represented  yeovil made a movement of impatience  all these things that you forecast he said must take time considerable time is this nightmare then to go on for ever  it is not a nightmare unfortunately said the doctor it is a reality  but surelya nation such as ours a virile highlycivilised nation with an agelong tradition of mastery behind it cannot be held under for ever by a few thousand bayonets and machine guns  we must surely rise up one day and drive them out  dear man said the doctor we might of course at some given moment overpower the garrison that is maintained here and seize the forts and perhaps we might be able to mine the harbours what then  in a fortnight or so we could be starved into unconditional submission  remember all the advantages of isolated position that told in our favour while we had the sea dominion tell against us now that the sea dominion is in other hands  the enemy would not need to mobilise a single army corps or to bring a single battleship into action a fleet of nimble cruisers and destroyers circling round our coasts would be sufficient to shut out our food supplies  are you trying to tell me that this is a final overthrow said yeovil in a shaking voice are we to remain a subject race like the poles  let us hope for a better fate said the doctor  our opportunity may come if the master power is ever involved in an unsuccessful naval war with some other nation or perhaps in some time of european crisis when everything hung in the balance our latent hostility might have to be squared by a concession of independence  that is what we have to hope for and watch for  on the other hand the conquerors have to count on time and tact to weaken and finally obliterate the old feelings of nationality the middleaged of today will grow old and acquiescent in the changed state of things the young generations will grow up never having known anything different  its a far cry to delhi as the old indian proverb says and the strange halfeuropean halfasiatic court out there will seem more and more a thing exotic and unreal  the king across the water was a rallyingcry once upon a time in our history but a king on the further side of the indian ocean is a shadowy competitor for one who alternates between potsdam and windsor  i want you to tell me everything said yeovil after another pause tell me holham how far has this obliterating process of time and tact gone  it seems to be pretty fairly started already  i bought a newspaper as soon as i landed and i read it in the train coming up  i read things that puzzled and disgusted me  there were announcements of concerts and plays and firstnights and private views there were even small dances  there were advertisements of houseboats and weekend cottages and string bands for garden parties  it struck me that it was rather like merrymaking with a dead body lying in the house  yeovil said the doctor you must bear in mind two things  first the necessity for the life of the country going on as if nothing had happened  it is true that many thousands of our working men and women have emigrated and thousands of our upper and middle class too they were the people who were not tied down by business or who could afford to cut those ties  but those represent comparatively a few out of the many  the great businesses and the small businesses must go on people must be fed and clothed and housed and medically treated and their thousandandone wants and necessities supplied  look at me for instance however much i loathe coming under a foreign domination and paying taxes to an alien government i cant abandon my practice and my patients and set up anew in toronto or allahabad and if i could some other doctor would have to take my place here  i or that other doctor must have our servants and motors and food and furniture and newspapers even our sport  the golf links and the hunting field have been wellnigh deserted since the war but they are beginning to get back their votaries because outdoor sport has become a necessity and a very rational necessity with numbers of men who have to work otherwise under unnatural and exacting conditions that is one factor of the situation  the other affects london more especially but through london it influences the rest of the country to a certain extent  you will see around you here much that will strike you as indications of heartless indifference to the calamity that has befallen our nation  well you must remember that many things in modern life especially in the big cities are not national but international in the world of music and art and the drama for instance the foreign names are legion they confront you at every turn and some of our british devotees of such arts are more acclimatised to the ways of munich or moscow than they are familiar with the life say of stirling or york for years they have lived and thought and spoken in an atmosphere and jargon of denationalised cultureeven those of them who have never left our shores  they would take pains to be intimately familiar with the domestic affairs and views of life of some galician gipsy dramatist and gravely quote and discuss his opinions on debts and mistresses and cookery while they would shudder at dye ken john peel as a piece of uncouth barbarity  you cannot expect a world of that sort to be permanently concerned or downcast because the crown of charlemagne takes its place now on the top of the royal box in the theatres or at the head of programmes at state concerts  and then there are the jews  there are many in the land or at least in london said yeovil  there are even more of them now than there used to be said holham  i am to a great extent a disliker of jews myself but i will be fair to them and admit that those of them who were in any genuine sense british have remained british and have stuck by us loyally in our misfortune all honour to them  but of the others the men who by temperament and everything else were far more teuton or polish or latin than they were british it was not to be expected that they would be heartbroken because london had suddenly lost its place among the political capitals of the world and became a cosmopolitan city  they had appreciated the free and easy liberty of the old days under british rule but there was a stiff insularity in the ruling race that they chafed against  now putting aside some petty government restrictions that teutonic bureaucracy has brought in there is really in their eyes more licence and social adaptability in london than before  it has taken on some of the aspects of a nomansland and the jew if he likes may almost consider himself as of the dominant race at any rate he is ubiquitous  pleasure of the cafe and cabaret and boulevard kind the sort of thing that gave berlin the aspect of the gayest capital in europe within the last decade that is the insidious leaven that will help to denationalise london  berlin will probably climb back to some of its old austerity and simplicity a worldruling city with a great sense of its position and its responsibilities while london will become more and more the centre of what these people understand by life  yeovil made a movement of impatience and disgust  i know i know said the doctor sympathetically life and enjoyment mean to you the howl of a wolf in a forest the call of a wild swan on the frozen tundras the smell of a wood fire in some little inn among the mountains  there is more music to you in the quick thud thud of hoofs on desert mud as a freestepping horse is led up to your tent door than in all the dronings and flourishes that a highlypaid orchestra can reel out to an expensively fed audience  but the tastes of modern london as we see them crystallised around us lie in a very different direction people of the world that i am speaking of our dominant world at the present moment herd together as closely packed to the square yard as possible doing nothing worth doing and saying nothing worth saying but doing it and saying it over and over again listening to the same melodies watching the same artistes echoing the same catchwords ordering the same dishes in the same restaurants suffering each others cigarette smoke and perfumes and conversation feverishly anxiously making arrangements to meet each other again tomorrow next week and the week after next and repeat the same gregarious experience  if they were not herded together in a corner of western london watching each other with restless intelligent eyes they would be herded together at brighton or dieppe doing the same thing  well you will find that life of that sort goes forward just as usual only it is even more prominent and noticeable now because there is less public life of other kinds  yeovil said something which was possibly the buriat word for the nether world  outside in the neighbouring square a band had been playing at intervals during the evening  now it struck up an air that yeovil had already heard whistled several times since his landing an air with a captivating suggestion of slyness and furtive joyousness running through it  he rose and walked across to the window opening it a little wider  he listened till the last notes had died away  what is that tune they have just played he asked  youll hear it often enough said the doctor  a frenchman writing in the matin the other day called it the national anthem of the fait accompli     chapter iv es ist verboten   yeovil wakened next morning to the pleasant sensation of being in a household where elaborate machinery for the smooth achievement of ones daily life was noiselessly and unceasingly at work  fever and the long weariness of convalescence in indifferently comfortable surroundings had given luxury a new value in his eyes  money had not always been plentiful with him in his younger days in his twentyeighth year he had inherited a fairly substantial fortune and he had married a wealthy woman a few months later  it was characteristic of the man and his breed that the chief use to which he had put his newlyacquired wealth had been in seizing the opportunity which it gave him for indulging in unlimited travel in wild outoftheway regions where the comforts of life were meagrely represented  cicely occasionally accompanied him to the threshold of his expeditions such as cairo or st petersburg or constantinople but her own tastes in the matter of roving were more or less condensed within an area that comprised cannes homburg the scottish highlands and the norwegian fiords  things outlandish and barbaric appealed to her chiefly when presented under artistic but highly civilised stage management on the boards of covent garden and if she wanted to look at wolves or sand grouse she preferred doing so in the company of an intelligent fellow of the zoological society on some fine sunday afternoon in regents park  it was one of the bonds of union and goodfellowship between her husband and herself that each understood and sympathised with the others tastes without in the least wanting to share them they went their own ways and were pleased and comradelike when the ways happened to run together for a span without selfreproach or heart searching when the ways diverged  moreover they had separate and adequate banking accounts which constitute if not the keys of the matrimonial heaven at least the oil that lubricates them  yeovil found cicely and breakfast waiting for him in the cool breakfast room and enjoyed with the appreciation of a recent invalid the comfort and resources of a meal that had not to be ordered or thought about in advance but seemed as though it were there foreordained from the beginning of time in its smallest detail  each desire of the breakfasting mind seemed to have its realisation in some dish lurking unobtrusively in hidden corners until asked for  did one want grilled mushrooms english fashion they were there black and moist and sizzling and extremely edible did one desire mushrooms a la russe they appeared blanched and cool and toothsome under their white blanketing of sauce  at ones bidding was a service of coffee prepared with rather more forethought and circumspection than would go to the preparation of a revolution in a south american republic  the exotic blooms that reigned in profusion over the other parts of the house were scrupulously banished from the breakfastroom bowls of wild thyme and other flowering weeds of the meadow and hedgerow gave it an atmosphere of country freshness that was in keeping with the morning meal  you look dreadfully tired still said cicely critically otherwise i would recommend a ride in the park before it gets too hot  there is a new cob in the stable that you will just love but he is rather lively and you had better content yourself for the present with some more sedate exercise than he is likely to give you  he is apt to try and jump out of his skin when the flies tease him  the park is rather jolly for a walk just now  i think that will be about my form after my long journey said yeovil an hours stroll before lunch under the trees  that ought not to fatigue me unduly  in the afternoon ill look up one or two people  dont count on finding too many of your old set said cicely rather hurriedly  i dare say some of them will find their way back some time but at present theres been rather an exodus  the bredes said yeovil are they here  no the bredes are in scotland at their place in sutherlandshire they dont come south now and the ricardes are farming somewhere in east africa the whole lot of them  valham has got an appointment of some sort in the straits settlement and has taken his family with him  the collards are down at their mothers place in norfolk a german banker has bought their house in manchester square  and the hebways asked yeovil  dick hebway is in india said cicely but his mother lives in paris poor hugo you know was killed in the war  my friends the allinsons are in paris too  its rather a clearance isnt it  however there are some left and i expect others will come back in time  pitherby is here hes one of those who are trying to make the best of things under the new regime  he would be said yeovil shortly  its a difficult question said cicely whether one should stay at home and face the music or go away and live a transplanted life under the british flag  either attitude might be dictated by patriotism  it is one thing to face the music it is another thing to dance to it said yeovil  cicely poured out some more coffee for herself and changed the conversation  youll be in to lunch i suppose  the clubs are not very attractive just now i believe and the restaurants are mostly hot in the middle of the day  ronnie storre is coming in hes here pretty often these days a rather goodlooking young animal with something midway between talent and genius in the pianoplaying line  not longhaired and semetic or tcheque or anything of that sort i suppose asked yeovil  cicely laughed at the vision of ronnie conjured up by her husbands words  no beautifully groomed and clipped and anglosaxon  i expect youll like him  he plays bridge almost as well as he plays the piano  i suppose you wonder at any one who can play bridge well wanting to play the piano  im not quite so intolerant as all that said yeovil anyhow i promise to like ronnie  is any one else coming to lunch  joan mardle will probably drop in in fact im afraid shes a certainty she invited herself in that way of hers that brooks of no refusal  on the other hand as a mitigating circumstance there will be a point dasperge omelette such as few kitchens could turn out so dont be late  yeovil set out for his morning walk with the curious sensation of one who starts on a voyage of discovery in a land that is well known to him  he turned into the park at hyde park corner and made his way along the familiar paths and alleys that bordered the row  the familiarity vanished when he left the region of fencedin lawns and rhododendron bushes and came to the open space that stretched away beyond the bandstand  the bandstand was still there and a military band in sky blue saxon uniform was executing the first item in the forenoon programme of music  around it instead of the serried rows of green chairs that yeovil remembered was spread out an acre or so of small round tables most of which had their quota of customers engaged in a steady consumption of lager beer coffee lemonade and syrups  further in the background but well within earshot of the band a gaily painted pagodarestaurant sheltered a number of more commodious tables under its awnings and gave a hint of convenient indoor accommodation for wet or windy weather  movable screens of trellistrained foliage and climbing roses formed little hedges by means of which any particular table could be shut off from its neighbours if semiprivacy were desired  one or two decorative advertisements of popularised brands of champagne and rhine wines adorned the outside walls of the building and under the central gable of its upper story was a flamboyant portrait of a sternfaced man whose image and superscription might also be found on the newer coinage of the land  a mass of bunting hung in folds round the flagpole on the gable and blew out now and then on a favouring breeze a long threecoloured strip black white and scarlet and over the whole scene the elm trees towered with an absurd sardonic air of nothing having changed around their roots  yeovil stood for a minute or two taking in every detail of the unfamiliar spectacle  they have certainly accomplished something that we never attempted he muttered to himself  then he turned on his heel and made his way back to the shady walk that ran alongside the row  at first sight little was changed in the aspect of the wellknown exercising ground  one or two riding masters cantered up and down as of yore with their attendant broods of anxiousfaced young girls and awkwardly bumping women pupils while horseylooking men put marketable animals through their paces or drew up to the rails for long conversations with horseylooking friends on foot  sportingly attired young women sitting astride of their horses careered by at intervals as though an extremely game fox were leading hounds a merry chase a short way ahead of them it all seemed much as usual  presently from the middle distance a bright patch of colour set in a whirl of dust drew rapidly nearer and resolved itself into a group of cavalry officers extending their chargers in a smart gallop  they were well mounted and sat their horses to perfection and they made a brave show as they raced past yeovil with a clink and clatter and rhythmic thud thud of hoofs and became once more a patch of colour in a whirl of dust  an answering glow of colour seemed to have burned itself into the grey face of the young man who had seen them pass without appearing to look at them a stinging rush of blood accompanied by a choking catch in the throat and a hot white blindness across the eyes  the weakness of fever broke down at times the rampart of outward indifference that a man of yeovils temperament builds coldly round his heartstrings  the row and its riders had become suddenly detestable to the wanderer he would not run the risk of seeing that insolently joyous cavalcade come galloping past again  beyond a narrow stretch of treeshaded grass lay the placid sunlit water of the serpentine and yeovil made a short cut across the turf to reach its gravelled bank  cant you read either english or german asked a policeman who confronted him as he stepped off the turf  yeovil stared at the man and then turned to look at the small neatlyprinted notice to which the official was imperiously pointing in two languages it was made known that it was forbidden and verboten punishable and straffbar to walk on the grass  three shilling fine said the policeman extending his hand for the money  do i pay you asked yeovil feeling almost inclined to laugh im rather a stranger to the new order of things  you pay me said the policeman and you receive a quittance for the sum paid and he proceeded to tear a counterfoil receipt for a three shilling fine from a small pocket book  may i ask said yeovil as he handed over the sum demanded and received his quittance what the red and white band on your sleeve stands for  bilingual said the constable with an air of importance  preference is given to members of the force who qualify in both languages  nearly all the police engaged on park duty are bilingual  about as many foreigners as english use the parks nowadays in fact on a fine sunday afternoon youll find three foreigners to every two english  the park habit is more continental than british i take it  and are there many germans in the police force asked yeovil  well yes a good few there had to be said the constable there were such a lot of resignations when the change came and they had to be filled up somehow  lots of men what used to be in the force emigrated or found work of some other kind but everybody couldnt take that line wives and children had to be thought of  tisnt every head of a family that can chuck up a job on the chance of finding another  starvations been the lot of a good many what went out  those of us that stayed on got better pay than we did before but then of course the duties are much more multitudinous  they must be said yeovil fingering his three shilling state document by the way he asked are all the grass plots in the park out of bounds for human feet  everywhere where you see the notices said the policeman and thats about threefourths of the whole grass space theres been a lot of new gravel walks opened up in all directions  people dont want to walk on the grass when theyve got clean paths to walk on  and with this parting reproof the bilingual constable strode heavily away his loss of consideration and selfesteem as a unit of a sometime ruling race evidently compensated for to some extent by his enhanced importance as an official  the women and children thought yeovil as he looked after the retreating figure yes that is one side of the problem  the children that have to be fed and schooled the women folk that have to be cared for an old mother perhaps in the home that cannot be broken up  the old case of giving hostages  he followed the path alongside the serpentine passing under the archway of the bridge and continuing his walk into kensington gardens  in another moment he was within view of the peter pan statue and at once observed that it had companions  on one side was a group representing a scene from one of the grimm fairy stories on the other was alice in conversation with gryphon and mockturtle the episode looking distressingly stiff and meaningless in its sculptured form  two other spaces had been cleared in the neighbouring turf evidently for the reception of further statue groups which yeovil mentally assigned to struwelpeter and little lord fauntleroy  german middleclass taste he commented but in this matter we certainly gave them a lead  i suppose the idea is that childish fancy is dead and that it is only decent to erect some sort of memorial to it  the day was growing hotter and the park had ceased to seem a desirable place to loiter in  yeovil turned his steps homeward passing on his way the bandstand with its surrounding acreage of tables  it was now nearly one oclock and luncheon parties were beginning to assemble under the awnings of the restaurant  lighter refreshments in the shape of sausages and potato salads were being carried out by scurrying waiters to the drinkers of lager beer at the small tables  a park orchestra in brilliant trappings had taken the place of the military band  as yeovil passed the musicians launched out into the tune which the doctor had truly predicted he would hear to repletion before he had been many days in london the national anthem of the fait accompli     chapter v lart detre cousine   joan mardle had reached forty in the leisurely untroubled fashion of a woman who intends to be comely and attractive at fifty  she cultivated a jovial almost joyous manner with a topdressing of hearty good will and good nature which disarmed strangers and recent acquaintances on getting to know her better they hastily rearmed themselves  some one had once aptly described her as a hedgehog with the protective mimicry of a puffball  if there was an awkward remark to be made at an inconvenient moment before undesired listeners joan invariably made it and when the occasion did not present itself she was usually capable of creating it she was not without a certain popularity the sort of popularity that a dashing highwayman sometimes achieved among those who were not in the habit of travelling on his particular highway  a greataunt on her mothers side of the family had married so often that joan imagined herself justified in claiming cousinship with a large circle of disconnected houses and treating them all on a relationship footing which theoretical kinship enabled her to exact luncheons and other accommodations under the plea of keeping the lamp of family life aglow  i felt i simply had to come today she chuckled at yeovil i was just dying to see the returned traveller  of course i know perfectly well that neither of you want me when you havent seen each other for so long and must have heaps and heaps to say to one another but i thought i would risk the odium of being the third person on an occasion when two are company and three are a nuisance  wasnt it brave of me  she spoke in full knowledge of the fact that the luncheon party would not in any case have been restricted to yeovil and his wife having seen ronnie arrive in the hall as she was being shown upstairs  ronnie storre is coming i believe said cicely so youre not breaking into a teteatete  ronnie oh i dont count him said joan gaily hes just a boy who looks nice and eats asparagus  i hear hes getting to play the piano really well  such a pity  he will grow fat musicians always do and it will ruin him  i speak feelingly because im gravitating towards plumpness myself  the divine architect turns us out fearfully and wonderfully built and the result is charming to the eye and then he adds another chin and two or three extra inches round the waist and the effect is ruined  fortunately you can always find another ronnie when this one grows fat and uninteresting the supply of boys who look nice and eat asparagus is unlimited  hullo mr storre we were all talking about you  nothing very damaging i hope said ronnie who had just entered the room  no we were merely deciding that whatever you may do with your life your chin must remain single  when ones chin begins to lead a double life ones own opportunities for depravity are insensibly narrowed  you neednt tell me that you havent any hankerings after depravity people with your coloured eyes and hair are always depraved  let me introduce you to my husband ronnie said cicely and then lets go and begin lunch  you two must almost feel as if you were honeymooning again said joan as they sat down you must have quite forgotten each others tastes and peculiarities since you last met  old emily fronding was talking about you yesterday when i mentioned that murrey was expected home curious sort of marriage tie she said in that stupid staring way of hers when husband and wife spend most of their time in different continents i dont call it marriage at all  nonsense i said its the best way of doing things  the yeovils will be a united and devoted couple long after heaps of their married contemporaries have trundled through the divorce court  i forgot at the moment that her youngest girl had divorced her husband last year and that her second girl is rumoured to be contemplating a similar step  one cant remember everything  joan mardle was remarkable for being able to remember the smallest details in the family lives of two or three hundred acquaintances  from personal matters she went with a bound to the political small talk of the moment  the official declaration as to the house of lords is out at last she said i bought a paper just before coming here but i left it in the tube  all existing titles are to lapse if three successive holders including the present ones fail to take the oath of allegiance  have any taken it up to the present asked yeovil  only about nineteen so far and none of them representing very leading families of course others will come in gradually as the change of dynasty becomes more and more an accepted fact and of course there will be lots of new creations to fill up the gaps  i hear for certain that pitherby is to get a title of some sort in recognition of his literary labours  he has written a short history of the house of hohenzollern for use in schools you know and hes bringing out a popular life of frederick the greatat least he hopes it will be popular  i didnt know that writing was much in his line said yeovil beyond the occasional editing of a company prospectus  i understand his historical researches have given every satisfaction in exalted quarters said joan something may be lacking in the style perhaps but the august approval can make good that defect with the style of baron  pitherby has such a kind heart kind hearts are more than coronets we all know but the two go quite well together  and the dear man is not content with his services to literature hes blossoming forth as a liberal patron of the arts  hes taken quite a lot of tickets for dear gorlas debut half the second row of the dresscircle  do you mean gorla mustelford asked yeovil catching at the name what on earth is she having a debut about  what cried joan in loudvoiced amazement havent you heard  hasnt cicely told you  how funny that you shouldnt have heard  why its going to be one of the events of the season  everybodys talking about it  shes going to do suggestion dancing at the caravansery theatre  good heavens what is suggestion dancing asked yeovil  oh something quite new explained joan at any rate the name is quite new and gorla is new as far as the public are concerned and that is enough to establish the novelty of the thing  among other things she does a dance suggesting the life of a fern i saw one of the rehearsals and to me it would have equally well suggested the life of john wesley however that is probably the fault of my imaginationive either got too much or too little  anyhow it is an understood thing that she is to take london by storm  when i last saw gorla mustelford observed yeovil she was a rather serious flapper who thought the world was in urgent need of regeneration and was not certain whether she would regenerate it or take up miniature painting  i forget which she attempted ultimately  she is quite serious about her art put in cicely shes studied a good deal abroad and worked hard at mastering the technique of her profession  shes not a mere amateur with a hankering after the footlights  i fancy she will do well  but what do her people say about it asked yeovil  oh theyre simply furious about it answered joan the idea of a daughter of the house of mustelford prancing and twisting about the stage for prussian officers and hamburg jews to gaze at is a dreadful cup of humiliation for them  its unfortunate of course that they should feel so acutely about it but still one can understand their point of view  i dont see what other point of view they could possibly take said yeovil sharply if gorla thinks that the necessities of art or her own inclinations demand that she should dance in public why cant she do it in paris or even vienna  anywhere would be better one would think than in london under present conditions  he had given joan the indication that she was looking for as to his attitude towards the fait accompli  without asking a question she had discovered that husband and wife were divided on the fundamental issue that underlay all others at the present moment  cicely was weaving social schemes for the future yeovil had come home in a frame of mind that threatened the destruction of those schemes or at any rate a serious hindrance to their execution  the situation presented itself to joans mind with an alluring piquancy  you are giving a grand supperparty for gorla on the night of her debut arent you she asked cicely several people spoke to me about it so i suppose it must be true  tony luton and young storre had taken care to spread the news of the projected supper function in order to ensure against a change of plans on cicelys part  gorla is a great friend of mine said cicely trying to talk as if the conversation had taken a perfectly indifferent turn also i think she deserves a little encouragement after the hard work she has been through i thought it would be doing her a kindness to arrange a supper party for her on her first night  there was a moments silence  yeovil said nothing and joan understood the value of being occasionally tonguetied  the whole question is continued cicely as the silence became oppressive whether one is to mope and hold aloof from the national life or take our share in it the life has got to go on whether we participate in it or not  it seems to me to be more patriotic to come down into the dust of the marketplace than to withdraw oneself behind walls or beyond the seas  of course the industrial life of the country has to go on said yeovil no one could criticise gorla if she interested herself in organising cottage industries or anything of that sort in which she would be helping her own people  that one could understand but i dont think a cosmopolitan concern like the musichall business calls for personal sacrifices from young women of good family at a moment like the present  it is just at a moment like the present that the people want something to interest them and take them out of themselves said cicely argumentatively what has happened has happened and we cant undo it or escape the consequences  what we can do or attempt to do is to make things less dreary and make people less unhappy  in a word more contented said yeovil if i were a german statesman that is the end i would labour for and encourage others to labour for to make the people forget that they were discontented  all this work of regalvanising the social side of london life may be summed up in the phrase travailler pour le roi de prusse  i dont think there is any use in discussing the matter further said cicely  i can see that grand supperparty not coming off said joan provocatively  ronnie looked anxiously at cicely  you can see it coming on if youre gifted with prophetic vision of a reliable kind said cicely of course as murrey doesnt take kindly to the idea of gorlas enterprise i wont have the party here  ill give it at a restaurant thats all  i can see murreys point of view and sympathise with it but im not going to throw gorla over  there was another pause of uncomfortably protracted duration  i say this is a tophole omelette said ronnie  it was his only contribution to the conversation but it was a valuable one     chapter vi herr von kwarl   herr von kwarl sat at his favourite table in the brandenburg cafe the new building that made such an imposing show and did such thriving business at the lower end of what most of its patrons called the regentstrasse  though the establishment was new it had already achieved its unwritten code of customs and the sanctity of herr von kwarls specially reserved table had acquired the authority of a tradition  a set of chessmen a copy of the kreuz zeitung and the times and a slim necked bottle of rhenish wine icecool from the cellar were always to be found there early in the forenoon and the honoured guest for whom these preparations were made usually arrived on the scene shortly after eleven oclock  for an hour or so he would read and silently digest the contents of his two newspapers and then at the first sign of flagging interest on his part another of the cafes regular customers would march across the floor exchange a word or two on the affairs of the day and be bidden with a wave of the hand into the opposite seat  a waiter would instantly place the chessboard with its marshalled ranks of combatants in the required position and the contest would begin  herr von kwarl was a heavily built man of mature middleage of the blond northgerman type with a facial aspect that suggested stupidity and brutality  the stupidity of his mien masked an ability and shrewdness that was distinctly above the average and the suggestion of brutality was belied by the fact that von kwarl was as kindhearted a man as one could meet with in a days journey  early in life almost before he was in his teens fritz von kwarl had made up his mind to accept the world as it was and to that philosophical resolution steadfastly adhered to he attributed his excellent digestion and his unruffled happiness  perhaps he confused cause and effect the excellent digestion may have been responsible for at least some of the philosophical serenity  he was a bachelor of the type that is called confirmed and which might better be labelled consecrated from his early youth onward to his present age he had never had the faintest flickering intention of marriage  children and animals he adored women and plants he accounted somewhat of a nuisance  a world without women and roses and asparagus would he admitted be robbed of much of its charm but with all their charm these things were tiresome and thorny and capricious always wanting to climb or creep in places where they were not wanted and resolutely drooping and fading away when they were desired to flourish animals on the other hand accepted the world as it was and made the best of it and children at least nice children uncontaminated by grown up influences lived in worlds of their own making  von kwarl held no acknowledged official position in the country of his residence but it was an open secret that those responsible for the real direction of affairs sought his counsel on nearly every step that they meditated and that his counsel was very rarely disregarded  some of the shrewdest and most successful enactments of the ruling power were believed to have originated in the braincells of the bovinefronted stammgast of the brandenburg cafe  around the woodpanelled walls of the cafe were set at intervals well mounted heads of boar elk stag roebuck and other gamebeasts of a northern forest while in between were carved armorial escutcheons of the principal cities of the lately expanded realm magdeburg manchester hamburg bremen bristol and so forth  below these came shelves on which stood a wonderful array of stone beermugs each decorated with some fantastic device or motto and most of them pertaining individually and sacredly to some regular and unfailing customer  in one particular corner of the highest shelf greatly at his ease and in nowise to be disturbed slept wotan the huge grey housecat dreaming doubtless of certain nimble and audacious mice down in the cellar three floors below whose nimbleness and audacity were as precious to him as the forwardness of the birds is to a skilled gun on a grouse moor  once every day wotan came marching in stately fashion across the polished floor halted mid way to resume an unfinished toilet operation and then proceeded to pay his leisurely respects to his friend von kwarl  the latter was said to be prouder of this daily demonstration of esteem than of his many coveted orders of merit  several of his friends and acquaintances shared with him the distinction of having achieved the black eagle but not one of them had ever succeeded in obtaining the slightest recognition of their existence from wotan  the daily greeting had been exchanged and the proud grey beast had marched away to the music of a slumberous purr  the kreuz zeitung and the times underwent a final scrutiny and were pushed aside and von kwarl glanced aimlessly out at the july sunshine bathing the walls and windows of the piccadilly hotel  herr rebinok the plump little pomeranian banker stepped across the floor almost as noiselessly as wotan had done though with considerably less grace and some halfminute later was engaged in sliding pawns and knights and bishops to and fro on the chess board in a series of lightning moves bewildering to look on  neither he nor his opponent played with the skill that they severally brought to bear on banking and statecraft nor did they conduct their game with the politeness that they punctiliously observed in other affairs of life  a running fire of contemptuous remarks and aggressive satire accompanied each move and the mere record of the conversation would have given an uninitiated onlooker the puzzling impression that an easy and crushing victory was assured to both the players  aha he is puzzled  poor man he doesnt know what to do     oho he thinks he will move there does he  much good that will do him    never have i seen such a mess as he is in    he cannot do anything he is absolutely helpless helpless  ah you take my bishop do you  much i care for that  nothing  see i give you check  ah now he is in a fright  he doesnt know where to go what a mess he is in      so the game proceeded with a brisk exchange of pieces and incivilities and a fluctuation of fortunes till the little banker lost his queen as the result of an incautious move and after several woebegone contortions of his shoulders and hands declined further contest  a sleekheaded piccolo rushed forward to remove the board and the erstwhile combatants resumed the courteous dignity that they discarded in their chessplaying moments  have you seen the germania today asked herr rebinok as soon as the boy had receded to a respectful distance  no said von kwarl i never see the germania  i count on you to tell me if there is anything noteworthy in it  it has an article today headed occupation or assimilation said the banker  it is of some importance and well written  it is very pessimistic  catholic papers are always pessimistic about the things of this world said von kwarl just as they are unduly optimistic about the things of the next world  what line does it take  it says that our conquest of britain can only result in a temporary occupation with a notice to quit always hanging over our heads that we can never hope to assimilate the people of these islands in our empire as a sort of maritime saxony or bavaria all the teaching of history is against it saxony and bavaria are part of the empire because of their past history  england is being bound into the empire in spite of her past history and so forth  the writer of the article has not studied history very deeply said von kwarl  the impossible thing that he speaks of has been done before and done in these very islands too  the norman conquest became an assimilation in comparatively few generations  ah in those days yes said the banker but the conditions were altogether different  there was not the rapid transmission of news and the means of keeping the public mind instructed in what was happening in fact one can scarcely say that the public mind was there to instruct there was not the same strong bond of brotherhood between men of the same nation that exists now  northumberland was almost as foreign to devon or kent as normandy was  and the church in those days was a great international factor and the crusades bound men together fighting under one leader for a common cause  also there was not a great national past to be forgotten as there is in this case  there are many factors certainly that are against us conceded the statesman but you must also take into account those that will help us in most cases in recent history where the conquered have stood out against all attempts at assimilation there has been a religious difference to add to the racial onetake poland for instance and the catholic parts of ireland  if the bretons ever seriously begin to assert their nationality as against the french it will be because they have remained more catholic in practice and sentiment than their neighbours here there is no such complication we are in the bulk a protestant nation with a catholic minority and the same may be said of the british then in modern days there is the alchemy of sport and the drama to bring men of different races amicably together  one or two sportsmanlike germans in a london football team will do more to break down racial antagonism than anything that governments or councils can effect  as for the stage it has long been international in its tendencies  you can see that every day  the banker nodded his head  london is not our greatest difficulty continued von kwarl  you must remember the steady influx of germans since the war whole districts are changing the complexion of their inhabitants and in some streets you might almost fancy yourself in a german town  we can scarcely hope to make much impression on the country districts and the provincial towns at present but you must remember that thousands and thousands of the more virile and restlesssouled men have emigrated and thousands more will follow their example  we shall fill up their places with our own surplus population as the teuton races colonised england in the old prechristian days  that is better is it not to people the fat meadows of the thames valley and the healthy downs and uplands of sussex and berkshire than to go hunting for elbowroom among the flies and fevers of the tropics  we have somewhere to go to now better than the scrub and the veldt and the thornjungles  of course of course assented herr rebinok but while this desirable process of infiltration and assimilation goes on how are you going to provide against the hostility of the conquered nation  a people with a great tradition behind them and the ruling instinct strongly developed wont sit with their eyes closed and their hands folded while you carry on the process of germanisation  what will keep them quiet  the hopelessness of the situation  for centuries britain has ruled the seas and been able to dictate to half the world in consequence then she let slip the mastery of the seas as something too costly and onerous to keep up something which aroused too much jealousy and uneasiness in others and now the seas rule her  every wave that breaks on her shore rattles the keys of her prison  i am no fireeater herr rebinok but i confess that when i am at dover say or southampton and see those dark blots on the sea and those grey specks in the sky our battleships and cruisers and aircraft and realise what they mean to us my heart beats just a little quicker  if every german was flung out of england tomorrow in three weeks time we should be coming in again on our own terms  with our sea scouts and air scouts spread in organised network around not a shipload of foodstuff could reach the country  they know that they can calculate how many days of independence and starvation they could endure and they will make no attempt to bring about such a certain fiasco  brave men fight for a forlorn hope but the bravest do not fight for an issue they know to be hopeless  that is so said herr rebinok as things are at present they can do nothing from within absolutely nothing  we have weighed all that beforehand  but as the germania points out there is another britain beyond the seas  supposing the court at delhi were to engineer a league  a league  a league with whom interrupted the statesman  russia we can watch and hold  we are rather nearer to its western frontier than delhi is and we could throttle its baltic trade at five hours notice france and holland are not inclined to provoke our hostility they would have everything to lose by such a course  there are other forces in the world that might be arrayed against us argued the banker the united states japan italy they all have navies  does the teaching of history show you that it is the strong power armed and ready that has to suffer from the hostility of the world asked von kwarl  as far as sentiment goes perhaps but not in practice  the danger has always been for the weak dismembered nation  think you a moment has the enfeebled scattered british empire overseas no undefended territories that are a temptation to her neighbours  has japan nothing to glean where we have harvested  are there no north american possessions which might slip into other keeping  has russia herself no traditional temptations beyond the oxus  mind you we are not making the mistake napoleon made when he forced all europe to be for him or against him  we threaten no world aggressions we are satiated where he was insatiable  we have cast down one overshadowing power from the face of the world because it stood in our way but we have made no attempt to spread our branches over all the space that it covered  we have not tried to set up a tributary canadian republic or to partition south africa we have dreamed no dream of making ourselves lords of hindostan on the contrary we have given proof of our friendly intentions towards our neighbours  we backed france up the other day in her squabble with spain over the moroccan boundaries and proclaimed our opinion that the republic had as indisputable a mission on the north africa coast as we have in the north sea  that is not the action or the language of aggression  no continued von kwarl after a moments silence the world may fear us and dislike us but for the present at any rate there will be no leagues against us  no there is one rock on which our attempt at assimilation will founder or find firm anchorage  and that is  the youth of the country the generation that is at the threshold now it is them that we must capture  we must teach them to learn and coax them to forget  in course of time anglosaxon may blend with german as the elbe saxons and the bavarians and swabians have blended with the prussians into a loyal united people under the sceptre of the hohenzollerns  then we should be doubly strong rome and carthage rolled into one an empire of the west greater than charlemagne ever knew  then we could look slav and latin and asiatic in the face and keep our place as the central dominant force of the civilised world  the speaker paused for a moment and drank a deep draught of wine as though he were invoking the prosperity of that future worldpower  then he resumed in a more level tone  on the other hand the younger generation of britons may grow up in hereditary hatred repulsing all our overtures forgetting nothing and forgiving nothing waiting and watching for the time when some weakness assails us when some crisis entangles us when we cannot be everywhere at once  then our work will be imperilled perhaps undone  there lies the danger there lies the hope the younger generation  there is another danger said the banker after he had pondered over von kwarls remarks for a moment or two amid the incenseclouds of a fat cigar a danger that i foresee in the immediate future perhaps not so much a danger as an element of exasperation which may ultimately defeat your plans  the law as to military service will have to be promulgated shortly and that cannot fail to be bitterly unpopular  the people of these islands will have to be brought into line with the rest of the empire in the matter of military training and military service and how will they like that  will not the enforcing of such a measure enfuriate them against us  remember they have made great sacrifices to avoid the burden of military service  dear god exclaimed herr von kwarl as you say they have made sacrifices on that altar     chapter vii the lure   cicely had successfully insisted on having her own way concerning the projected supperparty yeovil had said nothing further in opposition to it whatever his feelings on the subject might be  having gained her point however she was anxious to give her husband the impression of having been consulted and to put her victory as far as possible on the footing of a compromise  it was also rather a relief to be able to discuss the matter out of range of joans disconcerting tongue and observant eyes  i hope you are not really annoyed about this silly supperparty she said on the morning before the muchtalkedof first night  i had pledged myself to give it so i couldnt back out without seeming mean to gorla and in any case it would have been impolitic to cry off  why impolitic asked yeovil coldly  it would give offence in quarters where i dont want to give offence said cicely  in quarters where the fait accompli is an object of solicitude said yeovil  look here said cicely in her most disarming manner its just as well to be perfectly frank about the whole matter  if one wants to live in the london of the present day one must make up ones mind to accept the fait accompli with as good a grace as possible  i do want to live in london and i dont want to change my way of living and start under different conditions in some other place  i cant face the prospect of tearing up my life by the roots i feel certain that i shouldnt bear transplanting  i cant imagine myself recreating my circle of interests in some foreign town or colonial centre or even in a country town in england  india i couldnt stand  london is not merely a home to me it is a world and it happens to be just the world that suits me and that i am suited to  the german occupation or whatever one likes to call it is a calamity but its not like a molten deluge from vesuvius that need send us all scuttling away from another pompeii  of course she added there are things that jar horribly on one even when one has got more or less accustomed to them but one must just learn to be philosophical and bear them  supposing they are not bearable said yeovil during the few days that ive been in the land ive seen things that i cannot imagine will ever be bearable  that is because theyre new to you said cicely  i dont wish that they should ever come to seem bearable retorted yeovil  ive been bred and reared as a unit of a ruling race i dont want to find myself settling down resignedly as a member of an enslaved one  theres no need to make things out worse than they are protested cicely  weve had a military disaster on a big scale and theres been a great political dislocation in consequence  but theres no reason why everything shouldnt right itself in time as it has done after other similar disasters in the history of nations  we are not scattered to the winds or wiped off the face of the earth we are still an important racial unit  a racial unit in a foreign empire commented yeovil  we may arrive at the position of being the dominant factor in that empire said cicely impressing our national characteristics on it and perhaps dictating its dynastic future and the whole trend of its policy such things have happened in history  or we may become strong enough to throw off the foreign connection at a moment when it can be done effectually and advantageously  but meanwhile it is necessary to preserve our industrial life and our social life and for that reason we must accommodate ourselves to present circumstances however distasteful they may be  emigration to some colonial wilderness or holding ourselves rigidly aloof from the life of the capital wont help matters really murrey if you will think things over a bit you will see that the course i am following is the one dictated by sane patriotism  whom the gods wish to render harmless they first afflict with sanity said yeovil bitterly  you may be content to wait for a hundred years or so for this national revival to creep and crawl us back into a semblance of independence and worldimportance  im afraid i havent the patience or the philosophy to sit down comfortably and wait for a change of fortune that wont come in my timeif it comes at all  cicely changed the drift of the conversation she had only introduced the argument for the purpose of defining her point of view and accustoming yeovil to it as one leads a nervous horse up to an unfamiliar barrier that he is required eventually to jump  in any case she said from the immediately practical standpoint england is the best place for you till you have shaken off all traces of that fever  pass the time away somehow till the hunting begins and then go down to the east wessex country they are looking out for a new master after this season and if you were strong enough you might take it on for a while  you could go to norway for fishing in the summer and hunt the east wessex in the winter  ill come down and do a bit of hunting too and well have houseparties and get a little golf in between whiles  it will be like old times  yeovil looked at his wife and laughed  who was that old fellow who used to hunt his hounds regularly through the fiercest times of the great civil war  there is a picture of him by caton woodville i think leading his pack between king charless army and the parliament forces just as some battle was going to begin  i have often thought that the king must have disliked him rather more than he disliked the men who were in arms against him they at least cared one way or the other  i fancy that old chap would have a great many imitators nowadays though when it came to be a question of sport against soldiering  i dont know whether anyone has said it but one might almost assert that the german victory was won on the golflinks of britain  i dont see why you should saddle one particular form of sport with a special responsibility protested cicely  of course not said yeovil except that it absorbed perhaps more of the energy and attention of the leisured class than other sports did and in this country the leisured class was the only bulwark we had against official indifference  the working classes had a big share of the apathy and indirectly a greater share of the responsibility because the voting power was in their hands  they had not the leisure however to sit down and think clearly what the danger was their own industrial warfare was more real to them than anything that was threatening from the nation that they only knew from samples of german clerks and german waiters  in any case said cicely as regards the hunting there is no civil war or national war raging just now and there is no immediate likelihood of one  a good many hunting seasons will have to come and go before we can think of a war of independence as even a distant possibility and in the meantime hunting and horsebreeding and country sports generally are the things most likely to keep englishmen together on the land  that is why so many men who hate the german occupation are trying to keep field sports alive and in the right hands  however i wont go on arguing you and i always think things out for ourselves and decide for ourselves which is much the best way in the long run  cicely slipped away to her writingroom to make final arrangements over the telephone for the allimportant supperparty leaving yeovil to turn over in his mind the suggestion that she had thrown out  it was an obvious lure a lure to draw him away from the fret and fury that possessed him so inconveniently but its obvious nature did not detract from its effectiveness  yeovil had pleasant recollections of the east wessex a cheery little hunt that afforded good sport in an unpretentious manner a joyous thread of life running through a rather sleepy countryside like a merry brook careering through a placid valley  for a man coming slowly and yet eagerly back to the activities of life from the weariness of a long fever the prospect of a leisurely season with the east wessex was singularly attractive and side by side with its attractiveness there was a tempting argument in favour of yielding to its attractions  among the small squires and yeoman farmers doctors country tradesmen auctioneers and so forth who would gather at the covertside and at the hunt breakfasts there might be a local nucleus of revolt against the enslavement of the land a discouraged and leaderless band waiting for some one to mould their resistance into effective shape and keep their loyalty to the old dynasty and the old national cause steadily burning  yeovil could see himself taking up that position stimulating the spirit of hostility to the fait accompli organising stubborn opposition to every germanising influence that was brought into play schooling the youth of the countryside to look steadily delhiward that was the bait that yeovil threw out to his conscience while slowly considering the other bait that was appealing so strongly to his senses the dry warm scent of the stable the nip of the morning air the pleasant squelchsquelch of the saddle leather the moist earthy fragrance of the autumn woods and wet fallows the cold white mists of winter days the whimper of hounds and the hot restless pushing of the pack through ditch and hedgerow and undergrowth the birds that flew up and clucked and chattered as you passed the hearty greeting and pleasant gossip in farmhouse kitchens and marketday barparloursall these remembered delights of the chase marshalled themselves in the brain and made a cumulative appeal that came with special intensity to a man who was a little tired of his wanderings more than a little drawn away from the jarring centres of life  the hot london sunshine baking the soot grimed walls and the ugly incessant hoot and grunt of the motor traffic gave an added charm to the vision of hill and hollow and copse that flickered in yeovils mind  slowly with a sensuous lingering over detail his imagination carried him down to a small sleepy yet withal pleasantly bustling market town and placed him unerringly in a wide strawlittered yard halffull of men and quarterfull of horses with a bobtailed sheepdog or two trying not to get in everybodys way but insisting on being in the thick of things  the horses gradually detached themselves from the crowd of unimportant men and came one by one into momentary prominence to be discussed and appraised for their good points and bad points and finally to be bid for  and always there was one horse that detached itself conspicuously from the rest the ideal hunter or at any rate yeovils ideal of the ideal hunter  mentally it was put through its paces before him its pedigree and brief history recounted to him mentally he saw a stable lad put it over a jump or two with credit to all concerned and inevitably he saw himself outbidding less discerning rivals and securing the desired piece of horseflesh to be the chief glory and mainstay of his hunting stable to carry him well and truly and cleverly through many a joyous longtoberemembered run  that scene had been one of the recurring halfwaking dreams of his long days of weakness in the faraway finnish nursinghome a dream sometimes of tantalising mockery sometimes of pleasure in the foretaste of a joy to come  and now it need scarcely be a dream any longer he had only to go down at the right moment and take an actual part in his oftrehearsed vision  everything would be there exactly as his imagination had placed it even down to the bobtailed sheepdogs the horse of his imagining would be there waiting for him or if not absolutely the ideal animal something very like it  he might even go beyond the limits of his dream and pick up a couple of desirable animalsthere would probably be fewer purchasers for good class hunters in these days than of yore  and with the coming of this reflection his dream faded suddenly and his mind came back with a throb of pain to the things he had for the moment forgotten the weary hateful things that were symbolised for him by the standard that floated yellow and black over the frontage of buckingham palace  yeovil wandered down to his snuggery a mood of listless dejection possessing him  he fidgetted aimlessly with one or two books and papers filled a pipe and half filled a wastepaper basket with torn circulars and accumulated writingtable litter  then he lit the pipe and settled down in his most comfortable armchair with an old notebook in his hand it was a sort of disjointed diary running fitfully through the winter months of some past years and recording noteworthy days with the east wessex  and over the telephone cicely talked and arranged and consulted with men and women to whom the joys of a good gallop or the love of a stricken fatherland were as letters in an unknown alphabet     chapter viii the firstnight   huge posters outside the caravansery theatre of varieties announced the first performance of the uniquely interesting suggestion dances interpreted by the hon gorla mustelford  an impressionist portrait of a rather severelooking young woman gave the public some idea of what the danseuse might be like in appearance and the further information was added that her performance was the greatest dramatic event of the season yet another piece of information was conveyed to the public a few minutes after the doors had opened in the shape of large notices bearing the brief announcement house full  for the firstnight function most of the seats had been reserved for speciallyinvited guests or else bespoken by those who considered it due to their own importance to be visible on such an occasion  even at the commencement of the ordinary programme of the evening gorla was not due to appear till late in the list the theatre was crowded with a throng of chattering expectant human beings it seemed as though every one had come early to see every one else arrive  as a matter of fact it was the rumourheralded arrival of one personage in particular that had drawn people early to their seats and given a double edge to the expectancy of the moment  at first sight and first hearing the bulk of the audience seemed to comprise representatives of the chief european races in welldistributed proportions but if one gave it closer consideration it could be seen that the distribution was geographically rather than ethnographically diversified  men and women there were from paris munich rome moscow and vienna from sweden and holland and divers other cities and countries but in the majority of cases the jordan valley had supplied their forefathers with a common cradleground  the lack of a fire burning on a national altar seemed to have drawn them by universal impulse to the congenial flare of the footlights whether as artists producers impresarios critics agents gobetweens or merely as highly intelligent and fearsomely wellinformed spectators  they were prominent in the chief seats they were represented more sparsely but still in fair numbers in the cheaper places and everywhere they were voluble emphatic sanguine or sceptical prodigal of word and gesture with eyes that seemed to miss nothing and acknowledge nothing and a general restless dread of not being seen and noticed  of the theatregoing london public there was also a fair muster more particularly centred in the less expensive parts of the house while in boxes stalls and circles a sprinkling of military uniforms gave an unfamiliar tone to the scene in the eyes of those who had not previously witnessed a firstnight performance under the new conditions  yeovil while standing aloof from his wifes participation in this social event had made private arrangements for being a personal spectator of the scene as one of the ticketbuying public he had secured a seat in the back row of a lowpriced gallery whence he might watch observant and unobserved the much talkedof debut of gorla mustelford and the writing of a new chapter in the history of the fait accompli  around him he noticed an incessant undercurrent of jangling laughter an unending giveandtake of meaningless mirthless jest and catchword  he had noticed the same thing in streets and public places since his arrival in london a noisy empty interchange of chaff and laughter that he had been at a loss to account for  the londoner is not well adapted for the irresponsible noisiness of jesting tongue that bubbles up naturally in a southern race and the effort to be volatile was the more noticeable because it so obviously was an effort  turning over the pages of a book that told the story of bulgarian social life in the days of turkish rule yeovil had that morning come across a passage that seemed to throw some light on the thing that had puzzled him  bondage has this one advantage it makes a nation merry  where farreaching ambition has no scope for its development the community squanders its energy on the trivial and personal cares of its daily life and seeks relief and recreation in simple and easily obtained material enjoyment  the writer was a man who had known bondage so he spoke at any rate with authority  of the london of the moment it could not however be said with any truth that it was merry but merely that its inhabitants made desperate endeavour not to appear crushed under their catastrophe  surrounded as he was now with a babble of tongues and shrill mechanical repartee yeovils mind went back to the book and its account of a theatre audience in the turkish days of bulgaria with its light and laughing crowd of critics and spectators  bulgaria  the thought of that determined little nation came to him with a sharp sense of irony  there was a people who had not thought it beneath the dignity of their manhood to learn the trade and discipline of arms  they had their reward torn and exhausted and debtencumbered from their campaigns they were masters in their own house the bulgarian flag flew over the bulgarian mountains  and yeovil stole a glance at the crown of charlemagne set over the royal box  in a capacious box immediately opposite the one set aside for royalty the lady shalem sat in wellconsidered prominence confident that every press critic and reporter would note her presence and that one or two of them would describe or misdescribe her toilet  already quite a considerable section of the audience knew her by name and the frequency with which she graciously nodded towards various quarters of the house suggested the presence of a great many personal acquaintances  she had attained to that desirable feminine altitude of purse and position when people who go about everywhere know you well by sight and have never met your dress before  lady shalem was a woman of commanding presence of that type which suggests a consciousness that the command may not necessarily be obeyed she had observant eyes and a wellmanaged voice  her successes in life had been worked for but they were also to some considerable extent the result of accident  her public history went back to the time when in the person of her husband mr conrad dort she had contested two hopeless and very expensive parliamentary elections on behalf of her party on each occasion the declaration of the poll had shown a heavy though reduced majority on the wrong side but she might have perpetrated an apt misquotation of the french monarchs traditional message after the defeat of pavia and assured the world all is lost save honours  the forthcoming honours list had duly proclaimed the fact that conrad dort esquire had entered parliament by another door as baron shalem of wireskiln in the county of suffolk  success had crowned the ladys efforts as far as the achievement of the title went but her social ambitions seemed unlikely to make further headway  the new baron and his wife their title and money notwithstanding did not go down in their particular segment of county society and in london there were other titles and incomes to compete with  people were willing to worship the golden calf but allowed themselves a choice of altars  no one could justly say that the shalems were either oppressively vulgar or insufferably bumptious probably the chief reason for their lack of popularity was their intense and obvious desire to be popular  they kept open house in such an insistently open manner that they created a social draught  the people who accepted their invitations for the second or third time were not the sort of people whose names gave importance to a dinner party or a house gathering  failure in a thinlydisguised form attended the assiduous efforts of the shalems to play a leading role in the world that they had climbed into  the baron began to observe to his acquaintances that gadding about and entertaining on a big scale was not much in his line a quiet afterdinner pipe and talk with some brother legislator was his ideal way of spending an evening  then came the great catastrophe involving the old order of society in the national overthrow  lady shalem after a decent interval of patriotic mourning began to look around her and take stock of her chances and opportunities under the new regime  it was easier to achieve distinction as a titled oasis in the social desert that london had become than it had been to obtain recognition as a new growth in a rather overcrowded field  the observant eyes and agile brain quickly noted this circumstance and her ladyship set to work to adapt herself to the altered conditions that governed her world  lord shalem was one of the few peers who kissed the hand of the new sovereign his wife was one of the few hostesses who attempted to throw a semblance of gaiety and lavish elegance over the travesty of a london season following the year of disaster  the world of tradesmen and purveyors and caterers and the thousands who were dependent on them for employment privately blessed the example set by shalem house whatever their feelings might be towards the fait accompli and the august newcomer who had added an old saxon kingdom and some of its accretions to the teutonic realm of charlemagne was duly beholden to an acquired subject who was willing to forget the bitterness of defeat and to help others to forget it also  among other acts of imperial recognition an earldom was being held in readiness for the baron who had known how to accept accomplished facts with a good grace  one of the wits of the cockatrice club had asserted that the new earl would take as supporters for his coat of arms a lion and a unicorn oublie  in the box with lady shalem was the grafin von tolb a welldressed woman of some fiftysix years comfortable and placid in appearance yet alert withal rather suggesting a thoroughly wideawake dormouse  rich amiable and intelligent were the adjectives which would best have described her character and her lifestory  in her own rather difficult social circle at paderborn she had earned for herself the reputation of being one of the most tactful and discerning hostesses in germany and it was generally suspected that she had come over and taken up her residence in london in response to a wish expressed in high quarters the lavish hospitality which she dispensed at her house in berkeley square was a considerable reinforcement to the stricken social life of the metropolis  in a neighbouring box cicely yeovil presided over a large and lively party which of course included ronnie storre who was for once in a way in a chattering mood and also included an american dowager who had never been known to be in anything else  a tone of literary distinction was imparted to the group by the presence of augusta smith better known under her penname of rhapsodic pantril author of a play that had had a limited but welladvertised success in sheffield and the united states of america author also of a book of reminiscences entitled things i cannot forget  she had beautiful eyes a knowledge of how to dress and a pleasant disposition cankered just a little by a perpetual dread of the nonrecognition of her genius  as the woman augusta smith she probably would have been unreservedly happy as the superwoman rhapsodic pantril she lived within the borderline of discontent  her most ordinary remarks were framed with the view of arresting attention some one once said of her that she ordered a sack of potatoes with the air of one who is making enquiry for a lovephiltre  do you see what colour the curtain is she asked cicely throwing a note of intense meaning into her question  cicely turned quickly and looked at the dropcurtain  rather a nice blue she said  alexandrine bluemy colourthe colour of hope said rhapsodie impressively  it goes well with the general colourscheme said cicely feeling that she was hardly rising to the occasion  say is it really true that his majesty is coming asked the lively american dowager  ive put on my nooest frock and my best diamonds on purpose and i shall be mortified to death if he doesnt see them  there pouted ronnie i felt certain youd put them on for me  why no i should have put on rubies and orange opals for you  people with our colour of hair always like barbaric display  they dont said ronnie they have chaste cold tastes  you are absolutely mistaken  well i think i ought to know protested the dowager ive lived longer in the world than you have anyway  yes said ronnie with devastating truthfulness but my hair has been this colour longer than yours has  peace was restored by the opportune arrival of a middleaged man of blond northgerman type with an expression of brutality on his rather stupid face who sat in the front of the box for a few minutes on a visit of ceremony to cicely  his appearance caused a slight buzz of recognition among the audience and if yeovil had cared to make enquiry of his neighbours he might have learned that this decorated and obviously important personage was the redoubtable von kwarl artificer and shaper of much of the statecraft for which other men got the public credit  the orchestra played a selection from the gondola girl which was the leading musicalcomedy of the moment  most of the audience those in the more expensive seats at any rate heard the same airs two or three times daily at restaurant lunches teas dinners and suppers and occasionally in the park they were justified therefore in treating the music as a background to slightly louder conversation than they had hitherto indulged in  the music came to an end episode number two in the evenings entertainment was signalled the curtain of alexandrine blue rolled heavily upward and a troupe of performing wolves was presented to the public  yeovil had encountered wolves in north africa deserts and in siberian forest and wold he had seen them at twilight stealing like dark shadows across the snow and heard their long whimpering howl in the darkness amid the pines he could well understand how a magic lore had grown up round them through the ages among the peoples of four continents how their name had passed into a hundred strange sayings and inspired a hundred traditions  and now he saw them ride round the stage on tricycles with grotesque ruffles round their necks and clown caps on their heads their eyes blinking miserably in the blaze of the footlights  in response to the applause of the house a stout atrociously smiling man in evening dress came forward and bowed he had had nothing to do either with the capture or the training of the animals having bought them ready for use from a continental emporium where wild beasts were prepared for the musichall market but he continued bowing and smiling till the curtain fell  two american musicians with comic tendencies denoted by the elaborate rags and tatters of their costumes succeeded the wolves  their musical performance was not without merit but their comic business seemed to have been invented long ago by some man who had patented a monopoly of all musichall humour and forthwith retired from the trade  some day yeovil reflected the rights of the monopoly might expire and new business become available for the knockabout profession  the audience brightened considerably when item number five of the programme was signalled  the orchestra struck up a rollicking measure and tony luton made his entrance amid a rousing storm of applause  he was dressed as an errandboy of some west end shop with a livery and box tricycle as spruce and decorative as the most ambitious errandboy could see himself in his most ambitious dreams  his song was a lively and very audacious chronicle of life behind the scenes of a big retail establishment and sparkled with allusions which might fitly have been described as suggestiveat any rate they appeared to suggest meanings to the audience quite as clearly as gorla mustelfords dances were likely to do even with the aid in her case of long explanations on the programmes  when the final verse seemed about to reach an unpardonable climax a stage policeman opportunely appeared and moved the lively songster on for obstructing the imaginary traffic of an imaginary bond street  the house received the new number with genial enthusiasm and mingled its applause with demands for an earlier favourite  the orchestra struck up the familiar air and in a few moments the smart errandboy transformed now into a smart jockey was singing they quaff the gay bubbly in eccleston square to an audience that hummed and nodded its unstinted approval  the next number but one was the gorla mustelford debut and the house settled itself down to yawn and fidget and chatter for ten or twelve minutes while a troupe of talented japanese jugglers performed some artistic and quite uninteresting marvels with fans and butterflies and lacquer boxes  the interval of waiting was not destined however to be without its interest in its way it provided the one really important and dramatic moment of the evening  one or two uniforms and evening toilettes had already made their appearance in the imperial box now there was observable in that quarter a slight commotion an unobtrusive reshuffling and reseating and then every eye in the suddenly quiet semi darkened house focussed itself on one figure  there was no public demonstration from the newlyloyal it had been particularly wished that there should be none but a ripple of whisper went through the vast audience from end to end  majesty had arrived  the japanese marvelworkers went through their display with even less attention than before  lady shalem sitting well in the front of her box lowered her observant eyes to her programme and her massive bangles  the evidence of her triumph did not need staring at     chapter ix an evening to be remembered   to the uninitiated or unappreciative the dancing of gorla mustelford did not seem widely different from much that had been exhibited aforetime by exponents of the posturing school  she was not naturally graceful of movement she had not undergone years of arduous tutelage she had not the instinct for sheer joyous energy of action that is stored in some natures out of these unpromising negative qualities she had produced a style of dancing that might best be labelled a conscientious departure from accepted methods  the highly imaginative titles that she had bestowed on her dances the life of a fern the souldream of a topaz and so forth at least gave her audience and her critics something to talk about  in themselves they meant absolutely nothing but they induced discussion and that to gorla meant a great deal  it was a season of dearth and emptiness in the footlights and boxoffice world and her performance received a welcome that would scarcely have befallen it in a more crowded and prosperous day  her success indeed had been waiting for her readymade as far as the managerial profession was concerned and nothing had been left undone in the way of advertisement to secure for it the appearance at any rate of popular favour  and loud above the interested applause of those who had personal or business motives for acclaiming a success swelled the exaggerated enthusiasm of the fairly numerous artsatellites who are unstinted in their praise of anything that they are certain they cannot understand whatever might be the subsequent verdict of the theatrefilling public the majority of the favoured firstnight audience was determined to set the seal of its approval on the suggestion dances and a steady roll of applause greeted the conclusion of each item  the dancer gravely bowed her thanks in marked contradistinction to the gentleman who had presented the performing wolves she did not permit herself the luxury of a smile  it teaches us a great deal said rhapsodic pantril vaguely but impressively after the fern dance had been given and applauded  at any rate we know now that a fern takes life very seriously broke in joan mardle who had somehow wriggled herself into cicelys box  as yeovil from the back of his gallery watched gorla running and ricochetting about the stage looking rather like a wagtail in energetic pursuit of invisible gnats and midges he wondered how many of the middle aged women who were eagerly applauding her would have taken the least notice of similar gymnastics on the part of their offspring in nursery or garden beyond perhaps asking them not to make so much noise  and a bitterer tinge came to his thoughts as he saw the bouquets being handed up thoughts of the brave old dowager down at torywood the woman who had worked and wrought so hard and so unsparingly in her day for the well being of the statethe state that had fallen helpless into alien hands before her tired eyes  her eldest son lived invalidwise in the south of france her second son lay fathoms deep in the north sea with the hulk of a broken battleship for a burialvault and now the granddaughter was standing here in the limelight bowing her thanks for the patronage and favour meted out to her by this cosmopolitan company with its lavish sprinkling of the uniforms of an alien army  prominent among the flowers at her feet was one large goldenpetalled bouquet of gorgeous blooms tied with a broad streamer of golden riband the tribute rendered by caesar to the things that were caesars  the new chapter of the fait accompli had been written that night and written well  the audience poured slowly out with the triumphant music of jancoviuss kaiser wilhelm march played by the orchestra as a happy inspiration pealing in its ears  it has been a great evening a most successful evening said lady shalem to herr von kwarl whom she was conveying in her electric brougham to cicely yeovils supper party an important evening she added choosing her adjectives with deliberation  it should give pleasure in high quarters should it not  and she turned her observant eyes on the impassive face of her companion  gracious lady he replied with deliberation and meaning it has given pleasure  it is an evening to be remembered  the gracious lady suppressed a sigh of satisfaction  memory in high places was a thing fruitful and precious beyond computation  cicelys party at the porphyry restaurant had grown to imposing dimensions  every one whom she had asked had come and so had joan mardle  lady shalem had suggested several names at the last moment and there was quite a strong infusion of the teutonic military and official world  it was just as well cicely reflected that the supper was being given at a restaurant and not in berkshire street  quite like ole times purred the beaming proprietor in cicelys ear as the staircase and cloakrooms filled up with a jostling laughing throng  the guests settled themselves at four tables taking their places where chance or fancy led them late comers having to fit in wherever they could find room  a babel of tongues in various languages reigned round the tables amid which the rattle of knives and forks and plates and the popping of corks made a subdued hubbub  gorla mustelford the motive for all this sound and movement this chatter of guests and scurrying of waiters sat motionless in the fatigued selfconscious silence of a great artist who has delivered a great message  do sit at lady peachs table like a dear boy cicely begged of tony luton who had come in late she and gerald drowly have got together in spite of all my efforts and they are both so dull  try and liven things up a bit  a loud barking sound as of furseals calling across arctic ice came from another table where mrs mentiethmendlesohnn one of the mendlesohnns of invergordon as she was wont to describe herself was proclaiming the glories and subtleties of gorlas achievement  it was a revelation she shouted i sat there and saw a whole new scheme of thought unfold itself before my eyes  one could not define it it was thought translated into actionthe best art cannot be defined one just sat there and knew that one was seeing something one had never seen before and yet one felt that one had seen it in ones brain all ones life  that was what was so wonderfulyes please she broke off sharply as a fat quail in aspic was presented to her by a questioning waiter  the voice of mr mauleverer morle came across the table like another seal barking at a greater distance  rostand he observed with studied emphasis has been called le prince de ladjectif inopine miss mustelford deserves to be described as the queen of unexpected movement  oh i say do you hear that exclaimed mrs mentiethmendlesohnn to as wide an audience as she could achieve rostand has been calledtell them what you said mr morle she broke off suddenly mistrusting her ability to handle a french sentence at the top of her voice  mr morle repeated his remark  pass it on to the next table commanded mrs mentiethmendlesohnn its too good to be lost  at the next table however a grave impressive voice was dwelling at length on a topic remote from the event of the evening  lady peach considered that all social gatherings of whatever nature were intended for the recital of minor domestic tragedies  she lost no time in regaling the company around her with the detailed history of an interrupted weekend in a norfolk cottage  the most charming and delightful oldworld spot that you could imagine clean and quite comfortable just a nice distance from the sea and within an easy walk of the broads  the very place for the children  wed brought everything for a four days stay and meant to have a really delightful time  and then on sunday morning we found that some one had left the springhead where our only supply of drinking water came from uncovered and a dead bird was floating in it it had fallen in somehow and got drowned  of course we couldnt use the water that a dead body had been floating in and there was no other supply for miles round so we had to come away then and there  now what do you say to that  ah that a linnet should die in the spring quoted tony luton with intense feeling  there was an immediate outburst of hilarity where lady peach had confidently looked for expressions of concern and sympathy  isnt tony just perfectly cute  isnt he exclaimed a young american woman with an enthusiasm to which lady peach entirely failed to respond she had intended following up her story with the account of another tragedy of a similar nature that had befallen her three years ago in argyllshire and now the opportunity had gone  she turned morosely to the consolations of a tongue salad  at the centre table the excellent von tolb led a chorus of congratulation and compliment to which gorla listened with an air of polite detachment much as the sheikh ul islam might receive the homage of a wesleyan conference  to a close observer it would have seemed probable that her attitude of fatigued indifference to the flattering remarks that were showered on her had been as carefully studied and rehearsed as any of her postures on the stage  it is something that one will appreciate more and more fully every time one sees it    one cannot see it too often    i could have sat and watched it for hours    do you know i am just looking forward to to morrow evening when i can see it again     i knew it was going to be good but i had no idea so chimed the chorus between mouthfuls of quail and bites of asparagus  werent the performing wolves wonderful exclaimed joan in her fresh joyous voice that rang round the room like laughter of the woodpecker  if there is one thing that disturbs the complacency of a great artist of the halls it is the consciousness of sharing his or her triumphs with performing birds and animals but of course joan was not to be expected to know that  she pursued her subject with the assurance of one who has hit on a particularly acceptable topic  it must have taken them years of training and concentration to master those tricycles she continued in highpitched soliloquy  the nice thing about them is that they dont realise a bit how clever and educational they are  it would be dreadful to have them putting on airs wouldnt it  and yet i suppose the knowledge of being able to jump through a hoop better than any other wolf would justify a certain amount of side  fortunately at this moment a young italian journalist at another table rose from his seat and delivered a twominute oration in praise of the heroine of the evening  he spoke in rapid nervous french with a north italian accent but much of what he said could be understood by the majority of those present and the applause was unanimous  at any rate he had been brief and it was permissible to suppose that he had been witty  it was the opening for which mr gerald drowly had been watching and waiting  the moment that the italian enthusiast had dropped back into his seat amid a rattle of handclapping and rapping of forks and knives on the tables drowly sprang to his feet pushed his chair well away as for a long separation and begged to endorse what had been so very aptly and gracefully and might he add truly said by the previous speaker this was only the prelude to the real burden of his message with the dexterity that comes of practice he managed in a couple of hurried sentences to divert the course of his remarks to his own personality and career and to inform his listeners that he was an actor of some note and experience and had had the honour of acting underand here followed a string of names of eminent actor managers of the day  he thought he might be pardoned for mentioning the fact that his performance of peterkin in the broken nutshell had won the unstinted approval of the dramatic critics of the provincial press  towards the end of what was a long speech and which seemed even longer to its hearers he reverted to the subject of gorlas dancing and bestowed on it such laudatory remarks as he had left over  drawing his chair once again into his immediate neighbourhood he sat down aglow with the satisfied consciousness of a good work worthily performed  i once acted a small part in some theatricals got up for a charity announced joan in a ringing confidential voice the clapham courier said that all the minor parts were very creditably sustained  those were its very words  i felt i must tell you that and also say how much i enjoyed miss mustelfords dancing  tony luton cheered wildly  thats the cleverest speech so far he proclaimed  he had been asked to liven things up at his table and was doing his best to achieve that result but mr gerald drowly joined lady peach in the unfavourable opinion she had formed of that irrepressible youth  ronnie on whom cicely kept a solicitous eye showed no sign of any intention of falling in love with gorla  he was more profitably engaged in paying court to the grafin von tolb whose hospitable mansion in belgrave square invested her with a special interest in his eyes  as a professional prince charming he had every inducement to encourage the cult of fairy godmother  yes yes agreed i will come and hear you play that is a promise said the grafin and you must come and dine with me one night and play to me afterwards that is a promise also yes  that is very nice of you to come and see a tiresome old woman  i am passionately fond of music if i were honest i would tell you also that i am very fond of good looking boys but this is not the age of honesty so i must leave you to guess that  come on thursday in next week you can  that is nice  i have a reigning prince dining with me that night  poor man he wants cheering up the art of being a reigning prince is not a very pleasing one nowadays  he has made it a boast all his life that he is liberal and his subjects conservative now that is all changedno not all he is still liberal but his subjects unfortunately are become socialists  you must play your best for him  are there many socialists over there in germany i mean asked ronnie who was rather out of his depth where politics were concerned  ueberall said the grafin with emphasis everywhere i dont know what it comes from better education and worse digestions i suppose  i am sure digestion has a good deal to do with it  in my husbands family for example his generation had excellent digestions and there wasnt a case of socialism or suicide among them the younger generation have no digestions worth speaking of and there have been two suicides and three socialists within the last six years  and now i must really be going  i am not a berliner and late hours dont suit my way of life  ronnie bent low over the grafins hand and kissed it partly because she was the kind of woman who naturally invoked such homage but chiefly because he knew that the gesture showed off his smooth burnished head to advantage  the observant eyes of lady shalem had noted the animated conversation between the grafin and ronnie and she had overheard fragments of the invitation that had been accorded to the latter  take us the little foxes the little foxes that spoil the vines she quoted to herself not that that musicboy would do much in the destructive line but the principle is good     chapter x some reflections and a te deum   cicely awoke on the morning after the memorable evening with the satisfactory feeling of victory achieved tempered by a troubled sense of having achieved it in the face of a reasonably grounded opposition  she had burned her boats and was glad of it but the reek of their burning drifted rather unpleasantly across the jubilant incenseswinging of her te deum service  last night had marked an immense step forward in her social career without running after the patronage of influential personages she had seen it quietly and tactfully put at her service  people such as the grafin von tolb were going to be a power in the london world for a very long time to come  herr von kwarl with all his useful qualities of brain and temperament might conceivably fall out of favour in some unexpected turn of the political wheel and the shalems would probably have their little day and then a long afternoon of diminishing social importance the placid dormouselike grafin would outlast them all  she had the qualities which make either for contented mediocrity or else for very durable success according as circumstances may dictate  she was one of those characters that can neither thrust themselves to the front nor have any wish to do so but being there no ordinary power can thrust them away  with the grafin as her friend cicely found herself in altogether a different position from that involved by the mere interested patronage of lady shalem  a vista of social success was opened up to her and she did not mean it to be just the ordinary success of a popular and influential hostess moving in an important circle  that people with naturally bad manners should have to be polite and considerate in their dealings with her that people who usually held themselves aloof should have to be gracious and amiable that the selfassured should have to be just a little humble and anxious where she was concerned these things of course she intended to happen she was a woman  but she told herself she intended a great deal more than that when she traced the pattern for her scheme of social influence  in her heart she detested the german occupation as a hateful necessity but while her heart registered the hatefulness the brain recognised the necessity  the great fightingmachines that the germans had built up and maintained on land on sea and in air were three solid crushing facts that demonstrated the hopelessness of any immediate thought of revolt  twenty years hence when the present generation was older and greyer the chances of armed revolt would probably be equally hopeless equally remoteseeming  but in the meantime something could have been effected in another way  the conquerors might partially germanise london but on the other hand if the thing were skilfully managed the british element within the empire might impress the mark of its influence on everything german  the fighting men might remain prussian or bavarian but the thinking men and eventually the ruling men could gradually come under british influence or even be of british blood  an english liberalconservative centre might stand as a bulwark against the junkerdom and socialism of continental germany  so cicely reasoned with herself in a fashion induced perhaps by an earlier apprenticeship to the reading of nineteenth century articles in which the possible political and racial developments of various countries were examined and discussed and put away in the pigeonholes of probable happenings  she had sufficient knowledge of political history to know that such a development might possibly come to pass she had not sufficient insight into actual conditions to know that the possibility was as remote as that of armed resistance  and the role which she saw herself playing was that of a deft and courtly political intriguer rallying the british element and making herself agreeable to the german element a political inspiration to the one and a social distraction to the other  at the back of her mind there lurked an honest confession that she was probably overrating her powers of statecraft and personality that she was more likely to be carried along by the current of events than to control or divert its direction the political daydream remained however as daydreams will in spite of the clear light of probability shining through them  at any rate she knew as usual what she wanted to do and as usual she had taken steps to carry out her intentions  last night remained in her mind a night of important victory  there also remained the anxious proceeding of finding out if the victory had entailed any serious losses  cicely was not one of those illregulated people who treat the first meal of the day as a convenient occasion for serving up any differences or contentions that have been left over from the day before or overlooked in the press of other matters  she enjoyed her breakfast and gave yeovil unhindered opportunity for enjoying his a discussion as to the right cooking of a dish that he had first tasted among the orenburg tartars was the prevailing topic on this particular morning and blended well with trout and toast and coffee  in a cosy nook of the smokingroom in participation of the afterbreakfast cigarettes cicely made her dash into debatable ground  you havent asked me how my supperparty went off she said  there is a notice of it in two of the morning papers with a list of those present said yeovil the conquering race seems to have been very well represented  several races were represented said cicely a function of that sort celebrating a dramatic firstnight was bound to be cosmopolitan  in fact blending of races and nationalities is the tendency of the age we live in  the blending of races seems to have been consummated already in one of the individuals at your party said yeovil drily the name mentieth mendlesohnn struck me as a particularly happy obliteration of racial landmarks  cicely laughed  a noisy and very wearisome sort of woman she commented she reminds one of garlic thats been planted by mistake in a conservatory  still shes useful as an advertising agent to any one who rubs her the right way  shell be invaluable in proclaiming the merits of gorlas performance to all and sundry thats why i invited her  shell probably lunch today at the hotel cecil and every one sitting within a hundred yards of her table will hear what an emotional education they can get by going to see gorla dance at the caravansery  she seems to be like the salvation army said yeovil her noise reaches a class of people who wouldnt trouble to read press notices  exactly said cicely  gorla gets quite good notices on the whole doesnt she  the one that took my fancy most was the one in the standard said yeovil picking up that paper from a table by his side and searching its columns for the notice in question  the wolves which appeared earlier in the evenings entertainment are the programme assures us trained entirely by kindness  it would have been a further kindness at any rate to the audience if some of the training which the wolves doubtless do not appreciate at its proper value had been expended on miss mustelfords efforts at stage dancing  we are assured again on the authority of the programme that the muchtalkedof suggestion dances are the last word in posture dancing  the last word belongs by immemorial right to the sex which miss mustelford adorns and it would be ungallant to seek to deprive her of her privilege  as far as the educational aspect of her performance is concerned we must admit that the life of the fern remains to us a private life still  miss mustelford has abandoned her own private life in an unavailing attempt to draw the fern into the gaze of publicity  and so it was with her other suggestions  they suggested many things but nothing that was announced on the programme chiefly they suggested one outstanding reflection that stagedancing is not like those advertised breakfast foods that can be served up after three minutes preparation  half a lifetime or rather half a youth time is a much more satisfactory allowance  the standard is prejudiced said cicely some of the other papers are quite enthusiastic  the dawn gives her a column and a quarter of notice nearly all of it complimentary  it says the report of her fame as a dancer went before her but that her performance last night caught it up and outstripped it  i should not like to suggest that the dawn is prejudiced said yeovil but shalem is a managing director on it and one of its biggest shareholders  gorlas dancing is an event of the social season and shalem is one of those most interested in keeping up the appearance at any rate of a london social season  besides her debut gave the opportunity for an imperial visit to the theatrethe first appearance at a festive public function of the conqueror among the conquered apparently the experiment passed off well shalem has every reason to feel pleased with himself and welldisposed towards gorla  by the way added yeovil talking of gorla im going down to torywood one day next week  to torywood exclaimed cicely  the tone of her exclamation gave the impression that the announcement was not very acceptable to her  i promised the old lady that i would go and have a talk with her when i came back from my siberian trip she travelled in eastern russia you know long before the transsiberian railway was built and shes enormously interested in those parts  in any case i should like to see her again  she does not see many people nowadays said cicely i fancy she is breaking up rather  she was very fond of the son who went down you know  she has seen a great many of the things she cared for go down said yeovil it is a sad old life that is left to her when one thinks of all that the past has been to her of the part she used to play in the world the work she used to get through  it used to seem as though she could never grow old as if she would die standing up with some unfinished command on her lips  and now i suppose her tragedy is that she has grown old bitterly old and cannot die  cicely was silent for a moment and seemed about to leave the room  then she turned back and said  i dont think i would say anything about gorla to her if i were you  it would not have occurred to me to drag her name into our conversation said yeovil coldly but in any case the accounts of her dancing performance will have reached torywood through the newspapersalso the record of your raciallyblended supperparty  cicely said nothing  she knew that by last nights affair she had definitely identified herself in public opinion with the shalem clique and that many of her old friends would look on her with distrust and suspicion on that account  it was unfortunate but she reckoned it a lesser evil than tearing herself away from her london life its successes and pleasures and possibilities  these social dislocations and severing of friendships were to be looked for after any great and violent change in state affairs  it was yeovils attitude that really troubled her she would not give way to his prejudices and accept his point of view but she knew that a victory that involved estrangement from him would only bring a mockery of happiness  she still hoped that he would come round to an acceptance of established facts and deaden his political malaise in the absorbing distraction of field sports  the visit to torywood was a misfortune it might just turn the balance in the undesired direction only a few weeks of late summer and early autumn remained before the hunting season and its preparations would be at hand and yeovil might be caught in the meshes of an old enthusiasm in those few weeks however he might be fired by another sort of enthusiasm an enthusiasm which would sooner or later mean voluntary or enforced exile for his part and the probable breaking up of her own social plans and ambitions  but cicely knew something of the futility of improvising objections where no real obstacle exists  the visit to torywood was a graceful attention on yeovils part to an old friend there was no decent ground on which it could be opposed  if the influence of that visit came athwart yeovils life and hers with disastrous effect that was kismet  and once again the reek from her burned and smouldering boats mingled threateningly with the incense fumes of her te deum for victory  she left the room and yeovil turned once more to an item of news in the mornings papers that had already arrested his attention  the imperial aufklarung on the subject of military service was to be made public in the course of the day     chapter xi the tea shop   yeovil wandered down piccadilly that afternoon in a spirit of restlessness and expectancy  the longawaited aufklarung dealing with the new law of military service had not yet appeared at any moment he might meet the hoarsethroated newsboys running along with their papers announcing the special edition which would give the terms of the edict to the public  every sound or movement that detached itself with isolated significance from the general whirr and scurry of the streets seemed to yeovil to herald the oncoming clamour and rush that he was looking for but the long endless succession of motors and buses and vans went by hooting and grunting and such newsboys as were to be seen hung about listlessly bearing no more attractive bait on their posters than the announcement of an earthquake shock in hungary feared loss of life  the green park end of piccadilly was a changed and in some respects a livelier thoroughfare to that which yeovil remembered with affectionate regret  a great political club had migrated from its palatial home to a shrunken habitation in a less prosperous quarter its place was filled by the flamboyant frontage of the hotel konstantinopel  gorgeous turkey carpets were spread over the wide entrance steps and boys in circassian and anatolian costumes hung around the doors or dashed forth in unoriental haste to carry such messages as the telephone was unable to transmit  picturesque sellers of turkish delight attarofroses and brasswork coffee services squatted under the portico on terms of obvious good understanding with the hotel management  a few doors further down a service club that had long been a piccadilly landmark was a landmark still as the home of the army aeronaut club and there was a constant coming and going of gayhued uniforms saxon prussian bavarian hessian and so forth through its portals  the mastering of the air and the creation of a scientific aerial war fleet second to none in the world was an achievement of which the conquering race was pardonably proud and for which it had good reason to be duly thankful over the gateways was blazoned the badge of the club an elephant whale and eagle typifying the three armed forces of the state by land and sea and air the eagle bore in its beak a scroll with the proud legend the last am i but not the least  to the eastward of this gailyhumming hive the long shuttered front of a deserted ducal mansion struck a note of protest and mourning amid the noise and whirl and colour of a seemingly uncaring city  on the other side of the roadway on the gravelled paths of the green park small ragged children from the back streets of westminster looked wistfully at the smooth trim stretches of grass on which it was now forbidden in two languages to set foot  only the pigeons disregarding the changes of political geography walked about as usual wondering perhaps if they ever wondered at anything at the sudden change in the distribution of park humans  yeovil turned his steps out of the hot sunlight into the shade of the burlington arcade familiarly known to many of its newer frequenters as the passage  here the change that new conditions and requirements had wrought was more immediately noticeable than anywhere else in the west end  most of the shops on the western side had been cleared away and in their place had been installed an openair cafe converting the long alley into a sort of promenade teagarden flanked on one side by a line of haberdashers perfumers and jewellers show windows  the patrons of the cafe could sit at the little round tables drinking their coffee and syrups and aperitifs and gazing if they were so minded at the pyjamas and cravats and brazilian diamonds spread out for inspection before them  a string orchestra hidden away somewhere in a gallery was alternating grand opera with the gondola girl and the latest gems of transatlantic melody  from around the tightlypacked tables arose a babble of tongues made up chiefly of german a south american rendering of spanish and a north american rendering of english with here and there the sharp shakenout staccato of japanese  a sleepylooking boy in a nondescript uniform was wandering to and fro among the customers offering for sale the matin new york herald berliner tageblatt and a host of crudely coloured illustrated papers embodying the hardworked wit of a worldlegion of comic artists  yeovil hurried through the arcade it was not here in this atmosphere of staring alien eyes and jangling tongues that he wanted to read the news of the imperial aufklarung  by a succession of byways he reached hanover square and thence made his way into oxford street  there was no commotion of activity to be noticed yet among the newsboys the posters still concerned themselves with the earthquake in hungary varied with references to the health of the king of roumania and a motor accident in south london  yeovil wandered aimlessly along the street for a few dozen yards and then turned down into the smokingroom of a cheap teashop where he judged that the flourishing foreign element would be less conspicuously represented quietvoiced smoothheaded youths from neighbouring shops and wholesale houses sat drinking tea and munching pastry some of them reading others making a fitful rattle with dominoes on the marbletopped tables a clean wholesome smell of tea and coffee made itself felt through the clouds of cigarette smoke cleanliness and listlessness seemed to be the dominant notes of the place a cleanliness that was commendable and a listlessness that seemed unnatural and undesirable where so much youth was gathered together for refreshment and recreation  yeovil seated himself at a table already occupied by a young clergyman who was smoking a cigarette over the remains of a plateful of buttered toast  he had a keen clever hardlined face the face of a man who in an earlier stage of european history might have been a warlike prior awkward to tackle at the councilboard greatly to be avoided where blows were being exchanged  a pale silent damsel drifted up to yeovil and took his order with an air of being mentally some hundreds of miles away and utterly indifferent to the requirements of those whom she served if she had brought calfsfoot jelly instead of the pot of china tea he had asked for yeovil would hardly have been surprised  however the tea duly arrived on the table and the pale damsel scribbled a figure on a slip of paper put it silently by the side of the teapot and drifted silently away  yeovil had seen the same sort of thing done on the musicalcomedy stage and done rather differently  can you tell me sir is the imperial announcement out yet asked the young clergyman after a brief scrutiny of his neighbour  no i have been waiting about for the last halfhour on the lookout for it said yeovil the special editions ought to be out by now  then he added i have only just lately come from abroad  i know scarcely anything of london as it is now  you may imagine that a good deal of it is very strange to me  your profession must take you a good deal among all classes of people  i have seen something of what one may call the upper or at any rate the richer classes since i came back do tell me something about the poorer classes of the community  how do they take the new order of things  badly said the young cleric badly in more senses than one  they are helpless and they are bitterbitter in the useless kind of way that produces no great resolutions  they look round for some one to blame for what has happened they blame the politicians they blame the leisured classes in an indirect way i believe they blame the church  certainly the national disaster has not drawn them towards religion in any form one thing you may be sure of they do not blame themselves  no true londoner ever admits that fault lies at his door  no i never is an exclamation that is on his lips from earliest childhood whenever he is charged with anything blameworthy or punishable  that is why school discipline was ever a thing repugnant to the schoolboard child and its parents no schoolboard scholar ever deserved punishment  however obvious the fault might seem to a disciplinarian no i never exonerated it as something that had not happened  public schoolboys and private schoolboys of the upper and middle class had their fling and took their thrashings when they were found out as a piece of bad luck but our bert and our sid were of those for whom there is no condemnation if they were punished it was for faults that no they never committed naturally the grownup generation of berts and sids the voters and householders do not realise still less admit that it was they who called the tune to which the politicians danced  they had to choose between the votemongers and the socalled scaremongers and their verdict was for the votemongers all the time  and now they are bitter they are being punished and punishment is not a thing that they have been schooled to bear  the taxes that are falling on them are a grievous source of discontent and the military service that will be imposed on them for the first time in their lives will be another  there is a more lovable side to their character under misfortune though added the young clergyman  deep down in their hearts there was a very real affection for the old dynasty  future historians will perhaps be able to explain how and why the royal family of great britain captured the imaginations of its subjects in so genuine and lasting a fashion  among the poorest and the most matteroffact for whom the name of no public man politician or philanthropist stands out with any especial significance the old queen and the dead king the dethroned monarch and the young prince live in a sort of domestic pantheon a recollection that is a proud and wistful personal possession when so little remains to be proud of or to possess  there is no favour that i am so often asked for among my poorer parishioners as the gift of the picture of this or that member of the old dynasty  i have got all of them only except princess mary an old woman said to me last week and she nearly cried with pleasure when i brought her an old bystander portrait that filled the gap in her collection  and on queen alexandras day they bring out and wear the faded wildrose favours that they bought with their pennies in days gone by  the tragedy of the enactment that is about to enforce military service on these people is that it comes when theyve no longer a country to fight for said yeovil  the young clergyman gave an exclamation of bitter impatience  that is the cruel mockery of the whole thing  every now and then in the course of my work i have come across lads who were really drifting to the bad through the good qualities in them  a clean combative strain in their blood and a natural turn for adventure made the ordinary anaemic routine of shop or warehouse or factory almost unbearable for them  what splendid little soldiers they would have made and how grandly the discipline of a military training would have steadied them in afterlife when steadiness was wanted  the only adventure that their surroundings offered them has been the adventure of practising mildly criminal misdeeds without getting landed in reformatories and prisons those of them that have not been successful in keeping clear of detection are walking round and round prison yards experiencing the operation of a discipline that breaks and does not build  they were merryhearted boys once with nothing of the criminal or neerdoweel in their natures and nowhave you ever seen a prison yard with that walk round and round and round between grey walls under a blue sky  yeovil nodded  its good enough for criminals and imbeciles said the parson but think of it for those boys who might have been marching along to the tap of the drum with a laugh on their lips instead of hell in their hearts i have had hell in my heart sometimes when i have come in touch with cases like those  i suppose you are thinking that i am a strange sort of parson  i was just defining you in my mind said yeovil as a man of god with an infinite tenderness for little devils  the clergyman flushed  rather a fine epitaph to have on ones tombstone he said especially if the tombstone were in some crowded city graveyard  i suppose i am a man of god but i dont think i could be called a man of peace  looking at the strong young face with its suggestion of a fighting prior of bygone days more marked than ever yeovil mentally agreed that he could not  i have learned one thing in life continued the young man and that is that peace is not for this world  peace is what god gives us when he takes us into his rest  beat your sword into a ploughshare if you like but beat your enemy into smithereens first  a longdrawn cry repeated again and again detached itself from the throb and hoot and whir of the street traffic  speshul  military service speshul  the young clergyman sprang from his seat and went up the staircase in a succession of bounds causing the domino players and novelette readers to look up for a moment in mild astonishment  in a few seconds he was back again with a copy of an afternoon paper  the imperial rescript was set forth in heavy type in parallel columns of english and german  as the young man read a deep burning flush spread over his face then ebbed away into a chalky whiteness  he read the announcement to the end then handed the paper to yeovil and left without a word  beneath the courtly politeness and benignant phraseology of the document ran a trenchant searing irony  the british born subjects of the germanic crown inhabiting the islands of great britain and ireland had habituated themselves as a people to the disuse of arms and resolutely excluded military service and national training from their political system and daily life  their judgment that they were unsuited as a race to bear arms and conform to military discipline was not to be set aside their new overlord did not propose to do violence to their feelings and customs by requiring from them the personal military sacrifices and services which were rendered by his subjects germanborn  the british subjects of the crown were to remain a people consecrated to peaceful pursuits to commerce and trade and husbandry  the defence of their coasts and shipping and the maintenance of order and general safety would be guaranteed by a garrison of german troops with the cooperation of the imperial war fleet  germanborn subjects residing temporarily or permanently in the british isles would come under the same laws respecting compulsory military service as their fellowsubjects of german blood in the other parts of the empire and special enactments would be drawn up to ensure that their interests did not suffer from a periodical withdrawal on training or other military calls  necessarily a heavily differentiated scale of war taxation would fall on british taxpayers to provide for the upkeep of the garrison and to equalise the services and sacrifices rendered by the two branches of his majestys subjects  as military service was not henceforth open to any subject of british birth no further necessity for any training or exercise of a military nature existed therefore all rifle clubs drill associations cadet corps and similar bodies were henceforth declared to be illegal  no weapons other than guns for specified sporting purposes duly declared and registered and open to inspection when required could be owned purchased or carried  the science of arms was to be eliminated altogether from the life of a people who had shown such marked repugnance to its study and practice  the cold irony of the measure struck home with the greater force because its nature was so utterly unexpected  public anticipation had guessed at various forms of military service aggressively irksome or tactfully lightened as the case might be in any event certain to be bitterly unpopular and now there had come this contemptuous boon which had removed at one stroke the bogey of compulsory military service from the troubled imaginings of the british people and fastened on them the cruel distinction of being in actual fact what an enemy had called them in splenetic scorn long years agoa nation of shopkeepers  aye something even below that level a race of shopkeepers who were no longer a nation  yeovil crumpled the paper in his hand and went out into the sunlit street  a sudden roll of drums and crash of brass music filled the air a company of bavarian infantry went by in all the pomp and circumstance of martial array and the joyous swing of rapid rhythmic movement  the street echoed and throbbed in the englishmans ears with the exultant pulse of youth and mastery set to loud pagan music  a group of lads from the teashop clustered on the pavement and watched the troops go by staring at a phase of life in which they had no share  the martial trappings the swaggering joy of life the comradeship of camp and barracks the hard discipline of drill yard and fatigue duty the long sentry watches the trench digging forced marches wounds cold hunger makeshift hospitals and the bloodwet laurelsthese were not for them such things they might only guess at or see on a cinema film darkly they belonged to the civilian nation  the function of afternoon tea was still being languidly observed in the big drawingroom when yeovil returned to berkshire street  cicely was playing the part of hostess to a man of perhaps fortyone years of age who looked slightly older from his palpable attempts to look very much younger  percival plarsey was a plump palefaced shortlegged individual with puffy cheeks overprominent nose and thin colourless hair  his mother with nothing more than maternal prejudice to excuse her had discovered some twenty odd years ago that he was a wellfavoured young man and had easily imbued her son with the same opinion  the slipping away of years and the natural transition of the unathletic boy into the podgy unhealthylooking man did little to weaken the tradition plarsey had never been able to relinquish the idea that a youthful charm and comeliness still centred in his person and laboured daily at his toilet with the devotion that a hopelessly lost cause is so often able to inspire  he babbled incessantly about himself and the accessory futilities of his life in short neat complacent sentences and in a voice that ronald storre said reminded one of a fat bishop blessing a buttermaking competition  while he babbled he kept his eyes fastened on his listeners to observe the impression which his important little announcements and pronouncements were making  on the present occasion he was pattering forth a detailed description of the upholstery and fittings of his new musicroom  all the hangings violette de parme all the furniture rosewood  the only ornament in the room is a replica of the mozart statue in vienna nothing but mozart is to be played in the room  absolutely nothing but mozart  you will get rather tired of that wont you said cicely feeling that she was expected to comment on this tremendous announcement  one gets tired of everything said plarsey with a fat little sigh of resignation i cant tell you how tired i am of rubenstein and one day i suppose i shall be tired of mozart and violette de parme and rosewood i never thought it possible that i could ever tire of jonquils and now i simply wont have one in the house  oh the scene the other day because some one brought some jonquils into the house  im afraid i was dreadfully rude but i really couldnt help it  he could talk like this through a long summer day or a long winter evening  yeovil belonged to a race forbidden to bear arms  at the moment he would gladly have contented himself with the weapons with which nature had endowed him if he might have kicked and pommelled the abhorrent specimen of male humanity whom he saw before him  instead he broke into the conversation with an inspired flash of malicious untruthfulness  it is wonderful he observed carelessly how popular that viennese statue of mozart has become  a friend who inspects county council art schools tells me you find a copy of it in every classroom you go into  it was a poor substitute for physical violence but it was all that civilisation allowed him in the way of relieving his feelings it had moreover the effect of making plarsey profoundly miserable     chapter xii the travelling companions   the train bearing yeovil on his visit to torywood slid and rattled westward through the hazy dreamland of an english summer landscape  seen from the train windows the stark bare ugliness of the metalled line was forgotten and the eye rested only on the green solitude that unfolded itself as the miles went slipping by  tall grasses and meadowweeds stood in deep shocks field after field between the leafy boundaries of hedge or coppice thrusting themselves higher and higher till they touched the low sweeping branches of the trees that here and there overshadowed them  broad streams bordered with a heavy fringe of reed and sedge went winding away into a green distance where woodland and meadowland seemed indefinitely prolonged narrow streamlets lost to view in the growth that they fostered disclosed their presence merely by the waterweed that showed in a riband of rank verdure threading the mellower green of the fields  on the stream banks moorhens walked with jerky confident steps in the easy boldness of those who had a couple of other elements at their disposal in an emergency more timorous partridges raced away from the apparition of the train looking all leg and neck like little forest elves fleeing from human encounter  and in the distance over the tree line a heron or two flapped with slow measured wingbeats and an air of being bent on an immeasurably longer journey than the train that hurtled so frantically along the rails  now and then the meadowland changed itself suddenly into orchard with closegrowing trees already showing the measure of their coming harvest and then strawyard and farm buildings would slide into view heavy dairy cattle roan and skewbald and dappled stood near the gates drowsily resentful of insect stings and bunchedup companies of ducks halted in seeming irresolution between the charms of the horsepond and the alluring neighbourhood of the farm kitchen  away by the banks of some rushing millstream in a setting of copse and cornfield a village might be guessed at just a hint of red roof grey wreathed chimney and old church tower as seen from the windows of the passing train and over it all brooded a happy settled calm like the dreaming murmur of a troutstream and the faraway cawing of rooks  it was a land where it seemed as if it must be always summer and generally afternoon a land where bees hummed among the wild thyme and in the flower beds of cottage gardens where the harvestmice rustled amid the corn and nettles and the millrace flowed cool and silent through waterweeds and dark tunnelled sluices and made soft droning music with the wooden millwheel  and the music carried with it the wording of old undying rhymes and sang of the jolly uncaring uncaredfor miller of the farmer who went riding upon his grey mare of the mouse who lived beneath the merry millpin of the sweet music on yonder green hill and the dancers all in yellowthe songs and fancies of a lingering olden time when men took life as children take a long summer day and went to bed at last with a simple trust in something they could not have explained  yeovil watched the passing landscape with the intent hungry eyes of a man who revisits a scene that holds high place in his affections  his imagination raced even quicker than the train following winding roads and twisting valleys into unseen distances picturing farms and hamlets hills and hollows clattering inn yards and sleepy woodlands  a beautiful country said his only fellowtraveller who was also gazing at the fleeting landscape surely a country worth fighting for  he spoke in fairly correct english but he was unmistakably a foreigner one could have allotted him with some certainty to the eastern half of europe  a beautiful country as you say replied yeovil then he added the question are you german  no hungarian said the other and you you are english he asked  i have been much in england but i am from russia said yeovil purposely misleading his companion on the subject of his nationality in order to induce him to talk with greater freedom on a delicate topic while living among foreigners in a foreign land he had shrunk from hearing his countrys disaster discussed or even alluded to now he was anxious to learn what unprejudiced foreigners thought of the catastrophe and the causes which had led up to it  it is a strange spectacle a wonder is it not so resumed the other a great nation such as this was one of the greatest nations in modern times or of any time carrying its flag and its language into all parts of the world and now after one short campaign it is  and he shrugged his shoulders many times and made clucking noises at the roof of his voice like a hen calling to a brood of roving chickens  they grew soft he resumed great worldcommerce brings great luxury and luxury brings softness  they had everything to warn them things happening in their own time and before their eyes and they would not be warned  they had seen in one generation the rise of the military and naval power of the japanese a brownskinned race living in some island rice fields in a tropical sea a people one thought of in connection with paper fans and flowers and pretty teagardens who suddenly marched and sailed into the worlds gaze as a great power they had seen too the rise of the bulgars a poor herd of zaptiehridden peasants with a few students scattered in exile in bukarest and odessa who shot up in one generation to be an armed and aggressive nation with history in its hands  the english saw these things happening around them and with a warcloud growing blacker and bigger and always more threatening on their own threshold they sat down to grow soft and peaceful  they grew soft and accommodating in all things in religion  in religion said yeovil  in religion yes said his companion emphatically they had come to look on the christ as a sort of amiable elder brother whose letters from abroad were worth reading  then when they had emptied all the divine mystery and wonder out of their faith naturally they grew tired of it oh but dreadfully tired of it  i know many english of the country parts and always they tell me they go to church once in each week to set the good example to the servants  they were tired of their faith but they were not virile enough to become real pagans their dancing fauns were good young men who tripped morris dances and ate health foods and believed in a sort of socialism which made for the greatest dulness of the greatest number  you will find plenty of them still if you go into what remains of social london  yeovil gave a grunt of acquiescence  they grew soft in their political ideas continued the unsparing critic for the old insular belief that all foreigners were devils and rogues they substituted another belief equally grounded on insular lack of knowledge that most foreigners were amiable good fellows who only needed to be talked to and patted on the back to become your friends and benefactors  they began to believe that a foreign minister would relinquish longcherished schemes of national policy and hostile expansion if he came over on a holiday and was asked down to country houses and shown the tennis court and the rockgarden and the younger children  listen  i once heard it solemnly stated at an afterdinner debate in some literary club that a certain very prominent german statesman had a daughter at school in england and that future friendly relations between the two countries were improved in prospect if not assured by that circumstance  you think i am laughing i am recording a fact and the men present were politicians and statesmen as well as literary dilettanti  it was an insular lack of insight that worked the mischief or some of the mischief  we in hungary we live too much cheek by jowl with our racial neighbours to have many illusions about them  austrians roumanians serbs italians czechs we know what they think of us and we know what to think of them we know what we want in the world and we know what they want that knowledge does not send us flying at each others throats but it does keep us from growing soft ah the british lion was in a hurry to inaugurate the millennium and to lie down gracefully with the lamb  he made two mistakes only two but they were very bad ones the millennium hadnt arrived and it was not a lamb that he was lying down with  you do not like the english i gather said yeovil as the hungarian went off into a short burst of satirical laughter  i have always liked them he answered but now i am angry with them for being soft  here is my station he added as the train slowed down and he commenced to gather his belongings together  i am angry with them he continued as a final word on the subject because i hate the germans  he raised his hat punctiliously in a parting salute and stepped out on to the platform  his place was taken by a large looselimbed man with florid face and big staring eyes and an immense array of fishingbasket rod flycases and so forth  he was of the type that one could instinctively locate as a loudvoiced selfconstituted authority on whatever topic might happen to be discussed in the bars of small hotels  are you english he asked after a preliminary stare at yeovil  this time yeovil did not trouble to disguise his nationality he nodded curtly to his questioner  glad of that said the fisherman i dont like travelling with germans  unfortunately said yeovil we have to travel with them as partners in the same state concern and not by any means the predominant partner either  oh that will soon right itself said the other with loud assertiveness that will right itself damn soon  nothing in politics rights itself said yeovil things have to be righted which is a different matter  what dymean said the fisherman who did not like to have his assertions taken up and shaken into shape  we have given a clever and domineering people a chance to plant themselves down as masters in our land i dont imagine that they are going to give us an easy chance to push them out  to do that we shall have to be a little cleverer than they are a little harder a little fiercer and a good deal more selfsacrificing than we have been in my lifetime or in yours  well be that right enough said the fisherman we mean business this time  the last war wasnt a war it was a snap  we werent prepared and they were  that wont happen again bless you  i know what im talking about  i go up and down the country and i hear what people are saying  yeovil privately doubted if he ever heard anything but his own opinions  it stands to reason continued the fisherman that a highly civilised race like ours with the record that weve had for leading the whole world is not going to be held under for long by a lot of damned sausage eating germans  dont you believe it  i know what im talking about ive travelled about the world a bit  yeovil shrewdly suspected that the world travels amounted to nothing more than a trip to the united states and perhaps the channel islands with possibly a week or fortnight in paris  it isnt the past weve got to think of its the future said yeovil other maritime powers had pasts to look back on spain and holland for instance  the past didnt help them when they let their seasovereignty slip from them  that is a matter of history and not very distant history either  ah thats where you make a mistake said the other our seasovereignty hasnt slipped from us and wont do neither  theres the british empire beyond the seas canada australia new zealand east africa  he rolled the names round his tongue with obvious relish  if it was a list of firstclass battleships and armoured cruisers and destroyers and airships that you were reeling off there would be some comfort and hope in the situation said yeovil the loyalty of the colonies is a splendid thing but it is only pathetically splendid because it can do so little to recover for us what weve lost  against the zeppelin air fleet and the dreadnought sea squadrons and the new gelberhaus cruisers the last word in maritime mobility of what avail is loyal devotion plus halfadozen warships one keel to ten scattered over one or two ocean coasts  ah but theyll build said the fisherman confidently theyll build theyre only waiting to enlarge their dockyard accommodation and get the right class of artificers and engineers and workmen together  the money will be forthcoming somehow and theyll start in and build  and do you suppose asked yeovil in slow bitter contempt that the victorious nation is going to sit and watch and wait till the defeated foe has created a new war fleet big enough to drive it from the seas  do you suppose it is going to watch keel added to keel gun to gun airship to airship till its preponderance has been wiped out or even threatened that sort of thing is done once in a generation not twice  who is going to protect australia or new zealand while they enlarge their dockyards and hangars and build their dreadnoughts and their airships  heres my station and im not sorry said the fisherman gathering his tackle together and rising to depart ive listened to you long enough you and me wouldnt agree not if we was to talk all day  fact is im an outandout patriot and youre only a halfhearted one  thats what you are halfhearted  and with that parting shot he left the carriage and lounged heavily down the platform a patriot who had never handled a rifle or mounted a horse or pulled an oar but who had never flinched from demolishing his countrys enemies with his tongue  england has never had any lack of patriots of that type thought yeovil sadly so many patriots and so little patriotism     chapter xiii torywood   yeovil got out of the train at a small clean wayside station and rapidly formed the conclusion that neatness abundant leisure and a devotion to the cultivation of wallflowers and wyandottes were the prevailing influences of the stationmasters life  the train slid away into the hazy distance of trees and meadows and left the traveller standing in a world that seemed to be made up in equal parts of rock garden chicken coops and whiskey advertisements  the stationmaster who appeared also to act as emergency porter took yeovils ticket with the gesture of a kindhearted person brushing away a troublesome wasp and returned to a study of the poultry chronicle which was giving its readers sage counsel concerning the ailments of belated july chickens yeovil called to mind the stationmaster of a tiny railway town in siberia who had held him in long and rather intelligent converse on the poetical merits and demerits of shelley and he wondered what the result would be if he were to engage the english official in a discussion on lermontoffor for the matter of that on shelley  the temptation to experiment was however removed by the arrival of a young groom with brown eyes and a friendly smile who hurried into the station and took yeovil once more into a world where he was of fleeting importance  in the roadway outside was a fourwheeled dogcart with a pair of the famous torywood blue roans  it was an agreeable variation in modern locomotion to be met at a station with highclass horseflesh instead of the ubiquitous motor and the landscape was not of such a nature that one wished to be whirled through it in a cloud of dust  after a quick spin of some ten or fifteen minutes through twisting hedgegirt country roads the roans turned in at a wide gateway and went with dancing rhythmic step along the park drive  the screen of oakcrowned upland suddenly fell away and a grey sharpcornered building came into view in a setting of low growing beeches and dark pines  torywood was not a stately reposefullooking house it lay amid the sleepy landscape like a couched watchdog with pricked ears and wakeful eyes  built somewhere about the last years of dutch williams reign it had been a centre ever since for the political life of the countryside a storm centre of discontent or a rallying ground for the well affected as the circumstances of the day might entail  on the stoneflagged terrace in front of the house with its quaint leaden figures of diana pursuing a houndpressed stag successive squires and lords of torywood had walked to and fro with their friends watching the thunderclouds on the political horizon or the shifting shadows on the sundial of political favour tapping the political barometer for indications of change working out a party campaign or arranging for the support of some national movement  to and fro they had gone in their respective generations men with the passion for statecraft and political combat strong in their veins and many oft recurring names had echoed under those wakefullooking casements names spoken in anger or exultation or murmured in fear and anxiety bolingbroke charles edward walpole the farmer king bonaparte pitt wellington peel gladstoneecho and time might have graven those names on the stone flags and grey walls  and now one tired old woman walked there with names on her lips that she never uttered  a friendly riot of fox terriers and spaniels greeted the carriage leaping and rolling and yelping in an exuberance of sociability as though horses and coachman and groom were comrades who had been absent for long months instead of half an hour  an indiscriminately affectionate puppy lay flat and whimpering at yeovils feet sending up little showers of gravel with its wildly thumping tail while two of the terriers raced each other madly across lawn and shrubbery as though to show the blue roans what speed really was  the laughingeyed young groom disentangled the puppy from between yeovils legs and then he was ushered into the grey silence of the entrance hall leaving sunlight and noise and the stir of life behind him  her ladyship will see you in her writing room he was told and he followed a servant along the dark passages to the wellremembered room  there was something tragic in the sudden contrast between the vigour and youth and pride of life that yeovil had seen crystallised in those dancing highstepping horses scampering dogs and alert cleanlimbed young menservants and the agefrail woman who came forward to meet him  eleanor dowager lady greymarten had for more than half a century been the ruling spirit at torywood  the affairs of the county had not sufficed for her untiring activities of mind and body in the wider field of national and imperial service she had worked and schemed and fought with an energy and a farsightedness that came probably from the blend of caution and bold restlessness in her scottish blood  for many educated minds the arena of politics and public life is a weariness of dust and disgust to others it is a fascinating study to be watched from the comfortable seat of a spectator  to her it was a home  in her town house or down at torywood with her writingpad on her knee and the telephone at her elbow or in personal counsel with some trusted colleague or persuasive argument with a halting adherent or halfconvinced opponent she had laboured on behalf of the poor and the illequipped had fought for her idea of the right and above all for the safety and sanity of her fatherland  spadework when necessary and leadership when called for came alike within the scope of her activities and not least of her achievements though perhaps she hardly realised it was the force of her example a lone indomitable fighter calling to the halfcaring and the halfdiscouraged to the laggard and the slowmoving  and now she came across the room with the tired step of a tired king and that look which the french so expressively called lair defait  the charm which heaven bestows on old ladies reserving its highest gift to the end had always seemed in her case to be lost sight of in the dignity and interest of a great dame who was still in the full prime of her fighting and ruling powers  now in yeovils eyes she had suddenly come to be very old stricken with the forlorn languor of one who knows that death will be weary to wait for  she had spared herself nothing in the long labour the ceaseless building the watch and ward and in one short autumn week she had seen the overthrow of all that she had built the falling asunder of the world in which she had laboured  her lifes end was like a harvest home when blight and storm have laid waste the fruit of long toil and unsparing outlay  victory had been her goal the death or victory of old heroic challenge for she had always dreamed to die fighting to the last death or victoryand the gods had given her neither only the bitterness of a defeat that could not be measured in words and the weariness of a life that had outlived happiness or hope such was eleanor dowager lady greymarten a shadow amid the young red blooded life at torywood but a shadow that was too real to die a shadow that was stronger than the substance that surrounded it  yeovil talked long and hurriedly of his late travels of the vast siberian forests and rivers the desolate tundras the lakes and marshes where the wild swans rear their broods the flower carpet of the summer fields and the winter icemantle of russias northern sea  he talked as a man talks who avoids the subject that is uppermost in his mind and in the mind of his hearer as one who looks away from a wound or deformity that is too cruel to be taken notice of  tea was served in a long oakpanelled gallery where generations of mustelfords had romped and played as children and remained yet in effigy in a collection of more or less faithful portraits  after tea yeovil was taken by his hostess to the aviaries which constituted the sole claim which torywood possessed to being considered a show place  the third earl of greymarten had collected rare and interesting birds somewhere about the time when gilbert white was penning the last of his deathless letters and his successors in the title had perpetuated the hobby  little lawns and ponds and shrubberies were partitioned off for the various groundloving species and higher cages with interlacing perches and rockwork shelves accommodated the birds whose natural expression of movement was on the wing  quails and francolins scurried about under lowgrowing shrubs peacockpheasants strutted and sunned themselves pugnacious ruffs engaged in perfunctory battles from force of habit now that the rivalry of the mating season was over choughs ravens and loudthroated gulls occupied sections of a vast rockery and brighthued chinese pondherons and delicately stepping egrets waded among the waterlilies of a marbleterraced tank  one or two dusky shapes seen dimly in the recesses of a large cage built round a hollow tree would be lively owls when evening came on  in the course of his many wanderings yeovil had himself contributed three or four inhabitants to this little feathered town and he went round the enclosures renewing old acquaintances and examining new additions  the falcon cage is empty said lady greymarten pointing to a large wired dome that towered high above the other enclosures i let the lanner fly free one day  the other birds may be reconciled to their comfortable quarters and abundant food and absence of dangers but i dont think all those things could make up to a falcon for the wild range of cliff and desert  when one has lost ones own liberty one feels a quicker sympathy for other caged things i suppose  there was silence for a moment and then the dowager went on in a wistful passionate voice  i am an old woman now murrey i must die in my cage  i havent the strength to fight  age is a very real and very cruel thing though we may shut our eyes to it and pretend it is not there  i thought at one time that i should never really know what it meant what it brought to one  i thought of it as a messenger that one could keep waiting out in the yard till the very last moment  i know now what it means     but you murrey you are young you can fight  are you going to be a fighter or the very humble servant of the fait accompli  i shall never be the servant of the fait accompli said yeovil  i loathe it  as to fighting one must first find out what weapon to use and how to use it effectively  one must watch and wait  one must not wait too long said the old woman  time is on their side not ours  it is the young people we must fight for now if they are ever to fight for us  a new generation will spring up a weaker memory of old glories will survive the eclat of the ruling race will capture young imaginations  if i had your youth murrey and your sex i would become a commercial traveller  a commercial traveller exclaimed yeovil  yes one whose business took him up and down the country into contact with all classes into homes and shops and inns and railway carriages and as i travelled i would work work on the minds of every boy and girl i came across every young father and young mother too every young couple that were going to be man and wife  i would awaken or keep alive in their memory the things that we have been the grand brave things that some of our race have done and i would stir up a longing a determination for the future that we must win back  i would be a counter agent to the agents of the fait accompli  in course of time the government would find out what i was doing and i should be sent out of the country but i should have accomplished something and others would carry on the work  that is what i would do  murrey even if it is to be a losing battle fight it fight it  yeovil knew that the old lady was fighting her last battle rallying the discouraged and spurring on the backward  a footman came to announce that the carriage waited to take him back to the station  his hostess walked with him through the hall and came out on to the stoneflagged terrace the terrace from which a former lady greymarten had watched the twinkling bonfires that told of waterloo  yeovil said goodbye to her as she stood there a wan shrunken shadow yet with a greater strength and reality in her flickering life than those parrot men and women that fluttered and chattered through london drawing rooms and theatre foyers  as the carriage swung round a bend in the drive yeovil looked back at torywood a lone grey building couched like a watchdog with pricked ears and wakeful eyes in the midst of the sleeping landscape  an old pleading voice was still ringing in his ears     imperious and yet forlorn    came through the silence of the trees    the echoes of a golden horn    calling to distances  somehow yeovil knew that he would never hear that voice again and he knew too that he would hear it always with its message be a fighter  and he knew now with a shamefaced consciousness that sprang suddenly into existence that the summons would sound for him in vain  the weary braintorturing months of fever had left their trail behind a lassitude of spirit and a sluggishness of blood a quenching of the desire to roam and court adventure and hardship  in the hours of waking and depression between the raging intervals of delirium he had speculated with a sort of detached listless indifference on the chances of his getting back to life and strength and energy  the prospect of filling a corner of some lonely siberian graveyard or finnish cemetery had seemed near realisation at times and for a man who was already half dead the other half didnt particularly matter  but when he had allowed himself to dwell on the more hopeful side of the case it had always been a complete recovery that awaited him the same yeovil as of yore a little thinner and more lined about the eyes perhaps would go through life in the same way alert resolute enterprising ready to start off at short notice for some desert or upland where the eagles were circling and the wildfowl were calling  he had not reckoned that death evaded and held off by the doctors skill might exact a compromise and that only part of the man would go free to the west  and now he began to realise how little of mental and physical energy he could count on  his own country had never seemed in his eyes so comfort yielding and tobedesired as it did now when it had passed into alien keeping and become a prison land as much as a homeland  london with its thin mockery of a season and its chattering horde of emptyhearted self seekers held no attraction for him but the spell of english country life was weaving itself round him now that the charm of the desert was receding into a mist of memories  the waning of pleasant autumn days in an english woodland the whir of game birds in the clean harvested fields the grey moist mornings in the saddle with the magical cry of hounds coming up from some misty hollow and then the delicious abandon of physical weariness in bathroom and bedroom after a long run and the heavenly snatched hour of luxurious sleep before stirring back to life and hunger the coming of the dinner hour and the jollity of a wellchosen houseparty  that was the call which was competing with that other trumpetcall and yeovil knew on which side his choice would incline     chapter xiv a perfectly glorious afternoon   it was one of the last days of july cooled and freshened by a touch of rain and dropping back again to a languorous warmth  london looked at its summer best rainwashed and sunlit with the maximum of coming and going in its more fashionable streets  cicely yeovil sat in a screened alcove of the anchorage restaurant a feedingground which had lately sprung into favour  opposite her sat ronnie confronting the ruins of what had been a dish of prawns in aspic cool and clean and freshcoloured he was good to look on in the eyes of his companion and yet perhaps there was a ruffle in her soul that called for some answering disturbance on the part of that superbly tranquil young man and certainly called in vain  cicely had set up for herself a fetish of onyx with eyes of jade and doubtless hungered at times with an unreasonable but perfectly natural hunger for something of flesh and blood  it was the religion of her life to know exactly what she wanted and to see that she got it but there was no possible guarantee against her occasionally experiencing a desire for something else  it is the golden rule of all religions that no one should really live up to their precepts when a man observes the principles of his religion too exactly he is in immediate danger of founding a new sect  today is going to be your day of triumph said cicely to the young man who was wondering at the moment whether he would care to embark on an artichoke i believe im more nervous than you are she added and yet i rather hate the idea of you scoring a great success  why asked ronnie diverting his mind for a moment from the artichoke question and its ramifications of sauce hollandaise or vinaigre  i like you as you are said cicely just a nicelooking boy to flatter and spoil and pretend to be fond of  youve got a charming young body and youve no soul and thats such a fascinating combination  if you had a soul you would either dislike or worship me and id much rather have things as they are  and now you are going to go a step beyond that and other people will applaud you and say that you are wonderful and invite you to eat with them and motor with them and yacht with them  as soon as that begins to happen ronnie a lot of other things will come to an end  of course ive always known that you dont really care for me but as soon as the world knows it you are irrevocably damaged as a plaything  that is the great secret that binds us together the knowledge that we have no real affection for one another  and this afternoon every one will know that you are a great artist and no great artist was ever a great lover  i shant be difficult to replace anyway said ronnie with what he imagined was a becoming modesty there are lots of boys standing round ready to be fed and flattered and put on an imaginary pedestal most of them more or less goodlooking and well turned out and amusing to talk to  oh i dare say i could find a successor for your vacated niche said cicely lightly one thing im determined on though he shant be a musician  its so unsatisfactory to have to share a grand passion with a grand piano  he shall be a delightful young barbarian who would think saint saens was a derby winner or a claret  dont be in too much of a hurry to replace me said ronnie who did not care to have his successor too seriously discussed  i may not score the success you expect this afternoon  my dear boy a minor crowned head from across the sea is coming to hear you play and that alone will count as a success with most of your listeners  also ive secured a real duchess for you which is rather an achievement in the london of today  an english duchess asked ronnie who had early in life learned to apply the merchandise marks act to ducal titles  english oh certainly at least as far as the title goes she was born under the constellation of the starspangled banner  i dont suppose the duke approves of her being here lending her countenance to the fait accompli but when youve got republican blood in your veins a kaiser is quite as attractive a lodestar as a king rather more so  and canon mousepace is coming continued cicely referring to a closelywritten list of guests the excellent von tolb has been attending his church lately and the canon is longing to meet her  she is just the sort of person he adores  i fancy he sincerely realises how difficult it will be for the rich to enter the kingdom of heaven and he tries to make up for it by being as nice as possible to them in this world  ronnie held out his hand for the list  i think you know most of the others said cicely passing it to him  leutnant von gabelroth read out ronnie who is he  in one of the hussar regiments quartered here a friend of the grafins ugly but amiable and im told a good crosscountry rider  i suppose murrey will be disgusted at meeting the outward and visible sign under his roof but these encounters are inevitable as long as he is in london  i didnt know murrey was coming said ronnie  i believe hes going to look in on us said cicely its just as well you know otherwise we should have joan asking in her loudest voice when he was going to be back in england again  i havent asked her but she overheard the grafin arranging to come and hear you play and i fancy that will be quite enough  how about some turkish coffee said ronnie who had decided against the artichoke  turkish coffee certainly and a cigarette and a moments peace before the serious business of the afternoon claims us  talking about peace do you know ronnie it has just occurred to me that we have left out one of the most important things in our affaire we have never had a quarrel  i hate quarrels said ronnie they are so domesticated  thats the first time ive ever heard you talk about your home said cicely  i fancy it would apply to most homes said ronnie  the last boyfriend i had used to quarrel furiously with me at least once a week said cicely reflectively but then he had dark slumberous eyes that lit up magnificently when he was angry so it would have been a sheer waste of gods good gifts not to have sent him into a passion now and then  with your excursions into the past and the future you are making me feel dreadfully like an instalment of a serial novel protested ronnie we have now got to synopsis of earlier chapters  it shant be teased said cicely we will live in the present and go no further into the future than to make arrangements for tuesdays dinner party  ive asked the duchess she would never have forgiven me if shed found out that i had a crowned head dining with me and hadnt asked her to meet him        a sudden hush descended on the company gathered in the great drawingroom at berkshire street as ronnie took his seat at the piano the voice of canon mousepace outlasted the others for a moment or so and then subsided into a regretful but gracious silence  for the next nine or ten minutes ronnie held possession of the crowded room a tense slender figure with cold green eyes aflame in a sudden fire and smooth burnished head bent low over the keyboard that yielded a disciplined riot of melody under his strong deft fingers  the worldweary landgraf forgot for the moment the regrettable trend of his subjects towards parliamentary socialism the excellent grafin von tolb forgot all that the canon had been saying to her for the last ten minutes forgot the depressing certainty that he would have a great deal more that he wanted to say in the immediate future over and above the thirtyfive minutes or so of discourse that she would contract to listen to next sunday  and cicely listened with the wistful equivocal triumph of one whose goose has turned out to be a swan and who realises with secret concern that she has only planned the role of goosegirl for herself  the last chords died away the fire faded out of the jadecoloured eyes and ronnie became once more a wellgroomed youth in a drawingroom full of welldressed people  but around him rose an explosive clamour of applause and congratulation the sincere tribute of appreciation and the equally hearty expression of imitative homage  it is a great gift a great gift chanted canon mousepace you must put it to a great use  a talent is vouchsafed to us for a purpose you must fulfil the purpose  talent such as yours is a responsibility you must meet that responsibility  the dictionary of the english language was an inexhaustible quarry from which the canon had hewn and fashioned for himself a great reputation  you must gom and blay to me at schlachsenberg said the kindlyfaced landgraf whom the world adored and thwarted in about equal proportions at christmas yes that will be a good time  we still keep the christ fest at schlachsenberg though the sozi keep telling our schoolchildren that it is only a christ myth  never mind i will have the vicepresident of our landtag to listen to you he is sozi but we are good friends outside the parliament house you shall blay to him my young friendt and gonfince him that there is a got in heaven  you will gom  yes  it was beautiful said the grafin simply it made me cry  go back to the piano again please at once  perhaps the near neighbourhood of the canon inspired this command but the grafin had been genuinely charmed  she adored good music and she was unaffectedly fond of goodlooking boys  ronnie went back to the piano and tasted the matured pleasure of a repeated success  any measure of nervousness that he may have felt at first had completely passed away  he was sure of his audience and he played as though they did not exist  a renewed clamour of excited approval attended the conclusion of his performance  it is a triumph a perfectly glorious triumph exclaimed the duchess of dreyshire turning to yeovil who sat silent among his wifes guests isnt it just glorious she demanded with a heavy insistent intonation of the word  is it said yeovil  well isnt it she cried with a rising inflection isnt it just perfectly glorious  i dont know confessed yeovil you see glory hasnt come very much my way lately  then before he exactly realised what he was doing he raised his voice and quoted loudly for the benefit of half the room     other romans shall arise    heedless of a soldiers name    sounds not deeds shall win the prize    harmony the path to fame  there was a sort of shiver of surprised silence at yeovils end of the room  hell  the word rang out in a strong young voice  hell  and its true thats the worst of it  its damned true  yeovil turned with some dozen others to see who was responsible for this vigorously expressed statement  tony luton confronted him an angry scowl on his face a blaze in his heavylidded eyes  the boy was without a conscience almost without a soul as priests and parsons reckon souls but there was a slumbering devilgod within him and yeovils taunting words had broken the slumber life had been for tony a hard school in which right and wrong high endeavour and good resolve were untaught subjects but there was a sterling something in him just that something that helped poor street scavenged men to die bravefronted deaths in the trenches of salamanca that fired a handful of apprentice boys to shut the gates of derry and stare unflinchingly at grim leaguer and starvation  it was just that nameless something that was lacking in the young musician who stood at the further end of the room bathed in a flood of compliment and congratulation enjoying the honeydrops of his triumph  luton pushed his way through the crowd and left the room without troubling to take leave of his hostess  what a strange young man exclaimed the duchess now do take me into the next room she went on almost in the same breath im just dying for some iced coffee  yeovil escorted her through the throng of ronnieworshippers to the desired haven of refreshment  marvellous mrs menteithmendlesohnn was exclaiming in ringing trumpet tones of course i always knew he could play but this is not mere piano playing it is tonemastery it is sound magic  mrs yeovil has introduced us to a new star in the musical firmament  do you know i feel this afternoon just like cortez in the poem gazing at the newly discovered sea  silent upon a peak in darien quoted a penetrating voice that could only belong to joan mardle i say can any one picture mrs menteith mendlesohnn silent on any peak or under any circumstances  if any one had that measure of imagination no one acknowledged the fact  a great gift and a great responsibility canon mousepace was assuring the grafin the power of evoking sublime melody is akin to the power of awakening thought a musician can appeal to dormant consciousness as the preacher can appeal to dormant conscience  it is a responsibility an instrument for good or evil  our young friend here we may be sure will use it as an instrument for good  he has i feel certain a sense of his responsibility  he is a nice boy said the grafin simply he has such pretty hair  in one of the window recesses rhapsodie pantril was talking vaguely but beautifully to a small audience on the subject of chromatic chords she had the advantage of knowing what she was talking about an advantage that her listeners did not in the least share  all through his playing there ran a tonenote of malachite green she declared recklessly feeling safe from immediate contradiction malachite green my colourthe colour of striving  having satisfied the ruling passion that demanded gentle and dextrous selfadvertisement she realised that the augusta smith in her craved refreshment and moved with one of her overawed admirers towards the haven where peaches and iced coffee might be considered a certainty  the refreshment alcove which was really a goodsized room a sort of chapelofease to the larger drawingroom was already packed with a crowd who felt that they could best discuss ronnies triumph between mouthfuls of fruit salad and iced draughts of hockcup  so brief is human glory that two or three independent souls had even now drifted from the theme of the moment on to other more personally interesting topics  iced mulberry salad my dear its a specialite de la maison so to speak they say the roving husband brought the recipe from astrakhan or seville or some such outlandish place  i wish my husband would roam about a bit and bring back strange palatable dishes  no such luck hes got asthma and has to keep on a gravel soil with a south aspect and all sorts of other restrictions  i dont think youre to be pitied in the least a husband with asthma is like a captive golfball you can always put your hand on him when you want him  all the hangings violette de parme all the furniture rosewood nothing is to be played in it except mozart  mozart only  some of my friends wanted me to have a replica of the mozart statue at vienna put up in a corner of the room with flowers always around it but i really couldnt  i couldnt  one is so tired of it one sees it everywhere  i couldnt do it  im like that you know  yes ive secured the hero of the hour ronnie storre oh yes rather hes going to join our yachting trip third week of august  were going as far afield as fiume in the adriaticor is it the aegean  wont it be jolly  oh no were not asking mrs yeovil its quite a small yacht you knowat least its a small party  the excellent von tolb took her departure bearing off with her the landgraf who had already settled the date and duration of ronnies christmas visit  it will be dull you know he warned the prospective guest our landtag will not be sitting and what is a beargarden without the bears however we haf some wildt schwein in our woods we can show you some sport in that way  ronnie instantly saw himself in a wellfitting shooting costume with a tyrolese hat placed at a very careful angle on his head but he confessed that the other details of boarhunting were rather beyond him  with the departure of the von tolb party canon mousepace gravitated decently but persistently towards a corner where the duchess still at concert pitch was alternatively praising ronnies performance and the mulberry salad  joan mardle who formed one of the group was not openly praising any one but she was paying a silent tribute to the salad  we were just talking about ronnie storres music canon said the duchess i consider it just perfectly glorious  its a great talent isnt it canon put in joan briskly and of course its a responsibility as well dont you think  music can be such an influence just as eloquence can dont you agree with me  the quarry of the english language was of course a public property but it was disconcerting to have ones own particular barrowload of sentence building material carried off before ones eyes  the canons impressive homily on ronnies gift and its possibilities had to be hastily whittled down to a weakly acquiescent quite so quite so  have you tasted this iced mulberry salad canon asked the duchess its perfectly luscious  just hurry along and get some before its all gone  and her grace hurried along in an opposite direction to thank cicely for past favours and to express lively gratitude for the tuesday to come  the guests departed with a rather irritating slowness for which perhaps the excellence of cicelys buffet arrangements was partly responsible the great drawingroom seemed to grow larger and more oppressive as the human wave receded and the hostess fled at last with some relief to the narrower limits of her writingroom and the sedative influences of a cigarette  she was inclined to be sorry for herself the triumph of the afternoon had turned out much as she had predicted at lunch time  her idol of onyx had not been swept from its pedestal but the pedestal itself had an air of being packed up ready for transport to some other temple  ronnie would be flattered and spoiled by half a hundred people just because he could conjure sounds out of a keyboard and cicely felt no great incentive to go on flattering and spoiling him herself  and ronnie would acquiesce in his dismissal with the good grace born of indifferencethe surest guarantor of perfect manners  already he had social engagements for the coming months in which she had no share the drifting apart would be mutual  he had been an intelligent and amusing companion and he had played the game as she had wished it to be played without the fatigue of keeping up pretences which neither of them could have believed in  let us have a wonderfully good time together had been the single stipulation in their unwritten treaty of comradeship and they had had the good time  their wholehearted pursuit of material happiness would go on as keenly as before but they would hunt in different company that was all  yes that was all     cicely found the effect of her cigarette less sedative than she was disposed to exact  it might be necessary to change the brand  some ten or eleven days later yeovil read an announcement in the papers that in spite of handsome offers of increased salary mr tony luton the original singer of the popular ditty eccleston square had terminated his engagement with messrs isaac grosvenor and leon hebhardt of the caravansery theatre and signed on as a deck hand in the canadian marine  perhaps after all there had been some shred of glory amid the trumpet triumph of that july afternoon     chapter xv the intelligent anticipator of wants   two of yeovils london clubs the two that he had been accustomed to frequent had closed their doors after the catastrophe  one of them had perished from off the face of the earth its fittings had been sold and its papers lay stored in some solicitors office a titbit of material for the pen of some future historian  the other had transplanted itself to delhi whither it had removed its early georgian furniture and its traditions and sought to reproduce its st jamess street atmosphere as nearly as the conditions of a tropical asiatic city would permit  there remained the cartwheel a considerably newer institution which had sprung into existence somewhere about the time of yeovils last sojourn in england he had joined it on the solicitation of a friend who was interested in the venture and his bankers had paid his subscription during his absence  as he had never been inside its doors there could be no depressing comparisons to make between its present state and aforetime glories and yeovil turned into its portals one afternoon with the adventurous detachment of a man who breaks new ground and challenges new experiences  he entered with a diffident sense of intrusion conscious that his standing as a member might not be recognised by the keepers of the doors in a moment however he realised that a rajahs escort of elephants might almost have marched through the entrance hall and vestibule without challenge  the general atmosphere of the scene suggested a blend of the railway station at cologne the hotel bristol in any european capital and the second act in most musical comedies  a score of brilliant and brilliantined pages decorated the foreground while hebraiclooking gentlemen wearing tartan waistcoats of the clans of their adoption flitted restlessly between the tape machines and telephone boxes  the army of occupation had obviously established a firm footing in the hospitable premises a kaleidoscopic pattern of uniforms skyblue indigo and bottlegreen relieved the civilian attire of the groups that clustered in lounge and card rooms and corridors  yeovil rapidly came to the conclusion that the joys of membership were not for him  he had turned to go after a very cursory inspection of the premises and their human occupants when he was hailed by a young man dressed with strenuous neatness whom he remembered having met in past days at the houses of one or two common friends  hubert herltons parents had brought him into the world and some twenty one years later had put him into a motor business  having taken these pardonable liberties they had completely exhausted their ideas of what to do with him and hubert seemed unlikely to develop any ideas of his own on the subject  the motor business elected to conduct itself without his connivance journalism the stage tomato culture without capital and other professions that could be entered on at short notice were submitted to his consideration by nimbleminded relations and friends  he listened to their suggestions with polite indifference being rude only to a cousin who demonstrated how he might achieve a settled income of from two hundred to a thousand pounds a year by the propagation of mushrooms in a london basement  while his walk in life was still an undetermined promenade his parents died leaving him with a carefullyinvested income of thirtyseven pounds a year  at that point of his career yeovils knowledge of him stopped short the journey to siberia had taken him beyond the range of herltons domestic vicissitudes  the young man greeted him in a decidedly friendly manner  i didnt know you were a member here he exclaimed  its the first time ive ever been in the club said yeovil and i fancy it will be the last  there is rather too much of the fighting machine in evidence here  one doesnt want a perpetual reminder of what has happened staring one in the face  we tried at first to keep the alien element out said herlton apologetically but we couldnt have carried on the club if wed stuck to that line  you see wed lost more than twothirds of our old members so we couldnt afford to be exclusive  as a matter of fact the whole thing was decided over our heads a new syndicate took over the concern and a new committee was installed with a good many foreigners on it  i know its horrid having these uniforms flaunting all over the place but what is one to do  yeovil said nothing with the air of a man who could have said a great deal  i suppose you wonder why remain a member under those conditions continued herlton  well as far as i am concerned a place like this is a necessity for me  in fact its my profession my source of income  are you as good at bridge as all that asked yeovil im a fairly successful player myself but i should be sorry to have to live on my winnings year in year out  i dont play cards said herlton at least not for serious stakes  my winnings or losings wouldnt come to a tenner in an average year  no i live by commissions by introducing likely buyers to wouldbe sellers  sellers of what asked yeovil  anything everything horses yachts old masters plate shootings poultryfarms weekend cottages motor cars almost anything you can think of  look and he produced from his breast pocket a bulky note book illusorily inscribed engagements  here he explained tapping the book ive got a double entry of every likely client that i know with a note of the things he may have to sell and the things he may want to buy  when it is something that he has for sale there are crossreferences to likely purchasers of that particular line of article  i dont limit myself to things that i actually know people to be in want of i go further than that and have theories carefully indexed theories as to the things that people might want to buy  at the right moment if i can get the opportunity i mention the article that is in my minds eye to the possible purchaser who has also been in my minds eye and i frequently bring off a sale  i started a chance acquaintance on a career of printbuying the other day merely by telling him of a couple of good prints that i knew of that were to be had at a quite reasonable price he is a man with more money than he knows what to do with and he has laid out quite a lot on old prints since his first purchase  most of his collection he has got through me and of course i net a commission on each transaction  so you see old man how useful not to say necessary a club with a large membership is to me  the more mixed and socially chaotic it is the more serviceable it is  of course said yeovil and i suppose as a matter of fact a good many of your clients belong to the conquering race  well you see they are the people who have got the money said herlton i dont mean to say that the invading germans are usually people of wealth but while they live over here they escape the crushing taxation that falls on the britishborn subject  they serve their country as soldiers and we have to serve it in garrison money ship money and so forth besides the ordinary taxes of the state  the german shoulders the rifle the englishman has to shoulder everything else  that is what will help more than anything towards the gradual germanising of our big towns the comparatively lightlytaxed german workman over here will have a much bigger spending power and purchasing power than his heavily taxed english neighbour  the publichouses bars eatinghouses places of amusement and so forth will come to cater more and more for moneyyielding german patronage  the stream of british emigration will swell rather than diminish and the stream of teuton immigration will be equally persistent and progressive  yes the militaryservice ordinance was a cunning stroke on the part of that old fox von kwarl  as a civilian statesman he is far and away cleverer than bismarck was he smothers with a featherbed where bismarck would have tried to smash with a sledgehammer  have you got me down on your list of noteworthy people asked yeovil turning the drift of the conversation back to the personal topic  certainly i have said herlton turning the pages of his pocket directory to the letter y  as soon as i knew you were back in england i made several entries concerning you  in the first place it was possible that you might have a volume on siberian travel and natural history notes to publish and ive crossreferenced you to a publisher i know who rather wants books of that sort on his list  i may tell you at once that ive no intentions in that direction said yeovil in some amusement  just as well said herlton cheerfully scribbling a hieroglyphic in his book that branch of business is rather outside my linetoo little in it and the gratitude of author and publisher for being introduced to one another is usually shortlived  a more serious entry was the item that if you were wintering in england you would be looking out for a hunter or two  you used to hunt with the east wessex i remember ive got just the very animal that will suit that country ready waiting for you  a beautiful clean jumper  ive put it over a fence or two myself and you and i ride much the same weight  a stiffish price is being asked for it but ive got the letters do after your name  in heavens name said yeovil now openly grinning before i die of curiosity tell me what do stands for  it means some one who doesnt object to pay a good price for anything that really suits him  there are some people of course who wont consider a thing unless they can get it for about a third of what they imagine to be its market value  ive got another suggestion down against you in my book you may not be staying in the country at all you may be clearing out in disgust at existing conditions  in that case you would be selling a lot of things that you wouldnt want to cart away with you that involves another set of entries and a whole lot of cross references  im afraid ive given you a lot of trouble said yeovil drily  not at all said herlton but it would simplify matters if we take it for granted that you are going to stay here for this winter anyhow and are looking out for hunters  can you lunch with me here on wednesday and come and look at the animal afterwards  its only thirtyfive minutes by train  it will take us longer if we motor  there is a two fiftythree from charing cross that we could catch comfortably  if you are going to persuade me to hunt in the east wessex country this season said yeovil you must find me a convenient hunting box somewhere down there  i have found it said herlton whipping out a stylograph and hastily scribbling an order to view on a card central as possible for all the meets grand stabling accommodation excellent watersupply big bathroom game larder cellarage a bakehouse if you want to bake your own bread  any land with it  not enough to be a nuisance  an acre or two of paddock and about the same of garden  you are fond of wild things a wood comes down to the edge of the garden a wood that harbours owls and buzzards and kestrels  have you got all those details in your book asked yeovil wood adjoining property obk  i keep those details in my head said herlton but they are quite reliable  i shall insist on something substantial off the rent if there are no buzzards said yeovil now that you have mentioned them they seem an indispensable accessory to any decent huntingbox  look he exclaimed catching sight of a plump middleaged individual crossing the vestibule with an air of restrained importance there goes the delectable pitherby  does he come on your books at all  i should say exclaimed herlton fervently  the delectable p nourishes expectations of a barony or viscounty at an early date  most of his life has been spent in streets and squares with occasional migrations to the esplanades of fashionable wateringplaces or the gravelled walks of country house gardens  now that noblesse is about to impose its obligations on him quite a new catalogue of wants has sprung into his mind  there are things that a plain esquire may leave undone without causing scandalised remark but a fiercer light beats on a baron triggerpulling is one of the obligations  up to the present pitherby has never hit a partridge in anger but this year he has commissioned me to rent him a deer forest  some pedigree herefords for his home farm was another commission and a dozen and a half swans for a swannery  the swannery i may say was my idea i said once in his hearing that it gave a baronial air to an estate you see i knew a man who had got a lot of surplus swan stock for sale  now pitherby wants a heronry as well  ive put him in communication with a client of mine who suffers from superfluous herons but of course i cant guarantee that the birds nesting arrangements will fall in with his territorial requirement  im getting him some carp too of quite respectable age for a carp pond i thought it would look so well for his ladywife to be discovered by interviewers feeding the carp with her own fair hands and i put the same idea into pitherbys mind  i had no idea that so many things were necessary to endorse a patent of nobility said yeovil  if there should be any miscarriage in the bestowal of the honour at least pitherby will have absolved himself from any charge of contributory negligence  shall we say wednesday here one oclock lunch first and go down and look at the horse afterwards said herlton returning to the matter in hand  yeovil hesitated then he nodded his head  there is no harm in going to look at the animal he said     chapter xvi sunrise   mrs kerrick sat at a little teakwood table in the verandah of a low pitched teakbuilt house that stood on the steep slope of a brown hillside  her youngest child with the grave natural dignity of nine year old girlhood maintained a correct but observant silence looking carefully yet unobtrusively after the wants of the one guest and checking from time to time the incursions of ubiquitous ants that were obstinately disposed to treat the tablecloth as a foraging ground  the wayfaring visitor who was experiencing a british blend of eastern hospitality was a french naturalist travelling thus far afield in quest of feathered specimens to enrich the aviaries of a birdcollecting balkan king  on the previous evening while shrugging his shoulders and unloosing his vocabulary over the meagre accommodation afforded by the native resthouse he had been enchanted by receiving an invitation to transfer his quarters to the house on the hillside where he found not only a pleasantvoiced hostess and some drinkable wine but three brown skinned english youngsters who were able to give him a mass of intelligent firsthand information about the bird life of the region  and now at the early morning breakfast ere yet the sun was showing over the rim of the brownbaked hills he was learning something of the life of the little community he had chanced on  i was in these parts many years ago explained the hostess when my husband was alive and had an appointment out here  it is a healthy hill district and i had pleasant memories of the place so when it became necessary well desirable let us say to leave our english home and find a new one it occurred to me to bring my boys and my little girl heremy eldest girl is at school in paris  labour is cheap here and i try my hand at farming in a small way of course it is very different work to just superintending the dairy and poultryyard arrangements of an english country estate  there are so many things insect ravages bird depredations and so on that one only knows on a small scale in england that happen here in wholesale fashion not to mention droughts and torrential rains and other tropical visitations  and then the domestic animals are so disconcertingly different from the ones one has been used to humped cattle never seem to behave in the way that straightbacked cattle would and goats and geese and chickens are not a bit the same here that they are in europeand of course the farm servants are utterly unlike the same class in england one has to unlearn a good deal of what one thought one knew about stock keeping and agriculture and take note of the native ways of doing things they are primitive and unenterprising of course but they have an accumulated store of experience behind them and one has to tread warily in initiating improvements  the frenchman looked round at the brown sunscorched hills with the dusty empty road showing here and there in the middle distance and other brown sunscorched hills rounding off the scene he looked at the lizards on the verandah walls at the jars for keeping the water cool at the numberless little insectbored holes in the furniture at the heatdrawn lines on his hostesss comely face  notwithstanding his present wanderings he had a frenchmans strong homing instinct and he marvelled to hear this lady who should have been a lively and popular figure in the social circle of some english county town talking serenely of the ways of humped cattle and native servants  and your children how do they like the change he asked  it is healthy up here among the hills said the mother also looking round at the landscape and thinking doubtless of a very different scene they have an outdoor life and plenty of liberty  they have their ponies to ride and there is a lake up above us that is a fine place for them to bathe and boat in the three boys are there now having their morning swim  the eldest is sixteen and he is allowed to have a gun and there is some good wild fowl shooting to be had in the reed beds at the further end of the lake  i think that part of the joy of his shooting expeditions lies in the fact that many of the duck and plover that he comes across belong to the same species that frequent our english moors and rivers  it was the first hint that she had given of a wistful sense of exile the yearning for other skies the message that a dead birds plumage could bring across rolling seas and scorching plains  and the education of your boys how do you manage for that asked the visitor  there is a young tutor living out in these wilds said mrs kerrick he was assistant master at a private school in scotland but it had to be given up whenwhen things changed so many of the boys left the country  he came out to an uncle who has a small estate eight miles from here and three days in the week he rides over to teach my boys and three days he goes to another family living in the opposite direction  to day he is due to come here  it is a great boon to have such an opportunity for getting the boys educated and of course it helps him to earn a living  and the society of the place asked the frenchman  his hostess laughed  i must admit it has to be looked for with a strong pair of fieldglasses she said it is almost as difficult to get a good bridge four together as it would have been to get up a tennis tournament or a subscription dance in our particular corner of england  one has to ignore distances and forget fatigue if one wants to be gregarious even on a limited scale  there are one or two officials who are our chief social mainstays but the difficulty is to muster the few available souls under the same roof at the same moment  a road will be impassable in one quarter a pony will be lame in another a stress of work will prevent some one else from coming and another may be down with a touch of fever when my little girl gave a birthday party here her only little girl guest had come twelve miles to attend it  the forest officer happened to drop in on us that evening so we felt quite festive  the frenchmans eyes grew round in wonder  he had once thought that the capital city of a balkan kingdom was the uttermost limit of social desolation viewed from a parisian standpoint and there at any rate one could get cafe chantant tennis picnic parties an occasional theatre performance by a foreign troupe now and then a travelling circus not to speak of court and diplomatic functions of a more or less sociable character  here it seemed one went a days journey to reach an evenings entertainment and the chance arrival of a tired official took on the nature of a festivity  he looked round again at the rolling stretches of brown hills before he had regarded them merely as the background to this little shutaway world now he saw that they were foreground as well  they were everything there was nothing else  and again his glance travelled to the face of his hostess with its bright pleasant eyes and smiling mouth  and you live here with your children he said here in this wilderness  you leave england you leave everything for this  his hostess rose and took him over to the far side of the verandah  the beginnings of a garden were spread out before them with young fruit trees and flowering shrubs and bushes of pale pink roses  exuberant tropical growths were interspersed with carefully tended vestiges of plants that had evidently been brought from a more temperate climate and had not borne the transition well  bushes and trees and shrubs spread away for some distance to where the ground rose in a small hillock and then fell away abruptly into bare hillside  in all this garden that you see said the englishwoman there is one tree that is sacred  a tree said the frenchman  a tree that we could not grow in england  the frenchman followed the direction of her eyes and saw a tall bare pole at the summit of the hillock  at the same moment the sun came over the hilltops in a deep orange glow and a new light stole like magic over the brown landscape  and as if they had timed their arrival to that exact moment of sunburst three brownfaced boys appeared under the straight bare pole  a cord shivered and flapped and something ran swiftly up into the air and swung out in the breeze that blew across the hillsa blue flag with red and white crosses  the three boys bared their heads and the small girl on the verandah steps stood rigidly to attention  far away down the hill a young man cantering into view round a corner of the dusty road removed his hat in loyal salutation  that is why we live out here said the englishwoman quietly     chapter xvii the event of the season   in the first swelter room of the new osmanli baths in cork street four or five recumbent individuals in a state of moist nudity and selfrespecting inertia were smoking cigarettes or making occasional pretence of reading damp newspapers  a glass wall with a glass door shut them off from the yet more torrid regions of the further swelter chambers another glass partition disclosed the dimlylit vault where other patrons of the establishment had arrived at the stage of being pounded and kneaded and sluiced by orientallooking attendants  the splashing and trickling of taps the flipflap of wet slippers on a wet floor and the low murmur of conversation filtered through glass doors made an appropriately drowsy accompaniment to the scene  a newcomer fluttered into the room beamed at one of the occupants and settled himself with an air of elaborate languor in a long canvas chair cornelian valpy was a fair young man with perpetual surprise impinged on his countenance and a chin that seemed to have retired from competition with the rest of his features  the beam of recognition that he had given to his friend or acquaintance subsided into a subdued but lingering simper  what is the matter drawled his neighbour lazily dropping the end of a cigarette into a small bowl of water and helping himself from a silver case on the table at his side  matter said cornelian opening wide a pair of eyes in which unhealthy intelligence seemed to struggle in undetermined battle with utter vacuity why should you suppose that anything is the matter  when you wear a look of idiotic complacency in a turkish bath said the other it is the more noticeable from the fact that you are wearing nothing else  were you at the shalem house dance last night asked cornelian by way of explaining his air of complacent retrospection  no said the other but i feel as if i had been ive been reading columns about it in the dawn  the last event of the season said cornelian and quite one of the most amusing and lively functions that there have been  so the dawn said but then as shalem practically owns and controls that paper its favourable opinion might be taken for granted  the whole idea of the revel was quite original said cornelian who was not going to have his personal narrative of the event forestalled by anything that a newspaper reporter might have given to the public a certain number of guests went as famous personages in the worlds history and each one was accompanied by another guest typifying the prevailing characteristic of that personage  one man went as julius caesar for instance and had a girl typifying ambition as his shadow another went as louis the eleventh and his companion personified superstition  your shadow had to be someone of the opposite sex you see and every alternate dance throughout the evening you danced with your shadowpartner  quite a clever idea young graf von schnatelstein is supposed to have invented it  new york will be deeply beholden to him said the other shadowdances with all manner of eccentric variations will be the rage there for the next eighteen months  some of the costumes were really sumptuous continued cornelian the duchess of dreyshire was magnificent as aholibah you never saw so many jewels on one person only of course she didnt look dark enough for the character she had billy carnset for her shadow representing unspeakable depravity  how on earth did he manage that  oh a blend of beardsley and bakst as far as getup and costume and of course his own personality counted for a good deal  quite one of the successes of the evening was leutnant von gabelroth as george washington with joan mardle as his shadow typifying inconvenient candour  he put her down officially as truthfulness but every one had heard the other version  good for the gabelroth though he does belong to the invading horde its not often that any one scores off joan  another blaze of magnificence was the loudvoiced bessimer woman as the goddess juno with peacock tails and opals all over her she had ronnie storre to represent greeneyed jealousy  talking of ronnie storre and of jealousy you will naturally wonder whom mrs yeovil went with  i forget what her costume was but shed got that darkheaded youth with her that shes been trotting round everywhere the last few days  cornelians neighbour kicked him furtively on the shin and frowned in the direction of a darkhaired youth reclining in an adjacent chair  the youth in question rose from his seat and stalked into the further swelter room  so clever of him to go into the furnace room said the unabashed cornelian now if he turns scarlet all over we shall never know how much is embarrassment and how much is due to the process of being boiled  la yeovil hasnt done badly by the exchange hes better looking than ronnie  i see that pitherby went as frederick the great said cornelians neighbour fingering a sheet of the dawn  isnt that exactly what one would have expected pitherby to do said cornelian  hes so desperately anxious to announce to all whom it may concern that he has written a life of that hero  he had an uninspiring looking woman with him supposed to represent military genius  the spirit of advertisement would have been more appropriate said the other  the opening scene of the revel was rather effective continued cornelian all the shadow people reclined in the dimlylit centre of the ballroom in an indistinguishable mass and the human characters marched round the illuminated sides of the room to solemn processional music every now and then a shadow would detach itself from the mass hail its partner by name and glide out to join him or her in the procession then when the last shadows had found their mates and every one was partnered the lights were turned up in a blaze the orchestra crashed out a whirl of nondescript dance music and people just let themselves go  it was pandemonium  afterwards every one strutted about for half an hour or so showing themselves off and then the legitimate programme of dances began  there were some rather amusing incidents throughout the evening  one set of lancers was danced entirely by the seven deadly sins and their human exemplars of course seven couples were not sufficient to make up the set so they had to bring in an eighth sin i forget what it was  the sin of patriotism would have been rather appropriate considering who were giving the dance said the other  hush exclaimed cornelian nervously  you dont know who may overhear you in a place like this  youll get yourself into trouble  wasnt there some rather daring new dance of the bunnyhug variety asked the indiscreet one  the cubbycuddle said cornelian three or four adventurous couples danced it towards the end of the evening  the dawn says that without being strikingly new it was strikingly modern  the best description i can give of it said cornelian is summed up in the comment of the grafin von tolb when she saw it being danced if they really love each other i suppose it doesnt matter  by the way he added with apparent indifference is there any detailed account of my costume in the dawn  his companion laughed cynically  as if you hadnt read everything that the dawn and the other morning papers have to say about the ball hours ago  the naked truth should be avoided in a turkish bath said cornelian kindly assume that ive only had time to glance at the weather forecast and the news from china  oh very well said the other your costume isnt described you simply come amid a host of others as mr cornelian valpy resplendent as the emperor nero with him miss kate lerra typifying insensate vanity many hard things have been said of nero but his unkindest critics have never accused him of resembling you in feature  until some very clear evidence is produced i shall refuse to believe it  cornelian was proof against these shafts leaning back gracefully in his chair he launched forth into that detailed description of his last nights attire which the dawn had so unaccountably failed to supply  i wore a tunic of white nepaulese silk with a collar of pearls real pearls  round my waist i had a girdle of twisted serpents in beaten gold studded all over with amethysts  my sandals were of gold laced with scarlet thread and i had seven bracelets of gold on each arm  round my head i had a wreath of golden laurel leaves set with scarlet berries and hanging over my left shoulder was a silk robe of mulberry purple broidered with the signs of the zodiac in gold and scarlet i had it made specially for the occasion  at my side i had an ivorysheathed dagger with a green jade handle hung in a green cordova leather  at this point of the recital his companion rose softly flung his cigarette end into the little waterbowl and passed into the further swelter room  cornelian valpy was left still clothed in a look of ineffable complacency still engaged in all probability in reclothing himself in the finery of the previous evening     chapter xviii the dead who do not understand   the pale light of a november afternoon faded rapidly into the dusk of a november evening  far over the countryside housewives put up their cottage shutters lit their lamps and made the customary remark that the days were drawing in  in barn yards and poultryruns the greediest pullets made a final tour of inspection picking up the stray remaining morsels of the evening meal and then with much scrambling and squawking sought the places on the roostingpole that they thought should belong to them  labourers working in yard and field began to turn their thoughts homeward or tavernward as the case might be  and through the cold squelching slush of a waterlogged meadow a weary bedraggled but unbeaten fox stiffly picked his way climbed a high bramblegrown bank and flung himself into the sheltering labyrinth of a stretching tangle of woods  the pack of fiercemouthed things that had rattled him from copse and gorsecover along fallow and plough hedgerow and wooded lane for nigh on an hour and had pressed hard on his life for the last few minutes receded suddenly into the background of his experiences  the cold wet meadow the thick mask of woods and the oncoming dusk had stayed the chaseand the fox had outstayed it  in a short time he would fall mechanically to licking off some of the mud that caked on his weary pads in a shorter time horsemen and hounds would have drawn off kennelward and homeward  yeovil rode through the deepening twilight relying chiefly on his horse to find its way in the network of hedgebordered lanes that presumably led to a high road or to some human habitation  he was desperately tired after his days hunting a legacy of weakness that the fever had bequeathed to him but even though he could scarcely sit upright in his saddle his mind dwelt complacently on the days sport and looked forward to the snug cheery comfort that awaited him at his hunting box  there was a charm too even for a tired man in the eerie stillness of the lone twilight land through which he was passing a grey shadowhung land which seemed to have been emptied of all things that belonged to the daytime and filled with a lurking moving life of which one knew nothing beyond the sense that it was there  there and very near  if there had been woodgods and wickedeyed fauns in the sunlit groves and hill sides of old hellas surely there were watchful living things of kindred mould in this duskhidden wilderness of field and hedge and coppice  it was yeovils third or fourth day with the hounds without taking into account a couple of mornings cubhunting  already he felt that he had been doing nothing different from this all his life  his foreign travels his illness his recent weeks in london they were part of a tapestried background that had very slight and distant connection with his present existence  of the future he tried to think with greater energy and determination  for this winter at any rate he would hunt and do a little shooting entertain a few of his neighbours and make friends with any congenial fellowsportsmen who might be within reach next year things would be different he would have had time to look round him to regain something of his aforetime vigour of mind and body  next year when the hunting season was over he would set about finding out whether there was any nobler game for him to take a hand in  he would enter into correspondence with old friends who had gone out into the tropics and the backwoodshe would do something  so he told himself but he knew thoroughly well that he had found his level  he had ceased to struggle against the fascination of his present surroundings  the slow quiet comfort and interest of country life appealed with enervating force to the man whom death had half conquered the pleasures of the chase wellprovided for in every detail and dovetailed in with the assured luxury of a wellordered wellstaffed establishment were exactly what he wanted and exactly what his life down here afforded him  he was experiencing too that passionate recurring devotion to an old loved scene that comes at times to men who have travelled far and willingly up and down the world  he was very much at home  the alien standard floating over buckingham palace the crown of charlemagne on public buildings and official documents the grey ships of war riding in plymouth bay and southampton water with a flag at their stern that older generations of britons had never looked on these things seemed far away and inconsequent amid the hedgerows and woods and fallows of the east wessex country  horse and houndcraft harvest game broods the planting and felling of timber the rearing and selling of stock the letting of grasslands the care of fisheries the upkeep of markets and fairs they were the things that immediately mattered  and yeovil saw himself in moments of disgust and selfaccusation settling down into this life of rustic littleness concerned over the late nesting of a partridge or the defective draining of a loosebox hugely busy over affairs that a gardeners boy might grapple with ignoring the struggle cry that went up low and bitter and wistful from a dethroned dispossessed race in whose glories he had gloried in whose struggle he lent no hand  in what way he asked himself in such moments would his life be better than the life of that parody of manhood who upholstered his rooms with art hangings and rosewood furniture and babbled over the effect  the lanes seemed interminable and without aim or object except to bisect one another gates and gaps disclosed nothing in the way of a landmark and the night began to draw down in increasing shades of darkness presently however the tired horse quickened its pace swung round a sharp corner into a broader roadway and stopped with an air of thankful expectancy at the low doorway of a wayside inn  a cheerful glow of light streamed from the windows and door and a brighter glare came from the other side of the road where a large motorcar was being got ready for an immediate start  yeovil tumbled stiffly out of his saddle and in answer to the loud rattle of his hunting crop on the open door the innkeeper and two or three hangerson hurried out to attend to the wants of man and beast  flour and water for the horse and something hot for himself were yeovils first concern and then he began to clamour for geographical information  he was rather dismayed to find that the cumulative opinions of those whom he consulted and of several others who joined unbidden in the discussion placed his destination at nothing nearer than nine miles nine miles of dark and hilly country road for a tired man on a tired horse assumed enormous farstretching proportions and although he dimly remembered that he had asked a guest to dinner for that evening he began to wonder whether the wayside inn possessed anything endurable in the way of a bedroom  the landlord interrupted his desperate speculations with a really brilliant effort of suggestion  there was a gentleman in the bar he said who was going in a motorcar in the direction for which yeovil was bound and who would no doubt be willing to drop him at his destination the gentleman had also been out with the hounds  yeovils horse could be stabled at the inn and fetched home by a groom the next morning  a hurried embassy to the bar parlour resulted in the news that the motorist would be delighted to be of assistance to a fellowsportsman  yeovil gratefully accepted the chance that had so obligingly come his way and hastened to superintend the housing of his horse in its nights quarters  when he had duly seen to the tired animals comfort and foddering he returned to the roadway where a young man in hunting garb and a livened chauffeur were standing by the side of the waiting car  i am so very pleased to be of some use to you mr yeovil said the car owner with a polite bow and yeovil recognised the young leutnant von gabelroth who had been present at the musical afternoon at berkshire street  he had doubtless seen him at the meet that morning but in his hunting kit he had escaped his observation  i too have been out with the hounds the young man continued i have left my horse at the crow and sceptre at dolford  you are living at black dene are you not  i can take you right past your door it is all on my way  yeovil hung back for a moment overwhelmed with vexation and embarrassment but it was too late to cancel the arrangement he had unwittingly entered into and he was constrained to put himself under obligation to the young officer with the best grace he could muster after all he reflected he had met him under his own roof as his wifes guest  he paid his reckoning to mine host tipped the stable lad who had helped him with his horse and took his place beside von gabelroth in the car  as they glided along the dark roadway and the young german reeled off a string of comments on the incidents of the days sport yeovil lay back amid his comfortable wraps and weighed the measure of his humiliation  it was cicelys gospel that one should know what one wanted in life and take good care that one got what one wanted  could he apply that test of achievement to his own life  was this what he really wanted to be doing pursuing his uneventful way as a country squire sharing even his sports and pastimes with men of the nation that had conquered and enslaved his fatherland  the car slackened its pace somewhat as they went through a small hamlet past a schoolhouse past a rural policestation with the new monogram over its noticeboard past a church with a little treegrown graveyard there in a corner among wildrose bushes and tall yews lay some of yeovils own kinsfolk who had lived in these parts and hunted and found life pleasant in the days that were not so very long ago  whenever he went past that quiet little gatheringplace of the dead yeovil was wont to raise his hat in mute affectionate salutation to those who were now only memories in his family tonight he somehow omitted the salute and turned his head the other way  it was as though the dead of his race saw and wondered  three or four months ago the thing he was doing would have seemed an impossibility now it was actually happening he was listening to the gay courteous tactful chatter of his young companion laughing now and then at some joking remark answering some question of interest learning something of hunting ways and traditions in von gabelroths own country and when the car turned in at the gate of the hunting lodge and drew up at the steps the laws of hospitality demanded that yeovil should ask his benefactor of the road to come in for a few minutes and drink something a little better than the wayside inn had been able to supply  the young officer spent the best part of a half hour in yeovils snuggery examining and discussing the trophies of rifle and collecting gun that covered the walls  he had a good knowledge of woodcraft and the beasts and birds of siberian forests and north african deserts were to him new pages in a familiar book  yeovil found himself discoursing eagerly with his chance guest on the european distribution and local variation of such and such a species recounting peculiarities in its habits and incidents of its pursuit and capture  if the cold observant eyes of lady shalem could have rested on the scene she would have hailed it as another root fibre thrown out by the fait accompli  yeovil closed the hall door on his departing visitor and closed his mind on the crowd of angry and accusing thoughts that were waiting to intrude themselves  his valet had already got his bath in readiness and in a few minutes the tired huntsman was forgetting weariness and the consciousness of outside things in the languorous abandonment that steam and hot water induce  brain and limbs seemed to lay themselves down in a contented waking sleep the world that was beyond the bathroom walls dropped away into a far unreal distance only somewhere through the steam clouds pierced a hazy consciousness that a dinner well chosen was being well cooked and would presently be well servedand right well appreciated that was the lure to drag the bather away from the nirvana land of warmth and steam  the stimulating aftereffect of the bath took its due effect and yeovil felt that he was now much less tired and enormously hungry  a cheery fire burned in his dressingroom and a lively black kitten helped him to dress and incidentally helped him to require a new tassel to the cord of his dressinggown  as he finished his toilet and the kitten finished its sixth and most notable attack on the tassel a ring was heard at the front door and a moment later a loud hearty and unmistakably hungry voice resounded in the hall  it belonged to the local doctor who had also taken part in the days run and had been bidden to enliven the evening meal with the entertainment of his inexhaustible store of sporting and social reminiscences  he knew the countryside and the countryfolk inside out and he was a living unwritten chronicle of the east wessex hunt  his conversation seemed exactly the right accompaniment to the meal his stories brought glimpses of wet hedgerows stiff ploughlands leafy spinneys and muddy brooks in among the rich old worcester and georgian silver of the dinner service the glow and crackle of the wood fire the pleasant succession of wellcooked dishes and mellow wines  the world narrowed itself down again to a warm drowsy scented diningroom with a productive hinterland of kitchen and cellar beyond it and beyond that an important outer world of loose box and harnessroom and stableyard further again a dark hushed region where pheasants roosted and owls flitted and foxes prowled  yeovil sat and listened to story after story of the men and women and horses of the neighbourhood even the foxes seemed to have a personality some of them and a personal history  it was a little like hans andersen he decided and a little like the reminiscences of an irish rm and perhaps just a little like some of the more probable adventures of baron munchausen  the newer stories were evidently true to the smallest detail the earlier ones had altered somewhat in repetition as plants and animals vary under domestication  and all the time there was one topic that was never touched on  of half the families mentioned it was necessary to add the qualifying information that they used to live at such and such a place the countryside knew them no longer  their properties were for sale or had already passed into the hands of strangers  but neither man cared to allude to the grinning shadow that sat at the feast and sent an icy chill now and again through the cheeriest jest and most jovial story  the brisk run with the hounds that day had stirred and warmed their pulses it was an evening for comfortable forgetting  later that night in the stillness of his bedroom with the dwindling noises of a retiring household dropping off one by one into ordered silence a door shutting here a fire being raked out there the thoughts that had been held away came crowding in  the body was tired but the brain was not and yeovil lay awake with his thoughts for company  the world grew suddenly wide again filled with the significance of things that mattered held by the actions of men that mattered  huntingbox and stable and gunroom dwindled to a mere pin point in the universe there were other larger more absorbing things on which the mind dwelt  there was the grey cold sea outside dover and portsmouth and cork where the great grey ships of war rocked and swung with the tides where the sailors sang in doggerel english that bitter sounding adaptation germania rules te waves where the flag of a worldpower floated for the world to see  and in ovenlike cities of india there were men who looked out at the white sunglare the heatbaked dust the welter of crowded streets who listened to the unceasing chorus of harshthroated crows the strident creaking of cart wheels the buzz and drone of insect swarms and the rattle call of the tree lizards men whose thoughts went hungrily to the cool grey skies and wet turf and moist ploughlands of an english hunting country men whose memories listened yearningly to the music of a deepthroated hound and the call of a gamebird in the stubble  yeovil had secured for himself the enjoyment of the things for which these men hungered he had known what he wanted in life slowly and with hesitation yet nevertheless surely he had arrived at the achievement of his unconfessed desires here installed under his own rooftree with as good horseflesh in his stable as man could desire with sport lying almost at his door with his wife ready to come down and help him to entertain his neighbours murrey yeovil had found the life that he wantedand was accursed in his own eyes  he argued with himself and palliated and explained but he knew why he had turned his eyes away that evening from the little graveyard under the trees one cannot explain things to the dead     chapter xix the little foxes      take us the foxes the little foxes that spoil the vines  on a warm and sunny may afternoon some ten months since yeovils return from his siberian wanderings and sickness cicely sat at a small table in the openair restaurant in hyde park finishing her afterluncheon coffee and listening to the meritorious performance of the orchestra  opposite her sat larry meadowfield absorbed for the moment in the slow enjoyment of a cigarette which also was not without its shortlived merits  larry was a welldressed youngster who was in cicelys opinion distinctly good to look onan opinion which the boy himself obviously shared  he had the healthy wellcaredfor appearance of a countrydweller who has been turned into a town dandy without suffering in the process  his blue black hair growing very low down on a broad forehead was brushed back in a smoothness that gave his head the appearance of a rainpolished sloe his eyebrows were two dark smudges and his large violetgrey eyes expressed the restful good temper of an animal whose immediate requirements have been satisfied  the lunch had been an excellent one and it was jolly to feed out of doors in the warm spring airthe only drawback to the arrangement being the absence of mirrors  however if he could not look at himself a great many people could look at him  cicely listened to the orchestra as it jerked and strutted through a fantastic dance measure and as she listened she looked appreciatively at the boy on the other side of the table whose soul for the moment seemed to be in his cigarette  her scheme of life knowing just what you wanted and taking good care that you got it was justifying itself by results ronnie grown tiresome with success had not been difficult to replace and no one in her world had had the satisfaction of being able to condole with her on the undesirable experience of a long interregnum  to feminine acquaintances with fewer advantages of purse and brains and looks she might figure as that yeovil woman but never had she given them justification to allude to her as poor cicely yeovil  and murrey dear old soul had cooled down as she had hoped and wished from his white heat of disgust at the things that she had prepared herself to accept philosophically  a new chapter of their married life and manand woman friendship had opened many a rare gallop they had had together that winter many a cheery dinner gathering and long bridge evening in the cosy huntinglodge  though he still hated the new london and held himself aloof from most of her town set yet he had not shown himself rigidly intolerant of the sprinkling of teuton sportsmen who hunted and shot down in his part of the country  the orchestra finished its clicking and caracoling and was accorded a short clatter of applause  the danse macabre said cicely to her companion one of saintsaens best known pieces  is it said larry indifferently ill take your word for it  fraid i dont know much about music  you dear boy thats just what i like in you said cicely youre such a delicious young barbarian  am i said larry  i dare say  i suppose you know  larrys father had been a brilliantly clever man who had married a brilliantly handsome woman the fates had not had the least intention that larry should take after both parents  the fashion of having ones lunch in the open air has quite caught on this season said cicely one sees everybody here on a fine day  there is lady bailquist over there  she used to be lady shalem you know before her husband got the earldomto be more correct before she got it for him  i suppose she is all agog to see the great review  it was in fact precisely the absorbing topic of the forthcoming boyscout marchpast that was engaging the countess of bailquists earnest attention at the moment  it is going to be an historical occasion she was saying to sir leonard pitherby whose services to literature had up to the present received only a halfmeasure of recognition if it miscarries it will be a serious setback for the fait accompli  if it is a success it will be the biggest step forward in the path of reconciliation between the two races that has yet been taken  it will mean that the younger generation is on our sidenot all of course but some that is all we can expect at present and that will be enough to work on  supposing the scouts hang back and dont turn up in any numbers said sir leonard anxiously  that of course is the danger said lady bailquist quietly probably twothirds of the available strength will hold back but a third or even a sixth would be enough it would redeem the parade from the calamity of fiasco and it would be a nucleus to work on for the future  that is what we want a good start a preliminary rally  it is the first step that counts that is why todays event is of such importance  of course of course the first step on the road assented sir leonard  i can assure you continued lady bailquist that nothing has been left undone to rally the scouts to the new order of things  special privileges have been showered on them alone among all the cadet corps they have been allowed to retain their organisation a decoration of merit has been instituted for them a large hostelry and gymnasium has been provided for them in westminster his majestys youngest son is to be their scoutmasterinchief a great athletic meeting is to be held for them each year with valuable prizes three or four hundred of them are to be taken every summer free of charge for a holiday in the bavarian highlands and the baltic seaboard besides this the parent of every scout who obtains the medal for efficiency is to be exempted from part of the new war taxation that the people are finding so burdensome  one certainly cannot say that they have not had attractions held out to them said sir leonard  it is a special effort said lady bailquist it is worth making an effort for  they are going to be the janissaries of the empire the younger generation knocking at the doors of progress and thrusting back the bars and bolts of old racial prejudices  i tell you sir leonard it will be an historic moment when the first corps of those little khaki clad boys swings through the gates of the park  when do they come asked the baronet catching something of his companions zeal  the first detachment is due to arrive at three said lady bailquist referring to a small timetable of the afternoons proceedings three punctually and the others will follow in rapid succession  the emperor and suite will arrive at twofifty and take up their positions at the saluting baseover there where the big flagstaff has been set up  the boys will come in by hyde park corner the marble arch and the albert gate according to their districts and form in one big column over there where the little flags are pegged out  then the young prince will inspect them and lead them past his majesty  who will be with the imperial party asked sir leonard  oh it is to be an important affair everything will be done to emphasise the significance of the occasion said lady bailquist again consulting her programme  the king of wurtemberg and two of the bavarian royal princes an abyssinian envoy who is over herehe will lend a touch of picturesque barbarism to the scenethe general commanding the london district and a whole lot of other military bigwigs and the austrian italian and roumanian military attaches  she reeled off the imposing list of notables with an air of quiet satisfaction  sir leonard made mental notes of personages to whom he might send presentation copies of his new work frederickwilliam the great elector a popular biography as a souvenir of todays auspicious event  it is nearly a quarter to three now he said let us get a good position before the crowd gets thicker  come along to my car it is just opposite to the saluting base said her ladyship i have a police pass that will let us through  well ask mrs yeovil and her young friend to join us  larry excused himself from joining the party he had a barbarians reluctance to assisting at an imperial triumph  i think ill push off to the swimmingbath he said to cicely see you again about teatime  cicely walked with lady bailquist and the literary baronet towards the crowd of spectators which was steadily growing in dimensions  a newsboy ran in front of them displaying a poster with the intelligence essex wickets fall rapidlya semblance of county cricket still survived under the new order of things  near the saluting base some thirty or forty motorcars were drawn up in line and cicely and her companions exchanged greetings with many of the occupants  a lovely day for the review isnt it cried the grafin von tolb breaking off her conversation with herr rebinok the little pomeranian banker who was sitting by her side  why havent you brought young mr meadowfield  such a nice boy  i wanted him to come and sit in my carriage and talk to me  he doesnt talk you know said cicely hes only brilliant to look at  well i could have looked at him said the grafin  therell be thousands of other boys to look at presently said cicely laughing at the old womans frankness  do you think there will be thousands asked the grafin with an anxious lowering of the voice really thousands  hundreds perhaps there is some uncertainty  every one is not sanguine  hundreds anyway said cicely  the grafin turned to the little banker and spoke to him rapidly and earnestly in german  it is most important that we should consolidate our position in this country we must coax the younger generation over by degrees we must disarm their hostility  we cannot afford to be always on the watch in this quarter it is a source of weakness and we cannot afford to be weak  this slav upheaval in southeastern europe is becoming a serious menace  have you seen todays telegrams from agram  they are bad reading  there is no computing the extent of this movement  it is directed against us said the banker  agreed said the grafin it is in the nature of things that it must be against us  let us have no illusions  within the next ten years sooner perhaps we shall be faced with a crisis which will be only a beginning we shall need all our strength that is why we cannot afford to be weak over here  today is an important day i confess i am anxious  hark  the kettledrums exclaimed the commanding voice of lady bailquist  his majesty is coming  quick bundle into the car  the crowd behind the policekept lines surged expectantly into closer formation spectators hurried up from sidewalks and stood craning their necks above the shoulders of earlier arrivals  through the archway at hyde park corner came a resplendent cavalcade with a swirl of colour and rhythmic movement and a crash of exultant music lifeguards with gleaming helmets a detachment of wurtemberg lancers with a flutter of black and yellow pennons a rich medley of staff uniforms a prancing array of princely horsemen the imperial standard and the king of prussia great britain and ireland emperor of the west  it was the most imposing display that londoners had seen since the catastrophe  slowly grandly with thunder of music and beat of hoofs the procession passed through the crowd across the sward towards the saluting base slowly the eagle standard charged with the leopards lion and harp of the conquered kingdoms rose masthigh on the flagstaff and fluttered in the breeze slowly and with military precision the troops and suite took up their position round the central figure of the great pageant  trumpets and kettledrums suddenly ceased their music and in a moment there rose in their stead an eager buzz of comment from the nearest spectators  how well the young prince looks in his scout uniform    the king of wurtemberg is a much younger man than i thought he was    is that a prussian or bavarian uniform there on the right the man on a black horse     neither its austrian the austrian military attache     that is von stoppel talking to his majesty he organised the boy scouts in germany you know     his majesty is looking very pleased  he has reason to look pleased this is a great event in the history of the two countries  it marks a new epoch     oh do you see the abyssinian envoy  what a picturesque figure he makes  how well he sits his horse    that is the grand duke of badens nephew talking to the king of wurtemberg now  on the buzz and chatter of the spectators fell suddenly three sound strokes distant measured sinister the clang of a clock striking three  three oclock and not a boy scout within sight or hearing exclaimed the loud ringing voice of joan mardle one can usually hear their drums and trumpets a couple of miles away  there is the traffic to get through said sir leonard pitherby in an equally highpitched voice and of course he added vaguely it takes some time to get the various units together  one must give them a few minutes grace  lady bailquist said nothing but her restless watchful eyes were turned first to hyde park corner and then in the direction of the marble arch back again to hyde park corner  only the dark lines of the waiting crowd met her view with the yellow newspaper placards flitting in and out announcing to an indifferent public the fate of essex wickets  as far as her searching eyes could travel the green stretch of tree and sward remained unbroken save by casual loiterers  no small brown columns appeared no drum beat came throbbing up from the distance  the little flags pegged out to mark the positions of the awaited scoutcorps fluttered in meaningless isolation on the empty parade ground  his majesty was talking unconcernedly with one of his officers the foreign attaches looked steadily between their chargers ears as though nothing in particular was hanging in the balance the abyssinian envoy displayed an untroubled serenity which was probably genuine  elsewhere among the suite was a perceptible fidget the more obvious because it was elaborately cloaked  among the privileged onlookers drawn up near the saluting point the fidgeting was more unrestrained  six minutes past three and not a sign of them exclaimed joan mardle with the explosive articulation of one who cannot any longer hold back a truth  hark said some one i hear trumpets  there was an instant concentration of listening a straining of eyes  it was only the toot of a passing motorcar  even sir leonard pitherby with the eye of faith could not locate as much as a cloud of dust on the park horizon  and now another sound was heard a sound difficult to define without beginning without dimension the growing murmur of a crowd waking to a slowly dawning sensation  i wish the band would strike up an air said the grafin von tolb fretfully it is stupid waiting here in silence  joan fingered her watch but she made no further remark she realised that no amount of malicious comment could be so dramatically effective now as the slow slipping away of the intolerable seconds  the murmur from the crowd grew in volume  some satirical wit started whistling an imitation of an advancing fife and drum band others took it up and the air resounded with the shrill music of a phantom army on the march  the mock throbbing of drum and squealing of fife rose and fell above the packed masses of spectators but no answering echo came from beyond the distant trees  like mushrooms in the night a muster of uniformed police and plain clothes detectives sprang into evidence on all sides whatever happened there must be no disloyal demonstration  the whistlers and mockers were pointedly invited to keep silence and one or two addresses were taken  under the trees well at the back of the crowd a young man stood watching the long stretch of road along which the scouts should come  something had drawn him there against his will to witness the imperial triumph to watch the writing of yet another chapter in the history of his countrys submission to an accepted fact and now a dull flush crept into his grey face a look that was partly new born hope and resurrected pride partly remorse and shame burned in his eyes  shame the choking searing shame of selfreproach that cannot be reasoned away was dominant in his heart  he had laid down his armsthere were others who had never hoisted the flag of surrender  he had given up the fight and joined the ranks of the hopelessly subservient in thousands of english homes throughout the land there were young hearts that had not forgotten had not compounded would not yield  the younger generation had barred the door  and in the pleasant may sunshine the eagle standard floated and flapped the black and yellow pennons shifted restlessly emperor and princes generals and guards sat stiffly in their saddles and waited  and waited
