trifle late                                  160  there was a note in her voice that set the mans heart beating furiously                                     268  a fierce white frothing about him                frontispiece     the cattlebarons daughter  i  the portent   the hot weather had come suddenly at least a month earlier than usual and new york lay baking under a scorching sun when miss hetty torrance sat in the coolest corner of the grand central depot she could find it was by her own wish she had spent the afternoon in the city unattended for miss torrance was a selfreliant young woman but it was fate and the irregularity of the little gold watch which had been her dead mothers gift that brought her to the depot at least a quarter of an hour too soon but she was not wholly sorry for she had desired more solitude and time for reflection than she found in the noisy city where a visit to an eminent modiste had occupied most of her leisure there was she had reasons for surmising a decision of some moment to be made that night and as yet she was no nearer arriving at it than she had been when the little note then in her pocket had been handed her  still it was not the note she took out when she found a seat apart from the hurrying crowd but a letter from her father torrance the cattlebaron of cedar range it was terse and to the point as usual and a little smile crept into the girls face as she read  your letter to hand and so long as you have a good time dont worry about the bills youll find another five hundred dollars at the bank when you want them thank god i can give my daughter what her mother should have had two years since ive seen my little girl and now it seems that somebody else is wanting her well we were made men and women and if you had been meant to live alone dabbling in music you wouldnt have been given your mothers face now i dont often express myself this way but ive had a letter from captain jackson cheyne u s cavalry which reads as straight as ive found the man to be nothing wrong with that family and theyve dollars to spare but if you like the man i can put down two for every one of his well i might write a good deal but youre too much like your father to be taken in you want dollars and station and i can see you get them but in a contract of this kind the man is everything make quite sure youre getting the right one  there was a little more to the same purpose and when she slipped the letter into her pocket hetty torrance smiled  the dear old man she said it is very like him but whether jake is the right one or not is just what i cant decide  then she sat still looking straight in front of her a very attractive picture as some of the hurrying men who turned to glance at her seemed to find in her long light dress her face which showed a delicate oval under the big white hat was a trifle paler than is usual with most englishwomen of her age and the figure the thin fabric clung about less decided in outline still the faint warmth in her cheeks emphasized the clear pallor of her skin and there was a depth of brightness in the dark eyes that would have atoned for a good deal more than there was in her case necessity for her supple slenderness also became hetty torrance well and there was a suggestion of nervous energy in her very pose in addition to all this she was a rich mans daughter who had been well taught in the cities and had since enjoyed all that wealth and refinement could offer her it had also been a cause of mild astonishment to the friends she had spent the past year with that with these advantages she had remained miss torrance they had been somewhat proud of their guest and opportunities had not been wanting had she desired to change her status  while she sat there musing palefaced citizens hurried past great locomotives crawled to and fro and long trains of cars white with the dust of five hundred leagues rolled in swelling in deeper cadence the roar of the city came faintly through the din but responsive to the throb of life as she usually was hetty torrance heard nothing of it then for she was back in fancy on the greywhite prairie two thousand miles away it was a desolate land of parched grass and bitter lakes with beaches dusty with alkali but a rich one to the few who held dominion over it and she had received the homage of a princess there then she heard a voice that was quite in keeping with the spirit of the scene and was scarcely astonished to see that a man was smiling down on her  he was dressed in city garments and they became him but the hand he held out was lean and hard and brown and for he stood bareheaded a paler streak showed where the wide hat had shielded a face that had been darkened by stinging alkali dust from the prairie sun it was a quietly forceful face with steady eyes which had a little sparkle of pleasure in them and were clear and brown while something in the mans sinewy pose suggested that he would have been at home in the saddle indeed it was in the saddle that hetty torrance remembered him most vividly hurling his halftamed broncho straight at a gully down which the nondescript pack streamed while the scarcely seen shape of a coyote blurred by the dust streaked the prairie in front of them  hetty he said  larry said the girl why whatever are you doing here  then both laughed a little perhaps to conceal the faint constraint that was upon them for a meeting between former comrades has its difficulties when one is a man and the other a woman and the bond between them has not been defined  i came in on business a day or two ago said the man ran round to check some packages im going back again tomorrow  well said the girl i was in the city and came here to meet flo schuyler and her sister theyll be in at four  the man looked at his watch that gives us most fifteen minutes but its not going to be enough well lose none of it what about the singing  hetty torrance flushed a trifle larry she said you are quite sure you dont know  the man appeared embarrassed and there was a trace of gravity in his smile your father told me a little but i havent seen him so often of late any way i would sooner you told me  then said the girl with the faintest of quivers in her voice the folks who understand good music dont care to hear me  there was incredulity which pleased his companion in the mans face but his voice vaguely suggested contentment  that is just what they cant do he said decisively you sing most divinely  there is a good deal you and the boys at cedar dont know larry any way lots of people sing better than i do but i should be angry with you if i thought you were pleased  the man smiled gravely that would hurt im sorry for you hetty but again im glad now theres nothing to keep you in the city youll come back to us you belong to the prairie and its a better place than this  he spoke at an opportune moment since her cherished ambition had failed her hetty torrance had grown a trifle tired of the city and the round of pleasure that must be entered into strenuously and there were times when looking back in reverie she saw the great silent prairie roll back under the red sunrise into the east and fade vast solemn and restful a cool land of shadow when the first pale stars came out then she longed for the jingle of the bridles and the drumming of the hoofs and felt once more the rush of the gallop stir her blood but this was what she would not show and her eyes twinkled a trifle maliciously  well i dont quite know she said there is always one thing left to most of us  she saw the man wince ever so slightly and was pleased at it but he was as she had once told him in the old days grit all through and he smiled a little  of course he said still the trouble is that there are very few of us good enough for you but you will come back for a little  miss torrance would not commit herself how are they getting along at the range  doesnt your father write you  yes said the girl colouring a trifle i had a letter from him a few days ago but he seldom mentioned what he was doing and i want you to tell me about him  the man appeared thoughtful well he said its quite three months since i spoke to him he was stirring round as brisk as ever and is rolling the dollars in this year  but you used to be always at the range  the man nodded but the slight constraint that was upon him did not escape the girl still i dont go there so often now the range is lonesome when you are away  miss torrance accepted the speech as one made by a comrade and perhaps was wrong but a tramp of feet attracted her attention then and she looked away from her companion driven by the railroad officials and led by an interpreter a band of teutons some five or six hundred strong filed into the station stalwart and stolid towhaired with the stamp of acquiescent patience in their homely faces they came on with the swing but none of the usual spirit of drilled men they asked no questions but went where they were led and the foulness of the closepacked steerage seemed to cling about them for a time the depot rang to the rhythmic tramp of feet and when at a sign from the interpreter it stopped two bewildered children frowsy and unwashed in greasy homespun sat down and gazed at miss torrance with mild blue eyes she signed to a boy who was passing with a basket slung before him and made a little impatient gesture when the man slipped his hand into his pocket  no she said youll make me vexed with you tell him to give them all he has theyll be a long while in the cars  she handed the boy a silver coin and while the children sat still undemonstratively astonished with the golden fruit about them the man passed him a bill  now get some more oranges and begin right at the top of the line he said if that doesnt see you through come back to me for another bill  hetty torrances eyes softened larry she said that was dreadfully good of you where are they all going to  chicago nebraska minnesota montana said the man there are the cars coming in just out of castle garden and its because of the city improvements disorganizing traffic theyre bringing them this way theyre the advance guard you see and there are more of them coming  the tramp of feet commenced again but this time it was a horde of diverse nationality englishmen irishmen poles and finns but all with the stamp of toil and many with that of scarcity upon them bedraggled unkempt dejected eager with the cunning that comes of adversity they flowed in and hetty torrances face grew pitiful as she watched them  do they come every week like this and even in our big country have we got room for all of them she said  there was a curious gleam in the mans brown eyes oh yes he said its the biggest and greatest country this old world has ever seen and the lord made it as a home for the poorthe folks theyve no food or use for back yonder and while there are shortsighted fools who would close the door we take them in outcast and hopeless and put new heart in them in a few short years we make them men and useful citizens the equal of any on this earthamericans  hetty torrance nodded and there was pride but no amusement in her smile for she had a quick enthusiasm and the reticence of insular britain has no great place in that country  still she said all these people coming in must make a difference  the mans face grew grave yes he said there will have to be a change and it is coming we are only outwardly democratic just now and dont seem to know that men are worth more than millionaires we have let them get their grip on our industries and too much of our land until what would feed a thousand buys canvasbacks and wines from europe for one isnt what we raise in california good enough for americans  miss torrances eyes twinkled some of it isnt very nice and they dont live on canvasbacks she said still it seems to me that other men have talked like that quite a thousand years ago and while i dont know anyone better at breaking a broncho or cutting out a steer straightening these affairs out is too big a contract for you  the man laughed pleasantly thats all right but i can do a little in the place i belong to and the change is beginning there is it good for this country that one man should get rich feeding his cattle on leagues of prairie where a hundred families could make a living growing wheat  now said the girl drily i know why you and my father havent got on your opinions wouldnt please him larry  no said the man with a trace of embarrassment i dont think they would and thats just why weve got to convince him and the others that what we want to do is for the good of the country  hetty torrance laughed its going to be hard no man wants to believe anything is good when he sees it will take quite a pile of dollars out of his pocket  the man said nothing and hetty fancied he was not desirous of following up the topic while as they sat silent a big locomotive backed another great train of emigrant cars in then the tramp of feet commenced again and once more a frowsy host of outcasts from the overcrowded lands poured into the depot wagons piled with baggage had preceded them but many dragged their pitiful belongings along with them and the murmur of their alien voices rang through the bustle of the station hetty torrance was not unduly fanciful but those footsteps caused her as she afterwards remembered a vague concern she believed as her father did that america was made for the americans but it was evident that in a few more years every unit of those incoming legions would be a citizen of the republic with rights equal to those enjoyed by torrance of cedar range she had seen that as yet the constitution gave no man more than he could by his own hand obtain but it seemed not unlikely that some at least of those dejected unkempt men had struck for the rights of humanity that were denied them in the older lands with dynamite and rifle  then as the first long train of grimy cars rolled out close packed with their frowsy human freight a train of another kind came in and two young women in light dresses swung themselves down from the platform of a car that was sumptuous with polished woods and gilding miss torrance rose as she saw them and touched her companion  come along larry and ill show you two of the nicest girls you ever met she said  the man laughed they would have been nicer if they hadnt come quite so soon he said  he followed his companion and was duly presented to miss flora and miss caroline schuyler larry grant of fremont ranch said miss torrance larry is a great friend of mine  the misses schuyler were pretty carolina the younger pale blueeyed fairhaired and vivacious her sister equally blonde but a trifle quieter although they were gracious to him grant fancied that one flashed a questioning glance at the other when there was a halt in the conversation then as if by tacit agreement they left him alone a moment with their companion and hetty torrance smiled as she held out her hand  i cant keep them waiting but youll come and see me she said  i am going home tomorrow said the man when are you coming hetty  the girl smiled curiously and there was a trace of wistfulness in her eyes i dont quite know just now i fancy i may not come at all but you will not forget me larry  the man looked at her very gravely and hetty torrance appeared to find something disconcerting in his gaze for she turned her head away  no he said and there was a little tremor in his voice i dont think i shall forget you well if ever you grow tired of the cities you will remember the lonely folks who are longing to have you home again back there on the prairie  hetty torrance felt her fingers quiver under his grasp but the next moment he had turned away and her companions noticed there was a faint pink tinge in her cheeks when she rejoined them but being wise young women they restrained their natural inquisitiveness and asked no questions then  in the meanwhile grant who watched them until the last glimpse of their light dresses was lost in the crowd stood beside the second emigrant train vacantly glancing at the aliens who thronged about it his bronzed face was a trifle weary and his lips were set but at last he straightened his shoulders with a little resolute movement and turned away  i have my work he said and its going to be quite enough for me     ii  hetty takes heed   it was evening when hetty torrance sat alone in a room of mrs schuylers house at hastingsonthehudson the room was pretty though its adornment was garish and somewhat miscellaneous consisting as it did of the trophies of miss schuylers european tour a parisian clock rich in gilded scroll work to the verge of barbarity contrasted with the artistic severity of one or two good italian marbles while these in turn stood quaintly upon choice examples of timemellowed english cabinetwork there was taste in them all but they suffered from the juxtaposition which however was somewhat characteristic of the country still miss schuyler had not spoiled the splendid parquetrie floor of american timber  the windows were open wide and when a little breeze from the darkening river came up across the lawn hetty languidly raised her head the coolness was grateful the silken cushions she reclined amidst luxurious but the girls eyes grew thoughtful as they wandered round the room for that evening the suggestion of wealth in all she saw jarred upon her mood the great city lay not very far away sweltering with its crowded tenement houses under stifling heat and she could picture the toilers who herded there gasping for air then her fancy fled further following the long emigrant train as it crawled west from sidetrack to sidetrack close packed with humanity that was much less cared for than her fathers cattle  she had often before seen the dusty cars roll into a wayside depot to wait until the luxurious limited passed and the grimy faces at the windows pale and pinched cunning or coarsely brutal after the fashion of their kind had roused no more than a passing pity it was however different that night for grants words had roused her to thought and she wondered with a vague apprehension whether the tramp of weary feet she had listened to would once more break in upon her sheltered life larry had foreseen changes and he was usually right then she brushed these fancies into the background for she had still a decision to make captain cheyne would shortly arrive and she knew what he came to ask he was also a personable man and so far as the schuylers knew without reproach while hetty had seen a good deal of him during the past twelve months she admitted a liking for him but now that the time had come to decide she was not certain that she would care to spend her life with him as a companion he left nothing to be desired but as had happened already with another man with whom miss torrance had been pleased that position did not appear to content him and she had misgivings about contracting a more permanent bond it was almost a relief when miss schuyler came in  stand up hetty i want to look at you she said  miss torrance obeyed and stood before her girlishly slender in her long dress though there was an indefinite suggestion of imperiousness in her dark eyes  will i pass she asked  flora schuyler surveyed her critically and then laughed yes she said youre pretty enough to please anybody and theres a style about you that makes it quite plain you were of some importance out there on the prairie now you can sit down again because i want to talk to you whos larry grant  tell me what you think of him  miss schuyler pursed her lips reflectively well she said hes not new york quite a goodlooking man with a good deal in him but id like to see him on horseback been in the cavalry youre fond of them you know  no said hetty but he knows more about horses than any cavalry officer larrys a cattlebaron  i never quite knew what the cattlebarons were except that your fathers one and theyre mostly rich said miss schuyler  hettys eyes twinkled i dont think larrys very rich theyre the men or the sons of them who went west when the prairie belonged to the indians and the blackfeet crows and crees made them lots of trouble still they held the land they settled on and covered it with cattle until the government gave it to them most as much as you could ride across in a day to each big rancher  gave it to them  hetty nodded a lease of it it means the same thing a few of them though i think it wasnt quite permitted bought other leases in and out there a cattlebaron is a bigger man than a railroad king you see he makes the lawall there isas well as supports the industry for theres not a sheriff in the country dares question him the cattleboys are his retainers and weve a squadron of them at the range theyd do just what torrance of cedar told them whatever it was and there are few men who could ride with them in the u s cavalry  then said flora schuyler if the government ever encouraged homesteading in their country theyd make trouble  hetty laughed yes she said drily i guess they would but no government dares meddle with us  well said flora schuyler you havent told us yet who larry is you know quite well what i mean  hetty smiled i called him my partner when i was home larry held me on my first pony and has done most whatever i wanted him ever since fremont isnt very far from the range and when i wanted to ride anywhere or to have a new horse broken larry was handy  miss schuyler appeared reflective but there was a bond of confidence between the two and the reserve that characterizes the briton is much less usual in that country  it always seemed to me my dear that an arrangement of that kind is a little rough on the man and i think this one is too good to spoil she said  hetty coloured a trifle but she smiled it is all right with larry he never expected anything  no said flora schuyler he never tried to make love to you  the tinge of colour grew a trifle deeper in hettys cheek only once and i scarcely think he meant it it was quite a long while ago and i told him he must never do it again  and since then he has tamed your horses and bought you all the latest songs and booksgood editions in english art bindings it was larry who sent you those flowers when we could scarcely get one  hetty for some reason turned away her head dont you get things of that kind  a trace of gravity crept into flora schuylers blue eyes which were unusually attractive ones when they come too often i send them back she said oh i know im careless now and then but one has to do the square thing and i wouldnt let any man do all that for me unless i was so fond of him that i meant to marry him now im going to talk quite straight to you hetty youll have to give up larry by and by but if you find thats going to hurt you send the other man away  you dont understand and there was a little flash in hettys dark eyes larrys kind to everyonehe cant help it but he doesnt want me  flora schuyler gravely patted her companions arm my dear we dont want to quarrel but youll be carefulto please me jake cheyne is coming and you might be sorry ever after if you made a mistake tonight  hetty made no answer and there was silence for a space while the light grew dimmer until the sound of voices rose from without and she felt her heart beat a trifle faster than usual when somebody said captain cheyne  then there was a rustle of draperies and mrs schuyler thin angular and considerably more silent than is customary with women of her race came in with her younger daughter and a man in her train the latter bore the stamp of the soldier plainly but there was a distinction in his pose that was not the result of a military training then as he shook hands with flora schuyler the fading light from the window fell upon his face showing it clean cut from the broad forehead to the solid chin and reposeful instead of nervously mobile his even lowpitched voice was also in keeping with it for jackson cheyne was an unostentatious american of culture widened by travel and though they are not always to be found in the forefront in their own country unless it has need of them men of his type have little to fear from comparison with those to be met with in any other one  he spoke when there was occasion and was listened to but some time had passed before he turned to mrs schuyler i wonder if it would be too great a liberty if i asked miss torrance to give us some music he said i am going away tomorrow to a desolate outpost in new mexico and it will be the last time for months that i shall have a treat of that kind  flora schuyler opened the piano and hetty smiled at cheyne as she took her place but the man made a little gesture of negation when mrs schuyler would have rung for lights  wouldnt it be nicer as it is he said  hetty nodded and there was silence before the first chords rang softly through the room though it may have been that the absence of necessity to strive and stain her daintiness amidst the press was responsible for much hetty torrances voice had failed to win her fame but she sang and played better than most welltrained amateurs thus there was no rustle of drapery or restless movements until the last low notes sank into the stillness then the girl glanced at the man who had unobtrusively managed to find a place close beside her  you know what that is she said  carolina schuyler laughed jake knows everything  yes said the man quietly a nocturne you were thinking of something when you played it  the sea said flora schuyler when the moon is on it was that it hetty  no said miss torrance who afterwards wondered whether it would have made a great difference if she had not chosen that nocturne it was the prairie when the stars are coming out over cedar range then it seems bigger and more solemn than the sea i can see it now wide and grey and shadowy and so still that you feel afraid to hear yourself breathing with the last smoky flush burning on its northern rim now you may laugh at me for you couldnt understand when you have been born there you always love the prairie  then with a little deprecatory gesture she touched the keys again it will be different this time  cheyne glanced up sharply during the prelude and then feeling that the girls eyes were upon him nodded as out of the swelling harmonies there crept the theme it suggested the tramp of marching feet but there was a curious unevenness in its rhythm and the crescendo one of the listeners looked for never came the room was almost dark now but none of those who sat there seemed to notice it as they listened to the listless tramp of marching feet then the harmonies drowned it again and hetty looked at cheyne  now she said can you tell me what that means  cheynes voice seemed a trifle strained as though the music had troubled him i know the march but the composer never wrote what you have played tonight he said it wasmay mine be defended from itthe shuffle of beaten men how could you have felt what you put into the music  no said hetty your men could never march like that it was footsteps going west and i could not have originated their dragging beat i have heard it  there was a little silence until cheyne said softly one more  then said hetty you will recognize this  the chords rang under her fingers until they swelled into confused and conflicting harmonies that clashed and jarred upon the theme their burden was strife and struggle and the anguish of strain until at last in the high clear note of victory the theme rose supreme  yes said flora schuyler we know that we heard it with the kaiser in berlin only one man could have written it but his own countrymen could not play it better than you do a little overwhelming how did you get down to the spirit of it hetty  lights were brought in just then and they showed that the girls face was a trifle paler than usual as closing the piano she turned with a little laugh upon the musicstool  oh she said i dont quite know and until tonight it always cheated me i got it at the depotno i didnt it was there i felt the marching and larry brought the prairie back to me but i couldnt have seen what was in the last music because it hasnt happened yet  it will come said flora  yes said hetty wherever those weary men are going to  and to every one of us said cheyne with a curious graveness they afterwards remembered that is the stress and strainit is the triumph at the end of it only the few attain  once more there was silence and it was a relief when the unemotional mrs schuyler rose  now she said and her voice at least had in it the twang of the country you young folks have been solemn quite long enough cant you talk something kind of lively  they did what they could andfor cheyne could on occasion display a polished witlight laughter filled the room until caroline schuyler perhaps not without a motive suggested a stroll on the lawn if there was dew upon the grass none of them heeded it and it was but seldom anyone enjoyed the privilege of pacing that sod when mr schuyler was at home every foot had cost him many dollars and it remained but an imperfect imitation of an english lawn there was on the one side a fringe of maples and it was perhaps by mrs schuylers contrivance that eventually hetty found herself alone with cheyne in their deeper shadow it was not however a surprise to her for she had seen the mans desire and tacitly fallen in with it miss torrance had discovered that one seldom gains anything by endeavouring to avoid the inevitable  hetty he said quietly i think you know why i have come tonight  the girl stood very still and silent for a space of seconds and afterwards wondered whether she made the decision then or what she had seen and heard since she entered the depot had formed it for her  yes she said slowly i am so sorry  cheyne laid his hand upon her arm and his voice trembled a little dont be too hasty hetty he said i would not ask you for very much just now but i had ventured to fancy you could in time grow fond of me i know i should have waited but i am going away tomorrow and i only want you to give me a promise to take away with me  it was with a visible effort the girl lifted her head and looked at him i feel horribly mean jake but i cant she said i ought to have made you realize that long ago but i liked you and you see i didnt quite know i thought if i waited a little i might be more sure of what i felt for you  then said the man a trifle hoarsely give me what you can now and i will be patient  hetty turned half way from him and closed one hand the man was pleasant to look upon in character and disposition all she could desire and she had found a curious content in his company had that day passed as other days had done she might have yielded to him but she had been stirred to the depths of her nature during the last few hours and flora schuylers warning had been opportune she had as she had told him a liking for jackson cheyne but that she saw very clearly now was insufficient destiny had sent larry grant with the associations that clung about him into the depot  no she said with a little tremble in her voice it wouldnt be honest or fair to you i am not half good enough for you  the man smiled somewhat mirthlessly but his voice was reproachful you always speak the truth hetty my dear knowing what the best of us are i wonder how i dared to venture to ask you to share your life with me  hetty checked him with a little gesture cant you understand she said the girl who sang to you now and then isnt me i am selfish discontented and shallow and if you hadnt heard me sing or play you would never have thought of me there are people who sing divinely and areyou see i have met them with the mask offjust horrible  hetty said cheyne i cant allow anyone to malign you even if its yourself and if you have any faults my dear ill take them with the rest in fact i would be glad of one or two they would only bring you a little nearer to me  the girl lifted her hand and silenced him jake she said appealingly please take your answer and go away if i could only be fond of you in the right way i would but i cant you see it is not my faultit isnt in me  the man recognized the finality in her tone but feeling that it was useless made a last endeavour  im going away tomorrow he said you might think differently when i come back again  the girls voice quivered a little no she said i have to be straightforward now and i know you will try to make it easier for me even if im hurting you its no use i shall think the same and by and by youll get over this fancy and wonder what you ever saw in me  the man smiled curiously i am afraid it will take me a lifetime he said  in another moment he had gone and hetty turned a trifle flushed in face towards the house across the lawn  he took it very welland i shall never find anyone half so nice again she said  it was half an hour later and miss torrance had recovered at least her outward serenity when one of mrs schuylers neighbours arrived she brought one or two young women and a man with her the latter she presented to mrs schuyler  mr reginald clavering she said hes from the prairie where miss torrances father lives and is staying a day or two with us when i heard he knew hetty i ventured to bring him over  mrs schuyler expressed her pleasure andfor they had gone back to the lighted room nowhetty presently found herself seated face to face with the stranger he was a tall wellfavoured man slender and lithe in movement with dark eyes and hair and a slightly sallow face that suggested that he was from the south it also seemed fitting that he was immaculately dressed for there was a curious gracefulness about him that still had in it a trace of insolence no one would have mistaken him for a northerner  it was only an hour ago i found we were so near and i insisted upon coming across at once he said you have changed a good deal since you left the prairie  yes said the girl drily is it very astonishing you see we dont spend half our time on horseback here you didnt expect to find me a sharptongued amazon still  clavering laughed as he looked at her but the approval of what he saw was a trifle too evident in his black eyes  well he said languidly you were our princess then and there was only one of your subjects homage you never took kindly to that was rough on him because he was at least as devoted as the rest  that said the girl with a trace of acerbity was because he tried to patronize me even if i havent the right to it i like respect  clavering made a little gesture and the deference in it was at least half sincere you command it and i must try to make amends now dont you want to hear about your father and the range  no said hetty i had a talk with larry today  in new york  yes at the depot he is going back tomorrow you seem astonished  clavering appeared thoughtful well its chicago he usually goes to  usually said hetty i scarcely remember him leaving fremont once in three years  clavering laughed then he leaves it a good deal more often now a man must have a little diversion when he lives as we do and no doubt larry feels lonely you are here and heloise durand has gone away  hetty understood the implication for she had some notion how the men who spent months together in the solitude of the prairie amused themselves in the cities nor had she and most of her neighbours wholly approved of the liberal views held by heloise durand she had however an unquestioning belief in larry and none in the man beside her  i scarcely think you need have been jealous of him she said larry wasnt miss durands kind and he couldnt be lonely everybody was fond of him  clavering nodded of course still larry hasnt quite so many friends lately  now said hetty with a little flash in her eyes when youve told me that you have got to tell the rest what has he been doing  ploughing said clavering drily i did what i could to restrain him but nobody ever could argue with larry  hetty laughed though she felt a little dismay it was then a serious affair to drive the wheat furrow in a cattle country and the man who did it was apt to be regarded as an iconoclast nevertheless she would not show that she recognized it  well she said that isnt very dreadful the plough is supreme in the dakotas and minnesota now sooner or later it has got to find a place in our country  still thats not going to happen while your father lives  the girl realized the truth of this but she shook her head were not here to talk wheat and cattle and i see flo schuyler looking at us she said go across and make yourself agreeable to the others for the honour of the prairie  clavering went but he had left an unpleasant impression behind him as he had perhaps intended while soon after he took his departure flora schuyler found her friend alone  so you sent jake away she said  yes said hetty i dont know what made me but i felt i had to i almost meant to take him  flora schuyler nodded gravely but it wasnt because of that man clavering  it was not said hetty with a little laugh dont you like him he is rather a famous man back there on the prairie  flora schuyler shook her head no she said he reminded me of that florentine filigree thing its very pretty and i bought it for silver but it isnt  you think hes that kind of man  yes said miss schuyler i wouldnt take him at face value the silvers all on top i dont know what is underneath it and would sooner somebody else found out     iii  the cattlebarons   it was a still hot evening when a somewhat silent company of bronzefaced men assembled in the big living room of cedar range it was built of birch trunks and had once with its narrow windows and loopholes for rifle fire resembled a fortalice but now cedar panelling covered the logs and the great double casements were filled with the finest glass they were open wide that evening around this room had grown up a straggling wooden building of dressed lumber with pillars and scrollwork and as it stood then flanked by its stores and stables barns and cattleboys barracks there was no homestead on a hundred leagues of prairie that might compare with it  outside on the one hand the prairie rolled away in long billowy rises a vast sea of silvery grey for the grass that had been green a month or two was turning white again and here and there a stockrider showed silhouetted a dusky mounted figure against the paling flicker of saffron that still lingered upon the horizon on the other a birch bluff dipped to the cedar river which came down faintly chilled with the rockies snow from the pine forests of the foothills there was a bridge four miles away but the river could be forded beneath the range for a few months each year at other seasons it swirled by frothing in greenstained flood swollen by the drainage of snowfield and glacier and there was no stockrider at the range who dared swim his horse across  sun and wind had their will with the homestead for there was little shelter from icy blizzard and scorching heat at cedar but though here and there the frameboarding gaped and the roofshingles were rent no man accustomed to that country could fail to notice the signs of careful management and prosperity corrals barns and stables were the best of their kind and though the character of all of them was not beyond exception in physique and fitness for their work it would have been hard to match the sinewy men in blue shirts wide hats and long boots then watering their horses at the ford they were as daring and irresponsible swashbucklers as ever rode out on mediæval foray and having once sold their allegiance to torrance of cedar and recognized that he was not to be trifled with were ready to do without compunction anything he bade them  in the meanwhile torrance sat at the head of the long table with clavering of beauregard at his right hand his face was bronzed and resolute and the stamp of command sat plainly upon him there was grey in his dark hair and his eyes were keen and black with a little glint in them but vigorous as he still seemed the hand on the table was smooth and but slightly tinted by the sun for torrance was one who in the language of that country did his work which was usually arduous with his gloves on he was dressed in white shirt and broadcloth and a diamond of price gleamed in the front of the former  his guests were for the most part younger and clavering was scarcely half his age but when they met in conclave something usually happened for the seat of the legislature was far away and their will considerably more potent thereabouts than the law of the land sheriff postmaster railroad agent and petty politician carried out their wishes and as yet no man had succeeded in living in that region unless he did homage to the cattlebarons they were republicans admitting in the abstract the rights of man so long as no venturesome citizen demanded too much of them but they had discovered that in practice liberty is usually the prerogative of the strong still they had done their nation good service for they had found the land a wilderness and covered it with cattle so that its commerce fed the railroads and supported busy wooden towns some of the older men had disputed possession with the indian and most of them in the early days enduring thirst and loneliness and unwearying toil had held on stubbornly in the face of ruin by frost and drought and hail it was not astonishing that as they had made that landso they phrased itthey regarded it as theirs  there were eight of them present and for a time they talked of horses and cattle as they sipped their wine which was the choicest that france could send them and it is also probable that no better cigars ever came from cuba than those they smoked by and by however torrance laid his aside  its time we got down to work he said i sent for ten of you and eight have come one sent valid excuses and one made no answer  larry grant said clavering i guess he was too busy at the depot bringing a fat dutchman and a crowd of hardfaced dakota ploughboys in  there was a little murmur of astonishment which had the men been different would not have been quite free from consternation for it was significant news  youre quite sure asked torrance and his face was stern  well said clavering languidly i saw him and bantered him a little on his prepossessing friends asked him why when he was at it he didnt go to manitoba for canadians larry didnt take it nicely  im sorry said one of the older men larry is one of us and the last man id figure on committing that kind of meanness would be the son of fremont grant quite sure its not a fit of temper you have not been worrying him torrance  torrance closed one hand grant of fremont was my best friend and when he died i most brought the lad up as a son when he got hold of his foolish notions it hurt me considerably and i did what i could to talk him out of them  there was a little smile in the faces of some of the men for torrances draconic fashion of arguing was known to them  you put it a little too straight and he told you something that riled you said one  he did said torrance grimly still for most two years i kept a curb on my temper then one evening i told him he had to choose right then between his fancies and me i could have no dealings with any man who talked as he did  do you remember any of it asked another man  yes said torrance his fathers friends were standing in the way of progress land that would feed a thousand families was keeping us in luxury no american was entitled to this was going to be the poor mans country and the plough was bound to come  clavering laughed softly and there were traces of ironical amusement in the faces of the rest very similar predictions had more than once been flung at them and their possessions were still they fancied secure to them they however became grave again and it was evident that larry grant had hitherto been esteemed by them  if it had been any one else we could have put our thumb on him right now said one still i dont quite figure it would work with larry there are too many folks who would stand in with him  there was a little murmur of approbation and clavering laughed buy him off he said tentatively we have laid out a few thousand dollars in that way before  some of the men made gestures of decided negation and torrance looked at the speaker a trifle sternly  no sir he said larry may be foolish but hes one of us  then said somebody weve got to give him time let it pass you have something to tell us torrance  torrance signed to one of them you had better tell them allonby  a greyhaired man stood up and his fingers shook a little on the table my lease has fallen in and the bureau will not renew it he said im not going to moan about my wrongs but some of you know what it cost me to break in that place of mine you have lived on the bitter water and the saleratus bread but none of you has seen his wife die for the want of the few things he couldnt give her as i did i gave the nation my two boys when the good times came and theyre deadburied in their uniform both of themand now when id laid out my last dollar on the ranch that the one girl ive left me might have something when id gone the government will take it away from me gentlemen is it my duty to sit down quietly  there was a murmur and the men looked at one another with an ominous question in their eyes until torrance raised his hand  the lands not open to location i guess theyre afraid of us and allonbys there on toleration yet he said gentlemen we mean to keep him just where he is because when he pulls out we will have to go too but this thing has to be done quietly when the official machinery moves down here its because we pull the strings and we have got to have the law upon our side as far as we can well thats going to cost us money and we want a campaign fund ill give allonby a cheque for five hundred dollars in the meanwhile if hell be treasurer but as we may all be fixed as he is presently well want a good deal more before were through who will follow me  each of them promised five hundred and then looked at clavering who had not spoken one of them also fancied that there was for a moment a trace of embarrassment in his face but he smiled carelessly  the fact is dollars are rather tight with me just now he said youll have to wait a little if im to do as much as the rest of you i am however quite willing  ill lend you them said torrance allonby ill make that cheque a thousand you have got it down  allonby accepted office and one of the other men rose up now it seems to me that torrance is right and with our leases expired or running out were all in the same tight place he said the first move is to get every man holding cattle land from here to the barren country to stand in and then one way or another well freeze out the homesteaders well then well constitute ourselves a committee with torrance as head executive and as we want to know just what the others are doing my notion is that he should start off tomorrow and ride round the country if there are any organizations ready it might suit us to affiliate with them  it was agreed to and clavering said it seems to me sir that the first question is could we depend upon the boys if we wanted them  torrance strode to an open window and blew a silver whistle its shrill note had scarcely died away when a mounted man came up at a gallop and a band of others in haste on foot they stopped in front of the window picturesque in blue shirts and long boots sinewy generously fed and irresponsibly daring  boys he said youve been told theres a change coming and by and by this country will have no more use for you now if any folks came here and pulled our boundaries up to let the mean whites from back east in what are you going to do  there was a burst of hoarse laughter ride them down said one retainer with the soft blue eyes of a girl and a figure of almost matchless symmetry  grow feathers on them said another ride them back to the railroad on a rail  i scarcely think that would be necessary said torrance quietly still youd stand behind the men who pay you  there was a murmur that expressed a good deal though it was inarticulate and a man stood forward  youve heard them sir he said well well do just what you want us to this is the cattlebarons country and were here its good enough for us and if it means lots of trouble were going to stay here  torrance raised his hand and when the men moved away turned with a little grim smile to his guests theyll be quite as good as their word he said  then he led them back to the table and when the decanter had gone round one of the younger men stood up  we want a constitution gentlemen and ill give you one he said the cedar district stockraisers committee incorporated today with for sole object the defence of our rights as american citizens  clavering rose with the others but there was a little ironical smile in his eyes as he said if necessary against any unlawful encroachments made by the legislature  torrance turned upon him sternly no sir he said by whatever means may appear expedient  the glasses were lifted high and when they had laid them down the men rode away though only one or two of them realized the momentous issues which they and others had raised at about much the same time they had not however met in conclave too soon for any step that man makes forward towards a wider life is usually marked by strife and the shadow of coming trouble was already upon the land it had deepened little by little and the cattlebarons had closed their eyes as other men who have held the reins have done since the beginning until the lean hands of the toilers fastened upon them and fresh horrors added to an ancient wrong were the price of liberty that was lost again they had done good service to their nation with profit to themselves and would not see that the times were changing and that the nation had no longer need of them  other men however at least suspected it and there was an expectant gathering one hot afternoon in the railroad depot of a little wooden town where grant stood waiting for the westbound train there was little to please the eye about the station and still less about the town straight out of the great white levels ran the glistening track and an unsightly building of wood and iron rose from the side of it flanked by a towering watertank a pump rattled under it and the smell of creosote was everywhere cattle corrals ran back from the track and beyond them sunrent frame houses roofed with cedar shingles straggled away on the one hand paintless crude and square on the other a smear of trail led the dazzled vision back across the parched levels to the glancing refraction on the horizon and the figure of a single horseman showing dimly through a dust cloud emphasized their loneliness the town was hot and dusty its one green fringe of willows defiled by the garbage the citizens deposited there and the most lenient stranger could have seen no grace or beauty in it yet like many another place of the kind it was destined to rise to prosperity and fame  the depot was thronged that afternoon store and hotel keeper citizens in white shirts and broadcloth jostled blueshirted cattle men while here and there a petty politician consulted with the representative of a western paper the smoke of cigars drifted everywhere and the listless heat was stirred by the hum of voices eager and strident it was evident that the assembly was in an expectant mood and there was a murmur of approbation when one newspaper man laid hold of grant  i couldnt light on you earlier but ten minutes will see us through he said well make a halfpage of it if youll let me have your views new epoch in the countrys history the small farmer the coming king a woodcut of the man who brought the first plough in  larry grant laughed a little there are quite a few ahead of me and if you spread my views the barons would put their thumb on you and squeeze you flat he said on the other hand it wouldnt suit me if you sent them anything i told you to publish  the man appeared a trifle embarrassed the rights of the press are sacred in a free country sir he said  well said grant drily although i hope it will be this country isnt quite free yet i surmise that you dont know that the office of your contemporary farther east was broken into a few hours ago and an article written by a friend of mine pulled out of the press the proprietor was quietly held down upon the floor when he objected you will hear whether i am right or wrong tomorrow  what the man would have answered did not appear for just then somebody shouted and a trail of smoke swept up above the rim of the prairie it rose higher and whiter something that flashed dazzlingly grew into shape beneath it and there was a curious silence when the dusty cars rolled into the little station it was followed by a murmur as an elderly man in broad white hat and plain store clothing and a plump blueeyed young woman came out upon the platform of a car he wore a pair of spectacles and gazed about him in placid inquiry until grant stepped forward then he helped the young woman down and held out a big hard hand  mr grant he said  grant nodded and raised his hat to the girl yes he said mr muller  ja said the other man also der fräulein muller  there was a little ironical laughter from the crowd a dutchman said somebody from chicago they raise them there in the sausage machine the hogs go in at one end and they rake the dutchmen out of the other  muller looked round inquiringly but apparently failed to discover the speaker  dot he said is der chestnut i him have heard before  there was goodhumoured laughterfor even when it has an animus an american crowd is usually fair and in the meanwhile five or six other men got down from a car they were lean and brown with somewhat grim faces and were dressed in blue shirts and jean  well said one of them were americans got any objections to us getting off here boys  some of the men in store clothing nodded a greeting but there were others in wide hats and long boots with spurs who jeered  brought your ploughcows along said one and the taunt had its meaning for it is usually only the indigent and incapable who plough with oxen  no said one of the newcomers we have horses back yonder when we want mules or cowsteerers i guess well find them here you seem to have quite a few of them around  a man stepped forward jingling his spurs with his jacket of embroidered deerskin flung open to show though this was as yet unusual that he wore a bandolier rolling back one loose sleeve he displayed a brown arm with the letters c r tattooed within a garter upon it see this youve heard of that mark before he said  cash required said the newcomer with a grin well i guess thats not astonishing it would be a blame foolish man who gave you credit  no sir said the stockrider its cedar range and theres twenty boys and more cattle than you could count in a long day carrying that brand it will be a cold day when you and the rest of the dakotas start kicking against that outfit  there was laughter and acclamation in the midst of which the cars rolled on but in the meanwhile grant had seized the opportunity to get a gangplough previously unloaded from a freightcar into a wagon the sight of it raised a demonstration and there were hoots and cries of approbation while a man with a flushed face was hoisted to the top of a kerosenebarrel  boys he said theres no use howling were americans nobody can stop us and were going on you might as well kick against a railroad and because the plough and the small farmer will do more for you than even the locomotive did they have got to come well now some of you are keeping stores and one or two i see here baking bread and making clothes which is going to do the most for your trade and you a handful of rich men who wouldnt eat or wear the things you have to sell owning the whole country or a family farming on every quarter section a town ten times this size wouldnt be much use to them well youve had your cattlebarons gentlemen most of them but even a man of that kind has to step out of the track and make room when the nations moving on  he probably said more but grant did not hear him for he had as unostentatiously as possible conveyed muller and the fräulein into a wagon and had horses led up for the dakota men they had some difficulty in mounting and the crowd laughed goodhumouredly though here and there a man flung jibes at them while one jolting in his saddle as his broncho reared turned to grant with a little deprecatory gesture  in our country we mostly drive in wagons but ill ride by the stirrup and get down when nobody sees me he said the beast wouldnt try to climb out this way if there wasnt something kind of prickly under his saddle  grants face was a trifle grim when he saw that more of the horses were inclined to behave similarly but he flicked his team with the whip and there was cheering and derision when with a drumming of hoofs and rattle of wheels wagons and horsemen swept away into the dustcloud that rolled about the trail  this he said is only a little joke of theirs and theyll go a good deal further when they get their blood up still i tried to warn you what you might expect  so said muller with a placid grin it is noding to der franc tireurs i was in der chase of menotti among der vosges also at paris  well said grant drily im most afraid that by and by youll go through very much the same kind of thing again what you saw at the depot is going on wherever the railroad is bringing the farmers in and weve got men in this country whod make firstgrade franc tireurs     iv  muller stands fast   the windows of fremont homestead were open wide and larry grant sat by one of them in a state of quiet contentment after a long days ride outside the prairie fading from grey to purple ran back to the dusky east and the little cool breeze that came up out of the silence and flowed into the room had in it the qualities of snowchilled wine a star hung low to the westward in a field of palest green and a shaded lamp burned dimly at one end of the great bare room  by it the fräulein muller flaxenhaired plump and blueeyed sat knitting and larrys eyes grew a trifle wistful when he glanced at her it was a very long while since any woman had crossed his threshold and the redcheeked fräulein gave the comfortless bachelor dwelling a curiously homelike appearance nevertheless it was not the recollection of its usual dreariness that called up the sigh for larry grant had had his dreams like other men and miss muller was not the woman he had now and then daringly pictured sitting there her father perhaps from force of habit sat with a big meerschaum in hand by the empty stove and if his face expressed anything at all it was phlegmatic content opposite him sat breckenridge a young englishman lately arrived from minnesota  what do you think of the land now youve seen it asked grant  muller nodded reflectively der land is good it is der firstgrade hard wheat she will grow i three hundred and twenty acres buy  well said grant im willing to let you have it but i usually try to do the square thing and you may have trouble before you get your first crop in  und said muller so you want to sell  grant laughed not quite and i cant sell that land outright ill let it to you while my lease runs and when that falls in youll have the same right to homestead a quarter or half section for nothing as any other man in the meanwhile i and one or two others are going to start wheatgrowing on land that is ours outright and take our share of the trouble  ja said muller but dere is much dot is not clear to me why you der trouble like  well said grant as ive tried to tell you it works out very much like this it was known that this land was specially adapted to mixed farming quite a few years ago but the men who ran their cattle over it never drove a plough you want to know why well i guess it was for much the same reason that an association of our big manufacturers bought up the patents of an improved process and for a long while never made an ounce of material under them or let any one else try we had to pay more than it was worth for an inferior article that hampered some of the most important industries in the country and they piled up the dollars in the oldtime way  und said muller dot is democratic america  yes said grant that is the america we mean to alter well where one man feeds his cattle fifty could plough and make a living raising stock on a smaller scale and the times quite close upon us when they will but the cattlemen have got the country and it will hurt them to let go its not their land and was only lent them now im no fonder of trouble than any other man but this country fed and taught me and kept me two years in europe looking round and id feel mean if i took everything and gave it nothing back muller will understand me do you breckenridge  the english lad laughed oh yes though i dont know that any similar obligation was laid on myself the country i came from had apparently no use for a younger son at all and it was kicks and snubs it usually bestowed on me but if theres a row on hand im quite willing to stand by you and see it through my folks will however be mildly astonished when they hear ive turned reformer  grant nodded goodhumouredly for he was not a fanatic but an american with a firm belief in the greatness of his countrys destiny who however realized that faith alone was scarcely sufficient  well he said if its trouble youre anxious for its quite likely youll find it here nobody ever got anything worth having unless he fought for it and weve taken on a tolerably big contract were going to open up this state for any man who will work for it to make a living in and substitute its constitution for the law of the cattlebarons  der progress said muller she is irresistible  breckenridge laughed from what i was taught it seems to me that she moves round in rings you start with the luxury of the few oppression and brutality then comes revolution and worse things than you had before progress growing out of it that lasts for a few generations until the few fittest get more than their fair share of wealth and control and you come back to the same point again  muller shook his head no he said it is nod der ring but der elastic spiral der progress she march it is true round und round but she is arrive always der one turn higher und der pressure on der volute is nod constant  on the top said breckenridge principalities and powers traditional and aristocratic or monetary well it seems to me they squeeze progress down tolerably flat between them occasionally take our old cathedral cities and some of your german ones and if you demand it ill throw their ghettos in then put the new york tenements or most of the smaller western towns beside them and see what youve arrived at  no said muller tranquilly weight above she is necessary while der civilization is incomblete but der force is from der bottom it is all time positive and primitive for it was make when man was make at der beginning  grant nodded well he said our works waiting right here what other men have done in the dakotas and minnesota we are going to do nature has been storing us food for the wheat plant for thousands of years and theres more gold in our black soil than was ever dug out of mexico or california still you have to get it out by ploughing and not by making theories breckenridge you will stay with me but youll want a house to live in muller  muller drew a roll of papers out of his pocket and grant who took them from him stared in wonder they were drawings and calculations relating to building with undressed lumber made with teutonic precision and accuracy  i have said muller der observation make how you build der homestead in this country  then well start you in tomorrow said grant youll get all the lumber you want in the birch bluff and ill lend you one or two of the boys i brought in from michigan theres nobody on this continent handier with the axe  muller nodded and refilled his pipe and save for the click of the fräuleins needles there was once more silence in the bare room she had not spoken for the knitting and the baking were her share and the men whose part was the conflict must be clothed and fed they knew it could not be evaded and springing from the same colonizing stock placid teuton with his visions and precision in everyday details eager american and adventurous englishman each made ready for it in his own fashion free as yet from passion or desire for fame they were willing to take up the burden that was to be laid upon them but only the one who knew the least awaited it joyously others had also the same thoughts up and down that lonely land and the dusty cars were already bringing the vanguard of the homeless host in they were for the most part quiet and resolute men who asked no more than leave to till a few acres of the wilderness and to eat what they had sown but there were among them others of a different kindfanatics outcasts men with wrongsand behind them the human vultures who fatten on rapine as yet the latter found no occupation waiting them but their sight was keen and they knew their time would come  it was a week later and a hot afternoon when muller laid the big crosscut saw down on the log he was severing and slowly straightened his back then he stood up red and very damp in face a burly squareshouldered man and having mislaid his spectacles blinked about him on three sides of him the prairie swelling in billowy rises ran back to the horizon but on the fourth a dusky wall of foliage followed the crest of a ravine and the murmur of water came up faintly from the creek in the hollow between himself and its slender birches lay piled amidst the parched and dusty grass and the first courses of a wooden building rank with the smell of sappy timber already stood in front of him there was no notch in the framing that had not been made and pinned with an exact precision in its scanty shadow his daughter sat knitting beside a smouldering fire over which somebody had suspended a big blackened kettle the crash of the last falling trunk had died away and there was silence in the bluff but a drumming of hoofs rose in a sharp staccato from the prairie  now said muller quietly i think the chasseurs come  the girl looked up a moment noticed the four mounted figures that swung over the crest of a rise and then went on with her knitting again still there was for a second a little flash in her pale blue eyes  the horsemen came on the dust floating in long wisps behind them until with a jingle of bridle and stirrup they pulled up before the building three of them were bronzed and dusty in weatherstained blue shirts wide hats and kneeboots that fitted them like gloves and there was ironical amusement in their faces each sat his horse as if he had never known any other seat than the saddle but the fourth was different from the rest he wore a jacket of richly embroidered deerskin and the shirt under it was white while he sat with one hand in a big leather glove resting on his hip his face was sallow and his eyes were dark  hallo hamburg he said and his voice had a little commanding ring you seem kind of busy  muller blinked at him he had apparently not yet found his spectacles but he had in the meanwhile come upon his axe and now stood very straight with the long haft reaching to his waist  ja he said mine house i build  well said the man in the embroidered jacket i fancy youre wasting time asked anybodys leave to cut that lumber or put it up  mine friend said muller smiling when it is nod necessary i ask nodings of any man  then said the horseman drily as he turned to his companions i fancy thats where youre wrong boys well take him along in case torrance would like to see him i guess youll have to walk home jim  a man dismounted and led forward his horse with a wrench upon the bridle that sent it plunging get your foot in the stirrup hamburg and ill hoist you up he said  muller stood motionless and the horseman in deerskin glancing round in his direction saw his daughter for the first time he laughed but there was something in his black eyes that caused the teutons fingers to close a trifle upon the haft of the axe  youll have to get down charlie as well as jim he said torrance has his notions or coyote might have carried miss hamburg that far as well sorry to hurry you hamburg but i dont like waiting  muller stepped back a pace and the axehead flashed as he moved his hand while dazzled by the beam it cast the halftamed broncho rose with hoofs in the air its owner smote it on the nostrils with his fist and the pair sidled round each otherthe man with his arm drawn back the beast with laidback earsfor almost a minute before they came to a standstill  mine friend said muller other day i der pleasure have i mine house have to build  get up said the stockrider ever seen anybody fire off a gun  muller laughed softly and glanced at the leader der rifle he said drily i was at sedan today it is not convenient that i come  hoist him up said the leader and once more while the other man moved forward muller stepped back but this time there was an answering flash in his blue eyes as the big axehead flashed in the sun  i guess wed better hold on said another man look there mr clavering  he pointed to the bluff and the leaders face darkened as he gazed for four men with axes were running down the slope and they were lean and wiry with very grim faces they were also apparently small farmers or lumbermen from the bush of michigan and clavering knew such men usually possessed a terrible proficiency with the keenedged weapon and stubbornness was native in them two others one of whom he knew came behind them the foremost stopped and stood silent when the man clavering recognized signed to them but not before each had posted himself strategically within reach of a horsemans bridle  you might explain clavering what you and your cowboys are doing here he said  clavering laughed we are going to take your teutonic friend up to the range he is cutting our fuel timber with nobodys permission  no said grant drily he has mine the bluff is on my run  did you take out timber rights with your lease asked clavering  no i hadnt much use for them none of my neighbours hold any either but the bluff is big enough and ive no objection to their cutting what billets they want still i cant have them driving out any other friends of mine  clavering smiled ironically you have been picking up some curious acquaintances larry but dont you think you had better leave this thing to torrance the fact is the cattlemen are not disposed to encourage strangers building houses in their country just now  i had a notion it belonged to this state its not an unusual one said grant  clavering shrugged his shoulders of course it sounds better that way have it so still it will scarcely pay you to make yourself unpopular with us larry  well said grant drily it seems to me im tolerably unpopular already but thats not quite the point take your boys away  clavering flung his hand up in halfironical salutation but as he was about to wheel his horse a young englishman whose nationality was plainly stamped upon him seized his bridle  not quite so fast he said it would be more fitting if you got down and expressed your regrets to the fräulein you havent heard mullers story yet larry  let go said clavering raising the switch he held drop my bridle or take care of yourself  come down said breckenridge  the switch went up and descended hissing upon part of an averted face but the lad sprang as it fell and the next moment the horse rose almost upright with two men clinging to it one of them whose sallow cheeks were livid now swaying in the saddle then grant grasped the bridle that fell from the riders hands and hurled his comrade backwards while some of the stockriders pushed their horses nearer and the axemen closed in about them  hoarse cries went up horses back pull him off give the britisher a show leave them to it  it was evident that a blunder would have unpleasant results for clavering with switch raised had tightened his left hand on the bridle grant had loosed again while a wicked smile crept into his eyes and the lad stood tense and still with hands clenched in front of him and a weal on his young face grant however stepped in between them  weve had sufficient fooling breckenridge he said clavering ill give you a minute to get your men away and if you cant do it in that time youll take the consequences  clavering wheeled his horse the odds are with you larry he said you have made a big blunder but i guess you know your own business best  he nodded including the fräulein with an easy insolence that yet became him touched the horse with his heel and in another moment he and his cowboys were swinging at a gallop across the prairie then as they dipped behind a rise those who were left glanced at one another breckenridge was very pale and one of his hands was bleeding where claverings spur had torn it  it seems that we have made a beginning he said hoarsely its first blood to them but this will take a lot of forgetting and the rest may be different  grant made no answer but turned and looked at muller who stood very straight and square with a curious brightness in his eyes  are you going on with the contract there is the girl to consider said grant  illustration come downpage 47  ja said the teuton i was in der vosges and der girl is also fräulein muller  boys said grant to the men from michigan you have seen whats in front of you and youll probably have to use more than axes before youre through still you have the chance of clearing out right now i only want willing men behind me  one of the big axemen laughed scornfully and there was a little sardonic grin in the faces of the rest  theres more room for us here than there was in michigan and now weve got our foot down here were not going back again he said thats about all there is to it but when our time comes the other men arent going to find us slacker than the dutchman  grant nodded gravely well he said very simply i guess the lord who made this country will know whos in the right and help them theyll need it theres a big fight coming  then they went back to their hewing in the bluff and the fräulein muller went on with her knitting     v  hetty comes home   it was an afternoon of the indian summer sunny and cool and the maples about the schuyler villa flamed gold and crimson against a sky of softest blue when hetty torrance sat reflectively silent on the lawn flora schuyler sat near her with a book upside down upon her knee  you have been worrying about something the last few weeks she said  is that quite unusual asked hetty havent a good many folks to worry all the time  flora schuyler smiled just finding it out hetty well i have noticed a change and it began the day you waited for us at the depot and it wasnt because of jake cheyne  no said hetty reflectively i suppose it should have been have you heard from him since he went away  lily cheyne had a letter with some photographs and she showed it to me its a desolate place in the sage bush hes living in and theres not a white man except the boys he cant talk to within miles of him while from the picture i saw of his adobe room i scarcely think folks would have it down here to keep hogs in jake cheyne was fastidious too and there was a forced cheerfulness about his letter which had its meaning though of course he never mentioned you  hetty flushed a trifle flo im sorry still you cant blame me  no said miss schuyler though there was a time when i wished i could you cant help being pretty but it ought to make you careful when you see another of them going that way again  hetty made a little impatient gesture if there ever is another hell be pulled up quite sharp you dont think their foolishness which spoils everything is any pleasure to me its too humiliating cant one be friends with a nice man without falling in love with him  well said miss schuyler drily it depends a good deal on how youre made but its generally risky for one or the other still perhaps you might for i have a fancy theres something short in you now im going to ask you a question is it thinking of the other man that has made you restless i mean the one we saw at the depot  hetty laughed outright larry why as i tried to tell you he has always been just like a cousin or a brother to me and doesnt want anything but his horses and cattle and his books on political economy larrys quite happy with his ranching and his dreams of the new america of course theyll never come to anything but when you can start him talking theyre quite nice to listen to  flora schuyler shook her head i wouldnt be too sure that man is in earnest and the dreams of an earnest american have a way of coming true you have known him a long while and ive only seen him once but that man will do more than talk if he ever has the opportunity he has the quiet grit one finds in the best of usnot the kind that make the speechesand some englishmen in him you can see it in his eyes  then said hetty with a little laugh come back with me to cedar and if youre good you shall have him it isnt everybody id give larry to  there was a trace of indignation in flora schuylers face i fancy he would not appreciate your generosity and theres a good deal you have got to find out hetty she said drily it may hurt you when you do but you havent told me yet what has been worrying you  no said hetty with a little wistful smile well im going to its hard to own to but im a failure i fancied i could make everybody listen to my singing and i would come here well i came and found out that my voice would never bring me fame and for a time it hurt me horribly still i couldnt go back just then and when you and your mother pressed me i stayed i knew what you expected and i disappointed you perhaps i was too fastidious but there were none of them that really pleased me then i began to see that i was only spoiling nicer girls chances and trying the patience of everybody  hetty said flora schuyler but miss torrance checked her  wait until im through then it became plain to me that while id been wasting my time here the work i was meant for was waiting at cedar the old man who gave me everything is very lonely there and he and larry have been toiling on while i flung most what a ranch would cost away on lessons and dresses and fripperies which will never be any good to me still im an american too and now when theres trouble coming im going back to the place i belong to  you are doing the right thing now said flora schuyler  hetty smiled somewhat mirthlessly well she said because its hard i guess i am but theres one thing would make it easier you will come and stay with me you dont know how much i want you and new york in winter doesnt suit you youre pale already come and try our clear dry cold  eventually miss schuyler promised and hetty rose then its fixed she said ill write the old man a dutiful letter now while i feel like doing it well  the letter was duly written and as it happened reached torrance as he sat alone one evening in his great bare room at cedar range among the papers on the table in front of him were letters from the cattlemens committees which had sprung into existence every here and there and torrance apparently did not find them reassuring for there was care in his face it had become evident that the big ranchers rights were mostly traditional and already in scattered detachments the vanguard of the homesteaders host was filing in here and there they had made their footing good more often by means not wholly constitutional their outposts had been driven in but it was noticeable that torrance and his neighbours still believed them no more than detachments and had not heard the footsteps of the rest three years residence in that land had changed the aliens into american citizens but a lifetime of prosperity could scarcely efface the bitterness they had brought with them from the east while some in spite of their crude socialistic aspirations were drilled men who had herded the imperial legions like driven cattle into sedan more of native birth helots of the cities and hired hands of the plains were also turning desiring eyes upon the wide spaces of the cattle country where there was room for all  torrance opened his letter and smiled somewhat drily it was affectionate and not without its faint pathos for hetty had been stirred when she wrote but the grim old widower felt no great desire for the gentle attentions of a dutiful daughter just then  we shall be at cedar soon after you get this he read among the rest i know if i had told you earlier you would have protested you didnt want me just because you foolishly fancied i should be lonely at the range but i have been very selfish and you must have been horribly lonely too and one of the nicest girls you ever saw is coming to amuse you you cant help liking flo of course i had to bring a maid but you will have to make the best of us because you couldnt stop us now if you wanted to  it was noticeable that torrance took the pains to confirm this fact by reference to a railroad schedule and finding it incontrovertible shook his head  three of them he said  then he sat still with the letter in his hand while a trace of tenderness crept into his face which however grew grave again until there was a tapping at the door and clavering came in  you seem a trifle worried sir and if youre busy i neednt keep you long he said i just wanted to hand you a cheque for the subscription you paid for me  sit down said torrance where did you get the dollars from  clavering appeared almost uneasy for a moment but he laughed ive been thinning out my cattle  thats not a policy i approve of just now well have the rabble down upon us as soon as we show any sign of weakening  clavering made a little deprecatory gesture it wasnt a question of policy i had to have the dollars still you havent told me if you have heard anything unpleasant from the other committees  torrance appeared thoughtful he suspected that claverings ranch was embarrassed and the explanation was plausible  no he said it was something else hetty is on her way home and she is bringing another young woman and a maid with her they will be here before i can stop them still i could if it was necessary send them back  clavering did not answer for a moment though torrance saw the faint gleam in his dark eyes and watched him narrowly then he said you will find a change in miss torrance sir she has grown into a beautiful young woman and has i fancy been taught to think for herself in the city you could not expect her to come back as she left the prairie and if anything has induced her to decide that her place is here she will probably stay  youre not quite plain what could induce her  clavering smiled though he saw that the shot had told it was astonishing that miss torrance did not honour me with her confidence a sense of duty perhaps although one notices that the motives of young women are usually a trifle involved it however appears to me that if miss torrance makes up her mind to stay we are still quite capable of guarding our women from anxiety or molestation  yes said torrance grimly of course still we may have to do things we would sooner they didnt hear about or see well you have some news  clavering nodded i was in at the railroad and fifty dakota men came in on the cars i went round to the hotel with the committee and though it cost some dollars to fix the thing they wouldnt take them in the boys who got kind of savage found a pole and drove the door in but we turned the sheriff who had already sworn some of us in loose on them four or five men were nastily clubbed and one of jamess boys was shot through the arm while i have a fancy that the citizens would have stood in with the other crowd but seeing they were not going to get anything to eat there they held up a store and as we told the man who kept it how their friends had sacked regent he fired at them the consequence is that the sheriff has some of them in jail and the rest are camped down on the prairie we hold the town  through the sheriff  clavering laughed hell earn his pay has it struck you that this campaign is going to cost us a good deal allonby hasnt much left in hand already  oh yes said the older man with a little grim smile if its wanted ill throw my last dollar in beaten now and were beaten for ever we have got to win  clavering said nothing further though he realized perhaps more clearly than his leader that it was only by the downfall of the cattlemen the small farmer could establish himself and when he had handed a cheque to torrance went out  it was three days later when hetty torrance rose from her seat in a big vestibule car as the long train slackened speed outside a little western station she laughed as she swept her glance round the car  look at it flo she said gilding and velvet and nickel all quite in keeping with the luxury of the east you are environed by civilization still but once you step off the platform there will be a difference  flora schuyler who noticed the little flush in her companions face glanced out of the dusty window for the interior of the gentlyrocking car with its lavish decoration and upholstery was not new to her and the first thing that caught her eye was the miscellaneous deposit of rubbish old boots and discarded clothing amidst the willows that slowly flitted by then she saw a towering watertank wooden houses that rose through a haze of blowing dust hideous in their unadornment against a crystalline sky and a row of closepacked stockcars which announced that they were in the station  it seemed to be thronged with the populace and there was a murmur apparently of disappointed expectancy when as the cars stopped the three women alone appeared on the platform then there was a shout for the conductor and somebody said youve no rustlers aboard for us  no said the grinning official who leaned out from the door of the baggagecar the next crowd are waiting until they can buy rifles to whip you with  hoarse laughter followed and somebody said boys your friends arent coming you can take your band home again  then out of the clamour came the roll of a drum and clear and musical the ringing of bugles blown by men who had marched with grant and sherman when they were young the effect was stirring and a cheer went up for there were other men present in whom the spirit which underlying immediate issues had roused the north to arms was living yet but it broke off into laughter when one by one discordant instruments and beaten pans joined in the din however ceased suddenly when somebody said hadnt you better let up boys or torrance will figure you sent the band for him  miss schuyler appeared a trifle bewildered the maid frightened but hettys cheeks were glowing  flo she said arent you glad you came the boys are taking the trail well show you how we stir the prairie up by and by  miss schuyler was very doubtful as to whether the prospect afforded her any pleasure but just then a greyhaired man dressed immaculately in white shirt and city clothes kissed her companion and then taking off his hat handed her down from the platform with ceremonious courtesy he had a grim forceful face with pride and command in it and miss schuyler who felt half afraid of him then never quite overcame the feeling she noticed however that he paid equal attention to the terrified maid  it would be a duty to do our best for any of hettys friends who have been so kind to her in the city but in this case its going to be a privilege too he said well you will be tired and they have a meal waiting you at the hotel this place is a little noisy today but well start on the first stage of your journey when youre ready  he gave miss schuyler his arm and moved towards the thickest of the crowd which though apparently slightly hostile made way for him here and there a man drove his fellows back and one catching up a loose plank laid it down for the party to cross the rail switches on torrance turned to thank him but the man swept his hat off with a laugh  i wouldnt worry it wasnt for you he said its a long while since weve seen anything so pretty as miss torrance and the other one  flora schuyler flushed a little but hetty turned to the speaker with a sparkle in her eyes  now she said that was most worth a dollar and if i didnt know what kind of man you were id give it you but what about clarksons lou  there was a laugh from the assembly and the man appeared embarrassed  well he said slowly she went off with jo  miss torrance nodded sympathetically still if she knew no better than that i wouldnt worry jo had a cast in his eye  the crowd laughed again and flora schuyler glanced at her companion with some astonishment as she asked do you always talk to them that way  of course said hetty theyre our boysgrown right here arent they splendid  miss schuyler once more appeared dubious and made no answer but she noticed that the man now preceded them and raised his hand when they came up with the band which had apparently halted to indulge in retort or badinage with some of those who followed them  hold on a few minutes boys and down with that flag he said  then a tawdry banner was lowered suddenly between two poles but not before miss torrance had seen part of the blazoned legend its unvarnished forcefulness brought a flush to her companions cheek  dad she asked more gravely what is it all about  torrance laughed a little that he said is a tolerably big question it would take quite a long while to answer it  they had a street to traverse and hetty saw that it was filled with little knots of men some of whom stared at her father though as she passed their hats came off miss schuyler on her part noticed that most of the stores were shut and felt that she had left new york a long way behind as she glanced at the bare wooden houses cracked by frost and sun rickety plank walks whirling wisps of dust and groups of men splendid in their lean muscular symmetry and picturesque apparel there was a boldness in their carriage and a grace that approached the statuesque in every poise still she started when they passed one wooden building where blueshirted figures with rifles stood motionless in the verandah  the jail said torrance quietly the sheriff has one or two rioters safe inside there  they found an indifferent meal ready at the wooden hotel and when they descended in riding dress a wagon with their baggage was waiting outside the door while a few mounted men with wide hats and bandoliers came up with three saddlehorses torrance bestowed the maid in the light wagon and when the two girls were mounted swung himself into the saddle then as they trotted down the unpaved street hetty glanced at him and pointed to the dusty horsemen  what are the boys for she asked  torrance smiled grimly i told you we had our troubles it seemed better to bring them in case we had any difficulty with larrys friends  larrys friends asked hetty almost indignantly  torrance nodded yes he said you have seen a few of them they were carrying the flag with the inscription at the depot  hetty asked nothing further but flora schuyler noticed the little flash in her eyes and as they crossed the railroad track the clear notes of the bugles rose again and were followed by a tramp of feet glancing over their shoulders the girls could see men moving in a body with the flag they carried tossing amidst the dust they were coming on in open fours and when the bugles ceased deep voices sent a marching song ringing across the wooden town  hettys eyes sparkled the stockriders seemed to swing more lightly in their saddles and flora schuyler felt a little quiver run through her something that jingling rhythm and the simple words expressed but inarticulately stirred her blood as she remembered that in her nations last great struggle the long battalions had limped on ragged and footsore singing that song  listen said hetty while the colour crept into her face oh i know its scarcely music and the crudest verse but it served its purpose and is there any nation on earth could put more swing and spirit into the grandest theme  torrance smiled somewhat drily but there was a curious expression in his face some of those men are drawing their pension but theyre not with us he said its only because we have sent in all the boys we can spare that the sheriff who has their partners in his jail can hold the town  a somewhat impressive silence followed this and flora schuyler glanced at hetty when they rode out into the white prairie with two dusty men with bandoliers on either flank     vi  the incendiary   events of no apparent moment have extensive issues now and then and while cattleman and homesteader braced themselves for the conflict which they felt would come the truce might have lasted longer but for the fact that one night muller slept indifferently in the new house he had built he was never quite sure what made him restless or prompted him to open and lean out of his window and when he had done this he saw and heard nothing unusual for a while  on one hand the birch bluff rose a dusky wall against the indigo of the sky and in front of him the prairie rolled away silent and shadowy there was scarcely a sound but the low ripple of the creek until somewhere far off in the distance a coyote howled the drawnout wail had in it something unearthly and muller who was by no means an imaginative man shivered a little the deep silence of the great empty land emphasized by the sound reacted upon him and increased his restlessness  scarcely knowing why he did so except that he felt he could not sleep he slipped on a few garments and moved softly to the door that he might not disturb his daughter there was no moon when he went out but the stars shone clearly in the great vault of blue and the barns and stables he had built rose black against the sky though grant had lent him assistance and he had hewn the lumber on the spot one cannot build a homestead and equip it for nothing and when he had provided himself with working horses muller had sunk the last of his scanty capital in the venture it was perhaps this fact which induced him to approach the stable moving noiselessly in his slippers and glance within  the interior was black and shadowy but there was no doubting the fact that the beasts were moving restlessly muller went in holding his breath as he peered about him and one broncho backed away as he approached its stall muller patted it on the flank and the horse stood still as though reassured when it recognized him which was not without its meaning he listened but hearing nothing groped round the stable and taking a hayfork went out as softly as he had entered and took up his post in the deepest shadow where he commanded outbuildings and house there was he knew nobody but grant dwelling within several leagues of him and as yet property was at least as safe in that country as it was in chicago or new york but as he leaned impassively watchful against the wall he remembered an episode which had happened a few weeks earlier  he had been overtaken by a band of stockriders when fording the creek with his daughter and one who loitered behind them reined his horse in and spoke to the girl muller never knew what his words had been but he saw the sudden colour in the fräuleins face and seized the mans bridle an altercation ensued and when the man rejoined his comrades who apparently did not sympathize with him his bridle hand hung limp and the farmer was smiling as he swung a stick muller attached no especial importance to the affair but grant who did not tell him so differed in this when he heard of it he knew that the cattlerider is usually rather chivalrous than addicted to distasteful gallantries  in any case muller heard nothing for a while and felt tempted to return to his bed when he grew chilly he had however spent bitter nights stalking the franc tireurs in the snow and the vigilance taught and demanded by an inflexible discipline had not quite deserted him though he was considerably older and less nimble now at last however a dim moving shadow appeared round a corner of the building stopped a moment and then slid on again towards the door so noiseless was it that muller could almost have believed his eyes had deceived him until he heard the hasp rattle still he waited until the figure passed into the stable and then very cautiously crept along the wall muller was not so vigorous as he had been when proficiency in the use of the bayonet had been drilled into him but while his fingers tightened on the haft of the fork he fancied that he had still strength enough to serve his purpose he had also been taught to use it to the best advantage  he straightened himself a little when he stood in the entrance and looked about him there was a gleam of light in the stable now for a lantern stood upon a manger and revealed by its uncertain glimmer a pile of prairie hay with a kerosenecan upon it laid against the logs muller was not wholly astonished but he was looking for more than that and the next moment he saw a shadowy object apparently loosing the nearest horses halter it was doubtless a merciful deed but it was to cost the incendiary dear for when perhaps warned by some faint sound he looked up suddenly he saw a black figure between him and the door  on the instant he dropped the halter and the hand that had held it towards his belt but as it happened the horse pinned him against the stall and his opportunity had passed when it moved again muller had drawn his right leg back with his knee bent a trifle and there was a rattle as he brought the long fork down to the charge thus when the man was free the deadly points twinkled in a ray from the lantern within a foot of his breast it was also unpleasantly evident that a heave of the farmers shoulder would bury them in the quivering flesh  hands oop a stern voice said  the man delayed a second the butt of the pistol that would equalize the affair was almost within his grasp and muller stood in the light but he saw an ominous glint in the pale blue eyes and the farmers fingers tighten on the haft there was also a suggestive raising of one shoulder and his hands went up above his head muller advanced the points an inch or two stiffening his right leg and smiled grimly the other man stared straight in front of him with dilated eyes and a little grey patch growing larger in either cheek  are you going to murder me you condemned dutchman he said  yes said muller tranquilly if you der movement make so it is done without der trouble when you have der bayonet exercise make  the points gleamed as they swung forward and the man gasped but they stopped at the right second and muller who had hove his burly form a trifle more upright sank back again bringing his foot down with a stamp the little demonstration was more convincing than an hour of argument  well said the man hoarsely im corralled throw that thing away and ill give you my pistol  muller laughed and then raised his great voice in what was to the other an unknown tongue lotta he said come quick and bring the american rifle  there was silence for perhaps five minutes and the men watched each other one white in the face and quivering a little his adversary impassive as a statue but quietly observant then there was a patter of hasty footsteps and the fräulein stood in the lantern light with a flushed plump face and somewhat scanty dress she apparently recognized the man and her colour deepened but that was the only sign of confusion she showed and it was evident that the discipline of the fatherland had not been neglected in mullers household  lotta he said in english open der little slide you feel der cartridge now der butt to der shoulder und der eye on der sight as i have teach you der middle of him is der best place i shout und you press quite steady  he spoke with a quiet precision that had its effect and whatever the girl felt she obeyed each command in rotation there was however one danger which the stranger realized and that was that with an involuntary contraction of the forefinger she might anticipate the last one  shell shoot me before she means to he said with a little gasp come and take the condemned pistol  der middle of him said muller tranquilly no movement make you  dropping the fork he moved forward not in front of the man but to his side and whipped the pistol from his belt  one turn make he said so your hand behind you lotta you will now a halter get  the girls loose bodice rose and fell as she laid down the rifle but she was swift and in less than another minute muller had bound his captives hands securely behind his back and crosslashed them from wrist to elbow he inspected the work critically and then nodded as if contented  illustration shell shoot me before she means topage 66  lotta he said put der saddle on der broncho horse then in der house you der cordial find und of it one large spoonful mit der water take my pipe you bring me also und then you ride for mr grant  the girl obeyed him and when the drumming of horsehoofs died away muller sat down in front of his prisoner who now lay upon a pile of prairie hay and with his usual slow precision lighted his big meerschaum the american watched him for a minute or two and then grew red in the face as a fit of passion shook him  you condemned dutchman he said  muller laughed der combliment he said is nod of much use tonight  it was an hour later when grant and several horsemen arrived and he nodded as he glanced at the prisoner  i figured it was you theres not another man on the prairie mean enough for this kind of work he said pointing to the kerosenecan you didnt even know enough to do it decently and youre about the only american whod have let an old man tie his hands  the prisoner winced perceptibly well he said hoarsely glancing towards the hayfork rifle and pistol which still lay at mullers feet if youre astonished look at the blamed dutchmans armoury  ive one thing to ask you grant said sternly its going to pay you to be quite straight with me who hired you  there was defiance in the incendiarys eyes but grant was right in his surmise that he was resolute only because that of the two fears which oppressed him he preferred to bear the least  you can ask till you get sick of it but youll get nothing out of me he said  take him out said grant put him on to the led horse if youll come round to my place for breakfast ill be glad to see you muller  i come said muller mit der franc tireur it is finish quicker but here in der republic we reverence have for der law  grant laughed a little well he said drily im not quite sure  he swung himself to the saddle swept off his hat to the girl who stood with the lantern light upon her in the doorway smiling but flushed and shook his bridle then there was a jingle that was lost in the thud of hoofs and the men vanished into the shadowy prairie half an hour later the homestead was once more dark and silent but three men sent out by grant were riding at a reckless gallop across the great dusky levels and breakfast was not finished when those whom they had summoned reached fremont ranch  they were young men for the most part and americans though there were a few who had only just become so among them and two or three whose grim faces and grey hair told of a long struggle with adversity they were clad in blue shirts and jean and the hard brown hands of most betokened a close acquaintance with plough stilt axe and bridle though here and there one had from his appearance evidently lived delicately all appeared quietly resolute for they knew that the law which had given them the right to build their homes upon that prairie as yet left them to bear the risks attached to the doing of it hitherto the fact that the great ranchers had made their own laws and enforced them had been ignored or tacitly accepted by the state  when they were seated one of the men deputed to question the prisoner stood up you can take it that theres nothing to be got out of him he said  still said another we know he is one of claverings boys  there was a little murmur for of all the cattlebarons clavering was the only man who had as yet earned his adversaries individual dislike they were prepared to pull down the others because their interests which they had little difficulty in fancying coincided with those of their country demanded it but clavering with his graceful insolence ironical contempt of them and thinlyveiled pride was a type of all their democracy anathematized more than one of them had winced under his soft laugh and lightly spoken jibes which rankled more than a downright injury  the question is what were going to do with him said a third speaker  again the low voices murmured until a man stood up theres one cure for his complaint and thats a sure one but im not going to urge it now he said boys we dont want to be the first to take up the rifle and it would make our intentions quite as plain if we dressed him in a coat of tar and rode him round the town nobody would have any use for him after that and it would be a bigger slap in claverings face than anything else we could do to him  some of the men appeared relieved for it was evident they had no great liking for the sterner alternative and there was acclamation until grant rose quietly at the head of the table  ive got to move a negative he said it would be better if you handed him to the sheriff  there was astonishment in most of the faces and somebody said the sheriff hed let him go right off the cattlemen have got the screw on him  well said larry quietly he has done his duty so far and may do it again i figure we ought to give him the chance  exclamations of dissent followed and a man with a grim lean face stood up he spoke tolerable english but his accent differed from that of the rest  the first man put it straight when he told you there was only one curethe one they found out in france a hundred years ago he said you dont quite realize it yet you havent lived as we did back there across the sea and seen your women thrust off the pavement into the gutter to make room for an officer or been struck with the swordhilt if you resented an insult before your fellow citizens will you take off your hats to the rich men who are trampling on you you republicans and while they leave you the right of speech beg them to respect your rights and liberties do that and sit still a little and theyll fasten the yoke weve groaned under on your necks  i dont know that it isnt eloquent but it isnt business said somebody  the man laughed sardonically thats where youre wrong he said im trying to show you that if you want your liberties youve got to fight for them and your leader doesnt seem to know when by hanging one man he can save a hundred from misery its not the man who laid the kindling youre striking at but through him those who employed him let them see youll take your rights without leave of them theyve sent you warning that if you stay here theyll burn your homesteads down and theyre waiting your answer hang their firebug where everyone can see him in the middle of the town  it was evident that the men were wavering they had come there with the law behind them but from their youth up some following visions that could never be realized had hated the bureaucrat and the rest crippled by the want of dollars had fought with frost and drought and hail it was also plain that they felt the capture of the incendiary had given them an opportunity then when a word would have turned the scale grant stood up at the head of the table very resolute in face  i still move a negative and an amendment boys he said first though thats not the most important because ive a natural shrinking from butchering an unarmed man secondly it was not the cattlemen who sent him but one of them and just because he meant to draw you on it would be the blamedest bad policy to humour him would torrance or allonby or the others have done this thing theyre hard men but they believe theyre right as we do and theyre americans now for the third reason when clavering meant to burn mullers homestead he struck at me guessing that some of you would stand behind me he knew your temper and hed have laughed at us as hotblooded rabbleyou know how he can do itwhen hed put us in the wrong well this time well give the law a show  there was discussion but larry sat still saying nothing further with a curious gravity in his face until a man stood up again  we think youre right he said still theres a question what are you going to do if they try again  strike said larry quietly ill go with you to the hanging of the next one  nothing more was said and the men rode away with relief in their faces though three of them girt with rifle and bandolier trotted behind the wagon in which the prisoner sat     vii  larry proves intractable   it was some little time after her arrival at cedar range when miss torrance who took flora schuyler with her rode out across the prairie there were a good many things she desired to investigate personally and though a somewhat independent young woman she was glad that the opportunity of informing torrance of her intention was not afforded her since he had ridden off somewhere earlier in the day it also happened that although the days were growing colder she arrayed herself fastidiously in a long light skirt which she had not worn since she left cedar and which with the white hat that matched it became her better than the conventional riding attire miss schuyler naturally noticed this  is it a garden party we are going to she asked  hetty laughed we may meet some of our neighbours and after staying with you all that while in new york i dont want to go back on you i had the thing specially made in chicago for riding in  miss schuyler was not quite satisfied but she made no further comment and there was much to occupy her attention the bleached plain was bright with sunshine and rolled back into the distance under an arch of cloudless blue while the crisp clear air stirred her blood like an elixir they swept up a rise and down it the colour mantling in their faces over the long hollow and up a slope again until as the white grass rolled behind her flora schuyler yielded to the exhilaration of swift motion and flinging off the constraint of the city rejoiced in the springy rush of the mettlesome beast beneath her streaming white levels the blue of the sliding sky the kiss of the wind on her hot cheek and the roar of hoofs all reacted upon her until she laughed aloud when she hurled her halfwild broncho down a slope  this is surely the finest country in the world she said  the words were blown behind her but hetty caught some of them and when at last she drew bridle where a rise ran steep and seamed with badgerholes against the sky nodded with a little air of pride  oh yes and its ours all of it she said worth fighting for isnt it  flora schuyler laughed a little but she shook her head its a pity one couldnt leave that out you would stay here with your men folk if there was trouble  hetty looked at her with a little flash in her eyes why of course its our country we made it and id go around in rags and groom the boys horses if it would help them to whip out the men who want to take it from us  flora schuyler smiled a trifle drily the trouble is that when we fall out one is apt to find as good americans as we are and sometimes the men we like the most standing in with the opposition it has happened quite often since the war  hetty shook her bridle impatiently then of course one would not like them any longer she said  nothing more was said until they crossed the ridge above them when hetty pulled her horse up across the wide levels before her advanced a line of dusty teams the sunlight twinkling on the great breaker ploughs they hauled while the black loam rolled in softly gleaming waves behind them they came on with slow precision and in the forefront rolled a great machine that seamed and rent the prairie into triple furrows  what are they doing there do they belong to you asked miss schuyler  the flush the wind had brought there turned to a deeper crimson in hettys usually colourless face to us she said and her voice had a thrill of scorn theyre homesteaders ride down i want to see whos leading them  she led the way with one little gloved hand clenched on the dainty switch she held but before she reached the foremost team the man who pulled it up sprang down from the drivingseat of the big machine a tall wire fence with a notice attached to it barred his way the other ploughs stopped behind him somebody brought an axe and hetty set her lips when the glistening blade whirled high and fell thrice it flashed in the sunlight swung by sinewy arms and then as the fence went down a low halfarticulate cry rose from the waiting men it was not exultant but there was in it the suggestion of a steadfast purpose  hetty sat still and looked at them a little sparkle in her dark eyes and a crimson spot in either cheek while the laces that hung from her neck across the bodice of the white dress rose and fell it occurred to flora schuyler that she had never seen her companion look half so well and she waited with strained expectancy for what should follow realizing with the dramatic instinct most women have who the man with the axe must be he turned slowly straightening his back and stood for a moment erect and statuesque with the blue shirt open at his bronzed neck and the great axe gleaming in his hand and hetty gasped miss schuylers surmise was verified for it was larry grant  larry said her companion and her voice had a curious ring what are you doing here  the man who appeared to ignore the question swung off his wide hat arent you and miss schuyler rather far from home he asked  flora schuyler understood him when glancing round she noticed the figure of a mounted man forced up against the skyline here and there hetty however had evidently not seen them  i want an answer please she said  well said larry gravely i was cutting down that fence  why were you cutting it down persisted miss torrance  it was in the way  of what  grant turned and pointed to the men sturdy toilers starved out of bleak dakota and axemen farmers from the forests of michigan of these and the rest who are coming by and by he said still i dont want to go into that and you seem angry you havent offered to shake hands with me hetty  miss torrance sat very still one hand on the switch and another on the bridle looking at him with a little scornful smile on her lips then she glanced at the prairie beyond the severed fence  that land belongs to my friends she said  grants face grew a trifle wistful but his voice was grave they have had the use of it but it belongs to the united states and other people have the right to farm there now still that neednt make any trouble between you and me  no said the girl with a curious hardness in her inflection but her face softened suddenly larry while you only talked we didnt mind but no one fancied you would have done this yes im angry with you i have been home most a month and you never rode over to see me while now you want to talk politics  grant smiled a trifle wearily i would sooner talk about anything else and if you ask him your father will tell you why i have not been to the range i dont want to make you angry hetty  then you will give up this foolishness and make friends with us again said the girl very graciously it cant come to anything larry and you are one of us you couldnt want to take away our land and give it to this rabble  hetty was wholly bewitching as even flora schuyler who fancied she understood the grimness in the mans face felt just then he however looked away across the prairie and the movement had its significance to one of the company who having less at stake was the more observant when he turned again however he seemed to stand very straight  im afraid i cant he said  no said hetty still graciously not even when i ask you  grant shook his head they have my word and you wouldnt like me to go back upon what i feel is right he said  hetty laughed if you will think a little you cant help seeing that you are very wrong  again the little weary smile crept into grants face one naturally thinks a good deal before starting in with this kind of thing and i have to go through i cant stop now even to please you but cant we still be friends  for a moment there was astonishment in the girls face then it flushed and as her lips hardened and every line in her slight figure seemed to grow rigid she reminded miss schuyler of the autocrat of cedar range  you ask me that she said you an american turning dutchmen and these bushchoppers loose upon the people you belong to cant you see what the answer must be  grant did apparently for he mutely bent his head but there was a shout just then and when one of the vedettes on the skyline suddenly moved forward he seized miss torrances bridle and wheeled her horse  ride back to the range he said sharply as straight as you can tell your father that you met me let your horse go miss schuyler  as he spoke he brought his hand down upon the beasts flank and it went forward with a bound the one flora schuyler rode flung up its head and in another moment they were sweeping at a gallop across the prairie a mile had been left behind before hetty could pull her halfbroken horse up but the struggle that taxed every sinew had been beneficial and she laughed a trifle breathlessly  im afraid i lost my temper and im angry yet she said its the first time larry wouldnt do what i asked him and it was mean of him to send us off like that just when one wanted to put on all ones dignity  miss schuyler appeared thoughtful i fancy he did it because it was necessary didnt it strike you that you were hurting him that is a good man and an honest one though of course he may be mistaken  he must be said hetty now i used to think ever so much of larry and that is why i got angry with him it isnt nice to feel one has been fooled how can he be good when he wants to take our land from us  flora schuyler laughed you are quite delightful hetty now and then you have read a little and been taught history cant you remember any  oh yes said hetty with a little thoughtful nod still the men who made the trouble in those old days were usually buried before anyone was quite sure whether they were right or not try to put yourself in my place what would you do  there was a somewhat curious look in miss schuylers blue eyes i think if i had known a man like that one as long as you have done i should believe in himwhatever he did  well said hetty gravely if you had just as long as you could remember seen your father and his friends taking no pleasure but working every day and putting most of every dollar they made back into the ranch you would find it quite difficult to believe that the man who meant to take it from them now they were getting old and wanted to rest and enjoy what they had worked for was doing good  flora schuyler nodded yes she said i would its quite an old trouble there are two ways of looking at everything and other folks have had to worry over them right back to the beginning  then she suddenly tightened her grasp on the bridle for the ringing of a rifle rose sharp and portentous from beyond the rise the colour faded in her cheek and hetty leaned forward a trifle in her saddle with lips slightly parted as though in strained expectancy no sound now reached them from beyond the low white ridge that hemmed in their vision but a faint drumming of hoofs then flora schuyler answered the question in her companions eyes  i think it was only a warning she said  she wheeled her horse and they rode on slowly hearing nothing further until the range rose from behind the big birch bluff torrance had returned when they reached it and hetty found him in his office room  i met larry on the prairie and of course i talked to him she said i asked him why he had not been to the range and he seemed to think it would be better if he did not come  torrance smiled drily then i guess he showed quite commendable taste as well as good sense you are still decided not to go back to new york hetty  yes said the girl with a little resolute nod you see i cant help being young and just a little goodlooking but im miss torrance of cedar all the time  torrances face was usually grim but it grew a trifle softer then hetty he said they taught you a good many things i never heard of at that boston school but im not sure you know that all trade and industry is built upon just this fact what a man has made and worked hard for is his own would anyone put up houses or raise cattle if he thought his neighbours could take them from him now theres going to be trouble over that question here and though it isnt likely your father may be beaten down he may have to do things that wouldnt seem quite nice to a dainty young woman and folks may denounce him but its quite plain that if you stay here you will have to stand in with somebody  the girl who was touched by the unusual tenderness in his eyes sat down upon the table and slipped an arm about his neck  who would i stand in with but you she said well whip the rustlers out of the country and whether it sounds nice at the time or not you couldnt do anything but the square thing  torrance kissed her gravely but he sighed and his face grew stern again when she slipped out of the room  there will not be many who will come through this trouble with hands quite clean he said  it was during the afternoon and torrance had driven off again when as the two girls were sitting in the little room which was set apart for them a horseman rode up to the range and flora schuyler who was nearest the window drew back the curtain  that man should sit on horseback always she said hes quite a picture  hetty nodded yes she said still you told me you didnt like him its clavering now i wonder what he put those things on forhe doesnt wear them very oftenand whether he knew my father wasnt here  clavering would probably have attracted the attention of most young women just then for he had dressed himself in the fashion the prairie stockriders were addicted to as he did occasionally perhaps because he knew it suited him he had artistic perceptions and could adapt himself harmoniously to his surroundings and he knew hettys appreciation of the picturesque his sallow face showed clean cut almost to feminine refinement under the wide hat and the blue shirt which clung about him displayed his slender symmetry it was however not made of flannel but apparently of silk and the embroidered deerskin jacket which showed the squareness of his shoulders was not only daintily wrought but had evidently cost a good many dollars his loose trousers and silver spurs were made in mexican fashion but the boldness of the dark eyes and the pride that revealed itself in the very pose of the man redeemed him from any taint of vanity  he sat still until a hired man came up then swung himself from the saddle and in another few moments had entered the room with his wide hat in his hand  you find us alone said hetty are you astonished  i am content said clavering why do you ask me  well said hetty naïvely i fancied you must have seen my father on the prairie and could have stopped him if you had wanted to  there was a little flash in claverings dark eyes that was very eloquent the fact is i did still i was afraid he would want to take me along with him  hetty laughed i am growing up she said three years ago you wouldnt have wasted those speeches on me well you can sit down and talk to flora  clavering did as he was bidden its a timehonoured question he said how do you like this country  theres something in its bigness that gets hold of one said miss schuyler one feels free out here on these wide levels in the wind and sun  clavering nodded and flora schuyler fancied from his alertness that he had been waiting for an opportunity it would be wise to enjoy it while you can he said in another year or two the freedom may be gone and the prairie shut off in little squares by wire fences then one will be permitted to ride along a trail between rows of squalid homesteads flanked by piles of old boots and provisioncans we will have exchanged the stockrider for the slouching farmer with a swarm of unkempt children and a slatternly scolding wife then  you believe that will come about asked miss schuyler giving him the lead she felt he was waiting for  clavering looked thoughtful it would never come if we stood loyally together butand it is painful to admit itone or two of our people seem quite willing to destroy their friends to gain cheap popularity by truckling to the rabble of course we could spare those men quite well but they know our weak points and can do a good deal of harm by betraying them  now said hetty with a sparkle in her eyes you know quite well that if some of them are mistaken they will do nothing mean cant they have their notions and be straight men  it is quite difficult to believe it said clavering i will tell you what one or two of them did there was trouble down at gordons place fifty miles west and his cowboys whipped off a band of dutchmen who wanted to pull his fences down well they came back a night or two later with a mob of americans and laid hands on the homestead we are proud of the respect we pay women in this country miss schuyler but that night mrs gordons and her daughters rooms were broken into and the girls turned out on the prairie it was raining and i believe they were not even allowed to provide themselves with suitable clothing of course nothing of that kind could happen here or i would not have told you  hettys voice was curiously quiet as she asked was nothing done to provoke them  yes said clavering with a dry smile gordon shot one of them but is it astonishing what would you expect of an american if a horde of rabble who held nothing sacred poured into his house at night oh yes he shot one of them and would have given them the magazine only that somebody felled him with an axe the dutchman was only grazed but gordon is lying senseless still  there was an impressive silence and the man sat still with the veins on his forehead a trifle swollen and a glow in his eyes his story was also accurate so far as it went but he had with a purpose not told the whole of it  you are sure there were americans among them asked hetty very quietly  they were led by americans you know one or two of them  no said hetty almost fiercely i dont know but larry wasnt there  clavering shook his head but there was a curious incisiveness in his tone still we found out that his committee was consulted and countenanced the affair  then larry wasnt at the meeting said miss torrance he couldnt have been  clavering made her a little and very graceful inclination one would respect such faith as yours  miss schuyler who was a young woman of some penetration deftly changed the topic and clavering came near to pleasing her but he did not quite succeed before he took his departure then hetty glanced inquiringly at her companion  flora schuyler nodded i know just what you mean and i was mistaken  yes said hetty then you like him  miss schuyler shook her head no i fancied he was clever and he didnt come up to my expectations you see he was too obvious  about larry  yes are you not just a little inconsistent hetty  miss torrance laughed i dont know she said i am of course quite angry with larry but nobody else has a right to abuse him  flora schuyler said nothing further and while she sat in thoughtful silence clavering walked down the hall with hettys maid he was a wellfavoured man and the girl was vain she blushed when he looked down on her with a trace of admiration in his smile  you like the prairie he said  she admitted that she was pleased with what she had seen of it and claverings assumed admiration became bolder  well its a good country and different from the east he said there are a good many more dollars to be picked up here and pretty women are quite scarce they usually get married right off to a rancher now i guess you came out to better yourself it takes quite a long time to get rich down east  the girl blushed again and when she informed him that she had a crippled sister who was a charge on the family clavering smiled as he drew on a leather glove  youll find you have struck the right place he said now i wonder if you could fix a pin or something in this button shank its coming off you see  the girl did it and when he went out found a bill lying on the table where he had been standing the value of it somewhat astonished her but after a little deliberation she put it in her pocket  if he doesnt ask for it when he comes back ill know he meant me to keep it she said     viii  the sheriff   miss schuyler had conjectured correctly respecting the rifleshot which announced the arrival of a messenger a few minutes after the puff of white smoke on the crest of the rise had drifted away a mounted man rode up to grant at a gallop his horse was white with dust and spume but his spurs were red  railroad district executive sent me on to let you know the sheriff had lost your man he said  lost him said grant  well said the horseman put it as it pleases you but as he had him in the jail it seems quite likely he let him go  there was a growl from the teamsters who had clustered round and grants face grew stern he was able to hold the two homesteaders claverings boys brought him  oh yes said the other he has them tight enough youll remember one of the cattleboys and a storekeeper got hurt during the trouble and our men are not going to have much show at the trial torrance and the sheriff are fixing up  then said grant wearily well stop that trial you will get a fresh horse in my stable and tell your executive im going to take our men out of jail and if it suits them to stand in they can meet us at the trail forks thursday ten at night  the man nodded im tolerably played out but ill start back right now he said  he rode off towards the homestead and grant turned to the rest jake youll take the eastern round charley youll ride west give them the handful of oats at every shanty to show its urgent theyre to be at fremont in riding order at nine tomorrow night  in another ten minutes the men were riding hard across the prairie and grant with a sigh went on with his ploughing it would be next year before he could sow and whether he would ever reap the crop was more than any man in that region would have ventured to predict he worked however until the stars were out that night and commenced again when the red sun crept up above the prairie rim the next day but soon after dusk mounted men rode up one by one to fremont ranch they rode good horses and each carried a winchester rifle slung behind him when they assembled silent and grim in the big livingroom  boys said grant quietly we have borne a good deal and tried to keep the law but it is plain that the cattlemen who bought it up have left none for us now the sheriff who has the two homesteaders safe has let the man we sent him go  there was an ominous murmur and grant went on the homesteaders who only wanted to buy food and raised no trouble until they were fired on will be tried by the cattlemen and i neednt tell you what kind of chance theyll get we pledged ourselves to see they had fair play when they came in and theres only one means of getting it we are going to take them from the sheriff but there will be no fighting well ride in strong enough to leave no use for that now before we start are you all willing to ride with me  again a hoarse murmur answered him and grant glancing down the row of set faces under the big lamps was satisfied  then well have supper he said quietly it may be a long while before any of us gets a meal again  it was a silent repast as yet the homesteaders at least in that district had met contumely with patience and resisted passively each attempt to dislodge them though it had cost their leader a strenuous effort to restrain the more ardent from the excesses some of their comrades farther east had already committed but at last the most peaceful of them felt that the time to strike in turn had come they mounted when supper was over and rode in silence past willow bluff and dusky rise across the desolate waste the badger heard the jingle of their bridles and now and then a lonely coyote startled by the soft drumming of the hoofs rose with bristling fur and howled but no cowboy heard their passage or saw them wind in and out through devious hollows when daylight came still here and there an anxious woman stood with hazy eyes in the door of a lonely shanty wondering whether the man she had sent out to strike for the home he had built her would ever ride back again for they too had their part in the struggle and it was perhaps the hardest one  it was late at night when they rode into the wooden town here and there a window was flung open but the night was thick and dark and there was little to see but the dust that whirled about the dimly flitting forms that however was nothing unusual for of late squadrons of stockriders and droves of weary cattle had passed into the town and a long row of shadowy frame houses had been left behind before the fears of any citizen were aroused it was perhaps their silent haste that betrayed the horsemen for they rode in ordered ranks without a word as men who have grim business in hand until a hoarse shout went up then a pistol flashed in the darkness in front of them doors were flung open lights began to blink and a halfseen horseman came on at a gallop down the shadowy street he pulled his horse up within a pistolshot from the homesteaders and sat still in his saddle staring at them  youll have to get down boys or tell me what you want he said you cant ride through here at night without a permit  there was a little ironical laughter and somebody asked whos going to stop us  the sheriffs guard said the horseman stop right where you are until i bring them  keep clear said grant sternly or well ride over you forward boys  there was a jingle of bridles and the other man wheeled his horse as the heels went home quick as he was the foremost riders were almost upon him and as he went down the street at a gallop the wooden houses flung back a roar of hoofs every door was open now and the citizens peering out lights flashed in the windows and somebody cried the rustler boys are coming  other voices took up the cry hoots of derision mingled with shouts of greeting but still without an answer the men from the prairie rode on grant peering into the darkness as he swung in his saddle at the head of them he saw one or two mounted men wheel their horses and more on foot spring clear of the hoofs and then the flash of a rifle beneath the black front of a building a flagstaff ran up into the night above it and there were shadowy objects upon the verandah grant threw up a hand  were here boys he said  then it became evident that every mans part had been allotted him for while the hindmost wheeled their horses and then sat still with rifles across their saddles barring the road by which they had come the foremost pressed on until pulling up they left a space behind them and commanded the street in front the rest dismounted and while one man stood at the heads of every pair of horses the rest clustered round grant in the middle of the open space the jail rose dark and silent before them and for the space of a moment or two there was an impressive stillness it was broken by a shout from one of the rearguard  theres quite a crowd rolling up get through as quick as you can  grant stood forward well give you half a minute to send somebody out to talk to us and then were coming in he said  the time was almost up before a voice rose from the building who are you any way and what do you want  homesteaders was the answer we want the sheriff  well said somebody ill tell him  except for a growing clamour in the street behind there was silence until breckenridge who stood near grant touched him  i dont want to meddle but arent we giving them an opportunity of securing their prisoners or making their defences good he said  thats sense any way said another man it would be way better to go right in now while we can  grant shook his head you have left this thing to me and i want to put it through without losing a man men dont usually back down when the shooting begins  then a voice rose from the building you wanted the sheriff here he is  a shadowy figure appeared at a window and there was a murmur from grants men  he neednt be bashful said one of them nobodys going to hurt him cant you bring a light so we can see him  a burst of laughter followed and grant held up his hand it would be better sheriff and you have my word that well give you notice before we do anything if we cant come to terms  it seemed from the delay that the sheriff was undecided but at last a light was brought and the men below saw him standing at the window with an anxious face and behind him two men with rifles whose dress proclaimed them stockriders he could also see the horsemen below as grant who waited until the sight had made its due impression had intended that he should there were a good many of them and the effect of their silence and the twinkling of light on their rifles was greater than that of any uproar would have been  now you can see me you neednt keep me waiting said the sheriff with an attempt at jauntiness which betrayed his anxiety what do you want  two of your prisoners said grant  im sorry you cant have them said the sheriff hadnt you better ride home again before i turn the boys loose on you  but his voice was not quite in keeping with his words and it would have been wiser if he had turned his face aside  its a little too far to ride back without getting what we came for said grant quietly now we have no great use for talking we want two homesteaders and we mean to get them but that will satisfy us  you want nobody else  no you can keep your criminals or let them go just as it suits you  there was a laugh from some of the horsemen which was taken up by the crowd and swelled into a storm of cries some expressed approval others anger and the sheriff stepped backwards  then he said hoarsely if you want your friends you must take them  the next moment the window shut with a bang and the light died out leaving the building once more in darkness  get to work said grant forward those who are going to cover the axemen  there was a flash from the verandah apparently in protest and without intent to hurt for the next moment a few halfseen objects flung themselves over the balustrade as the men with the axes came up and others with rifles took their places a few paces behind them then one of the horsemen shouted a question  let them pass said grant  the door was solid and braced with iron but those who assailed it had swung the axe since they had the strength to lift it and in the hands of such men it is a very effective implement the door shook and rattled as the great blades whirled and fell each one dropping into the notch the other had made the men panted as they smote the splinters flew in showers  holding out still gasped one of them theres iron here get some of the boys to chop that redwood pillar and well drive it down  there was an approving murmur but grant grasped the man by the shoulder no he said we havent come to wreck the town ive another plan if youre more than two minutes getting in  the axes whirled faster and at last a man turned breathlessly get ready boys he said one more on the bolt head jake and were in  a brawny man twice whirled the hissing blade about his head and as he swung forward with both hands on the haft with a dull crash the wedge of tempered steel clove the softer metal the great door tilted and went down and breckenridge sprang past the axemen through the opening his voice came back exultantly out of the shadowy building it was the old country sent you the first man in  the mens answer was a shout as they followed him with a great trampling down the corridor but the rest of the building was very silent and nobody disputed their passage until at last a man with grey hair appeared with a lantern behind an iron grille  open that thing said somebody  the man smiled drily i couldnt do it if i wanted to ive given my keys away  one or two of the homesteaders glanced a trifle anxiously behind them the corridor was filling up and it dawned upon them that if anything barred their egress they would be helpless  then what are you stopping for asked somebody  its in my contract said the jailer quietly i was raised in kentucky you dont figure im scared of you  no use for talking said a man you cant argue with him go ahead with your axes and beat the blamed thing in  it cost them twenty minutes strenuous toil but the grille went down and two of the foremost seized the jailer  let him go said grant quietly now we cant fool time away with you wheres the sheriff  i dont quite know said the jailer and the contempt in his voice answered the question  grant laughed a little well he said i guess hes sensible now what you have got to do is to bring out the two homesteaders as quick as you can  i told you i couldnt do it said the other man  you listen to me we are going to take those men out if we have to pull this place to pieces until we find them that its quite plain would let the others go and you would lose the whole of your prisoners instead of two of them tell us where you put them and you can keep the rest  thats square  oh yes said grant there are quite enough men of their kind loose in this country already  straight on said the jailer first door  they went on in silence but there was a shout when somebody answered their questions from behind a door which a few minutes later tottered and fell beneath the axes then amidst acclamation they led two men out and showed them to the jailer  you know them said grant well you can tell your sheriff there wasnt a cartridge in the rifles of the men who opened his jail hell come back when the troubles over but it seems to me the cattlemen have wasted a pile of dollars over him  he laughed when a question met them as they once more trampled into the verandah  yes he said the boys are bringing them  two horses were led forward and the released men swung themselves into the saddle there was a hasty mounting and when the men swung into open fours a shout went up from the surging crowd  they have taken the homesteaders out the sheriff has backed down  a roar followed that expressed approbation and disgust it was evident that the sympathies of the citizens were divided in the momentary silence grants voice rang out  sling rifles keep your order and distance forward boys  again a hoarse cry went up but there was only applause in it now for the crowd recognized the boldness of the command and opened out pressing back against the houses as the little band rode forward their silence was impressive but the leader knew his countrymen for while taunts and display would have courted an onset nobody seemed anxious to obstruct the men who sat unconcernedly in their saddles with the rifles which alone warranted their daring disdainfully slung behind them  on they went past clusters of wondering citizens shouting sympathizers and silent cattlemen until there was a hoot of derision and perhaps in the hope of provoking a conflict in which the rest would join a knot of men pushed out into the street from the verandah of the wooden hotel grant realized that a rash blow might unloose a storm of passion and rouse to fury men who were already regretting their supineness  keep your pace and distance he commanded  looking straight in front of them shadowy and silent the leading four rode on and once more the crowd melted from in front of them as the last of the band passed through the opening that was made for them a man laughed as he turned in his saddle  we cant stay any longer boys but it wasnt your fault its a man you want for sheriff he said  no talking there gallop said grant and the horsemen flitted across the railroad track and with a sinking thud of hoofs melted into the prairie they had accomplished their purpose and the cattlemen going back disgustedly to remonstrate with the sheriff for a while failed to find him     ix  the prisoner   the prairie was shining white in the moonlight with the first frost when torrance hetty and miss schuyler drove up to allonbys ranch they were late in arriving and found a company of neighbours already assembled in the big general room it was panelled with cedar from the pacific slope and about the doors and windows were rich hangings of tapestry but the dust was thick upon them and their beauty had been wasted by the moth tarnished silver candlesticks and lamps which might have come from england a century ago and a scarred piano littered with tattered music were in keeping with the tapestry for signs of taste were balanced by those of neglect while here and there a roughly patched piece of furniture conveyed a plainer hint that dollars were scanty with allonby he was from the south a spare greyhaired man with a stamp of oldfashioned dignity and in his face a sadness not far removed from apathy and which perhaps accounted for the condition of his property  his guests among whom were a number of young men and women were however apparently lighthearted and had whiled away an hour or two with song and badinage a little removed from them in a corner with the great dusty curtain of a window behind her sat hetty torrance with allonbys nephew and daughter miss allonby was pale and slight and silent but her cousin united the vivacity of the northerner with the distinction that is still common in the south andfor he was very younghetty found a mischievous pleasure in noticing his almost too open admiration for flora schuyler who sat close beside them a girl was singing indifferently and when she stopped miss allonby raised her head as a rhythmical sound became audible through the closing chords of the piano  somebody riding here in a hurry she said  it was significant that the hum of voices which followed the music ceased as the drumming of hoofs grew louder the women looked anxious and the men glanced at one another tidings brought in haste were usually of moment then torrance however stood up and smiled at the assembly  i guess some of those rascally rustlers have been driving off a steer again he said cant you sing us something clavering  clavering understood him and it was a rollicking ballad he trolled out with verve and spirit but still though none of the guests now showed it openly the anxious suspense did not abate and by and by miss allonby smiled at the lad beside her somewhat drily  never mind the story chris i guess we know the rest that man is riding hard and you are as anxious as any of us she said  a minute or two later there was a murmur of voices below and allonby went out nobody appeared to notice this but the hum of somewhat meaningless talk which followed and the strained look in one or two of the womens faces had its meaning every eye was turned towards the doorway until allonby came back and spoke with torrance apart then he smiled reassuringly upon his guests  you will be pleased to hear that some of our comrades have laid hands upon one of the leaders in the attack upon the jail he said they want to lodge him here until they can send for the sheriffs posse and of course i could only agree though the state seems bent on treating us somewhat meanly we are i believe still loyal citizens and i feel quite sure you will overlook any trifling inconvenience the arrival of the prisoner may cause you  doesnt he put it just a little curiously suggested flora schuyler  well said christopher allonby it really isnt nice to have one of our few pleasant evenings spoiled by this kind of thing  you dont understand i am quite pleased with your uncle but theres something that amuses me in the idea of jailing ones adversary from patriotic duty  christopher allonby smiled theres a good deal of human nature in most of us and its about time we got even with one or two of them  find out about it chris said miss allonby then come straight back and tell us  the young man approached a group of his elders who were talking together and returned by and by  it was done quite smartly he said one of the homestead boys who had fallen out with larry came over to us and i fancy it was clavering fixed the thing up with him the boys didnt know he had deserted them and the man he took the oats to believed in him  i cant remember you telling a tale so one could understand it chris said miss allonby why did he take the oats to him  the lad laughed they have their committees and executives and when a man has to do anything they send a few grains of oats to him one cant see much use in it and we know most everything about them but it makes the thing kind of impressive and the rustler fancied our boy was square when he got them he was to ride over alone and meet somebody from one of the other executives at night in a bluff he went and found a band of cattleboys waiting for him i believe he hadnt a show at all for the man who went up to talk to him grabbed his rifle but it seems he managed to damage one or two of them  you dont know who he is asked miss allonby and flora schuyler noticed a sudden intentness in hettys eyes  no said the lad but the boys will be here with him by and by and im glad they made quite sure of him any way  hettys eyes sparkled you cant be proud of them it wasnt very american  well we cant afford to be too particular considering what we have at stake though it might have sounded nicer if they had managed it differently you dont sympathize with the homestead boys miss torrance  of course not said hetty with a little impatient gesture still that kind of meanness does not appeal to me even the men we dont like would despise it they rode into the town without a cartridge in their rifles and took out their friends in spite of the sheriff while the crowd looked on  it was larry grant fixed that and tisnt every day you can find a man like him it most made me sick when i heard he had gone over to the rabble  you were a friend of his asked flora schuyler  oh yes and a little shadow crept into allonbys face but thats over now when a man goes back on his own folks theres only one way of treating him and its not going to be nice for larry if we can catch him were in too tight a place to show the man who can hurt us most much consideration  hetty turned her head a moment and then changed the subject but not before flora schuyler noticed the little flush in her cheek the music laughter and gay talk began again and if anyone remembered that while they chased their cares away grim men who desired their downfall toiled and planned no sign of the fact was visible  twenty minutes passed and then the thud of hoofs once more rose from the prairie it swelled into a drumming that jarred harsh and portentous through the music and hettys attention to the observations of her companions became visibly less marked one by one the voices also seemed to sink and it was evidently a relief to the listeners when a girl rose and closed the piano somebody made an effort to secure attention to a witty story and there was general laughter but it also ceased and an impressive silence followed out of it came the jingle of bridles and trampling of hoofs as the men outside pulled up followed by voices in the hall and once more allonby went out  theyre right under this window said his nephew slip quietly behind the curtains and i think you can see them  flora schuyler drew the tapestry back the rest followed her and christopher allonby flung it behind them so that it shut out the light in a moment or two their eyes had become accustomed to the change and they saw a little group of mounted men close beneath two of them dismounted and appeared to be speaking to some one at the door but the rest sat with their rifles across their saddles and a prisoner in front of them his hat was crushed and battered his jacket rent and flora schuyler fancied there was a red trickle down his cheek but his face was turned partly away from the window and he sat very still apparently with his arms bound loosely at the wrists  all these to make sure of one man and they have tied his hands she said  hetty noticed the ring in her companions voice and allonby made a little deprecatory gesture  its quite evident they had too much trouble getting him to take any chances of losing him he said i wish the fellow would turn his head i fancy i should know him  a tremor ran through hetty for she also felt she recognized that tattered figure then one of the horsemen seized the captives bridle and the man made a slight indignant gesture as the jerk flung off his hands flora schuyler closed her fingers tight  if i were a man i should go down and talk quite straight to them she said  the prisoner was sitting stiffly now but he swayed in the saddle when one of the cattlemen struck his horse and it plunged he turned his head as he did so and the moonlight shone into his face it was very white and there was a red smear on his forehead hetty gasped and flora schuyler felt her fingers close almost cruelly upon her arm  its larry she said  christopher allonby nodded yes we have him at last he said of course one feels sorry but he brought it on himself theyre going to put him into the stable  the men rode forward and when they passed out of sight hetty slipped back from behind the curtain and sat down shivering as she looked up at miss schuyler  i cant help it flo if one could only make them let him go  you need not let any of them see it said miss schuyler sharply sit quite still here and talk to me now what right had those men to arrest him  the warning was sufficient hetty shook out her dress and laughed though her voice was not steady  its quite simple she said the sheriff can call out any citizen to help him or send any man off after a criminal in an emergency of course being a responsible man he stands in with us and in times like these the arrangement suits everybody we do what seems the right thing and the sheriff is quite pleased when we tell him  flora schuyler smiled drily yes its delightfully simple still wouldnt it make the thing more square if the other men had a goodnatured sheriff too  now you are laughing at me the difference is that we are in the right  and larry of course must be quite wrong  no said hetty he is mistaken flo you have got to help meim going to do something for him try to be nice to chris allonby theyll send him to take care of larry  miss schuyler looked steadily at her companion you tried to make me believe you didnt care for the man  a flush stole into hettys cheek and a sparkle to her eyes cant you do a nice thing without asking questions larry was very good to me for years andim sorry for him any way its so easy chris is young and you could fool any man with those big blue eyes if he let you look at him  flora schuyler made a halfimpatient gesture and then sweeping her dress aside made room for christopher allonby she also succeeded so well with him that when the guests had departed and the girls came out into the corral where he was pacing up and down he flung his cigar away and forsook his duty to join them it was a long ride to cedar range and torrance had decided to stay with allonby until morning  it was very hot insidethey would put so much wood in the stove said hetty besides flos fond of the moonlight  well said allonby its quite nice out here and i guess miss schuyler ought to like the moonlight its kind to her  flora schuyler laughed as they walked past the end of the great wooden stable together if you look at it in one sense that wasnt pretty you are guarding the prisoner  yes said the lad with evident diffidence the boys who brought him here had bout enough of him and theyre resting while ours are out on the range im here for two hours any way its not quite pleasant to remember im watching larry  of course and miss schuyler nodded sympathetically now couldnt you just let us talk to him the boys have cut his forehead and hetty wanted to bring him some balsam i believe he used to be kind to her  allonby looked doubtful but miss schuyler glanced at him appealinglyand she knew how to use her eyeswhile hetty said  now dont be foolish chris of course we had just to ask your uncle but he would have wanted to come with us and would have asked so many questions while we knew you would tell nobody anything you know i cant help being sorry for larry and he has done quite a few nice things for you too  miss schuyler is going with you  of course and hetty smiled mischievously as she glanced at her companion still you neednt be jealous chris ill take the best care she doesnt make love to him  flora schuyler looked away across the prairie which was not quite what one would have expected from a young woman of her capacities but the laughing answer served to banish the lads suspicions and he walked with them towards the door then he stopped and when he drew a key from an inner pocket hetty saw something twinkle in the moonlight at his belt  chris she said stand still for a minute and shut your eyes quite tight  the lad did as he was bidden for a few years ago he had been the complaisant victim of hettys pleasantries and felt a light touch on his lips then there was a pluck at his belt and hetty was several yards away when he made a step forward with his eyes wide open she was laughing at him but there was a pistol in her hand  it was only my fingers chris and flo wasnt the least nearer than she is now she said if you dared to think anything else you would make me too angry well bring this thing back to you in five minutes but you wouldnt have us go in there quite defenceless now you walk across the corral and wait until we tell you  allonby was very young and somewhat susceptible hetty was also very pretty and he fancied miss schuyler even prettier still but he had a few misgivings and when they went in closed the lower half of the door and set his back to it  no he said decisively im staying right here  the girls made no demur but when they had crossed a portion of the long building miss schuyler touched her companion ill wait where i am she said drily you will not want me  hetty went on until she came to where the light of a lantern shone faintly in a stall a man sat there with his hands still bound and a wide red smear upon his forehead his face flushed suddenly as he glanced at her but he said nothing  im ever so sorry larry said the girl  the man smiled though it was evident to hetty whose heart beat fast that it was only by an effort he retained his selfcontrol  well he said it cant be helped and it was my fault still i never suspected that kind of thing  hetty coloured larry you mustnt be bitterbut it was horribly mean i couldnt help comingi was afraid you would fancy i was proud of them  no he said sternly i couldnt have fancied that there was nothing else  your head it is horribly cut we saw you from the window and i fancied i could tie it up for you you wouldnt mind if i tried larry i have some balsam here and i only want a little water  for a moment grants face was very expressive but once more he seemed to put a check upon himself and his voice was almost too even as he pointed to the pitcher beside him there is some ready your friends dont treat their prisoners very well  the girl winced a little but dipping her handkerchief in the pitcher she laved his forehead and then would have laid the dressing on it but he caught her hand  no he said take mine instead  you neednt be quite too horrid larry and there was a quiver in her voice it wouldnt hurt you very much to take a little thing like that from me  grant smiled very gravely i think you had better take mine if they found a ladys handkerchief round my head allonbys folks would wonder how it got there  hetty did as he suggested and felt a curious chagrin when he failed to look at her i used to wonder larry how you were able to think of everything she said now i have brought you something else but you must promise not to hurt anybody belonging to allonby with it  grant laughed softly partly to hide his astonishment when he saw a pistol laid beside him  i havent grown bloodthirsty hetty he said where did you get it  it was chris allonbys flo and i fooled him and took it away it was so delightfully easy but you will keep it  he shook his head just try to think hetty  hettys cheeks flushed you are horribly unkind cant you take anything from me stillyouhave got to think now if i let you go you will promise not to make any more trouble for my father and allonby or anybody  grant only looked at her with an odd little smile but the crimson grew deeper in hettys cheek oh of course you couldnt i was sorry the last time i asked you she said larry you make me feel horribly mean but you would not do anything that would hurt them unless it was quite necessary  no said the man drily i dont think im going to have an opportunity  you are i came to let you go it will be quite easy chris is quite foolish about flo  grant shook his head doesnt it strike you that it would be very rough on chris  hetty would not look at him and her voice was very low if anyone must be hurt i would sooner it was chris than you  he did not answer for a moment and the girl watching him in sidelong fashion saw the grim restraint in his face which grew almost grey in patches  it is no use hetty he said very quietly chris would tell them nothing there is no meanness in his father or him but that wouldnt stop him thinking now you will know i was right tomorrow take him back his pistol  larry said the girl with a little quiver in her voice you are right againi dont quite know why you were friends with me  grant smiled at her i havent yet seen the man who was fit to brush the dust off your little shoes but you dont look at these things quite as we do now chris will be getting impatient you must go  hetty turned away from him and while the man felt his heart throbbing painfully and wondered whether his resolution would support him much longer stood very still with one hand clenched then she moved back towards him swiftly with a little smile  there is a window above the beams where they pitch the grainbags through she said chris will go away in an hour or so and the other man will only watch the door there are horses in the corral behind the barn and ive seen you ride the wickedest broncho without a saddle  she whisked away before the man who felt a little almost caressing touch upon his arm and heard something drop close beside him with a rattle could answer and in less than a minute later smiling at chris allonby gave him back his pistol  do you know i was most afraid you were going to make trouble for me he said  but if i had you wouldnt have told  the lad coloured you have known me quite a long time hetty  hetty laughed but there was a thrill in her voice as she turned to miss schuyler now she said you know the kind of men we raise on the prairie  as they moved away together flora schuyler cast a steady scrutinizing glance at her companion i could have told you hetty she said  yes said hetty with a little nod he wouldnt go and i feel so mean that im not fit to talk to you or anybody but wait youll hear something before tomorrow  it was not quite daylight when miss schuyler was awakened by a murmur of voices and a tramp of feet on the frozen sod almost at the same moment the door of her room opened and a slim white figure glided towards the window flora schuyler stood beside it in another second or two and felt that the girl whose arm she touched was trembling the voices below grew louder and they could see two men come running from the stable while one or two others were flinging saddles upon the horses brought out in haste  he must have got away an hour ago said somebody the best horse allonby had in the corral isnt there now  then hetty sat down laughing excitedly and let her head fall back on flora schuylers shoulder when she felt the warm girdling of her arm in another moment she was crying and gasping painfully  he has got away the best horse in the corral ten times as many of them couldnt bring him back she said  hetty said miss schuyler decisively you are shivering all through go back at once he is all right now  the girl gasped again and clung closer to her companion of course she said you dont know larry if they had all the cedar boys too he would ride straight through them     x  on the trail   grant and breckenridge sat together over their evening meal outside the frost was almost arctic but there was wood in plenty round fremont ranch and the great stove diffused a stuffy heat the two men had made the round of the small homesteads that were springing up with difficulty for the snow was too loose and powdery to bear a sleigh and now they were content to lounge in the tranquil enjoyment of the rest and warmth that followed exposure to the stinging frost  at last breckenridge pushed his plate aside and took out his pipe  you must have put a good many dollars into your ploughing larry and the few i had have gone in the same way he said you see its a long while until harvest comes round and a good many unexpected things seem to happen in this country to be quite straight is there much probability of our getting any of those dollars back  grant smiled i think there is though i cant be sure the legislature must do something for us sooner or later while the fact that the cattlemen and the sheriff have left us alone of late shows that they dont feel too secure still there may be trouble a good many hard cases have been coming in  the cattlemen would get them its dollars theyre wanting and the other men have a good many more than we have by the way shouldnt the man with the money you are waiting for turn up tonight  grant nodded a number of almost indigent mensmall farmers ruined by frost in dakota and axemen from michigan with growing familieshad settled on the land in his neighbourhood and as every hand and voice might be wanted levies had been made on the richer homesteaders and subscribed to here and there in the cities for the purpose of enabling them to continue the struggle  we want the dollars badly he said the cattlemen have cut off our credit at the railroad stores and there are two or three of the englishmen who have very little left to eat at the hollow you have seen what we have sent out from fremont and muller has been feeding quite a few of the dutchmen  he stopped abruptly and breckenridge drew back his chair hallo he said you heard it larry  grant had heard the windows jar and a sound that resembled a faint tap yes he said quietly i may have been mistaken but it was quite like a rifle shot  they were at the door in another moment shivering as the bitter cold met them in the face but there was now no sound from the prairie which rolled away before them white and silent under the moonlight then breckenridge flung the door to and crossed over to the rack where a marlin rifle and two winchesters hung he pressed back the magazine slide of one of them and smiled somewhat grimly at grant  well he said we can only hope youre wrong where did you put the book i was reading  grant who told him took out some accounts and they lounged in big hide chairs beside the stove for at least half an hour though it was significant that every now and then one of them would turn his head as though listening and become suddenly intent upon his task again when he fancied his companion noticed him at last breckenridge laughed  its all right larry thereissomebody coming it will be the man with dollars and i dont mind admitting that ill be glad to see him  five minutes later the door opened and muller came in he looked round him inquiringly  quilter is not come i his horse in der stable have not seen he said  no said grant sharply he would pass your place  muller nodded he come in und der supper take why is he not here i who ride by der hollow one hour after him start make  breckenridge glanced at grant and both sat silent for a second or two then the former said im half afraid well have to do without those dollars mr muller shall i go round and roll the boys up larry  grant only nodded and while breckenridge dragging on his fur coat made for the stable took down two of the rifles and handed one to muller  so said the teuton quietly we der trail pick up  in less than five minutes the two were riding across the prairie towards mullers homestead at the fastest pace attainable in the loose dusty snow while breckenridge rode from shanty to shanty to call out the men of the little community which had grown up not far away it was some time later when he and those who followed him came up with his comrade and muller the moon still hung in the western sky and showed the bluegrey smear where horsehoofs had scattered the snow it led straight towards a birch bluff across the whitened prairie and breckenridge stooped in his saddle and looked at it  larry he said sharply there were two of them  yes said grant only one left mullers  breckenridge asked nothing further but it was not the first time that night he felt a shiver run through him he fell behind but he heard one of the rest answer a question grant put to him  yes he said the last man was riding a good deal harder than the other fellow  then there was silence save for the soft trampling of hoofs and breckenridge fancied the others were gazing expectantly towards the shadowy blurr of the bluff which rose a trifle clearer now against the skyline he felt with instinctive shrinking that their search would be rewarded there in the blackness beneath the trees the pace grew faster men glanced at their neighbours now and then as well as ahead and breckenridge felt the silence grow oppressive as the bluff rose higher the snow dulled the beat of hoofs and the flitting figures that rode with him passed on almost as noiselessly as the long black shadows that followed them his heart beat faster than usual when as they reached the birches grant raised his hand  ride wide and behind me he said were going to find one of them inside of five minutes  there was an occasional crackle as a rotten twig or branch snapped beneath the hoofs slender trees slid athwart the moonlight closed on one another and opened out and still though the snow was scanty and in places swept away grant and a big michigan bushman rode straight on breckenridge who was young felt the tension grow almost unendurable at last when even the horses seemed to feel their masters uneasiness the leader pulled up and with a floundering of hoofs and jingle of bridles the line of shadowy figures came to a standstill  get down boys and light the lantern quilters here he said  breckenridge dismounting looped his bridle round a bough and by and by stood peering over the shoulders of the clustering men in front of him the moonlight shone in between the birches and something dusky and rigid lay athwart it in the snow one man was lighting a lantern and though his hands were mittened he seemed singularly clumsy at last however a pale light blinked out and under it breckenridge saw a white face and shadowy head from which the fur cap had fallen  yes said somebody with a suspicion of hoarseness thats quilter its not going to be much use but you had better go through his pockets larry  grant knelt down and his face also showed colourless in the lantern light as with the help of another man he gently moved the rigid form then opening the big furcoat he laid his hand on a brown smear on the deerskin jacket under it  one shot he said couldnt have been more than two or three yards off  get through said the bushman grimly the man who did it cant have more than an hours start of us any way and from the trail he left his horse is played out  in a minute or two grant stood up with a little shiver you have got to bring out a sledge for him somehow muller he said boys the man who shot him has left nothing and the instructions from our other executives would be worth more to the cattlemen than a good many dollars  illustration a white face and shadowy head from which the fur cap had fallenpage 114  well said the big bushman were going to get that man if we have to pull down cedar range or claverings place before we do it heres his trail that one was made by quilters horse  it scarcely seemed appropriate and the whole scene was singularly undramatic and in a curious fashion almost unimpressive but breckenridge who came of a reticent stock understood unlike the americans of the cities these men were not addicted to improving the occasion and only a slight hardening of their grim faces suggested what they felt they were almost as immobile in the faint moonlight as that frozen one with the lantern flickering beside it in the snow yet breckenridge long afterwards remembered them  two men went back with muller and the rest swung themselves into the saddle and reckless of the risk to beast and man brushed through the bluff dry twigs crackled beneath them rotten bough and withered bush went down and a murmur went up when they rode out into the snow again it sounded more ominous to breckenridge than any clamorous shout then bridles were shaken and heels went home as somebody found the trail and the line tailed out farther and farther as blood and weight began to tell the men were riding so fiercely now that a squadron of united states cavalry would scarcely have turned them from the trail breckenridge laughed harshly as he and grant floundered down into a hollow stirrup by stirrup and neck to neck  i should be very sorry for any of the cattleboys we came upon tonight he said  grant only nodded and just then a shout went up from the head of the straggling line and a man waved his hand  heading for the river he said well find him in the timber he cant cross the ice  the line divided and grant and breckenridge rode on with the smaller portion while the rest swung wide to the right in front of them the cedar flowed through its birchlined gully as yet but lightly bound with ice and breckenridge guessed that the men who had left them purposed cutting off the fugitive from the bridge it was long before the first dim birches rose up against the sky and the white wilderness was very still and the frost intense when they floundered into the gloom of the bluff at the hour that mans vitality sinks to its lowest every crackle of a brittle branch rang with horrible distinctness and now and then a man turned in his saddle and glanced at his neighbour when from the shadowy hollow beneath them rose the sound of rending ice the stream ran fast just there and there had been but a few days frost  they rode at a venture looking about them with strained intentness for they had left the guiding trail behind them now suddenly a faint cry came out of the silence followed by a beat of hoofs that grew louder every second until it seemed to swell into a roar either there was clearer ground in the bluff or the rider took his chances blindly so long as he made haste  the men spread out at a low command and breckenridge smiled mirthlessly as he remembered the restrained eagerness with which he had waited outside english covers when the quarry was a fox he could feel his heart thumping furiously and his mittened hands would tremble on the bridle it seemed that the fugitive kept them waiting a horribly long while  then there was a shout close by him grants horse shot forward and he saw a shadowy object flash by amidst the trees hand and heel moved together and the former grew steady again as he felt the spring of the beast under him and the bitter draught upon his cheek his horse had rested and the fugitives was spent where he was going he scarcely noticed save that it was down hill for the birches seemed flying up to him and the beast stumbled now and then he was only sure that he was closing with the flying form in front of him  the trees grew blurred together he had to lean forward to evade the thrashing branches his horse was blundering horribly the slope grew steeper still the ground beneath the dusty snow and fallen leaves was granite hard but he was scarcely a length away a few paces more would bring him level and his right hand was stretched out for a grip of the strangers bridle  a hoarse shout came ringing after him and breckenridge fancied it was a warning the river was close in front and only thinly frozen yet but he drove his heels home again if the fugitive could risk the passage of the ice he could risk it too there was another sound that jarred across the hammering of the hoofs a crash and breckenridge was alone struggling with his horse they reeled smashing through withered bushes and striking slender trees but at last he gained the mastery and swung himself down from the saddle already several mounted men were clustered about something while just before he joined them there was another crash and a little thin smoke drifted among the trees then he saw one of them snap a cartridge out of his rifle and that a horse lay quivering at his feet a man stood beside it and grant was speaking to him but breckenridge scarcely recognized his voice  we want everything you took from quilter the papers first he said light that lantern jake and then the rest stand round i want you to notice what he gives me  the man saying nothing handed him a crumpled packet and grant tearing it open passed the cover to the rest  you know that writing he said  there was a murmur of assent and grant took a paper from those in his hand and gave it to a man who held it up in the blinking light of the lantern now he said we want to make sure the dollars he took from quilter agree with it hand them over  the prisoner took a wallet from his pocket and passed it across i guess theres no use in me objecting youll find them there he said  count them said grant to the other man two of you look over his shoulder and tell me if hes right  it took some little time for the man passed the roll of bills to a comrade who after turning them over replaced them in the wallet  yes thats right boys its quite plain even if we hadnt followed up his trail those dollars and documents were handed quilter  grant touched breckenridge get up and ride he said theyll send us six men from each of the two committees well be waiting for them at bostons when they get there now theres just another thing look at the magazine of that fellows rifle  a man took up the rifle and snapped out the cartridges into his hand usual 44 winchester one of them gone he said he wouldnt have started out after quilter without his magazine full  the man rubbed the fringe of his deerskin jacket upon the muzzle and then held it up by the lantern where the rest could see the smear of the fouling upon it  i guess thats convincing but well bring the rifle along he said  grant nodded and turned to the prisoner as a man led up a horse get up he said youll have a fair trial but if you have any defence to make you had better think it over youll walk back to hansons jake  the prisoner mounted and they slowly rode away into the darkness which now the moon had sunk preceded the coming day  it was two days later when breckenridge who had ridden a long way in the meanwhile rejoined them at a lonely ranch within a days journey of the railroad twelve men whose bronzed faces showed very intent and grave under the light of the big lamp sat round the long bare room and the prisoner at the foot of a table grant stood at the head of it with a roll of dollar bills and a rifle in front of him  now he said you have heard the testimony have you anything to tell us  well said the prisoner i guess it wouldnt be much use hadnt you better get through with it i dont like a fuss  grant signed to the men who silently filed out and returned within a minute the things quite plain said one of them he killed quilter  grant turned to the prisoner theres nothing that would warrant our showing any mercy but if you have anything to urge well listen now its your last opportunity you were heading for one of the cattlemens homesteads  the man smiled sardonically im not going to talk he said i guess i can see your faces and thats enough for me  grant stood up and signed to a man who led the prisoner away then he looked at the others questioningly and a michigan axeman nodded  only one thing he said it has to be done  there was an approving murmur and grant glanced along the row of stern faces yes he said the law will do nothing for usthe cattlemen have bought it up but this work must be stopped well i guess you like what lies before us as little as i do but if it warns off the othersand there are more of his kind coming inits the most merciful thing  once more the low murmur ran through the silence of the room grant raised his hand and a man brought in the prisoner he looked at the set faces and made a little gesture of comprehension  i guess you neednt tell me he said when is it to be  tomorrow said grant and it seemed to breckenridge that his voice came from far away at the townas soon as there is light enough to see by  the prisoner turned without a word and when he had gone the men as if prompted by one impulse hastened out of the room leaving grant and breckenridge alone the former sat very still at the head of the table until breckenridge laid his hand on his shoulder  shake it off larry you couldnt have done anything else he said  no said grant with a groan still i could have wished this duty had not been laid on me  when they next stood side by side the early daylight was creeping across the little railroad town and breckenridge whose young face was white shivered with more than the bitter cold he never wished to recall it but the details of that scene would return to himthe square frame houses under the driving snowcloud the white waste they rose from the grim silent horsemen with the rifles across their saddles and the intent faces beyond them in the closepacked street he saw the prisoner standing rigidly erect in a wagon drawn up beside a towering telegraphpole and heard a voice reading hoarsely  a man raised his hand somebody lashed the horses the wagon lurched away a dusky object cut against the sky and breckenridge turned his eyes away a sound that might have been a groan or murmur broke from the crowd and the momentary silence that followed it was rent by the crackle of riflery after that breckenridge only recollected riding across the prairie amidst a group of silent men and feeling very cold  in the meanwhile the citizens were gazing at a board nailed to the telegraphpole for murder and robbery take warning anyone offending in the same way will be treated similarly     xi  larrys acquittal   a warm wind from the pacific which had swept down through the rockies passes had mitigated the arctic cold and the snow lay no more than thinly sprinkled upon the prairie hetty torrance and miss schuyler were riding up through the birch bluff from the bridge of the cedar it was dim among the trees for dusk was closing in the trail was rough and steep and hetty drew bridle at a turn of it  i quite fancied we would have been home before it was dark and my father would be just savage if he knew we were out alone she said of course he wouldnt have let us go if he had been at cedar  flora schuyler looked about her with a shiver the wind that shook the birches had grown perceptibly colder the gloom beneath them deepened rapidly and there was a doleful wailing amidst the swinging boughs beyond the bluff the white wilderness sinking into dimness now ran back waste and empty to the horizon miss schuyler was from the cities and the loneliness of the prairie is most impressive when night is closing down  then one could have wished he had been at home she said  perhaps hetty did not hear her plainly for the branches thrashed above them just then oh thats quite right folks are not apt to worry much over the things they dont know about she said  it was not your father i was sorry for flora schuyler said sharply the sod is too hard for fast riding and it will be most an hour yet before we get home i wish we were not alone hetty  hetty sighed it was so convenient once she said whenever i wanted to ride out i had only to send for larry its quite different now  i have no doubt mr clavering would have come said miss schuyler  oh yes hetty agreed still im beginning to fancy you were right about that man like a good many more of them hes quite nice at a distance but there are men who should never let anyone get too close to them  you have had quite a few opportunities of observing him at a short distance lately  hetty laughed but there was a trace of uneasiness in her voice i could wish my father didnt seem quite so fond of him ohtheres somebody coming  instinctively she wheeled her horse into the deeper shadow of the birches and miss schuyler followed there was no habitation within a league of them and though the frost which put a period to the homesteaders activities lessened the necessity for the cattlebarons watchfulness unpleasant results had once or twice attended a chance encounter between their partisans it was also certain that somebody was coming and hetty felt her heart beat as she made out the tramp of three horses the vultures the struggle had attracted had she knew much less consideration for women than the homesteaders or cattleboys  hadnt we better ride on asked miss schuyler  no said hetty they would most certainly see us out on the prairie back your horse quite close to mine if we keep quiet they might pass us here  her voice betrayed what she was feeling and flora schuyler felt unpleasantly apprehensive as she urged her horse farther into the gloom the trampling came nearer and by and by a mans voice reached her  hadnt you better pull up and get down it said im not much use at tracking but somebody has been along here a little while ago you see there are only three of us  theyre homesteaders and theyve found our trail exclaimed hetty with a little gasp of dismay  there was scarcely an opening one could ride through between the birches behind them and it was evident that the horsemen could scarcely fail to see them the moment they left their shelter one of them had already dismounted and was apparently stooping beside the prints the horsehoofs had left where a little snow had sifted down upon the trail hetty heard his laugh and it brought her a great relief  i dont think you need worry breckenridge there were only two of them  hetty wheeled her horse its larry she said  a minute later he saw them and pulling up took off his hat but flora schuyler noticed that he ventured on no more than this  it is late for you to be out alone you are riding home he said  of course said hetty with miss schuyler fancied a chilliness which contrasted curiously with the relief she had shown a minute or two earlier  well said grant quietly im afraid you will have to put up with our company there are one or two men i have no great opinion of somewhere about this prairie this is mr breckenridge and as the trail is rough and narrow he will follow with miss schuyler i presume you dont mind riding with him although like the rest of us he is under the displeasure of your friends the cattlebarons  miss schuyler looked at him steadily i dont know enough of this trouble to make sure who is right she said but i should never be prejudiced against any american who was trying to do what he felt was the work meant for him  well said grant with a little laugh breckenridge will feel sorry that hes an englishman  miss schuyler turned to the young man graciously and the dim light showed there was a twinkle in her eyes  that she said is the next best thing since you are with mr grant you no doubt came out to this country because you thought we needed reforming mr breckenridge  the lad laughed as they rode on up the trail with grant and hetty in front of them and muller following  no he said to be frank i came out because my friends in the old one seemed to fancy the same thing of me when they have no great use for a young man yonder they generally send him to america in fact they send some of them quite a nice cheque quarterly so long as they stay there you see we are like the hedgehogs or your porcupines if you grow them here miss schuyler  flora schuyler smiled you are young or you wouldnt empty the magazine all at once in answer to a single shot  well said breckenridge so are you it is getting dark but i have a notion that you are something else too the fact i mentioned explains the liberty  flora shook her head the dusk is kind any way i know i am years older than you there are no little girls in this country like the ones you have been accustomed to  now said breckenridge my sisters and cousins are i firmly believe a good deal nicer than those belonging to most other men but you see i have quite a lot of them and any one so favoured loses a good many illusions  in the meantime hetty who when she fancied he would not observe it glanced at him now and then rode silently beside grant until he turned to her  i have a good deal to thank you for hetty andfor you know i was never clever at saying the right thingi dont quite know how to begin still in the old times we understood just what each other meant so well that talking wasnt necessary you know im grateful for my liberty and would sooner take it from you than anybody else dont you  hetty laid a restraint upon herself for there was a thrill in the mans voice which awakened a response within her wouldnt it be better to forget those days she said it is very different now  it isnt easy said grant checking a sigh i most fancied they had come back the night you told me how to get away  hettys horse plunged as she tightened its bridle in a fashion there was no apparent necessity for that she said chillingly was quite foolish of you and it isnt kind to remind folks of the things they had better not have done now you told us the prairie wasnt safe because of some of your friends  no said grant drily i dont think i did i told you there were some men around i would sooner you didnt fall in with  then they must be your partisans there isnt a cattleboy in this country who would be uncivil to a woman  i wish i was quite sure still there are men coming in who dont care who is right and only want to stand in with the men who will give them the most dollars or let them take what they can we have none to give away  larry the girl said hotly do you mean that we would be glad to pay them  no but they will most of them quite naturally go over to you which will make it harder for us to get rid of them we have no use for men of that kind in this country  no said the girl scornfully well i fancied they would have come in quite handythere was a thing you did  you heard of that  yes very coldly it was a horrible thing  grants voice changed to a curious low tone did you ever see me hurt anything when i could help it in the old days hetty  no one has to be honest i remember how you once hurt your hand taking a jackrabbit out of a trap  and how you bound it up  well said hetty i dont know after the work you have done with it that i should care to do that now  there are affairs you should never hear of and i dont care to talk about with you grant said very quietly but since you have mentioned this one you must listen to me just as it is ones duty to give no needless pain to anything so there is an obligation on him to stop any other man who would do it is it wrong to kill a grizzly or a rattlesnake or merciful to leave them with their meanness to destroy whatever they want now if you had known a quiet american who did a tolerably dangerous thing because he fancied it was right and found him shot in the back and the trail of the man who crept up behind him and killed him for a few dollars would you have let that man go  hetty ignored the question the man was your friend  well said grant slowly he had done a good deal for me but that would not have counted for very much with any one when we made our decision  no and hetty glanced at him with a little astonishment  grant shook his head no he said we had to do the square thingthat and nothing more but if we had let that man go he would when the chance was given him have done what he did again well it washorrible but there was no law that would do the work for us in this country then  hetty shivered but had there been light enough grant would have seen the relief in her face and as it was his pulse responded to the little quiver in her voice why it was she did not know but the belief in him which she had once cherished suddenly returned to her in the old days the man she had never thought of as a lover could at least do no wrong  i understand her voice was very gentle there must be a good deal of meanness in me or i should have known you only did it because you are a white man and felt you had to oh of course i knowonly its so much easier to go round another way so you cant see what you dont want to larry im sorry  grants voice quivered the only thing you ever do wrong hetty is to forget to think now and then and by and by you will find somebody who is good enough to think for you  the girl smiled he would have to be very patient and the trouble is that if he was clever enough to do the thinking he wouldnt have the least belief in me you are the only man larry who could see peoples meannesses and still have faith in them  i am a blunderer who has taken up a contract thats too big for him grant said gravely i have never told anyone else hetty but there are times now and then when knowing the kind of man i am i get most sick with fear all the poor men in this district are looking to me and though i lie awake at night i cant see how im going to help them when one trace of passion would let loose anarchy its only right theyre wanting that is most of the dutchmen and the americansbut theres the mad red rabble behind them and the bitter rage of hard men who have been trampled on to hold in its a crushing weight we who hold the reins have got to carry still we were made only plain farmer men and i guess were not going to be saddled with more than we can bear  he had spoken solemnly from the depths of his nature and all that was good in the girl responded  larry she said softly while you feel just that i think you cant go wrong it is what is right we are both wanting andthough i dont know howi feel we will get it by and by and then it will be the best thing for homesteadboys and cattlebarons when that time comes we will be glad there were white men who took up their load and worried through and when this troubles worked out and over there will be nothing to stop us being good friends again  is that quite out of the question now  yes said hetty simply i am sorry but larry cant you understand you are leading the homesteadboys and my father the cattlebarons first of all ive got to be a dutiful daughter  of course he agreed well it cant last for ever and we can only do the best we can other folks had the same trouble when the boys in sumter fired the starting gunnorth and south at each others throats and both americans  hetty decided that she had gone sufficiently far and turned in her saddle what is the englishman telling you flo she asked  miss schuyler laughed he was almost admitting that the girls in this country are as pretty as those they raise in the one he came from  well said breckenridge if it was daylight id be sure  grant fancied that it was not without a purpose his companion checked her horse to let the others come up and though it cost him an effort acquiesced his laugh was almost as ready as that of the rest as they rode on four abreast until at last the lights of cedar range blinked beside the bluff then they grew suddenly silent again as muller who it seemed remembered that he had been taught by the franc tireurs rode past them with his rifle across his saddle they pulled up when his figure cut blackly against the sky on the crest of a rise and hettys laugh was scarcely lighthearted  you have been very good and i am sorry i cant ask you to come in she said still i dont know that its all our fault we are under martial law just now  grant took off his hat and wheeled his horse and when the girls rode forward sat rigid and motionless watching them until he saw the ray from the open door of cedar range then muller trotted up and with a little sigh he turned homewards across the prairie  about the same time richard clavering lay smoking in a big chair in the room where he kept his business books and papers he wore among other somewhat unusual things a velvet jacket very fine linen and on one of his long slim fingers a ring of curious eastern workmanship clavering was a man of somewhat expensive tastes and his occasional visits to the cities had cost him a good deal which was partly why an accountant famous for his knowledge of ranching property now sat busy at a table he was a shrewd direct american and had already spent several days endeavouring to ascertain the state of claverings finances  nearly through the rancher asked with a languidness which the accountant fancied was assumed  i can give you a notion of how you stand right now he answered you want me to be quite candid  oh yes said clavering with a smile of indifference im in a tight place hopkins  i guess you areany way if you go on as youre doing you see what i consider it prudent to write off the value of your property  clavering examined the paper handed him with visible astonishment why have you whittled so much off the face value  just because youre going to have that much taken away from you by and by  claverings laugh was quietly scornful by the homesteadboys  by the legislature of this state the law is against you holding what youre doing now  we make what law there is out here  well said hopkins coolly i guess youre not going to do it long you know the maxim about fooling the people it cant be done  arent you talking like one of those german socialists  on the contrary i quite fancy im talking like a business man now you want to realize on those cattle before the winter takes the flesh off them and extinguish the bank loan with what you get for them  claverings face darkened that would strip the place and id have to borrow to stock again  youd have to run a light stock for a year or two  it wouldnt suit me to do anything that would proclaim my poverty just now said clavering  then youll have to do it by and by the interest on the bond is crippling you  well clavering lighted another cigar i told you to be straight go right on tell me just what you would do if the place was in your hands  sell out those cattle and take the big loan up clear off the imported horses and pedigree brood mares you have been losing more dollars than many a small rancher makes over them the last few years  i like good horses round the place clavering said languidly  the trouble said hopkins is that you cant afford to have them then i would cut down my personal expenses by at least twothirds the ranch cant stand them do you know what you have been spending in the cities  no i gave you a bundle of bills so you could find it out  hopkins smile was almost contemptuous i guess you had better burn them when i am through ill mention one or two items one hundred dollars for flowers one thousand in several bills from chicago jewellers the articles would count as an asset have you got them  i havent said clavering they were for a lady  well said hopkins you know best but one would have fancied there was more than one of them from the bills heres another somewhat curious item hatsi guess they came from parisand millinery two hundred dollars worth of them  a little angry light crept into claverings eyes if i hadnt been so abominably careless you wouldnt have seen those bills i meant to put them down as miscellaneous and destroy the papers well ive done with that extravagance any way and its to hear the truth im paying you quite a big fee if i go on just as im doing how long would you give me  two years then the bank will put the screw on you the legislature may pull you up earlier but i can tell you more when ive squared up tomorrow  there was a curious look in claverings dark eyes but he laughed again  i guess thats about enough but ill leave you to it now he said its quite likely ill have got out of the difficulty before one of those years is over  he went out and a few minutes later stopped as he passed the one big mirror in the ranch and surveyed himself critically for a moment with a dispassionate interest that was removed from vanity then he nodded as if contented  with torrance to back me it might be done he said liberty is sweet but i dont know that its worth at least fifty thousand dollars     xii  the sprouting of the seed   late in the afternoon of a bitter day grant drove into sight of the last of the homesteaders dwellings that lay within his round it rose a shapeless mound of white from the wilderness that rolled away in billowy rises shining under the sunlight that had no warmth in it the snow that lay deep about its sod walls and upon the birchbranch roof hid its squalidness and covered the pile of refuse and empty cans but grant knew what he would find within it and when he pulled up his team his face grew anxious it was graver than it had been a year ago for larry grant had lost a good deal of his hopefulness since he heard those footsteps at the depot  the iron winter that was but lightly felt in the homes of the cattlebarons had borne hardly on the men huddled in sodhovel and birchlog shanty swept by the winds of heaven at fifty degrees below they had no thick furs to shelter them and many had very little food while on those who came from the cities the cold of the northwest set its mark numbing the halffed body and unhinging the mind the lean farmers from the dakotas who had fought with adverse seasons and the sinewy axemen from michigan clearings bore it with grim patience but there were here and there a few who failed to stand the strain and listening to the outcasts from the east let passion drive out fortitude and dreamed of anarchy they had come in with a pitiful handful of dollars to build new homes and farm but the rich men and in some cases their own supineness had been too strong for them and while they waited their scanty capital melted away now with most of them it had almost gone and they were left without the means to commence the fight in spring  breckenridge saw the shadow in grants face and touched his arm ill go in and give the man his dollars larry he said you have had about as much worry as is good for you today  grant shook his head ive no use for shutting my eyes so i cant see a thing when i know its there  he stepped out of the sleigh and went into the shanty the place had one room and though a stove stood in the midst of it and the snow that kept some of the frost out was piled to the windows it was dank and chill only a little dim light crept in and it was a moment or two before grant saw the man who sat idle by the stove with a clotted bandage round his leg he was gaunt and clad in jean patched with flourbags and his face showed haggard under his bronze behind him on a rude birchbranch couch covered with prairie hay a woman lay apparently asleep beneath a tattered fur coat  whats the matter with her grant asked  i dont quite know she got sick most two weeks ago and talks of a pain that only leaves her when shes sleeping one of the boys drove in to the railroad for the doctor but hes busy down there any way it would have taken him most a week to get here and back and i guess he knew i hadnt the dollars to pay him with  grant recognized the hopeless evenness of the tone but breckenridge who was younger did not  but you cant let her lie here without help of any kind he said  well said the man slowly what else can i do  breckenridge could not tell him and appealed to his comrade we have got to take this up larry she looks ill  grant nodded i have friends down yonder who will send that doctor out he said here are your dollars from the fund ten of them this time  the man handed him one of the bills back if you want me to take more than five youll have to show your book he said ive been finding out how you work these affairs larry  grant only laughed but breckenridge turned to the speaker with an assumption of severity that was almost ludicrous in his young face  now dont you make yourself a consumed ass he said you want those dollars considerably more than we do and weve got quite a few of them doing nothing in the bank that is larry has  grants eyes twinkled its no use breckenridge i know the kind of man he is im going to send miss muller here and well come round and pound the foolishness out of you if you try to send back anything she brings with her this place is as cold as an icestore whats the matter with your stove  the stoves all right and the man pointed to his leg the trouble is that ive very little wood axe slipped the last time i went chopping in the bluff and the frost got into the cut i couldnt make three miles on one leg and pack a load of billets on my back  but youd freeze when those ran out and they couldnt last you two days said breckenridge glancing at the little pile of fuel  yes said the man grimly i guess i would unless one of the boys came along  anything wrong with your oxen asked grant  well said the man drily weve been living for most two months on one of them i salted a piece of him the rests frozen i had to sell the other to a dutchman since the cattleboys stopped me ploughing i hadnt much use for them any way  then said breckenridge why the devil did you bring a woman out to this forsaken country  perhaps the man understood what prompted the question for he did not resent it where was i to take her to im a farmer without dollars and i had to go somewhere when id lost three wheat crops in dakota somebody told me you had room for small farmers and when i heard the land was to be opened for homesteading i sold out everything and came on here to begin again never saw a richer soil and theres only one thing wrong with the country  the men in it asked breckenridge  the farmer nodded and a little glow crept into his eyes yes he said fiercely the cattlebaronsand therell be no room for anyone until weve done away with them weve no patience for more fooling it has got to be done  thats the executives business said grant  the man rose with a little quiver of his lean frame and a big hand clenched no he said its our business and the business of every honest citizen if you dont tackle it right off other men will put the contract through  youll have to talk plainer said grant  well said the farmer thats easy it was you and some of the others brought us in and now were here were starving theres land to feed a host of us and every citizen is entitled to enough to make a living on but while the cattlemen keep hold hows he going to get it oh yes weve cut their fences and broken a few acres here and there but how are we going to put through our ploughing when every man who drives a furrow has to whip up six of his neighbours to keep the cowboys off him well theres just one answer were going to pull those men down  youre going to sit tight until your leaders tell you to move grant informed him  the man laughed harshly no he said unless they keep ahead of us were going to trail them along youre a straight man larry but you dont see all youve done you set this thing going and now you cant step out if it goes too far for you no sir youve got to keep the pace and come along and its going to be quite lively now some of the chicago anarchy boys are chipping in  grants face was very stern when theyre wanted your leaders will be there he said theyve got hold and theyll keep it if they have to whip the sense into some of you now give me that axe of yours and well get some wood i dont want to hear any more wild talking  he went out taking breckenridge with him and an hour later returned with a sleighload of birch branches which he flung down before the shanty then he turned the team towards fremont ranch and his face was grave as he stared over the horses heads at the smear of trail that wound away a bluegrey riband before the gliding sleigh  i wonder if that fellow meant to give us a hint said breckenridge  grant nodded i think he didand he was right about the rest two years ago i was a prosperous rancher proud of the prairie i belonged to and without a care but i could see what this country was meant to be and when the others started talking about the homestead movement i did my share folks seemed keen to listen we got letters from everywhere and we told the men who wrote them just what the land could do it was sowing blindfold and now the crops above the sod it most frightens me no man can tell what it will grow to be before its ready for the binder and while weve got the wheat weve got the weeds as well  wasnt it always like that at least it seems so from reading a little history i dont know that i envy you larry in the tongue of this country its a hard row you have to hoe of course there are folks who would consider they had done enough in planting it  yes grant agreed we have quite a few of them over here but if more than weve planted has come up im going right through  breckenridge said nothing further and there was silence until the lights of fremont rose out of the snowy wilderness when they reached it they found a weary man lying in a big chair he pointed to the litter of plates on the table as he handed grant a letter  i havent eaten since sun up and drove most of sixty miles so i didnt wait he said our executive boss who told me to lose no time seemed kind of worried about something  grant opened the letter which was terse look out he read we had to put the screw on a crazy pole who has been making wild speeches here and as he lit out i have a notion he means to see what he can do with the discontented in your district we couldnt have him raising trouble round this place any way its taking us both hands to hold the boys in already  bad news said breckenridge sympathetically  yes grant said wearily get your supper and sleep when you can youll be driving from sun up until after its dark tomorrow  they ate almost in silence but though the messenger and breckenridge retired shortly after the meal grant sat writing until late in the night then he stretched his arms wearily above his head and his face showed worn and almost haggard in the flickering lamplight  it has put hetty further from me than ever and cost me the goodwill of every friend i had while the five thousand dollars ive lost as well dont count for very much after that he said  early next morning breckenridge and the messenger drove away and rather more than a week later fräulein muller whom the former had taken to attend on the homesteaders wife arrived one night at fremont ranch she came in redcheeked unconcerned and shapeless in mullers fur coat and quietly brushed the dusty snow from her dress before she sat down as far as possible from the stove  i a message from mrs harper bring she said last night two men to harpers house have come and one now and then will to the other talk in our tongue he is one i think who will destroy everything then they talk with harper long in the stable and today harper with his rifle rides away mrs harper who has fears for her husband would have you know that tonight or tomorrow he will go with other men to the cedar ranch  grant was on his feet in a moment and nodded to breckenridge who rose almost as quickly and glanced at him as he moved towards the door  yes he said theres some tough hoeing to be done now youll drive miss muller back to harpers and then turn out the boys theyre to come on to cedar as fast as they can  and you said breckenridge quietly  im going there now  you know the cattlemen would do almost anything to get their hands on you  oh yes grant said wearily arent you wasting time  breckenridge was outside the next moment but before he had the sleigh ready grant lead a saddled horse out of the stable and vanished at a gallop down the beaten trail it rang dully beneath the hoofs but the frost that had turned its surface dusty lessened the chance of stumbling and it was not until the first league had been left behind and he turned at the forking beneath a big birch bluff that he tightened his grip on the bridle there it was different for the trail no longer led wide and trampled hard across the level prairie but wound an almost invisible riband through tortuous hollow and over swelling rise so narrow that in places the hoofs broke with a sharp crackling through the frozen crust of snow that larry knew might by crippling the beast he rode stop him then and there and he pushed on warily dazzled at times by the light of the sinking moon which the glistening white plain flung back into his eyes  it was bitter cold and utterly still for the birds had gone south long ago and there was no beast that ventured from his lair to face the frost that night dulled as the trample of hoofs was it rang about him stridently and now and then he could hear it roll repeated along the slope of a rise the hand upon the bridle had lost all sense of feeling his moccasined feet tingled painfully and a white fringe crackled under his hand when warned by the nipping of his ears he drew the big fur cap down further over them it is not difficult to lose the use of ones members for life by incautiously exposing them to the cold of the prairie while a frost that may be borne by the man covered to the chin with great sleigh robes is not infrequently insupportable to the one on horseback  grant however took precautions as it were mechanically for his mind was too busy to feel in its full keenness the sting of the frost and while his eyes were fixed on the blur of the trail his thoughts were far away and it was by an almost unconscious effort he restrained the impatient horse because speed was essential he dare risk no undue haste he was not the only rider out on the waste that night and the shiver that went through him was not due to the cold as he pictured the other horsemen pressing on towards cedar ranch of the nativeborn he had little fear and he fancied but few of them would be there there was even less to dread from any of english birth but he feared the insensate alien and still more the human vultures that had gathered about the scene of strife they had neither race nor creed nor aspirations but only an unhallowed lust for the fruits of rapine  he could also picture hetty sitting slight and darkeyed at the piano as he had often seen her and torrance listening with a curious softening of his lean face to the voice that had long ago wiled larrys heart away from him that led him back to the days when loosetressed and flushed in face hetty had ridden beside him in the track of the flying coyote and he had seen her eyes glisten at his praise there were other times when sitting far apart from any of their kind with the horses tethered beside them in the shadow of a bluff she had told him of her hopes and ambitions but halfformed then and to silence his doubts sung him some simple song larry had travelled through europe to look about him as he naïvely said but it was what reminded him of that voice he had found most pleasure in when he listened to famous sopranos and great cathedral choirs  still he had expected little realizing as he had early done that hetty was not for him it was enough to be with her when she had any need of him and to dream of her when absent while it was only when he heard she had found her hopes were vain that he clutched at the very faint but alluring possibility that now her heart might turn to him then had come the summons of duty and when he had to choose which side he would take larry knowing what it would cost him had with the simple loyalty which had bound him as hettys servant without hope of reward decided on what he felt was right he was merely one of the many quiet steadfast men whom the ostentatious sometimes mistake for fools until the nation they form the backbone of rises to grapple with disaster or emergency they are not confined to any one country for his comrade muller the placid unemphatic teuton had been at worth and sedan  though none of these memories delayed him a second he brushed them from him when the moon dipped darkness swooped down on the prairie and it is the darkness that suits rapine best now that he could see the trail no longer he shook the bridle and the pace grew faster the powdery snow whirled behind him the long dim levels flitted past until at last with heart thumping he rode up a rise from whose crest he could see cedar range a great weight lifted from himthe row of windows were blinking beside the dusky bluff but even as he checked the horse the ringing of a rifle came portentously out of the stillness with a gasp he drove in his heels and swept at a furious gallop down the slope     xiii  under fire   it was getting late and torrance evidently becoming impatient when clavering who had ignored the latter fact as long as he considered it advisable glanced at hetty with a smile he stood by the piano in the big hall at cedar range and she sat on the musicstool turning over one of the new songs he had brought her from chicago  i am afraid i will have to go he said your father is not fond of waiting  though hetty was not looking at him directly she saw his face which expressed reluctance still more plainly than his voice did but just then torrance turned to them  arent you through with those songs yet clavering he said  im afraid i have made miss torrance tired said clavering still we have music enough left us for another hour or two  then why cant you stay on over tomorrow and get a whole night at it i want you just now  clavering glanced at hetty and though she made no sign fancied that she was not quite pleased with her father  am i to tell him i will he asked  hetty understood what prompted him but she would not commit herself you will do what suits you she said when my father asks any one to cedar i really dont often make myself unpleasant to him  claverings eyes twinkled as he walked towards the older man while hetty crossed the room to where miss schuyler sat both apparently became absorbed in the books clavering had brought but they could hear the conversation of the men and it became evident later that one of them listened torrance had questions to ask and clavering answered them  well he said i had a talk with purbeck which cost us fifty dollars his notion was that the bureau hadnt a great deal to go upon if they meant to do anything further about dispossessing us in fact he quite seemed to think that as the legislature had a good many other worries just now it would suit them to let us slide he couldnt recommend anything better than getting our friends in the lobbies to keep the screw on them until the election  torrance looked thoughtful that means holding out for another six months any way did you hear anything at the settlement  yes fleming wouldnt sell the homesteadboys anything after they broke in his store steeles our man and it was carter they got their provisions from now carter had given jackson a bond for two thousand dollars when he first came in and as he hadnt made his payments lately and we have our thumb on jackson the sheriff has closed down on his store hell be glad to light out with the clothes he stands in when were through with him  torrance nodded grim approval larry wouldnt sit tight  no said clavering he wired right through to chicago for most of a carload of flour and eatables but that car got billed wrong somehow and now theyre looking for her up and down the sidetracks of the pacific slope larrys men will be getting savage it is not nice to be hungry when theres forty degrees of frost  torrance laughed softly you have fixed the thing just as i would  then his daughter stood up with a little flush in her face you could not have meant that father she said  well said torrance drily i quite think i did but theres a good deal you cant get the hang of hettyand its getting very late  he looked at his daughter steadily and flora schuyler looked at all of them and remembered the picturetorrance sitting lean and sardonic with the lamplight on his face clavering watching the girl with a curious little smile and hetty standing very slim and straight with something in the poise of her shapely head that had its meaning to miss schuyler then with a goodnight to torrance and a halfironical bend of the head to clavering she turned to her companion and they went out together before he could open the door for them  five minutes later hetty tapped at miss schuylers door the pink tinge still showed in her cheeks and her eyes had a suspicious brightness in them  flo she said youll go back to new york right off im sorry i brought you here this place isnt fit for you  i am quite willing so long as you are coming too  i cant isnt that plain this thing is getting horriblebut i have to see it through it was clavering fixed it any way  put it away until tomorrow flora schuyler advised it will be easier to see whether you have any cause to be angry then  hetty turned towards her with a flash in her eyes i know just what you mean and it would be nicer just to look as if i never felt anything as some of those english folks you were fond of did but i cant i wasnt made that way still im not going to apologize for my father he is torrance of cedar and im standing in with himbut if i were a man id go down and whip clavering i could almost have shaken him when he wanted to stay here and tried to make me ask him  well said flora schuyler quietly i am going to stay with you but i dont quite see what clavering has done  no said hetty arent you just a little stupid flo now he has made me ashamedhorriblyand i was proud of the men we had in this country hes starving the women and the little children there are quite a few of them lying in freezing shanties and sodhuts out there in the snow its just awful to be hungry with the temperature at fifty below  miss schuyler shivered it was very warm and cosy sitting there behind double casements beside a glowing stove but there had been times when wrapped in costly furs and great sleighrobes and generously fed she had felt her flesh shrink from the cold of the prairie  but they have mr grant to help them she said  even in her agitation hetty was struck by something which suggested unquestioning faith in her companions tone  you believe he could do something she said  of course you know him better than i do hetty  well said hetty though he has made me vexed with him i am proud of larry and theres just one thing he cant do that is to see women and children hungry while he has a dollar to buy them food with oh i know who was going to pay for the provisions that came from chicago that clavering got the railroad men to send the wrong way and if larry had only been with us he would have been splendid as it is if he feeds them in spite of clavering i could most forgive him everything  are you quite sure that you have a great deal to forgive  hetty instead of resenting the question stretched out her hand appealingly dont be clever flo come here quite close and be nice to me this thing is worrying me horribly and im ashamed of myself andof everybody oh i know im a failure i couldnt sing to please folks and i sent jake cheyne away while now when the troubles come im too mean even to stand behind my father as i meant to do flo youll stay with me i want you  miss schuyler who had not seen hetty in this mood before petted her though she said very little for she felt that the somewhat unusual abasement might on the whole be beneficial to her companion so there was silence in the room broken only by the snapping of the stove and the faint moaning of the bitter wind about the lonely building while miss schuyler sat somewhat uncomfortably on the arm of hettys chair with the little dusky head pressed against her shoulder hetty could not see her face or its gravity might have astonished her miss schuyler had not spoken quite the truth when though she had only met him three times she admitted that hetty knew larry grant better than she did in various places and different guises flora schuyler had seen the type of manhood he stood for but had never felt the same curious stirring of sympathy this grave brownfaced man had aroused in her  a hound bayed savagely and hetty lifted her head strangers she said bowie knows all the cattleboys who can be coming at this hour  the question was not unwarranted for it was close on midnight but flora schuyler did not answer she could hear nothing but the moan of the wind the ranch was very still until once more there came an angry growl then out of the icy darkness followed the sound of running feet a hoarse cry and a loud pounding at the outer door  hetty stood up trembling and white in the face but very straight dont be frightened flo she said well whip them back to the place they came from  who is it asked miss schuyler  again the building rang to the blows upon the outer door but hettys voice was even and a little contemptuous  the rustlers she said  there was a trampling below and a corridor beneath the girls vibrated with the footsteps of hurrying men while torrances voice rose faintly through the din a very unpleasant silence until somebody rapped upon the door flora schuyler felt her heart throbbing painfully and gasped when torrance looked in his lean face was very stern  put the lamp out and sit well away from the window he said  no said hetty in a voice miss schuyler had not heard before we are coming down  torrance considered for a second and then smiled significantly as he glanced at his daughters face well you would be most as safe down thereand i guess it was born in you he said  the girls followed him down the cedar stairway and into the hall a lamp burning very low stood on a table in one corner but the big room was dim and shadowy and the girls could scarcely see the five or six men standing near not in front of one open window framed by its log casing the white prairie faded into the dimness under a smear of indigo sky here and there a star shone in it with intense brilliancy and though the great stove roared in the draught it seemed to miss schuyler that a destroying cold came in already she felt her hands grow numb  where are the boys hetty she asked  in at the railroad most of them one or two at the back now ill show you how to load a rifle flo  miss schuyler followed her to the table where several rifles were lying beside a big box of cartridges and hetty took one of them up  you push this slide back and drop the cartridge in she said now it has gone into this pipe here and you drop in another get hold and push them in until you cant get in any more whyit cant hurt youyour hands are shaking  there was a rattle and the venomous conicalheaded cartridge slipped from miss schuylers fingers she had never handled one before and it seemed to her that a horrible evil potency was bound up in that insignificant roll of metal then while the rifle clickclacked in hettys hands torrance stood by the window holding up a handkerchief he called out sharply and there was a murmur of derision in the darkness outside  come out said a hoarse voice well give you a minute then you can have a sleigh to drive to perdition in  the laughter that followed frightened miss schuyler more than any threats would have done it seemed wholly horrible and there was a hint in it of the fierce exultation of men driven to desperation  that wouldnt suit me said torrance what do you want here any way  food somebody answered you wanted to starve us torrance and rode us out when we went chopping stove wood in the bluff well you dont often miss your supper at the range and theres quite enough of it to make a decent blaze you havent much of that minute left are you coming out  no said torrance briefly and dropping the handkerchief moved from the window  the next moment there was a flash in the darkness and something came whirring into the room the girls could not see it but they heard the thud it struck with and saw a chip start from the cedar panelling then there was a rush of feet and twice a red streak blazed from the window a man jerked a cartridge which fell with a rattle from his rifle and a little blue smoke blew across the room flora schuyler shivered as the acrid fumes of it drifted about her but hetty stood very straight with one hand on the rim of the table  got nobody and theyre into the shadow now said a man disgustedly and flora schuyler seeing his face which showed a moment fierce and brutish as he turned felt that she could not forget it and most illogically hated him  for almost a minute there was silence nobody moved in the big room where the shadows wavered as the faint flickering lamplight rose and fell and there was no sound but the doleful wail of the night wind from the prairie it was broken by a dull crash that was repeated a moment later and the men looked at one another  theyve brought their axes along said somebody if theres any of the michigan boys around theyll drive that door in  watch it two of you said torrance jake cant you get a shot at them  a man crouched by the open window which was some little height from the ground his arms upon the sill and his head showing against the darkness just above them he was it seemed to miss schuyler horribly deliberate and she held her breath while she watched as if fascinated the long barrel move a little then its muzzle tilted suddenly a train of red sparks blew out and something that hummed through the smoke struck the wall the man dropped below the sill and called hoarsely through the crash of the falling axes  got the pillar instead of him theres a streak of light behind me well ill try for him again  hetty emptied the box of cartridges and with hands that did not seem to tremble stood it up before the lamp once more the man crouched by the window a blurred huddled object with head down on the rifle stock and there was another streak of flame then the thud of the axes suddenly ceased and he laughed a little discordant laugh  got him this time the other ones lit out he said  miss schuyler shuddered and clutched at the table while though hetty was very still she fancied she heard a stifled gasp the silence was even more disconcerting than the pounding of the axes or the crash of the firing flora schuyler could see the shadowy figures about the window and just distinguish some of them the one standing close in front of it as though disdainful of the risk he ran was torrance the other who now and then moved lithely and once rested a rifle on the sill was clavering another the man who had fired the last shot but the rest were blurred formless objects a little darker than the cedar panelling now and then the streak of radiance widened behind the box and the cold grew numbing as the icy wind flowed in  suddenly a voice rose up outside you cant keep us out torrance were bound to get in but ill try to hold the boys now if youll let us have our wounded man and light out quietly  torrance laughed you are not making much of a show and im quite ready to do the best i can he said if theres any life in him we want your man for the sheriff  then he turned to the others i was most forgetting the fellow outside there well hold them off from the window while you bring him in  it appeared horribly risky but torrance spoke with a curious unconcernedness and clavering laughed as signing to two men he prepared to do his bidding there was a creaking and rattling and the great door at one end of the hall swung open and flora schuyler staring at the darkness expected to see a rush of shadowy figures out of it but she saw only the blurred outline of two men who stooped and dragged something in and then the door swung to again  they lifted their burden higher torrance approaching the table took up the lamp and miss schuyler had a passing glimpse of a hanging head and a drawn grey face as they tramped past her heavily she opened her blue lips and closed them again for she was dazed with cold and the cry that would have been a relief to her never came it was several minutes later when torrances voice rose from by the stove  well leave him here in the meanwhile where he cant freeze he said shot right through the shoulder but theres no great bleeding the cold would stop it  hetty was at her fathers side the next moment flo she said we have to do something now  torrance waved them back the longer that man stops as he is the better chances hes going to have he glanced towards the window boys can you see what theyre doing now  hauling out prairie hay said clavering theyve broken into the store and from what one fellow shouted theyve found the kerosene  torrance said nothing whatever and his silence was significant listening with strained attention flora schuyler could hear a faint hum of voices and now and then vague sounds amidst a patter of hurrying steps they told her very little but the tension in the attitude of the halfseen men had its meaning it was evident that their assailants purposed to burn them out  ten minutes passed as it were interminably and still nobody moved the voices had grown a little louder and there was a rattle as though men unseen behind the buildings were dragging up a wagon suddenly a rhythmic drumming came softly through it and clavering glanced at torrance  somebody riding this way at a gallop he said  the beat of hoofs grew louder the men without seemed to be running to and fro and shouting to one another while those in the hall clustered about the window reckless of the risk they ran standing a little behind them hetty saw a dim mounted figure sweep out of the waste of snow and a hoarse shout went up hold on throw down that rifle its larry grant     xiv  torrances warning   in another moment the horseman pulled up and sat motionless in his saddle with his head turned towards the house hetty could see him silhouetted shapeless and shadowy in his big furcoat against the whiteness of the snow and the relief she felt betrayed itself in her voice as she turned to miss schuyler  yes she said its larry there will be no more trouble now  flora schuyler laughed a little breathless laugh for though she also felt the confidence her companion evinced the strain had told on her  of course she said he knew you wanted him there are men like that  it was a simple tribute but hetty thrilled with pride larry was at least consistent and now as it had been in the days both looked back upon he had come when she needed him she also recognized even then that the fact that he is generally to be found where he is wanted implies a good deal in the favour of any man  and now halfseen objects moved out from behind barn and stable and the horseman turned towards them his voice rose sharply and commandingly  what are you doing here he demanded  there was no answer for several moments and then a man stepped forward gesticulating fiercely as he commenced a tirade that was less than half intelligible larry checked him with a lifted hand  theres a good deal of that i cant quite understand and the rest doesnt seem to fit this case he said with a laugh that had more effect upon some of those who heard it than a flow of eloquence would have had boys we have no use for worrying about the meanness of european kings and folks of that kind if you have brought any along id sooner listen to sensible americans  another man stepped forward and there was no doubt about his accent though his tone was deprecatory  well it just comes to this he said torrance and the cattlemen have done their best to starve us and freeze us out and since he has made it plain that theres no room for both of us somebody has got to go now we have come a long way and we mean to stay were not looking for trouble but we want our rights  there was a murmur of encouragement from the rest but again larrys laugh had its effect then youre taking a kind of curious way of getting them he said i dont know that trying to burn folks houses ever did anybody much good and its quite likely to bring a regiment of united states cavalry down on you mr torrance i fancied i heard firing have you anybody hurt inside  one of your men said torrance drily we hope to pull him round and let the sheriff have him  it was not a conciliatory answer and came near undoing what grant had accomplished but the grim old cattlebaron was not the man to propitiate an enemy a murmur followed it and somebody said boys you hear him bring along that wagon were going in  the form of speech was western but the voice was guttural and when there was a rattle of wheels grant suddenly changed his tone  stop right there he said throw every truss of hay down the man who holds off when i tell him what to do is going to have trouble with the executive  it was a bold venture and any sign of effort or unevenness of inflection would have rendered it futile but the voice was sharp and ringing and the fashion in which the horseman flung up his arm commanding it was also tactful for some of those who heard it had been drilled into unreflecting obedience and there is in the native american the respect for a duly accredited leader which discipline has further impressed upon the teuton still those who watched from the window felt that this was the crisis and tightened their numbed fingers on the rifles knowing that if the horseman failed they would shortly need them again none of them however made any other movement and miss schuyler who grasping hettys hand saw the dim figures standing rigid and intent could only hear the snapping of the stove  hetty she gasped i shall do something silly in another moment  the tension only lasted a moment or two a man sprang up on the pole of the wagon and a truss of hay went down another followed and then men who had also felt the strain and now felt it a relief to do anything clustered about the wagon in a few minutes it was empty and the men who had been a mob turned to the one who had changed them into an organized body  what do you want now asked one of them  run that wagon back where you got it from said larry  it was done and when the clustering figures vanished amidst a rattle of wheels torrance laid aside his rifle and sat down on the table  i guess therell be no more trouble boys thats a thing theres not many men could have done he added  his daughter also sat down in the nearest chair with flora schuylers hand still within her own she had been very still while the suspense lasted but she was trembling now and her voice had a little quiver in it as she said wasnt he splendid flo  it was some minutes before grant and the other men came back again and fragments of what he said were audible then you can pick out four men and well hear them at the committee i have two or three questions to ask you by and by half a dozen of you keep a lookout the rest can get into the stable out of the frost  the men dispersed and grant turned towards the house i dont think you need have any further anxiety and you can shut that window if you want to mr torrance  torrance laughed i dont know that ive shown any yet  i hope you havent felt it said grant it is cold out here and im willing to come in and talk to you  somebody had moved the box away from the lamp and claverings face showed up against the wavering shadow as he turned towards his leader flora schuyler saw a little unpleasant smile on his lips as he pointed suggestively to the men with rifles he had sent towards the door  that would suit us sir he said  torrance understood him for he shook his head impatiently it wouldnt pay there would be too many of his friends wondering what had become of him get the door open and tell him to come in light the big lamps somebody  the door was opened and as if in confirmation of torrances warning a voice rose up outside we have let him go but if you try any meanness or he isnt ready when we want him well pull the place down it said  larry walked out of the darkness into the blaze of light and only smiled a little when the great door swung to behind him and somebody brought the window banging down two men with rifles stepped between him and the former but if torrance had intended to impress him he had apparently failed for he moved forward with quiet confidence the fur cap he held in his hand was white and the great fur coat stood out from his body stiff with frost while hetty winced when she saw the pallor of his face it was evident that it was not without a strenuous effort he had made the mob subservient to him  but his eyes were grave and steady in spite of the weariness in them and as he passed the girls he made a little formal inclination with his head he stopped in front of torrance who rose from his seat on the table and for a moment the two men looked at one another both stood very straight one lean and dark and commanding with halfcontemptuous anger in his black eyes the other of heavier frame and brown of skin and hair save where what he had done had left its stamp of pallor yet different as they were in complexion and feature it seemed to miss schuyler who watched them intently that there was a curious indefinite resemblance between them they were of the same stock and equally resolute each ready it seemed to stake all he had on what he held the right  flora schuyler who had trained her observation also read what they felt in their faces and saw in that of torrance grudging approval tempered by scorn of the man who had trampled on the traditions of those he sprang from she fancied that larry recognized this and that it stung him though he would not show that it did and his attitude pleased her most it was unyielding but there was a deference that became him in it  i am sorry i did not arrive soon enough to save you this inconvenience sir he said  torrance smiled grimly and there was a hardness in his voice you have been here a good many times larry and we did our best for you none of us fancied that you would repay us by coming back with a mob of rabble to pull the place down  grant winced perceptibly nobody is more sorry than i am sir  arent you a trifle late  i came as soon as i got word  torrance made a little gesture of impatience thats not what i mean there is very little use in being sorry now before the other fools you joined started there talking there was quietness and prosperity in this country the men who had made it what it is got all but nothing more than they were entitled to and one could enjoy what he had worked for and sleep at night this was not good enough for youand this is what you have made of it  he stretched out his arm with a forceful gesture pointing to the men with rifles the two whitefaced girls and the splinters on the wall then dropped his hand and larrys eyes rested on the huddled figure lying by the stove he moved towards it and bent down without a word and it was at least five minutes before he came back again his face dark and stern  you have done nothing for him he said  illustration arent you a trifle latepage 160  no said torrance we have not i guess nature knows whats best for him and i didnt see anything to be gained by rousing him with brandy to start the bleeding  well first of all i want that man  you can have him we had meant him for the sheriff but what you did just now lays me in your debt and i would not like to feel i owed you anything  grant made a little gesture i dont think i have quite deserved that sir i owe you a good deal and it makes what i have to do harder still cant you remember that there was a time when you were kind to me  no said torrance drily i dont want to be reminded when i have done foolish things i tried to warn you but you would not listen to me that the trail you have started on will take you a good deal farther than you meant to go if you have anything to tell me i would sooner talk business are you going to bring your friends round here at night again  they came without me and if i can help it will not come back this thing will be gone into and the leaders punished by our committee now are you willing to stop the intimidation of the storekeepers which has brought about this trouble and let us get provisions in the town i can offer you something in exchange  no said torrance do what suits you best i can make no terms with you if it hadnt been for my foolishness in sending the boys off with the cattle very few of your friends would have got away from cedar range tonight  ill take my man away i can thank you for that at least was grants answer  he moved to the door and opened it and three men came in they did his bidding and all made way for them when they tramped out unsteadily with their burden then he turned once more to torrance with his fur cap in his hand  i am going now sir and it is hard to tell what may happen before we meet again we have each got a difficult row to hoe and i want to leave you on the best terms i can  torrance looked at him steadily and grant returned it with a curious gravity though there were fearless cattlemen at cedar range who did not care to meet its owners gaze when he regarded them in that fashion with a just perceptible gesture he directed the younger mans attention to the red splashes on the floor  that alone he said quietly would stand between you and me we made this land rich and peaceful but that did not please you and the rest who had not sense to see that while human natures what it is theres no use worrying about what you cant have when you have got enough you went round sowing trouble and by and by youll have to reap it you brought in the rabble and were going to lead them and make them farmers but now they will lead you where you dont want to go and when you have given them all you have turn and trample on you with the help of the men who are going back on their own kind they may get us down but when that time comes there will not be a head of cattle left or a dollar in the treasury  i can only hope you are mistaken sir said grant  i have lived quite a long while but i have never seen the rabble keep faith with anyone longer than it suited them the older man said any way that is not the question you will be handed to the sheriff if you come here again i have nothing more to tell you and this is i hope the last time i shall ever speak to you  miss schuyler watched grant closely but though his face was drawn and set she saw only a respect which if it was assumed still became him in his bearing as he turned away as he passed the girls he bent his head and hetty whose cheeks were flushed rose with a formal bow though her eyes shone suspiciously but flora schuyler stepped forward and held out her hand  mr torrance cant object to two women thanking you for what you have done and if he does i dont greatly mind she said  torrance only smiled but the warm bronze seemed to have returned to larrys face as he passed on flora schuyler had thanked him but he had seen what was worth far more to him in hettys eyes and knew that it was only loyalty to one who had the stronger claim that held her still after the door closed behind him there was once more a curious stillness in the hall until torrance went out with his retainers a little later clavering found the girls in another room  you seem quite impressed miss schuyler he said  i am said flora schuyler i have seen a man who commands ones approbationand an american  clavering laughed then theyre not always quite the same thing  no flora schuyler said coldly that was one of the pleasant fancies i had to give up a long time ago  i would like a definition of the perfected american said clavering  miss schuyler yawned cant you tell him hetty i once heard you talk quite eloquently on that subject  ill try said hetty its the man who wants to give his country something and not get the most he can out of it the one who goes round planting seeds that will grow and bear fruit even if it is long after he is there to eat it no country has much use for the man who only wants to reap  clavering assented but there was a sardonic gleam in his eyes well he said reflectively there was once a man who planted dragons teeth and you know what kind of crop they yielded him  he knew what he was doing said flora schuyler the trouble is that now few men know a dragons tooth when they see it  clavering laughed then the ones who dont should be stopped right off when they go round planting anything     xv  hettys bounty   it was a clear cold afternoon and hetty driving back from allonbys ranch sent the team at a gallop down the dip to the cedar bridge the beaten trail rang beneath the steel shoes of the rocking sleigh the birches streamed up blurred together out of the hollow and flora schuyler felt the wind sting her cheeks like the lash of a whip the coldness of it dimmed her eyes and she had only a hazy and somewhat disconcerting vision of a streak of snow that rolled back to the horses feet amidst the whirling trees it was wonderfully exhilaratingthe rush of the lurching sleigh the hammering of the hoofs and the scream of the windbut miss schuyler realized that it was also unpleasantly risky as she remembered the difficult turn before one came to the bridge  she decided however that there was nothing to be gained by pointing this out to her companion for hetty who sat swaying a little in the driving seat had been in a somewhat curious mood since the attack on cedar range and unusually impatient of advice or remonstrance indeed flora schuyler fancied that it was the restlessness she had manifested once or twice of late which impelled her to hurl the sleigh down into the hollow at that reckless pace so she said nothing until the streak of snow broke off close ahead and there were only trees in front of them then a wild lurch cut short the protest she made and she gasped as they swung round the bend and flashed across the bridge the trail however led steeply upwards now and hetty laughing dropped the reins upon the plodding horses necks  didnt that remind you of the chicago limited she said  i was wondering said miss schuyler breathlessly if you had any reason for trying to break your neck  well said hetty with a twinkle in her eyes i felt i had to do something a little out of the usual and it was really safe enough everybody feels that way now and then and i couldnt well work it off by quarrelling with you or going out and talking to the boys as my father does i dont know a better cure than a gallop or a switchback in a sleigh  some folks find it almost as soothing to tell their friends what is worrying them and i scarcely think its more risky said miss schuyler  hettys face became grave well she said one can talk to you and i have been worried flo i know that it is quite foolish but i cant help it i came back to see my father through the trouble and im going to but while i know that hes ever so much wiser than i am some of the things he has to do hurt me its our land and were going to keep it but its not nice to think of the little children starving in the snow  this miss schuyler decided was perfectly correct so far as it went but she also felt tolerably certain that while it was commendable hettys loyalty to her father would be strenuously tested and did not alone account for her restlessness  and there was nothing else she said  no said hetty a little too decisively of course any way now i have told you we are not going to worry about these things today and i drove fast partly because the trail is narrow and one generally meets somebody here did it ever strike you flo that if theres anyone you know in a country that has a bridge in it you will if you cross it often enough meet him there  no and miss schuyler smiled satirically it didnt though one would fancy it was quite likely i however remember that we met larry here not very long ago that canadian blanket suit shows you off quite nicely hetty it is especially adapted to your kind of figure  hetty flicked the horses then pulled them up again and miss schuyler laughed as a sleigh with two men in it swung out from beneath the trees in front of them  this is of course a coincidence she said  hetty coloured dont be foolish flo she said how could i know he was coming  flora schuyler did not answer and hetty was edging her horses to the side of the trail in which two sleighs could scarcely pass when a shout came down  wait well pull up and lead our team round  in another minute grant stepped out of his sleigh and would have passed if hetty had not stopped him she sat higher than her companion and probably knew that the canadian blanket costume with its scarlet trimmings became her slender figure the crimson toque also went well with the clustering dark hair and dark eyes and there was a brightness in the latter which was in keeping with the colour the cold wind had brought into the delicate oval face the man glanced at her a moment and then apparently found that a trace required his attention  i am glad we met you larry said the girl flo thanked you the night you came to cedar and i wanted to but while you know why i couldnt i would not like you to think it was very unkind of me whatever my father does is right you see  of course said grant gravely you have to believe it hetty  hettys eyes twinkled that was very nice of you then you must be wrong  well said grant with a merry laugh it is quite likely that i am now and then one can only do the best he can and to be right all the time is a little too much to expect from any man  miss schuyler who was talking to breckenridge turned and smiled and hetty said then that makes it a little easier for me to admit that the folks i belong to go just a little too far occasionally larry i hate to think of the little children going hungry are there many of them  grants face darkened for a moment im afraid there are quite a fewand sick ones too lying with about half enough to cover them in sodhovels  hetty shuddered and her eyes grew pitiful for since the grim early days hunger and want had been unknown in the cattle country if i want to do something for them it cant be very wrong she said larry you will take a roll of bills from me and buy them whatever will make it a little less hard for them  no said grant quietly i cant hetty your father gives you that money and we have our own relief machinery  the girl laid her hand upon his arm appealingly i have a little my mother left me and it was hers before she married my father cant you understand i am with my father and would not lift my finger to help you and the homesteadboys against him but it couldnt do anybody any harm if i sent a few things to hungry children you have just got to take those dollars larry  then i dare not refuse said grant after thinking a moment they need more than we can give them but you cant send me the dollars  no said hetty and i have none with me now but if a responsible man came to the bluff tomorrow night at eight oclock my maid could slip down with the walletyou must not come it would be too dangerous my father and one or two of the rest are very bitter against you  well said grant smiling gravely a responsible man will be there there are folks who will bless you hetty  you must never tell them or anybody the girl insisted  grant said nothing further and led his team past but hetty noticed the shadow in his bronzed face and the wistfulness in his eyes then she shook the reins and as the horses plodded up the slope miss schuyler fancied that she sighed  in the meanwhile grant got into his sleigh and breckenridge who had been vanquished by miss schuyler in an exchange of badinage found him somewhat silent during the journey to fremont ranch he retired to rest soon after they reached it and set out again before daylight the next morning and it was late at night when he came back very weary with his garments stiff with frost the great bare room where breckenridge awaited him was filled with a fusty heat and as he came in partly dazed by the change of temperature grant did not see the other man who sat amidst the tobaccosmoke beside the glowing stove he sank into a hide chair limply and when breckenridge glanced at him inquiringly with numbed fingers dragged a wallet out of his pocket  yes he said i got the dollars i dont know that it was quite the square thing but with harpers wife and the dutchmans children most starving in the hollow i felt i had to take them  breckenridge made a little warning gesture and the man behind the stove reaching forward picked up a packet that had dropped unnoticed by the rest when grant took out the wallet  you seem kind of played out larry and i guess you didnt know you dropped the thing he said  grant blinked at him for a man who has driven for many hours in the cold of the northwest is apt to suffer from unpleasant and somewhat bewildering sensations when his numbed brain and body first throw off the effect of the frost  no he said unevenly let me alone a minute i didnt see you  the man who was one of the homesteaders leaders in another vicinity sat still with the packet in his hand until perhaps without any intention of reading it his eyes rested on the address then he sat upright suddenly and stared at grant  do you know what you have got here larry he asked  grant stretched out his hand and took the packet then laid it upon the table with the address downwards  its something that dropped out of the wallet he said  the other man laughed a little but his face was intent oh yes thats quite plain but if i know the writing its a letter with something in it from torrance to the sheriff theres no mistaking the way he makes the g turn it over and ill show you  grant laid a brown hand on the packet no do you generally look at letters that dont belong to you chilton  breckenridge saw that grant was recovering and that the contemptuous manner of his question was intentional and guessed that his comrade had intended to sting the other man to resentment and so lead him from the point at issue chilton coloured but he persisted  well he said i guess that one belongs to the committee i didnt mean to look at the thing but now im sure of it i have to do what i can for the boys who made me their executive i dont ask you how you got it larry  i got it by accident  chilton looked astonished and almost incredulous well we neednt worry over that the question is what youre going to do with it  im going to send it back  chilton made a gesture of impatience thats what you cant do as we know the cattlemen had a committee at cedar a day or two ago and now heres a packet stuffed with something going to the sheriff doesnt it strike you yet that its quite likely theres a roll of dollar bills and a letter telling him what he has to do inside it  well said grant seeing that he must face the issue sooner or later  we dont want their dollars but that letters worth a pile of them to us we could get it printed by a paper farther east with an article on it that would raise a howl from everybody there are one or two of them quite ready for a chance of getting a slap at the legislature while theres more than one man who would be glad to hawk it round the lobbies then his friends would have no more use for the sheriff and we might even get a commission sent down to straighten things up for us  the trouble is that we cant make any use of it said grant  no said chilton and the men looked at each other steadily  no repeated grant it wasnt meant that i should get it and im going to send it back  then while i dont want to make trouble ill have to mention the thing to my committee  youll do just what you believe is right any way well have supper now it will be ready  chilton stood still a moment you are quite straight with us in this  yes said grant but im not going to give you that letter are you coming in to supper it really wouldnt commit you to anything  i am said chilton simply i have known you quite a long while and your assurance is good enough for me but you would have found it difficult to make other folks believe you  they sat down at table and larry smiled as he said its the first time i have seen your scruples spoil your appetite chilton but i had a notion that you were not quite sure about taking any supper from me  well laughed chilton that just shows how foolish a man can be because the suppers already right here inside me when i came in breckenridge got it for me still i have driven a long way and i can worry through another  he made a very creditable attempt and when he had been shown to his room grant glanced at breckenridge  you know how i got the letter  yes said breckenridge miss torrance must have inadvertently slipped it into the wallet you couldnt have done anything else larry but the affair is delicate and will want some handling how are you going to get the packet back  take it myself grant said quietly  it was ten oclock the next night and hetty torrance and miss schuyler sat talking in their little sittingroom torrance was away but his married foreman who had seen service in new mexico and his wife slept in the house and cedar range was strongly guarded now and then the bitter wind set the door rattling and there was a snapping in the stove but when the gusts passed the ranch seemed very still and miss schuyler could hear the light tread of the armed cowboy who perhaps to keep himself warm paced up and down the hall below there was another at a window in the corridor and one or two more on guard in the stores and stables  wasnt chris allonby to have come over today asked miss schuyler  yes said hetty im sorry he didnt i have a letter for the sheriff to give him and wanted to get rid of the thing it is important and i fancy from what my father told me if any of the homesteadboys got it they could make trouble for us chris is to ride in with it and hand it to the sheriff  i wouldnt like a letter of that kind lying round said miss schuyler where did you put it hetty  hetty laughed where nobody would ever find itunder some clothes of mine talking about it makes one uneasy pull out the second drawer in the bureau flo  miss schuyler did so and hetty turned over a bundle of daintily embroidered linen then her face grew very grave she laid each article back again separately  nothing there said miss schuyler  hettys fingers quivered pull the drawer out flo no never mind anything shake them out on the floor  it was done and a litter of garments lay scattered about them but no packet appeared and hetty sat down limply very white in the face  it was there she said by the wallet with the dollars it must have got inside somehow and i sent the wallet to larry this is horrible flo  think said miss schuyler you couldnt have put it anywhere else  no said hetty faintly if the wrong people got it it would turn out the sheriff and make an outcry everywhere that is what i was told though i dont know what it was about  still you know it would be safe with mr grant  yes said hetty larry never did anything mean in his life but you dont understand flo he didnt know it was there and it might have dropped out on the prairie while even if he found it how is he going to get it back to me the boys would fire on him if he came here  flora schuyler looked frightened you will have to tell your father hetty  hetty trembled a little it is going to be the hardest thing i ever did he is just dreadful in his quietness when he is angryand i would have to tell him i had been meeting larry and sending him dollars you know what he would fancy  it was evident that hetty was very much afraid of her father and as clear to miss schuyler that the latter would have some cause for unpleasant suspicions then the girl turned to her companion appealingly  flo she said tell me what to do the thing frightens me  miss schuyler slipped an arm about her wait she said your father will not be here until noon tomorrow and that letter is in the hands of a very honest man i think you can trust him to get it back to you  but he couldnt send anybody without giving me away and he knows it might cost him his liberty to come here said hetty  i scarcely fancy that would stop him  hetty turned and looked at her friend curiously flo i wonder how it would have suited if larry had been fond of you  miss schuyler did not wince but the smile that was on her lips was absent from her eyes you once told me i should have him are you quite sure you would like to hand him over now  hetty did not answer the question instead she blushed furiously we are talking nonsenseand i dont know how i can face my father tomorrow she said  it was at least an hour later and the cowboy below had ceased his pacing when hetty who felt no inclination for sleep fancied she heard a tapping at the window she sprang suddenly upright and saw apprehension in miss schuylers face the cowboys were some distance away and a little verandah ran round that side of the house just below the window flora schuyler had sufficient courage but it was not of the kind which appears to advantage in the face of bodily peril and the colour faded in her cheeks it was quite certain now that somebody was tapping at or trying to open the window  shake yourself together flo said hetty in a hoarse whisper when i tell you turn the lamp down and open the door i am going to see who is there  the next moment she had opened a drawer of the bureau while as she stepped forward with something glinting in her hand flora schuyler who heard a whispered word turned the lamp right out in her confusion and because she dared not stand still crept after her companion with a swift motion hetty drew the windowcurtains back and miss schuyler gasped the stars were shining outside and the dark figure of a man was silhouetted against the blue clearness of the night  come back she cried oh hes coming in hetty i must scream  hettys fingers closed upon her arm with a cruel grip stop she said if you do theyll shoot him dont be a fool flo  it was too dark to see clearly but flora schuyler realized with a painful fluttering of her heart and a great relief whose the white face outside the window must be     xvi  larry solves the difficulty   for the space of several seconds the girls stood staring at the figure outside the window then the man turned sharply and hetty gasped as she heard the crunch of footsteps in the snow below there was a little of it on the verandah and the stars shone brilliantly  catch hold of the frame here flo she said breathlessly now push with all your might  miss schuyler did as she was bidden the double sashes moved with a sharp creaking and while she shivered as the arctic cold struck through her hetty stretched out an arm and drew the man in then with a tremendous effort she shut the window and pulled the curtains together there was darkness in the room now and one of the cowboys called out below  hear anything jake  somebody shutting a door in the house there said another man and hetty passing between the curtains could see two figures move across the snow and the little scintillation from something that was carried by one of them and she realized that they had very narrowly averted a tragedy  flo she said with a little quiver in her voice light the lamp quick if they see the room dark they might come up  miss schuyler was unusually clumsy but at last the light sprang up and showed larry standing just inside the curtain with the dust of snow on his fur coat and cap his face looked a little less bronzed than usual but he showed no other sign of discomposure hetty was very pale as she stood in front of him with the pistol still in her hand she dropped it on a chair with a shiver and broke into a little strained laugh  you are quite sure they didnt see you larry you took a terrible risk just now  grant smiled more with his lips than his eyes yes he said i guess i did i taught you to shoot as well as most men hetty  hetty gasped again and sank limply into the nearest chair what brought you here she said still you cant get away now sit down larry  grant sat down with a bow to miss schuyler and fumbled in the pocket of his big fur coat i came to give you something you sent me by mistake he said i would not have come this way if i could have helped it but i saw there was a man with a rifle every here and there as i crept up through the bluff and it was quite a while before i could swing myself up by a pillar on to the verandah you have been anxious about this hetty  he laid a packet on the table and hettys eyes shone as she took it up  couldnt you have given it to somebody to bring me it would have been ever so much safer she said  no said the man simply i dont think i could  hetty understood him and so did miss schuyler while the meaning of the glance her companion cast at her was equally plain miss torrances face was still pallid but there was pride in her eyes  i wonder if you guessed what was in that letter mr grant flora schuyler asked  larry smiled i think i have a notion  of course said hetty impulsively we knew you had and that was why we felt certain you would try to bring it back to me  if it could have been managed in a different fashion it would have pleased me better grant said with a little impatient gesture i am sorry i frightened you hetty  the colour crept back into hettys cheeks i was frightened but only just a little at first she said it was when i saw who it was and heard the boys below that i grew really anxious  she did not look at the man as she spoke but it was evident to miss schuyler that he understood the significance of the avowal  then he said i must try to get away again more quietly  you cant said hetty not until the man by the store goes away you have taken too many chances already you have driven a long way in the cold take off that big coat and flo will make you some coffee  grant turning drew the curtains aside a moment and let them fall back again then he took off the big coat and sat down with a little smile of contentment beside the glowing stove on which miss schuyler was placing a kettle  well he said i am afraid you will have to put up with my company until that fellow goes away and i need not tell you that this is very nice for me one hasnt much time to feel it but its dreadfully lonely at fremont now and then  hetty nodded sympathetically for she had seen the great desolate room at fremont where grant and breckenridge passed the bitter nights alone the mans halfaudible sigh was also very expressive for after his grim life he found the brightness and daintiness of the little room very pleasant it was sparely furnished but there was taste in everything and in contrast with fremont its curtains rugs and pictures seemed luxurious without were bitter frost and darkness peril and selfdenial within warmth and refinement and the companionship of two cultured women who were very gracious to him he also knew that he had shut himself out from the enjoyment of their society of his own will that he had but to make terms with torrance and all that one side of his nature longed for might be restored to him  larry was as free from sensuality as he was from asceticism but there were times when the bleak discomfort at fremont palled upon him as did the loneliness and halfcooked food his overtaxed body revolted now and then from further exposure to arctic cold and the deprivation of needed sleep while his heart grew sick with anxiety and the distrust of those he was toiling for he was not a fanatic and had very slight sympathy with the iconoclast for he had an innate respect for the law and vague aspirations after an ampler life made harmonious by refinement as well as a halfcomprehending reverence for all that was best in art and music there are many americans like him and when such a man turns reformer he has usually a hard row indeed to hoe  what do you do up there at nights asked hetty  larry laughed sometimes breckenridge and i sit talking by the stove and now and then we quarrel breckenridge has taste and generally smooths one the right way but there are times when i feel like throwing things at him then we sit quite still for hours together listening to the wind moaning until one of the boys comes in to tell me we are wanted and it is a relief to drive until morning with the frost at fifty below it is very different from the old days when i was here and at allonbys two or three nights every week  it must have been hard to give up what you did said hetty with a diffidence that was unusual in her oh i know you did it willingly but you must have found it was very different from what you expected i mean that the men you wanted to smooth the way for had their notions too and meant to do a good deal that could never please you suppose you found they didnt want to go along quietly making this country better but only to trample down whatever was there already  flora schuyler looked up i think you will have to face that question mr grant she said a good many men of your kind have had to do it before you isnt a faulty ruler better than wild disorder  yes said hetty eagerly that is just what i mean if you saw they wanted anarchy larry you would come back to us we should be glad to have you  the man turned his eyes away and flora schuyler saw his hands quiver  no he said i and the rest would have to teach them what was good for them and if it was needful try to hold them in whatever they did we who brought them here would have to stand in with them  hetty accepted the decision in his tone and sighed well she said we will forget it and flo has the coffee ready that is yours larry and heres a box of crackers now well try to think of pleasant things its like our oldtime picnics doesnt it remind you of the big bluffonly we had a black kettle then and you made the fire of sticks there was the day you shot the willow grouse it isnt really so very long ago  it seems years said the man wistfully so much has happened since  well said hetty i can remember all of it stillthe pale blue sky behind the bluff with the little curl of grey smoke floating up against it you sat by the fire larry roasting the grouse and talking about what could be done with the prairie it was all white in the sunshine and empty as far as one could see but you told me it would be a great red wheatfield by and by i laughed at you for dreaming things that couldnt be but we were very happy that day  grants face was very sad for a moment but he turned to miss schuyler with a little smile hetty is leaving you out he said  i wasnt there you see miss schuyler said quickly those days belong to you and hetty  hetty glanced at her sharply and fancied there was a slightly strained expression in the smiling face but the next moment miss schuyler laughed  what are you thinking flo said hetty  it was scarcely worth mentioning i was wondering how it was that the only times we have crossed the bridge we met mr grant  thats quite simple said larry each time it was on wednesday and i generally drive round to see if i am wanted anywhere that day they have had to do almost without provisions at the homesteads in the hollow lately your dollars will be very welcome hetty  hetty blushed for no especial reason except that when grant mentioned wednesday she felt that flora schuylers eyes were upon her then a voice rose up below  hello all quiet jake  there were footsteps in the snow outside and when the sentry answered the words just reached those who listened in the room  i had a kind of notion i saw something moving in the bluff but i couldnt be quite sure he said there was a door or window banged up there on the verandah a while ago but that must have been done by one of the women in the house  grant rose and drew back the curtain when after a patter of footsteps the voices commenced again  somebody has come in straight from the bluff said one of the men you can see where he has been but im blamed if i can figure where he went to unless it was up the post into the verandah and he couldnt have done that without miss torrance hearing him ill stop right here any way and i wish my two hours were up  im that stiff i can scarcely move said the man relieved and there was silence in the room until hetty turned to the others in dismay  he is going to stay there two hours and he would see us the moment we opened the window she said  grant quickly put on his big fur coat and unnoticed he fancied slipped one hand down on something that was girded on the belt beneath it  i must get away at oncethrough the house he said  hetty had however seen the swift motion of his hand  theres a man with a rifle in the hall she said shudderingly flo cant you think of something  flora schuyler looked at them quietly i fancy it would not be very difficult for mr grant to get away but the trouble is that nobody must know he has been near the place that is the one thing your father could not forgive hetty  hetty turned her head a little but grant nodded had it been otherwise i should have gone an hour ago he said  well said flora schuyler with a curious look in her face while i fancy we can get you away unnoticed if anybody did see you it neednt appear quite certain that it was any affair with hetty that brought you  no said hetty very sharply what do you mean flo  miss schuyler smiled a little and looked grant in the eyes what would appear base treachery in hettys case would be less astonishing in me mr grant you must not run risks again to talk to me but since you have done it i must see you through you are sure there is only one cowboy in the hall hetty  hetty turned and looked at them flora schuyler was smiling bravely the man standing still with grave astonishment in his eyes  no she said with quick incisiveness i cant let you flo  i dont think i asked your permission said miss schuyler could you explain this to your father hetty i believe he would not be angry with me adventurous gallantry is i understand quite approved of on the prairie call your maid mr grant will you come with me  for several seconds hetty stood silent recognizing that what torrance might smile at in his guest would appear almost a crime in his daughter but still horribly unwilling then as flora schuyler with a halfimpatient gesture signed to grant she touched a little gong and a few moments later her maid met them in the corridor the girl stopped suddenly gasping a little as she stared at grant until hetty grasped her arm nipping it cruelly  if you scream or do anything silly you will be ever so sorry she said go down into the hall and talk to jo keep him where the stove is with his back to the door  but how am i to do it the girl asked  take him something to eat miss schuyler said impatiently any way it should not be hard to fool himi have seen him looking at you now i wonder if that grey dress of mine would fit youi have scarcely had it on but its a little too tight for me  the girls eyes glistened she moved swiftly down the corridor flora schuyler laughed and grant looked away  larry said hetty it isnt just what one would likebut i am afraid it is necessary  five minutes later hetty moved across the hall making a little noise so that the cowboy who stood near the other end of it with the maid close by him should notice her she softly opened the outer door and then came back and signed to grant and flora schuyler who stood waiting in the corridor  no he said and the lamplight showed a darker hue than the bronze of frost and sun in his face miss schuyler i have never felt quite so mean before and you will leave the rest to me  it seems to me she said coolly that what you feel does not count for much just now you have to do what is best for everybody stoop as low as you can  she stretched out her hand with a little imperious gesture and laid it on his arm drawing herself up to her full height as she stood between him and the light they moved forward together and hetty closed her hand as she watched them pass into the hall the end was dim and shadowy for the one big lamp that was lighted stood some distance away by the stove where the man on watch was talking to the maid hetty realized that the girl was playing her part well as she saw her make a swift step backwards and heard the mans low laugh  flora schuyler and grant were not far from the door now the girl walking close to her companion in another moment they would have passed out of sight into the shadow but while hetty felt her fingers trembling the man on watch perhaps hearing their footsteps turned round  hallo he said it seems kind of cold what can miss schuyler want with opening the door is that miss torrance behind her  he moved forward a pace apparently not looking where he was going but towards the door and might have moved further but that the maid swiftly stretched out one foot and a chair with the tray laid on it went over with a crash  now theres going to be trouble see what youve done she said  the man stopped staring at the wreck upon the floor  well he said im blamed if i touched the thing what made it fall over any way  pick them up the girl said sharply you dont want to make trouble for me  he stooped and hetty gasped with relief as she saw him carefully scraping some dainty from the floor for just then one of the two figures slipped away from the other and there was a sound that might have been made by a softly closing door the cowboy looked up quickly and saw miss torrance and miss schuyler standing close together then stood up as they came towards him hetty paused and surveyed the overturned crockery and then though her heart was throbbing painfully gave the man a glance of ironical inquiry he looked at the maid as if for inspiration but she stood meekly still the picture of bashful confusion  im quite sorry miss torrance he said the concerned thing went over  hetty laughed well she said its a very cold night and lou can get you some more supper she is however not to stay here a minute after she has given it you  she went out with miss schuyler and the two stood very silent by a window in the corridor one of them fancied she saw a shadowy object slip round the corner of a barn but could not be sure and for five very long minutes they stared at the faintly shining snow nothing moved upon it and save for the maids voice in the hall the great building was very still hetty touched miss schuylers arm  he has got away she said come back with me i dont feel like standing up any longer  they sat down limply when they returned to the little room and though miss schuyler did not meet her companions gaze there was something that did not seem to please the latter in her face  flo she said one could almost fancy you felt it as much as i did it was awfully nice of you  miss schuyler smiled though there was a tension in her voice of course i felt it she said hetty id watch that maid of yours shes too clever  hetty said nothing for a moment then suddenly crossing the room she stooped down and kissed miss schuyler  i have never met any one who would do as much for me as you would flo she said i dont think there is anything that could come between us  there was silence for another moment and during it miss schuyler looked steadily into hettys eyes no she said although you do not seem quite sure i dont think there is  it was early the next morning when christopher allonby arrived at the range he smiled as he glanced at the packet hetty handed him  i have never seen your father anything but precise he said  has anything led you to fancy that he has changed asked hetty  allonby laughed as he held out the packet the envelope is all creased and crumpled it might have been carried round for ever so long in somebodys pocket now i know you dont smoke hetty  there is no reason why i should not but as it happens i dont said miss torrance  then the packet has a most curious cigarlike smell said allonby smiling now i dont think mr torrance carries loose cigars and letters about with him together i wonder what deduction one could make from this  hetty glanced at miss schuyler you could never make the right one chris she said  allonby said nothing further and went out with the letter a day or two later he handed it to the sheriff  i guess you know whats inside it said the latter  yes said the lad i want to see you count them now  the sheriff glanced at him sharply took out a roll of bills and flicked them over  yes he said thats quite right but one piece of what i have to do is going to be difficult  which said allonby  well said the sheriff i guess you know i mean the getting hold of larry     xvii  larrys peril   one afternoon several days later christopher allonby drove over to cedar range and though he endeavoured to hide his feelings was evidently disconcerted when he discovered that miss schuyler and hetty were alone torrance had affairs of moment on hand just then and was absent from cedar range frequently  one could almost have fancied you were not pleased to see us and would sooner have talked to mr torrance said miss schuyler  the lad glanced at her reproachfully  hetty knows how diffident i am but it seems to me a lady with your observation should have seen the gratification i did not venture to express  it was not remarkably evident said miss schuyler in fact when you heard mr torrance was not here i fancied i saw something else  i was thinking said allonby wondering how i could be honest and at the same time complimentary to everybody it was quite difficult people like me generally think of the right thing afterwards you see  hetty shook her head sit down and dont talk nonsense chris she said you shouldnt think too much when youre not accustomed to it it isnt wise what brought you  i had a message for your father said the lad and flora schuyler fancied she saw once more the signs of embarrassment in his face  then said hetty you can tell it me  theres a good deal of it and its just a little confusing said allonby  flora schuyler glanced at hetty and then smiled at the lad that is certainly not complimentary she said dont you think hetty and i could remember anything that you can  allonby laughed of course you could but i had my instructions i was told to give mr torrance the message as soon as i could without troubling anybody  then it is of moment  yes that is we want him to know though theres really nothing in it that need worry anybody  then it is unfortunate that my father is away said hetty  allonby sat silent a moment or two apparently reflecting and then looked up suddenly as though he had found the solution of the difficulty  i could write him  hetty laughed that was an inspiration you can be positively brilliant chris you will find paper and special envelopes in the office as well as a big stick of sealingwax  allonby who appeared unable to find a neat rejoinder went out and when he left flora schuyler smiled as she saw the carefully fastened envelope lying on torrances desk as well as something else torrance was fastidiously neat and the blotting pad from which the soiled sheets had been removed bore the impress of christopher allonbys big legible writing it was however a little blurred and miss schuyler who had her scruples made no attempt to read it then it was the next afternoon and torrance had not yet returned when a mounted man rode up to the range and was shown into the room where the girls sat together  mr clavering will be kind of sorry mr torrance wasnt here but he has got it fixed quite straight he said  what has he fixed said hetty  well said the man your father knows and i dont though ive a kind of notion we are after one of the homesteadboys any way what i had to tell him was this he could ride over to the cedar bluff at about six this evening with two or three of the boys if it suited him but if it didnt mr clavering would put the thing through  hetty asked one or two leading questions but the man had evidently nothing more to tell and when he went out the two girls looked at one another in silence hettys eyes were anxious and her face more colourless than usual  flo she said sharply are we thinking the same thing  i dont know said miss schuyler you have not told me your notions yet still this is clear to both of us mr clavering expects to meet somebody at the cedar bluff and your father is to bring two or three men with him the question is what could they be wanted for  no said hetty with a little quiver in her voice it is who they expect to meet you know what day this is  wednesday  once more there was silence for a few seconds but the thoughts of the two girls were unconcealed now and when she spoke hetty closed her hand  think flo there must be no uncertainty miss schuyler slipped out of the room and when she came back she brought an envelope splashed with red wax on a blottingpad  theres the key all is fairin war she said  a pink tinge crept into hettys cheeks and a sparkle into her eyes as she looked at her companion  dont make me angry with you flo she said we cant read it  no said miss schuyler quietly holding up the pad now i think we can this is another manifestation of the superiority of the masculine mind give me your handglass hetty  of course said hetty with a little gasp stillits horribly mean  there was a slightly contemptuous hardness in flora schuylers eyes if you let the man who rides by the bluff on wednesdays fall into claverings hands it would be meaner still  the next moment hetty was out of the room and miss schuyler sat down with a face that had grown suddenly weary but it betrayed nothing when hetty came back with the glass and when she held up the blotter in hands that were perfectly steady they read  i have fixed it with the sheriff claverings boys had as you guessed been watching for larry on the wrong day but now we have found out it is wednesday well make sure of him if you care to come around to the bluff about six that night you will probably see us seize him but if you would sooner stand out in this case it wouldnt count we dont expect any difficulty  hetty flushed crimson flo she said it was the letter arranging his own arrest he brought me back  that is not the point said miss schuyler sharply what are you going to do  hetty laughed mockingly you and i are going to drive over to the newcombes and stay the night you get nervous when my father is away but we are not going there quite straight and you had better put your warmest things on  an hour later two of the best horses in torrances stable drew the lightest sleigh up to the door and miss schuyler turned with a smile to the remonstrating housekeeper  nothing would induce me to stay here another night when mr torrance was away she said you can tell him that if he is vexed with hetty and you neednt worry we will be safe at mrs newcombes before an hour is over  the housekeeper shook her head i guess not its a league round by the bridge and you couldnt find the other trail in the dark  miss schuyler laughed then look at the time and well let you know when we get there she said  hetty whipped the team and with a whirling of dusty snow beneath the runners they swept away both sat silent until the beat of hoofs rang amidst the trees as they swept through the gloom of the big bluff at a gallop and hetty laughed excitedly  hold fast flo you did that very well but we have our alibi to prove and are not going near the bridge she said  she flicked the horses and the trees swept away behind them and the long white levels rolled back faster yet to the drumming hoofs the rush of cold wind stung miss schuylers face like the lash of a whip her eyes grew hazy and she held the furs about her as she swayed with the lurching of the sleigh darkness was closing in when they came to the forking of the trail and with a little cry of warning hetty lashed the team the lurches grew sharper and miss schuyler gasped now and then as she felt the sleigh swing rocking down a long declivity scattered birches raced up out of it and the hammering beat of hoofs swelled into a roar as it rolled along a thicker belt of trees  they rose higher and higher a dusky wall athwart the way and miss schuyler felt for a better hold for her feet and grasped the big strapped robe as she looked in vain for any opening that team had done nothing for more than a week and there was no stinting of oats and maize at cedar hetty however did not attempt to hold them but sat swaying to the jolting leaning forward as the shadowy barrier rushed up towards them until before she quite realized how they got there miss schuyler found herself hurled forward down what appeared to be a steadily sloping tunnel dim trees swept by and drooping boughs lashed at her now and then there was a sharp crackling or a sickening lurch and still they sped on furiously until a faint white shining appeared ahead  what is it she gasped  the river said hetty hold fast theres a piece like a tobogganleap quite near  she flung herself backwards as the lacelike birch twigs smote her furs and when one of the horses stumbled miss schuyler with difficulty stifled a cry the beast however picked up its stride again there was a lurch and the rocking sleigh appeared to leap clear of the snow a crash followed and they were flying out of the shadow again across a strip of faintly shining plain with another belt of dusky trees rolling back towards them beyond them low in the soft indigo a pale star was shining hetty glanced at it as she shook the reins and once more something in her laugh stirred miss schuyler  i know when that star comes out she said if larrys only there we can warn him and make our ride on time  in another minute they were in among the trees and hetty springing down plodded through the loose snow at the horses heads urging them with hand and voice up the incline which wound tortuously into the darkness now and then one of them stumbled and there was a great trampling of hoofs but the girls mittened hand never loosed its grasp and it was with a little breathless run she clutched the sleigh and swung herself in when the team swept out on the level again still at least a minute had passed before she had the horses in hand the trail forked again somewhere in the dimness they were flashing through and it was difficult to see the dusky smear at all  a lurch that flung miss schuyler against her showed that hetty had found the turning and a little later with a struggle she checked the team and they slid behind one of the low rolling rises that seamed the prairie here and there there was no wind in the hollow behind it and a great stillness under the high vault of blue studded with twinkling stars the dim whiteness of a long ridge cut sharply against it and the pale colouring and frosty glitter conveyed the suggestion of pitiless cold flora schuyler shivered and drew the furs closer round her  is this the place she asked  yes said hetty with a little gasp if we dont meet him here he will have passed or gone by the other trail and it will be too late to stop him can you hear anything flo  miss schuyler strained her ears but though the horses were walking now she could hear nothing the deep silence round them was emphasized by the soft trample of the hoofs and thin jingle of steel that seemed unreal and out of place there in the wilderness of snow and stars  no she said in a strained voice i can hear nothing at all it almost makes one afraid to listen  they drove slowly for a minute or two and then hetty pulled up the team i cant go on and it is worse to stand still she said flo if he didnt stopand he wouldntthey would shoot him he must be coming listen theres a horrible buzzing in my earsi cant hear at all  miss schuyler listened for what appeared an interminable time and wondered afterwards that she had borne the tension without a sign the great stillness grew overwhelming now the team had stopped and there was that in the utter cold and sense of desolation that weighed her courage down she felt her insignificance in the face of that vast emptiness and destroying frost and wondered at the rashness of herself and hetty and larry grant who had ventured to believe they could make any change in the great inexorable scheme of which everything that was to be was part miss schuyler was not fanciful but during the last hour she had borne a heavy strain and the deathly stillness of the northwestern waste under the arctic frost is apt to leave its impress on the most unimaginative  suddenly very faint and far off a rhythmic throbbing crept out of the darkness and flora schuyler who fearing her ears had deceived her at first dared not speak felt her chilled blood stir when hetty flung back her head  flocant you hear it tell me  miss schuyler nodded for she could not trust her voice just then but the sound had grown louder while she listened and now it seemed flung back by the rise then she lost it altogether as hetty shook the reins and the sleigh went on again in a few minutes however there was an answer to the thud of hoofs and another soft drumming that came quivering through it sank and swelled again by and by a clear musical jingling broke in and at last when a moving object swung round a bend of the rise a voice that rang harsh and commanding reached them  pull right up there and wait until we see who you are it said  larry cried hetty and the second time her strained voice broke and died away larry  it was less than a minute later when a sleigh stopped close in front of them and leaving one man in it grant sprang stiffly down it took hetty a minute or two more to make her warning plain and miss schuyler found it necessary to put in a word of amplification occasionally then grant signed to the other man  will you drive miss schuyler slowly in the direction she was going breckenridge he said hetty i want to talk to you and cant keep you here  hetty was too cold to reflect and almost before she knew how he had accomplished it found herself in grants sleigh and the man piling the robes about her when he wheeled the horses she was only conscious that he was very close to her and that breckenridge and miss schuyler were driving slowly a little distance in front of them then glancing up as though under compulsion she saw that grant was looking down upon her  it is not what i meant to tell you but doesnt this remind you of old times hetty he said  i dont want to remember themand what have they to do with what concerns us now said the girl  there was a new note in the mans voice that was almost exultant in its quietness a good deal i think hetty if you hadnt driven so often beside me here would you have done what you have tonight  no said the girl tremulously  no grant said you have done a rash as well as a very generous thing  it was rash but what could i do we were as you remind me good friends once  yes he said i cant thank you hettythanks of any kind wouldnt be adequateand there is nothing else i can offer to show my gratitude because all i had was yours already you have known that a long while havent you  the girl looked away from him i was not good enough to understand its value at first and when i did i tried to make you take it back  i couldnt he said gently it was perhaps worth very little but it was all i had andsince that day by the riveri never asked for anything in return it was very hard not to now and then but i saw that you had only kindness to spare for me  then why do you talk of it again  i think said grant very quietly it is different now after tonight nothing can be quite the same again hetty dear if you had missed me and i had ridden on to the bridge  stop said the girl with a shiver i dare not think of it larry cant you see that just now you must not talk in that strain to me  but there is a difference and grant looked at her steadily  for a moment the girl returned his gaze her face showing very white in the faint light flung up by the snow but she sat very straight and still and the mans passion suddenly fell from him  yes she said softly there is i was only sure of it when i fancied i had missed you a few minutes ago but that cant affect us larry we can neither of us go back on those we belong to and i know how mean i was when i tried to tempt you you were staunch and if i were less so you would not respect me  grant sighed you still believe your father right  yes said hetty i must hope so and if he is wrong i still belong to him  but you can believe that i am right too  yes said hetty simply i am at least certain you think you are still it may be a long and bitter while before we see this trouble through i have done too much tonightthat is had it been for anyone but youand you will not make my duty too hard for me  larrys pulses were throbbing furiously but he had many times already checked the passionate outbreak that he knew would have banished any passing tenderness the girl had for him  no my dear he said but the trouble cant last for ever and when it is over you will come to me i have been waitingeven when i felt it was hopelessyear after year for you  hetty smiled gravely whether i shall ever be able to do that larry neither you nor i can tell but at least i shall never listen to anyone else that is all i can promise and we must go on each of us doing what is put before us and hoping for the best  larry swept off his fur cap and stooping kissed her on the cheek it is the first time hetty i will wait patiently for the next but i shall see you now and then  the girl showed as little sign of resentment as she did of passion if i meet you but that must come by chance she said i want you to think the best of me and if the time should come i know i would be proud of you you have never done a mean thing since i knew you larry and that means a good deal now  grant pulled the team up in silence and called to breckenridge who checked his horses and getting down looked straight in front of him as his comrade handed hetty into her sleigh then they stood still saying nothing while the team swept away  hetty was also silent though she drove furiously and flora schuyler did not consider it advisable to ask any questions while the rush of icy wind and rocking of the sleigh afforded scanty opportunity for conversation she was also very cold and greatly relieved when a blink of light rose out of the snow five minutes later somebody handed her out of the sleigh and she saw a man glance at the team  you have been sending them along was it you or hetty who drove miss schuyler he said  flora schuyler laughed hetty of course but i want you to remember when we came in she said mentioning when they left cedar i told mrs ashley we would get here inside an hour and she wouldnt believe me  if anyone wants to know when you came in send them to me said the man there are not many horses that could have made it in the time     xviii  a futile pursuit   hettys sleigh was sliding a dim moving shadow round a bend in the rise when breckenridge touched his comrade who stood gazing silently across the prairie  its abominably cold larry he said with a shiver hadnt we better get on  grant said nothing as he took his place on the drivingseat and the team had plodded slowly along the trail for at least five minutes before he spoke  you heard what miss torrance told me he said  yes breckenridge said i notice however we are still heading for the bridge cant you cross the ice larry  if i wanted to i fancy i could  then why dont you  grant laughed well he said theres only one trail through the bluff and its not the kind im fond of driving over in the dark  breckenridge twisted in his seat and looked at him pshaw he said it would be a good deal less risky than meeting the sheriff at the bridge you are not going to do anything senseless larry  no only what seems necessary  breckenridge considered now he said slowly i can guess what youre thinking and of course its commendable but one has to be reasonable is there anything that could excite the least suspicion that miss torrance warned you  there are two or three little facts that only need putting together  still if we called at mullers and drove home by the other trail it wouldnt astonish anybody  it would appear a little too much of a coincidence in connection with the fact that miss torrance and i were known to be good friends and the time she left cedar as the cattlemen have evidently found out i have crossed the bridge at about the same time every wednesday and two of the cowboys saw us near harpers  larry said breckenridge if you were merely one of the rest your intentions would no doubt become you but the point is that every homesteader round here is dependent on you if you went down the opposition to the cattlemen would collapse or there would be general anarchy and that is precisely why torrance and the sheriff are anxious to get their hands on you now doesnt it strike you that its your plain duty to keep clear of any unnecessary peril  grant shook his head no he said it seems to me that argument has quite frequently accounted for a good deal of meanness it is tolerably presumptuous for any man to consider himself indispensable  well said breckenridge divided between anger and approval i have found out already that its seldom any use trying to convince you but each time you made this round ive driven with you and its quite obvious that if one of us crossed the bridge it would suit the purpose now i dont think the sheriff could rake up very much against me  grant laid his hand on the lads shoulder im going to cross the bridge but i dont purpose that either of us should fall into the sheriffs clutches he said you saw what jardines glass had gone down to  breckenridge nodded it dropped like that before the last blizzard we had  grant turned and looked about him and breckenridge shivered as he followed his gaze they had driven out from behind the rise now and a bitter wind met them in the face there was not very much of it as yet but all feeling seemed to die out of the lads cheeks under it and it brought a little doleful moaning out of the darkness behind them stars shone frostily in the soft indigo but elsewhere a deepening obscurity was creeping up across the prairie and sky and snow were blurred and merged one into the other  theres one meaning to that said grant well have snow in an hour or two and when it comes its going to be difficult to see anything in the meanwhile well drive round by busbys and get our supper while the cowboys cool the man who hangs around a couple of hours doing nothing in a frost of this kind is not to be relied upon when hes wanted in a hurry  he flicked the horses and in half an hour the pair were sitting in a lonely loghouse beside a glowing stove while its owner prepared a meal two other men with bronzed faces sat close by and breckenridge fancied he had never seen his comrade so cheerful his cares seemed to have fallen from him his laugh had a pleasant ring and there was something in his eyes which had not been there for many weary months breckenridge wondered whether it could be due to anything miss torrance had said to him but kept his thoughts to himself for that was a subject upon which one could not ask questions  in the meanwhile clavering and the sheriff found the time pass much less pleasantlyon the bluff the wind that whistled through it grew colder as one by one the stars faded out and there was a mournful wailing amidst the trees now and then a shower of twigs came rattling down from branches dried to brittleness by the frost and the sheriff brushed them off disgustedly as huddling lower in the sleigh from which the horses had been taken out he packed the robes round him he had lived softly and it would have suited him considerably better to have spent that bitter evening in the warmth and security of claverings ranch  no sign of him yet he said when christopher allonby and clavering came up together larry will stay at home tonight he has considerably more sense than we seem to have  i have seen nothing said allonby who in the hope of restoring his circulation had walked up the trail still the night is getting thicker and nobody could make a sleigh out until it drove right up to him  if larry did come you could hear him said the sheriff  allonby lifted his hand and as if to supply the answer with a great thrashing of frostnipped twigs the birches roared about them the blast that lashed them also hurled the icy dust of snow into the sheriffs face  i dont know said the lad nobody could hear very much through that  ugh said the sheriff we will have a blizzard on us before long and government pay doesnt warrant one taking chances of that kind arent we playing a fools game clavering  clavering laughed somewhat unpleasantly there are other emoluments attached to your office which should cover a little inconvenience he said now i fancy i know larry grant better than the rest of you and it would take quite a largesized blizzard to keep him at home when he had anything to do once you put him out of the way it will make things a good deal more pleasant for everybody larry is the one man with any brains the homesteaders have in this part of the country and while they would make no show without him we can expect nothing but trouble while hes at liberty it seems to me that warrants our putting up with a little unpleasantness  quite improving said allonby who was not in the best of temper just then one could almost wonder if you had any personal grudge against the man clavering you are so astonishingly disinterested when you talk of him now if i didnt like a man id make an opportunity of telling him  clavering laughed youre young chris or you wouldnt worry about folks motives when their efforts suit you what are the men doing  freezing and grumbling said allonby theyve made up their minds to get larry this time or we wouldnt have kept them here its the horses im anxious about they seem to know what is coming and theyre going to give us trouble  a fools game repeated the sheriff with a shiver got any of those cigars with you clavering if im to stay here i have to smoke  clavering threw him the case and turned away with allonby they went down through the bluff together and stood a few moments looking up the trail it led downwards towards them a streak of faintly shining whiteness through the gloom of the trees and the wind that set the branches thrashing whirled powdery snow into their faces though whether this came down from the heavens or was uplifted from the frozen soil they did not know with eyes dimmed and tingling cheeks they moved back again amidst the birches but even there it was bitterly cold and allonby was glad to turn his face from the wind a moment as they stopped to glance at the tethered horses they were stamping impatiently while the man on watch who would have patted one of them sprang backwards when the beast lashed out at him  if larry doesnt come soon i guess were going to find it hard to keep them here he said theyre most pulling the branches theyre hitched to off the trees  allonby nodded larry would be flattered if he knew the trouble you and i were taking over him clavering he said its also the first time ive seen you worry much about this kind of thing  what kind of thing  citizens duty i think thats the way you put it  clavering laughed if you want to be unpleasant chris cant you try a different line that ones played out its too cold to quarrel  i dont feel pleasant said allonby in fact i dont like this thing any way before larry got stuck with his notions he was a friend of mine  if the boys dont get too cold to shoot its quite likely he will be nobodys friend tomorrow said clavering cruelly well go round and look at them  they went back into the trail once more and the icy gusts struck through them as they plodded up it but they found no man keeping watch beside it as there should have been the cowboys had drawn back for shelter among the trees and clavering who found them stamping and shivering had some difficulty in getting them to their posts again they had been there two hours and the cold was almost insupportable  i guess its no use said allonby as soon as we have gone on every boy will be back behind his tree and i dont know that anybody could blame them any way im most too cold for talking  they went back together and while the cowboys who did as allonby had predicted slowly froze among the trees rolled themselves in the sleighrobes and huddled together it was blowing strongly now and a numbing drowsiness had to be grappled with as the warmth died out of them at last when a few feathery flakes came floating down the sheriff shook himself with a sleepy groan  there is not a man living who could keep me here more than another quarter of an hour he said are the boys on the lookout by the trail allonby  they were said the lad drowsily i dont know if theyre there now and it isnt likely clavering can go and make sure if he likes to but if anyone wants me to get up he will have to lift me  neither clavering nor the sheriff appeared disposed to move and it was evident that both had abandoned all hope of seeing larry grant that night ten minutes that seemed interminable passed and the white flakes that whirled about them grew thicker between the gusts and came down in a bewildering rush the sheriff shook the furs off him and stood up with a groan  tell them to bring the horses i have had quite enough he said  allonby staggered to his feet and reeled into the wood there was a hoarse shouting and a trampling of hoofs that was drowned in a roar of wind and when that slackened a moment a faint cry went up  hallo said the sheriff hes coming  then nobody quite remembered what he did here and there a man struggled with a plunging horse in the darkness of the wood and one or two blundered into each other and fell against the trunks as they ran on foot they were dazed with cold and the snow that seemed to cut their cheeks was in their eyes  allonby however saw that clavering was mounted and the horse he rode apparently going round and round with him while by and by he found himself in the saddle he was leaning low over the horses neck with one moccasined foot in the stirrup and the other hanging loose while the branches lashed at him when something dark and shapeless came flying down the trail  he heard a hoarse shout and a rifle flashed but the wind drowned the sound and before he was in the trail the sleigh which was what he supposed the thing to be had flashed by one cannot handily fit spurs to moccasins and as his hands were almost useless it was some time before he induced the horse which desired to go home uphill to take the opposite direction then he was off at a gallop with a man whom he supposed to be clavering in front of him and the sheriff who seemed to be shouting instructions at his side allonby did not think that anybody heard them but that was of no great moment to him then for the trail was narrow and slippery here and there and he was chiefly concerned with the necessity of keeping clear of his companion he could not see the sleigh now and scarcely fancied that anybody else did but he could hear the beat of hoofs in front of him when the wind sank a trifle and rode on furiously downhill at a gallop the horse had apparently yielded to its terror of the storm and allonby had more than a suspicion that had he wanted to he could neither have turned it nor pulled it up  clavering still held in front of him but the sheriff was dropping back a little and the lad did not know whether any of the rest were following he was however certain that barring a fall a mounted man could overtake a sleigh and that the up grade beyond the bridge would tell on the beasts that dragged a weight behind them so while the snow whirled past him and the dim trees flashed by he urged on the beast until he heard the bridge rattle under him and felt the pace slackenthe trail had begun to lead steeply up out of the hollow  the horse was flagging a little by the time they reached the crest of the rise and for a few moments allonby saw nothing at all the roar of the trees deafened him and the wind drove the snow into his eyes then as he gasped and shook it from him when the gust had passed he dimly made out something that moved amidst the white haze and guessed that it was clavering if that were so he felt it was more than likely that the sleigh was close in front of him a few minutes later he had come up with the man whose greater weight was telling and while they rode stirrup to stirrup and neck by neck allonby fancied there was something dim and shadowy in front of them  clavering shouted as he dropped behind and allonby who failed to catch what he said was alone blinking at the filmy whiteness through which he had blurred glimpses of the object ahead now growing more distinct he could also when the wind allowed it hear the dull beat of hoofs how long it took him to overtake it he could never remember but at last the sleigh was very close to him and he shouted there was no answer but allonby who could scarcely hear his own voice did not consider this astonishing and tried again still no answer came back and coming up with the sleigh at every stride he dragged the butt of his sling rifle round and fumbled at the strap with a numbed and almost useless hand  he could see the back of the sleigh but nothing else and lurching perilously in the saddle he got the rifle in his hand but cold and stiffened as he was he dared not loose his grasp on the bridle and so with the butt at his hip he raced up level with the sleigh then the horse perhaps edged off the beaten trail into the snow outside it blundered in its stride and the rifle that fell as the lad swayed was left behind he had both hands on the bridle the next moment and leaning down sideways fancied there was nobody in the sleigh it took him a second or two to make quite sure of it and at least a minute more before he brought the horse to a standstill in the trail by that time the sleigh had swept on into the sliding whiteness wheeling his horse clavering rode out of the snow and pulled up in evident astonishment  have you let him get away he gasped  he wasnt there said allonby  not there i saw him and another man when they drove past us in the bluff  well said allonby im quite certain theres nobody in that sleigh now  the wind that roared about them cut short the colloquy and a minute or two later allonby became sensible that clavering was speaking again  larry and the other man must have dropped into the soft snow when the team slowed up on the up grade knowing the horses would go on until they reached their stable he said well theyll be away through the bluff now and a brigade of cavalry would scarcely find them on such a night in fact we will have to trust the beasts to take us home  just then the sheriff with one or two cowboys rode up and allonby who did not like the man laughed as he signed him to stop  you can go back and get your driving horses in we have been chasing a sleigh with no one in it he said larry has beaten us again     xix  torrance asks a question   there was but one lamp lighted in the hall at cedar range and that was turned low but there was light enough to satisfy clavering who stood beneath it with hettys maid close beside him and a little red leather case in his hand the girls eyes were eager but they were fixed upon the case and not the man who had seen the keenness in them and was not displeased clavering had met other women in whom cupidity was at least as strong as vanity  now i wonder if you can guess what is inside there and who it is for he said  the maid drew a trifle nearer stooping slightly over the mans hand and she probably knew that the trace of shyness which was not all assumed became her she was also distinctly conscious that the pose she fell into displayed effectively a prettily rounded figure  something for miss torrance she said  claverings laugh was as his companion noticed not quite spontaneous no he said i guess you know as well as i do that miss torrance would not take anything of this kind from me she has plenty of them already  the maid knew this was a fact for she had occasionally spent a delightful halfhour adorning herself with hettys jewellery  well she said with a little tremor of anticipation in her voice what is inside it  clavering laid the case in her hand it is yours he said just press that spring  it was done and she gasped as a gleam of gold and a coloured gleam met her eyes my she said theyre realand its for me  clavering smiled a little and taking her fingers lightly closed them on the case  of course he said well youre pleased with it  the sparkle in the girls eyes and the little flush in her face was plain enough but the mans soft laugh was perfectly genuine it was scarcely a gift he had made her but while he expected that the outlay upon the trinket would be repaid him he could be generous when it suited him and was quite aware that a less costly lure would have served his purpose equally he also knew when it was advisable to offer something more tasteful than the obtrusive dollar  oh said the girl its just lovely  clavering who had discretion did not look round but though he kept his dark eyes on his companions face he listened carefully he could hear the wind outside and the crackle of the stove but nothing else and knew that the footsteps of anyone approaching would ring tolerably distinctly down the corridor behind the hall he also remembered that the big door nearest them was shut  well he said it wouldnt do to put anything that wasnt pretty on a neck like that and i wonder if you would let me fix it  the girl made no protest but though she saw the admiration in the mans dark eyes as she covertly looked up it would have pleased her better had he been a trifle more clumsy his words and glances were usually bold enough but as he clasped the little brooch on his fingers were almost irritatingly deft and steady men she knew did not make fools of themselves from a purely artistic appreciation of feminine comeliness  now she said slipping away from him with a blush i wonder what you expect for this  claverings eyebrows went up and there was a faint assumption of haughtiness in his face which became it  only the pleasure of seeing it where it is its a gift he said  well said the girl that was very kind of you but youre quite sure you never gave miss torrance anything of this kind  no i think i told you so  the maid was not convinced but she said looking at him sideways i thought you did she has a little gold chain very thin and not like the things they make nowand just lately she is always wearing it  i never saw it  the girl smiled significantly i guess thats not astonishing she wears it low down on her neckand the curious thing is that it lay by and she never looked at it for ever so long  clavering felt that the dollars the trinket had cost him had not been wasted but though he concealed his disgust tolerably well the maid noticed it she had however vague ambitions and a scarcely warranted conviction that given a fair field she could prove herself a match for her mistress  then if it wasnt you it must have been the other man she said  the other man  yes with a laugh the one i took the wallet with the dollars to  clavering hoped he had not betrayed his astonishment but she had seen the momentary flash in his eyes and the involuntary closing of his hand  now he said firmly that cant be quite straight and one should be very careful about saying that kind of thing  the girl looked at him steadily still i took a wallet with dollar bills in it to mr grantat night i met him on the bluff and miss torrance sent them him  it was possible that clavering would have heard more had he followed the line of conduct he had adopted at first but he stood thoughtfully silent instead which did not by any means please his companion as well he had a vague notion that this was a mistake but the anger he did not show was too strong for him then he fancied he heard a footstep on the stairway and laughed in a somewhat strained fashion  well we neednt worry about that and i guess if i stay here any longer mr torrance will be wondering where i have gone he said  he went out by one door and a few moments later miss schuyler came in by another she swept a hasty glance round the hall most of which was in the shadow and her eyes caught the faint sparkle at the maids neck the next moment the girl moved back out of the light but miss schuyler saw her hand go up and fancied there was something in it when it came down again she had also heard a mans footstep and could put two and two together  miss torrance wants the silk it was here but i dont see it she said who went out a moment or two ago  the girl opened a bureau mr clavering he left his cigarcase when he first came in  she took out a piece of folded silk and miss schuyler noticed the fashion in which she held it  it is the lighter shade we want but the other piece is very like it unroll it so i can see it she said  the maid seemed to find this somewhat difficult but miss schuyler had seen a strip of red leather between the fingers of one hand and understanding why it was so went out thoughtfully she knew the appearance of a jewelcase tolerably well and had more than a suspicion as to whom the girl had obtained it from miss schuyler who would not have believed claverings assertion about the trinket had she heard it wondered what he expected in exchange for it which perhaps accounted for the fact that she contrived to overtake him in the corridor at the head of the stairs  when you left hetty and me alone we understood it was because mr torrance was waiting for you she said  yes said clavering smiling it is scarcely necessary to explain that if he hadnt been i would not have gone i fancied he was in the hall  flora schuyler nodded as though she believed him but she determined to leave no room for doubt he is in his office she said have you the deerskin cigarcase you showed us with you you will remember i was interested in the indian embroidery  im sorry i havent said clavering torrances cigars are better than mine so i usually leave mine at home but ill bring the case next time and if you would like to copy it i could get you a piece of the dressed hide from one of the blackfeet  he turned away and flora schuyler decided not to tell hetty what she had heardhetty was a little impulsive occasionallybut it seemed to miss schuyler that it would be wise to watch her maid and clavering closely  in the meantime the man walked away towards torrances office considering what the maid had told him he had found it difficult to credit but her manner had convinced him and he realized that he could not afford the delay he had hitherto considered advisable a young woman he reflected would scarcely send a wallet of dollars at night to a man whose plans were opposed to her fathers without a strong motive and the fact that hetty wore a chain hidden about her neck had its meaning he had like most of his neighbours laughed at larrys hopeless devotion but he had seen similar cases in which the lady at last relented and while he knew hettys loyalty to her own people and scarcely thought that she had more than a faint tolerant tenderness for larry it appeared eminently desirable to prevent anything of that kind happening torrance who was sitting smoking glanced at him impatiently when he went in  you have been a long while he said  i have a sufficient excuse sir said clavering  well said torrance drily they are quite clever girls but i have found myself wishing lately they were a long way from here that however is not what i want to talk about apparently none of us can get hold of larry  it is not for the want of effort there are few things that would please me better  torrance glanced at clavering sharply no i fancied once or twice you had a score of your own against him in fact i heard allonby say something of the same kind too  chris is a trifle officious said clavering any way its quite evident that we shall scarcely hold the homesteadboys back until we get our thumb on larry  how are we going to do it he has come out ahead of us so far  we took the wrong way said clavering now larry as you know puts all his dealings through the tillotson company tillotson as i found out in chicago has a free hand to buy stocks or produce with his balances and larry who does not seem to bank his dollars draws on him its not an unusual thing well ive been writing to folks in chicago and they tell me tillotson is in quite a tight place since the upward move in lard it appears he has been selling right along for a fall  torrance looked thoughtful tillotson is a straight man but ive had a notion he has been financing some of the homesteadboys he handles all larrys dollars  clavering nodded he put them into lard now the brand company hold tillotsons biggest contract and if it suited them they could break him i dont think they want to tillotson is a kind of useful man to them  torrance brought his fist down on the table well he said grimly we have a stronger pull than tillotson most of the business in this country goes to them and if he thought it worth while brand would sell all his relations up tomorrow ill go right through to chicago and fix the thing  clavering smiled if you can manage it you will cut off larrys supplies  then said torrance ill start tomorrow still i dont want to leave the girls here and it would suit me if you could drive them over to allonbys i dont mind admitting that they have given me a good deal of anxiety though theyve made things pleasant too and ive most got afraid of wondering what cedar will feel like when they go away  will miss torrance go away  she will said torrance with a little sigh though there was pride in his eyes when the troubles overbut not before she came home to see the old man through  clavering seized the opportunity did you ever contemplate the possibility of miss torrance marrying anybody here  i have a notion that theres nobody good enough torrance said quickly  clavering nodded though he felt the old mans eyes upon him and did not relish the implication still i fancy the same difficulty would be met with anywhere else and that encourages me to ask if you would have any insuperable objections to myself  torrance looked at him steadily i have been expecting this once i thought it was miss schuyler but she does not like you  i am sorry and clavering wondered whether his host was right though the latter fact is not of any great moment i have long had a sincere respect for miss torrance but i am afraid it would be difficult to tell you all i think of her  the point said torrance somewhat grimly is what she thinks of you  i dont know it did not seem quite fitting to ask her until i had spoken to you  torrance said nothing for almost a minute and to clavering the silence became almost intolerable the old mans forehead was wrinkled and he stared at the wall in front of him with vacant eyes then he spoke very slowly  that was the square thing and i have to thank you for twenty years now i have worked and saved for hettythat she might have the things her mother longed for and never got and ive never been sorrythe girl is good all through it is natural that she should marry and even so far as the dollars go she will bring as much to her husband as he can give her and if its needful more but there are one or two points about you i dont quite like  the old mans voice vibrated and his face grew softer and the respect that clavering showed when he answered was not all assumed  i know my own unworthiness sir but i think any passing follies i may have indulged in are well behind me now  well said torrance drily its quite hard to shake some tastes and habits off and one or two of them have a trick of hanging on to the man who thinks he has done with them now i want a straight answer do you know any special reason why it would not be the square thing for you to marry my daughter  a faint colour crept into claverings face i know a good many which would make the bargain unfair to her he said but there are very few men in this country who would be good enough for her  torrance checked him with a lifted hand that is not what i mean it is fortunate for most of us that women of her kind believe the best of us and can forgive a good deal i am not speaking generally do you know any special reasonone that may make trouble for both of you its a plain question and you understand it if you do well go into the thing right now and then if it can be got over never mention it again  clavering sat silent knowing well that delay might be fatal and yet held still by something he had heard in the old mans voice and seen in his eyes however he had succeeded in signally defeating one blackmailer  sir he said very slowly i know of no reason now  torrance had not moved his eyes from him then he said i can only take your word you are one of us and understand the little things that please girls like hetty if she will take you you can count on my good will  clavering made a little gesture of thanks i ask nothing more and may wait before i urge my suit but it seems only fair to tell you that my ranching has not been very profitable lately and my affairs  torrance cut him short in these things it is the man that counts the most and not the dollars you will not have to worry over that point now you have told me i can trust hetty to you  he said a little more on the same subject and then clavering went out with unpleasantly confused sensations through which a feeling of degradation came uppermost he had not led an exemplary life but pride had kept him clear of certain offences and he had as yet held his word sacred when put upon his honour it was some minutes before he ventured to join hetty and miss schuyler who he knew by the sound of the piano were in the hall  hetty sat with her fingers on the keyboard the soft light of the lamps in the sconces shining upon hervery pretty very dainty an unusual softness in the eyes she turned towards clavering  you went in to get ittouching the musicjust because you heard me say i would like those songs a four days ride and a blizzard raging on one of them she said  clavering looked at her gravely with something in his eyes that puzzled miss schuyler who had expected a wittily graceful speech  you are pleased with them he said  yes said the girl impulsively but i feel horribly mean because i sent you although of course i didnt mean to it was very kind of you but you must not do anything of that kind again  clavering who did not appear quite himself watched her turn over the music in silence for though the last words were spoken quietly there was he and miss schuyler fancied a definite purpose behind them  then you will sing one of them he said  hetty touched the keysthere was a difference in her when she sang for music was her passion and as the clear voice thrilled the two who listened a flush of exaltation that was almost spiritual crept into her face clavering set his lips and when the last notes sank into the stillness miss schuyler wondered what had brought the faint dampness to his forehead she did not know that all that was good in him had revolted against what he had done and meant to do just then and had almost gained the mastery unfortunately instead of letting hetty sing again and fix claverings halfformed resolution she allowed her distrust of him to find expression for capable young woman though she was flora schuyler sometimes blundered  the song was worth the effort she said mr clavering is however evidently willing to do a good deal to give folks pleasure  clavering glanced at her with a little smile folks that means more than one  yes it generally means at least two  hetty laughed as she looked round is there anybody else he has been giving music to  i fancy the question is unnecessary flora said he told us he came straight here and there is nobody but you and i at cedar he would be likely to bring anything to  of course not well i never worry over your oracular observations they generally mean nothing when you understand them said hetty  flora schuyler smiled maliciously at clavering she did not know that when a good deed hung in the balance she had by rousing his intolerance of opposition just tipped the beam     xx  hettys obstinacy   it was very cold the red sun hung low above the prairies western rim and clavering who sat behind hetty and miss schuyler in the lurching sleigh glanced over his shoulder anxiously  hadnt you better pull up and let me have the reins miss torrance he said  hetty laughed why she asked i havent seen the horse i could not drive  well said clavering drily this is the first time you have either seen or tried to drive badger and i not infrequently get out and lead the team down the slope in front of you when i cross the creek it has a very awkward bend in it  hetty looked about her and as it happened the glare of sunlight flung back from the snow was in her eyes still she could dimly see the trail dip over what seemed to be the edge of a gully close ahead and she knew the descent to the creek in its bottom was a trifle perilous she was however fearless and a trifle obstinate and clavering had unfortunately already ventured to give her what she considered quite unnecessary instructions as to the handling of the team there had also been an indefinite change in his attitude towards her during the last week or two which the girl without exactly knowing why resented and this appeared a fitting opportunity for checking any further presumption  you can get down now if you wish she said we will stop and pick you up when we reach the level again  clavering said nothing further for he knew that miss torrance was very like her father in some respects and hetty shook the reins the next minute they had swept over the brink and flora schuyler saw the trail dip steeply but slantwise to lessen the gradient to the frozen creek the sinking sun was hidden by the high bank now and the snow had faded to a cold bluewhiteness through which the trail ran a faint line of dusky grey it was difficult to distinguish at the pace the team were making and the ground dropped sharply on one side of it  let him have the reins hetty she said  unfortunately clavering who was a trifle nettled and knew that team especially the temper of badger the near horse better than hetty did laughed just then  hold fast miss schuyler and remember that if anything does happen the righthand side is the one to get out from he said  now said hetty im not going to forgive you that you sit quite still and well show him something flo  she touched the horses with the lash and badger flung up his head another moment and he and the other beast had broken into a gallop hetty threw herself backwards with both hands on the reins but no cry escaped her and clavering who had a suspicion that he could do no more than she was doing now even if he could get over the back of the seat in time which was out of the question set his lips as he watched the bank of snow the trail twisted round rush towards them the sleigh bounced beneath him in another second or two there was a stifled scream from flora schuyler and leaning over he tore the robe about the girls from its fastenings then there was a bewildering jolting and a crash and he was flung out head foremost into dusty snow  when he scrambled to his feet again hetty was sitting in the snow close by him and flora schuyler creeping out of a wreath of it on her hands and knees the sleigh lay on one side not far away with the badger rolling and kicking amidst a tangle of harness though the other horse was still upon its feet  clavering was pleased to find all his limbs intact and almost as gratified to see only indignant astonishment in hettys face she rose before he could help her and in another moment or two flora schuyler also stood upright clinging to his arm  no she said with a little gasp i dont think im killed though i felt quite sure of it at first now i only feel as though id been through an earthquake  hetty turned and looked at clavering with a little red spot in either cheek why dont you say something she asked are you waiting for me  i dont know that anything very appropriate occurs to me you know im devoutly thankful you have both escaped injury said the man who was more shaken than he cared to admit  then ill have to begin and hettys eyes sparkled it was my fault mr clavering and if it is any relief to you i feel most horribly ashamed of my obstinacy will that satisfy you  clavering turned his head away for he felt greatly inclined to laugh but he knew the torrance temper hetty had been very haughty during that drive but she had not appeared especially dignified when she sat blinking about her in the snow nor had miss schuyler and he felt that they realized it and in feminine fashion blamed him for being there it was miss schuyler who relieved the situation  hadnt you better do something for the horse it is apparently trying to hang itselfand i almost wish it would it deserves to succeed  clavering could have done very little by himself but in another minute hetty was kneeling on the horses head while at more than a little risk from the battering hoofs he loosed some of the harness then the badger was allowed to flounder to his feet and clavering proceeded to readjust his trappings a buckle had drawn however and a strap had burst  no said hetty sharply not that way dont you see youve got to lead the trace through it is most unfortunate larry isnt here  clavering glanced at miss schuyler and both of them laughed while hetty frowned  well she said he would have fixed the thing in half the time and we cant stay here for ever  clavering did what he could but repairing harness in the open under twenty or thirty degrees of frost is a difficult task for any man especially when he has no tools to work with and cannot remove his mittens and it was at least twenty minutes before he somewhat doubtfully announced that all was ready he handed miss schuyler into the sleigh and then passed the reins to hetty who stood with one foot on the step apparently waiting for something  i dont think he will run away again he said  the girl glanced at him sharply i am vexed with myself dont make me vexed with you she said  clavering said nothing but took the reins and they slid slowly down into the hollow and more slowly still across the frozen creek and up the opposite ascent after awhile hetty touched his shoulder  i really dont want to meddle but while caution is commendable it will be dark very soon she said  something has gone wrong clavering said gravely im afraid ill have to get down  he stood for several minutes looking at the frame of the sleigh and an indented line ploughed behind it in the snow and then quietly commenced to loose the horses  well said hetty sharply what are you going to do  take them out said clavering  why  clavering laughed they are not elephants and have been doing rather more than one could expect any horse to do it is really not my fault you know but one of the runners has broken and the piece sticks into the snow  then whatever are we to do  i am afraid you and miss schuyler will have to ride on to allonbys i can fix the furs so theyll make some kind of saddle and it cant be more than eight miles or so  miss schuyler almost screamed i cant she said  dont talk nonsense flo said hetty youll just have to  claverings fingers were very cold and the girls still colder before he had somehow girthed a rug about each of the horses and ruthlessly cut and knotted the reins the extemporized saddles did not look very secure but hetty lightly swung herself into one though miss schuyler found it difficult to repress a cry and was not sure that she quite succeeded when clavering lifted her to the other  im quite sure i shall fall off she said  hetty was evidently very much displeased at something for she seemed to forget clavering was there if you do ill never speak to you again she said you might have been fond of him flo there wasnt the least necessity to put your arm right around his neck  clavering wisely stooped to do something to one of his moccasins for he saw an ominous sparkle in miss schuylers eyes but he looked up prematurely and the smile was still upon his lips when he met hettys gaze  how are you going to get anywhere she asked  well said clavering it is quite a long while now since i was able to walk alone  hetty shook her bridle and the badger started at a trot but when miss schuyler followed clavering who fancied that her prediction would be fulfilled also set off at a run he was however not quite fast enough for when he reached her miss schuyler was sitting in the snow she appeared to be unpleasantly shaken and her lips were quivering clavering helped her to her feet and then caught the horse  the wretched thing turned round and slid me off she said when he came back with it pointing to the rug  clavering tugged at the extemporized girth i am afraid you can only try again i dont think it will slip now he said  miss schuyler who had evidently lost her nerve mounted with difficulty and after trotting for some minutes pulled up once more and was sitting still looking about her hopelessly when clavering rejoined her  i am very sorry but i really cant hold on she said  clavering glanced at the prairie and hetty looked at him nothing moved upon all the empty plain which was fading to a curious dusky blue darkness crept up across it from the east and a last faint patch of orange was dying out on its western rim while with the approaching night there came a stinging cold  it might be best if you rode on miss torrance and sent a sleigh back for us he said walk your horse miss schuyler and ill keep close beside you if you fell i could catch you  hettys face was anxious but she shook her head no it was my fault and i mean to see it through she said you couldnt keep catching her all the time you know im not made of eiderdown and shes a good deal heavier than me it really is a pity you cant ride flo  nevertheless said miss schuyler tartly i cantwithout a saddleand im quite thankful i cant drive  hetty said nothing and they went on in silence until when a dusky bluff appeared on the skyline clavering taking the bridle led miss schuylers horse into a forking trail  this is not the way to allonbys said hetty  no said clavering quietly im afraid you would be frozen before you got there the homesteadboys who chop their fuel in the bluff have however some kind of shelter and ill make you a big fire  but said hetty  clavering checked her with a gesture please let me fix this thing for you he said it is getting horribly cold already  they went on a trifle faster without another word and presently with crackle of dry twigs beneath them plodded into the bush dim trees flitted by them branches brushed them as they passed and the stillness and shadowiness affected miss schuyler uncomfortably she started with a cry when there was a sharp patter amidst the dusty snow but claverings hand was on the bridle as the horse snorting flung up its head  i think it was only a jackrabbit and i can see the shelter now he said  a few moments later he helped miss schuyler down and held out his hand to hetty who sprang stiffly to the ground then with numbed fingers he broke off and struck a sulphur match and the feeble flame showed the refuge to which he had brought them it was just high enough to stand in and had three sides and a roof of birch logs but the front was open and the soil inside it frozen hard as adamant an axe and a saw stood in a corner and there was a hearth heaped ready with kindling chips  if you will wait here ill try to get some wood he said  he went out and tethered the horses and when his footsteps died away miss schuyler shivering crept closer to hetty who flung an arm about her  its awful floand its my fault she said then she sighed it would all be so different if larry was only here  still said flora schuyler mr clavering has really behaved very well most men would have shown just a little temper  i almost wish he hadit would have been so much easier for me to have kept mine and overlooked it graciously flo i didnt mean to be disagreeable but its quite hard to be pleasant when one is in the wrong  it was some time before clavering came back with an armful of birch branches and a suspiciously reddened gash in one of his moccasinsfor an axe ground as the michigan man grinds it is a dangerous tool for anyone not trained to it to handle in the dark in ten minutes he had a great fire blazing and the shivering girls felt their spirits revive a little under the cheerful light and warmth then he made a seat of the branches close in to the hearth and glanced at them anxiously  if you keep throwing wood on and sit there with the furs wrapped round you you will be able to keep the cold out until i come back he said  until you come back said hetty checking a little cry of dismay where are you going  to bring a sleigh  but allonbys is nearly eight miles away you could not leave us here three hours  no said clavering gravely you would be very cold by then still you need not be anxious nothing can hurt you here and i will come or send somebody for you before long  hetty sat very still while he drew on the fur mittens he had removed to make the fire then she rose suddenly  no she said it was my faultand we cannot let you go  clavering smiled i am afraid your wishes wouldnt go quite as far in this case as they generally do with me you and miss schuyler cant stay here until i could get a sleigh from allonbys  he turned as he spoke and was almost out of the shanty before hetty stepping forward laid her hand upon his arm  now i know she said it is less than three miles to mullers but the homesteadboys would make you a prisoner if you went there cant you see that would be horrible for flo and me it was my wilfulness that made the trouble  clavering very gently shook off her grasp and miss schuyler almost admired him as he stood looking down upon her companion with the flickering firelight on his face it was a striking face and the smile in the dark eyes became it clavering had shaken off his furs and the closefitting jacket of dressed deerskin displayed his lean symmetry for he had swung round in the entrance to the shanty and the shadows were black behind him  i think the fault was mine i should not have been afraid of displeasing you which is what encourages me to be obstinate now he said one should never make wild guesses should they miss schuyler  he had gone before hetty could speak again and a few moments later the girls heard a thud of hoofs as a horse passed at a gallop through the wood they stood looking at each other until the sound died away and only a little doleful wind that sighed amidst the birches and the snapping of the fire disturbed the silence then hetty sat down and drew miss schuyler down beside her  flo she said with a little quiver in her voice what is the use of a girl like me i seem bound to make trouble for everybody  it is not an unusual complaint especially when one is as pretty as you are said miss schuyler though i must confess i dont quite understand what you are afraid of hetty  no said hetty you never do seem to understand anything flo if he goes to mullers the homesteadboys who are as fond of him as they are of poison might shoot him and he almost deserves it no of course after what he is doing for us i dont mean that it is the meanness that is in me makes me look for faults in everybody he was almost splendidand he has left his furs for usbut he maynt come back at all oh its horrible  hettys voice grew indistinct and flora schuyler drew the furs closer about them and slipped an arm round her waist she began to feel the cold again and the loneliness more while even when she closed her eyes she could not shut out the menacing darkness in front of her miss schuyler was from the cities and it was not her fault that while she possessed sufficient courage of a kind she shrank from the perils of the wilderness she would have found silence trying but the vague sounds outside to which she could attach no meaning were more difficult to bear so she started when a puff of wind set the birch twigs rattling or something stirred the withered leaves and once or twice a creaking branch sent a thrill of apprehension through her and she almost fancied that evil faces peered at her from the square gap of blackness now and then a wisp of pungent smoke curled up and filled her eyes and little by little she drew nearer to the fire with a physical craving for the warmth of it and an instinctive desire to be surrounded by its brightness until hetty shook her roughly by the arm  flo she said you are making me almost as silly as you are and that capoteits the prettiest i have seen you put onis burning sit still or ill pinch youhard  hettys grip had a salutary effect and miss schuyler shaking off her vague terrors smiled a trifle tremulously  i wish you would she said your fingers are real any way i cant help being foolish hettyand is the thing actually burning  hetty laughed i guessed that would rouse youbut it is she said i have made my mind up flo if he doesnt come in an hour or so well go to mullers too  miss schuyler was by no means sure that this would please her but she said nothing and once more there was a silence she found it difficult to bear  in the meanwhile clavering whose foot pained him was urging the badger to his utmost pace he rode without saddle or stirrups which however was no great handicap to anyone who had spent the time he had in the cattle country and though it was numbingly cold and he had left his furs behind him scarcely felt the frost for his brain was busy he knew hetty torrance and that what he had done would count for much with her but that was not what had prompted him to make the somewhat perilous venture free as he was in his gallantries he was not without the chivalrous daring of the south his fathers came from and hetty was of his own caste she at least would have been sure of deference from him and perhaps have had little cause for complaint had he married her of late the admiration he felt for her was becoming tinged with a genuine respect  he knew that the homesteaders who had very little cause to love him were in a somewhat dangerous mood just then but that was of no great moment to him he had a cynical contempt for them and a pride which would have made him feel degraded had he allowed any fear of what they might do to influence him he had also with less creditable motives found himself in difficult positions once or twice already and his quickly arrogant fearlessness had enabled him to retire from them without bodily hurt or loss of dignity  the lights of mullers homestead rose out of the prairie almost before he expected to see them and a few minutes later he rode at a gallop up to the door it opened before he swung himself down for the beat of hoofs had carried far and when he stood in the entrance slightly dazed by the warmth and light there was a murmur of wonder  clavering said somebody and a man he could not clearly see laid a hand on his shoulder  he shook the grasp off contemptuously moved forward a pace or two and then sat down blinking about him muller sat by the stove a big pipe in hand looking at him over his spectacles his daughter stood behind him knitting tranquilly though there was a shade more colour than usual in her cheeks and a big grimfaced man stood at the end of the room with one hand on a rifle that hung on the wall clavering instinctively glanced over his shoulder and saw that another man now stood with his back to the door  you have come alone asked the latter  oh yes said clavering unconcernedly you might put my horse in one of you if i could have helped it i would not have worried you but my sleigh got damaged and miss torrance and another lady are freezing in the bitter creek bluff and i know you dont hurt women  no said the man dropping his hand from the rifle with a little unpleasant laugh we havent got that far yet though your folks are starving them  well said clavering im going to ask you to send a sledge and drive them back to cedar or on to allonbys  the men exchanged glances its a trick said one  so said muller der ambuscade lotta you ride to fremont und larry bring i show you how when we have drubbles mit der franc tireurs we fix der thing  clavering exclaimed impatiently you have no time for fooling when there are two women freezing in the bluff would i have come here knowing you could do what you liked with me if i had meant any harm to you  thats sense any way said one of the men i guess if he was playing any trick one of us would be quite enough to get even with him youll take truscott with you muller and get out the bobsled  muller nodded gravely i go he said lotta you der big kettle fill before you ride for larry we der bobsled get ready  you are not going to be sorry said clavering this thing will pay you better than farming  the man by the door turned with a hard laugh well he said i guess wed feel mean for ever if we took a dollar from you  clavering ignored the speech do you want me he said glancing at muller  no said the man who now took down the rifle from the wall not just yet youre going to stop right where you are the boys can do without me and ill keep you company  ten minutes later the others drove away and with a significant gesture claverings companion laid the rifle across his knees     xxi  clavering appears ridiculous   there was silence in the loghouse when the men drove away and clavering who sat in a corner found the time pass heavily a clock ticked noisily upon the wall and the stove crackled when the draughts flowed in but this he felt only made the stillness more exasperating the big hardfaced bushman sat as motionless as a statue and almost as expressionless with a brown hand resting on the rifle across his knees in front of a row of shelves which held miss mullers crockery clavering felt his fingers quiver in a fit of anger as he watched the man but he shook it from him knowing that he would gain nothing by yielding to futile passion  i guess i can smoke he said flinging his cigarcase on the table take one if you feel like it  the swiftness with which the mans eyes followed the first move of his prisoners hand was significant but he shook his head deliberately  i dont know any reason why you shouldnt but you can keep your cigars for your friends he said  he drawled the words out but the vindictive dislike in his eyes made them very expressive and clavering who saw it felt that any attempt to gain his jailers goodwill would be a failure as though to give point to the speech the man took out a pipe and slowly filled it with tobacco from a little deerskin bag  what are you going to do with me asked clavering partly to hide his anger and partly because he was more than a little curious on the subject  well said the man reflectively i dont quite know keep you here until larry comes any way it wouldnt take long to fix it so youd be sorry you had worried poor folks if the boys would listen to me  this was even less encouraging but there were still points on which clavering desired enlightenment  will muller bring miss torrance and her companion here he asked  the bushman nodded i guess he will its quite a long way to allonbys and theyll be most frozen after waiting in the bluff now im not anxious for any more talk with you  a little flush crept into claverings forehead but it was not the mans contemptuous brusqueness which brought it there though that was not without its effect it was evident that the most he could hope for was larrys clemency and that would be difficult to tolerate but there was another ordeal before him hetty was also coming back and would see him a prisoner in the hands of the men he had looked down upon with ironical contempt had the contempt been assumed his position would have been less intolerable but it was not and the little delicately venomous jibes he seldom lost an opportunity of flinging at the homesteaders expressed no more than he felt and were now and then warranted  clavering of course knew that to pose as a prisoner as the result of his efforts on her behalf would stir hettys sympathy and his endurance of persecution at the hands of the rabble for his adherence to the principles he fancied she held would further raise him in her estimation but he had no desire to acquire her regard in that fashion he would have preferred to take the chances of a rifleshot for while he had few scruples he had been born with a pride which occasionally at least prevented his indulgence in petty knavery and crushing down his anger he set himself to consider by what means he could extricate himself  none however were very apparent the homesteader showed no sign of drowsiness or relaxed vigilance but sat tranquilly alert watching him through the curling smoke it was also some distance to the door which from where clavering sat appeared to be fastened and he knew the quick precision with which the bushman can swing up a rifle or if it suits him fire from the hip a dash for liberty could he fancied have only one result it was evident that he must wait  now waiting is difficult to most men and especially to those in whose veins there flows the hot southern blood and clavering felt the taste of the second excellent cigar grow bitter in his mouth he sat very still with halfclosed eyes and a little ironical smile upon his lips when his grim companion glanced at him in the meantime the stove crackled less noisily and the room grew steadily colder but clavering scarcely felt the chill even when the icy draughts whirled the cigarsmoke about him for he began to see that an opportunity would be made for him and waited strung up and intent when he thought he could do so unobserved he glanced at the clock whose fingers now moved with a distressful rapidity knowing that his chance would be gone if the bobsled arrived before the cold grew too great for his jailer  ten minutes dragged by then another five and still the man sat smoking tranquilly while clavering realized that allowing for all probable delays muller and miss torrance should arrive before the halfhour was up ten more minutes fled by and clavering quivering in an agony of impatience found it almost impossible to sit still but at last the bushman stood up and laid his rifle on the table  you will stop right where you are he said im going to put a few billets in the stove  clavering nodded for he dared not trust himself to speak and the man who took up an armful of the billets dropped a few of them through the open top of the stove one as it happened jammed inside it so that he could get no more in and he laid hold of an iron scraper to free it with he now stood with his back to clavering but the rifle still lay within his reach upon the table  clavering rose up and though his injured foot was painful moved forward a pace or two noiselessly in his soft moccasins a billet had rolled in his direction and swaying lithely from the waist with his eyes fixed upon the man he seized it the homesteader was stooping still and he made another pace crouching a trifle with every muscle hardening  then the man turned sharply and hurled the scraper straight at clavering it struck him on the face but he launched himself forward and while the homesteader grabbed at his rifle fell upon him he felt the thud of the billet upon something soft but the next moment it was torn from him the rifle fell with a clatter and he and the bushman reeled against the stove together then they fell against the shelves and with a crash they and the crockery went down upon the floor  clavering was supple and wiry and just then consumed with an almost insensate fury he came down uppermost but his adversarys leg was hooked round his knee and the grip of several very hard fingers unpleasantly impeded his respiration twice he struck savagely at a halfseen brown face but the grip did not relax and the knee he strove to extricate began to pain him horribly the rancher possessed no mean courage and a traditional belief in the prowess of his caste was famed for proficiency in most manly sports but that did not alter the fact that the other mans muscle hardened by long use of the axe was greater than his own and the stubborn courage which had upheld the homesteader in his struggle with adverse seasons and the encroaching forest was at least the equal of that born in clavering  so the positions were slowly reversed until at last clavering lay with his head amidst a litter of broken cups and plates and the homesteader bent over him with a knee upon his chest  i guess youve had bout enough he said will you let up or do you want me to pound the life out of you  clavering could not speak but he managed to make a movement with his head and the next moment the man had dragged him to his feet and flung him against the table he caught at it gasping while his adversary picked up the rifle  you will be sorry for this nights work yet he said  the homesteader laughed derisively well he said i guess youre sorry now anyone who saw you would think you were get right back to the chair yonder and stay there  it was at least five minutes before clavering recovered sufficiently to survey himself and then he groaned his deerskin jacket was badly rent there was a great burn on one side of it and several red scratches defaced his hands from the splotches on them after he brushed back his ruffled hair he also had a suspicion that his head was cut and the tingling where the scraper had struck him suggested a very visible weal he felt dizzy and shaken but his physical was less than his mental distress clavering was distinguished for his artistic taste in dress and indolent grace but no man appears dignified or courtly with discoloured face tattered garments and dishevelled hair he thought he heard the bobsled coming and in desperation glanced at his jailer  if you would like ten dollars you have only got to let me slip into that other room he said  the bushman grinned sardonically and claverings fears were confirmed youre that pretty i wouldnt lose sight of you for a hundred he said no sir youre going to stop where you are  clavering anathematized him inwardly knowing that the beat of hoofs was unmistakablehe must face what he dreaded most a swordcut or even a rifleshot would he fancied have entitled him to sympathy not untinged with admiration but he was unpleasantly aware that a man damaged in an encounter with natures weapons is apt to appear either brutal or ludicrous and he had noticed miss torrances sensibility he set his lips and braced himself for the meeting  a few minutes later the door opened and followed by the fräulein muller hetty and miss schuyler came in they did not seem to have suffered greatly in the interval which clavering knew was not the case with him and he glanced at the homesteader with a little venomous glow in his eyes when hetty turned to him  oh she said with a gasp and her face grew pale and stern as closing one hand she too looked at the bushman  clavering took heart at this but his enemys vindictiveness was evidently not exhausted for he nodded comprehendingly  yes he said hes damaged he got kind of savage a little while ago and before i could quiet him he broke up quite a lot of crockery  the imperious anger faded out of hettys face and flora schuyler understood why it did so as she glanced at clavering there was nothing that could appeal to a fastidious young womans fancy about him just then he reminded miss schuyler of a man she had once seen escorted homewards by his drunken friends after a fracas in the bowery at the same time it was evident that hetty recognized her duty and was sensible if not of admiration at least of somewhat tempered sympathy  i am dreadfully sorry mr claveringand it was all my fault she said i hope they didnt hurt you very much  clavering who had risen made her a little inclination but he also set his lips for hetty had not expressed herself very tactfully and just then muller and another man came in and stood staring at them the rancher endeavoured to smile with very small success for he was consumed with an unsatisfied longing to destroy the bushman  i dont think you need be miss torrance he said i am only sorry i could not come back for you but unfortunatelycircumstancesprevented me  you have done enough said hetty impulsively apparently forgetting the presence of the rest it was splendid of you  then the bushman looked up again with an almost silent chuckle i guess if it had been your plates he sat on you wouldnt be quite so sure of itand the circumstance was me he said  hetty turned from the speaker and glanced at the rest muller was standing near the door with his spectacles down on his nose and mild inquiry in his pale blue eyes and a big bronzed dakota man beside him was grinning visibly the fräulein was kneeling despairingly amidst her shattered china while flora schuyler leaned against the table with her lips quivering and a most suspicious twinkle in her eyes  flo said hetty halfaloud how can you  i dont know said miss schuyler with a little gasp dont look at me hetty i really cant help it  hetty said no more but she glanced at the redcheeked fräulein who was gazing at a broken piece of crockery with tearful eyes and turned her head away clavering saw the effort it cost her to keep from laughing and writhed  well said the man who had come with muller pointing to the wreck what started you smashing up the house  its quite simple said the bushman mr clavering and i didnt quite agree he had a billet in his hand when he crept up behind me and somehow we fell into the crockery i didnt mean to damage him but he wanted to get away you see  hetty swung round towards muller you havent dared to make mr clavering a prisoner  muller was never very quick at speech and the american by his side answered for him well we have got to keep him until larry comes hell be here most directly  flo said hetty with relief in her face larry is coming we need not worry about anything now  the fräulein had risen in the meanwhile and was busy with the kettle and a fryingpan by and by she set a steaming jug of coffee and a hot cornmeal cake before her guests for whom muller had drawn out chairs they were glad of the refreshment and still more pleased when grant and breckenridge came in when larry shook hands with them hetty contrived to whisper in his ear  if you want to please me get clavering away  grant glanced at her somewhat curiously but both were sensible that other eyes were upon them and with a just perceptible nod he passed on with muller into the adjoining room clavering and the two americans followed him with breckenridge and grant who had heard something of what had happened from the fräulein asked a few questions  you can go when it pleases you clavering he said i am sorry you have received some trifling injury but i have an idea that you brought it upon yourself in the face of your conduct to them it seems to me that my friends were warranted in detaining you until they made sure of the correctness of your story  clavering flushed for there was a contemptuous incisiveness in grants voice which stung his pride  i dont know that i am very grateful he said angrily and you are probably doing this because it suits you in any case your friends dare not have offered violence to me  grant smiled grimly i wouldnt try them too far but i dont quite catch your meaning i can gain nothing by letting you go  it should be tolerably plain i fancied you desired to please some friends at cedar who send money to you  there was a murmur of astonishment from the rest and clavering saw that the shot had told  i guess hes lying larry said one of them  grant stood still a moment with his eyes fixed on clavering i wonder he said if you are hazarding a guess  no said clavering i dont think i am i know you got a wallet of dollarsthough i dont know who sent them are you prepared to deny it  im not prepared to exchange any words with you said grant go while the door is open and it would not be advisable for you to fall into our hands again we hanged a friend of yours who i fancy lived up to at least as high a standard as you seem to do  when clavering had left the room the others turned to grant you have something to tell us  no said grant quietly i dont think i have  the men looked at each other and one of them said that fellows story sounded kind of ugly what were you taking dollars from the cattlemen for larry  grant saw the growing distrust in their eyes but his own were resolute  i cant help that he said i am with you as i have always been but there are affairs of mine i cant have anybody inquiring into that is all i can tell you you will have to take me on trust  youre making it hard said the man who had spoken first  before grant could answer clavering returned ready for his ride but grant gave him no opportunity to address hetty and miss schuyler it is too far to drive to allonbys in the sled he said to them my sleigh is at your service shall i drive you  hetty for a moment looked irresolute but she saw claverings face and remembered what was due to him and what he had apparently suffered for her sake  it wouldnt be quite fair to dismiss mr clavering in that fashion she said  grant glanced at her and the girl longed for an opportunity of making him understand what influenced her but this was out of the question  then if he will be surety for their safety the team is at mr claverings disposal he said  clavering said nothing to grant but he thrust his hand into his pocket and laid a fivedollar bill on the table  i am very sorry i helped to destroy some of your crockery fräulein and this is the only amend i can make he said if i knew how to replace the broken things i wouldnt have ventured to offer it to you  the little deprecatory gesture was graceful and hetty flashed an approving glance at him but she also looked at grant as if to beseech his comprehension when she went out larry however did not understand her and stood gravely aside as she passed him he said nothing but when he was fastening the fur robe round her in the sleigh hetty spoke  larry she said softly cant you understand that one has to do the square thing to everybody  then clavering who could not hear what she was saying flicked the horses and the sleigh slid away into the darkness  a moment or two later while the men still lingered talking without and larry stood putting on his furs in the room breckenridge saw miss muller who had been gazing at the money rise and as though afraid her resolution might fail her hastily thrust it into the stove  you are right he said that was an abominably unfair shot of claverings larry of course you couldnt answer him or tell anybody but its horribly unfortunate the thing made the impression he meant it to  well said larry bitterly i have got to bear it with the rest i cant see any reason for being pleased with anything tonight  breckenridge nodded but once more a little twinkle crept into his eyes i scarcely think you need worry about one trifle any way he said if you think miss torrance or miss schuyler wanted clavering to drive them you must be unusually dense they only asked him to because they have a sense of fairness and id stake a good many dollars on the fact that when miss schuyler first saw him she was convulsed with laughter  did miss torrance seem amused grant asked eagerly  yes said breckenridge decisively she did though she tried to hide it miss torrance has of course a nice appreciation of what is becoming in fact her taste is only slightly excelled by miss schuylers  grant stared at him for a moment and then for the first time during several anxious months broke into a great peal of laughter     xxii  the cavalry officer   the winter was relaxing its iron grip at last and there were alternations of snow and thaw and frost when one evening a few of his scattered neighbours assembled at allonbys ranch clavering was there with torrance hetty and miss schuyler among the rest but though the guests made a spirited attempt to appear unconcerned the signs of care were plainer in their faces than when they last met and there were times when the witty sally fell curiously flat the strain was beginning to tell and even the most optimistic realized that the legislature of the state was more inclined to resent than yield to any further pressure that could be exerted by the cattlebarons the latter were however proud and stubborn men who had unostentatiously directed affairs so long that they found it difficult to grasp the fact that their ascendancy was vanishing showing a bold front still they stubbornly disputed possession of every acre of land the homesteaders laid claim upon the latters patience was almost gone and the more fiery spirits were commencing to obstruct their leaders schemes by individual retaliation and occasionally purposeless aggression  torrance seemed older and grimmer his daughter paler and there were moments when anxiety was apparent even in claverings usually careless face he at least was already feeling the pinch of straitened finances and his only consolations were the increasing confidence that torrance reposed in him and hettys graciousness since his capture by the homesteaders it was perhaps not astonishing that he should mistake its meaning for he had no means of knowing as miss schuyler did that the cattlebarons daughter met larry grant now and then  hetty was sitting in a corner of the big room with flo schuyler and christopher allonby close at hand and during a lull in the conversation she turned to him with a smile  you find us a little dull tonight chris she said  allonby laughed there was a time when you delighted in trapping me into admissions of that kind but im growing wise he said in fact another year like this one would make an old man of me i dont mind admitting that there is something wrong with the rest i have told them the stories they have laughed over the last three years and could not raise a smile from one of them and when i got my uncle started playing cards i actually believe your father forgot what trumps were for the first time in his life  that is significant said hetty whose face had grown serious nothing has gone well for us lately chris  allonby sighed we dont like to acknowledge it but its a fact he said still theres hope yet if we can just stir up the homesteadboys into wrecking a railroad bridge or burning somebodys ranch  it is a little difficult to understand how that would improve affairs especially for the man whose place was burned said miss schuyler drily  one cant afford to be too particular said allonby with a deprecating gesture you see once they started in to do that kind of thing the state would have to crush them which of course would suit us quite nicely as it is after the last affair at hamlins they have sent in a draft of cavalry  and you are naturally taking steps to bring about the things that would suit you asked flora schuyler  allonby did not see the snare well he said i am not an admirer of clavering but im willing to admit that he has done everything he could in fact im most astonished they have stood him so long and i dont think they would have done so but for larry anyway its comforting to know larry is rapidly making himself unpopular among them  a spot of colour showed in hettys cheek and there was a little gleam in flora schuylers eyes as she fixed them on the lad  you evidently consider mr grant is taking an unwarranted liberty in persuading his friends to behave themselves as lawful citizens should she said  i dont quite think you understand me of course one could scarcely expect it from a lady but if you look at the thing from our point of view its quite easy  flora schuyler smiled satirically i fancy i do though i may be mistaken subtleties of this kind are as you suggest beyond the average woman  you are laughing at me and its quite likely i deserve it we will talk of something else i was telling you about the cavalry officer  no said hetty i dont think you were  then i meant to he has just come up from the apache countrya kind of quiet man with a good deal in him and a way of making you listen when you once start him talking we half expect him here this evening and if he comes i want you to be nice to him you could make him believe we are in the right quite easily  from the apache country and flora schuyler glanced at hetty  allonby nodded new mexico arizona or somewhere there now just when you were beginning to listen theres mr torrance wanting me  he rose with evident reluctance and miss schuyler sat reflectively silent when he moved away  what are you thinking of asked hetty sharply  that the united states is not after all such a very big country one is apt to run across a friend everywhere  hetty did not answer but miss schuyler knew that she was also wondering about the cavalry officer when half an hour later it became evident from the sounds outside that a sleigh had reached the door and when a little further time had passed allonby ushered a man in blue uniform into the room hetty set her lips when she saw him  oh said miss schuyler i felt quite sure of it this is the kind of thing that not infrequently happens and it is only the natural sequence that he should turn up on the opposite side to larry  flo said hetty sharply what do you mean  well she said lazily i fancy that you should know better than i do i have only my suspicions and some little knowledge of human nature to guide me now of course you convinced us that you didnt care for cheyne but we have only your word to go upon in regard to larry  hetty turned upon her with a flash in her eyes dont try to make me angry flo its going to be difficult to meet him as it is  i dont think you need worry and flora schuyler laughed he is probably cured by this time and has found somebody else they usually do that ought to please you  in the meantime allonby and the man he was presenting to his friends were drawing nearer hetty rose when the pair stopped in front of them  captain jackson cheyne who is coming to help us miss torrance and miss schuyler the daughter and guest of our leader said allonby and the soldierly man with the quiet brown face smiling held out his hand  we are friends already he said and passed on with allonby  was it very dreadful hetty said flora schuyler i could see he means to come back and talk to you  hetty also fancied cheyne wished to do so and spent the next hour or two in avoiding the encounter with this purpose she contrived to draw chris allonby into one of the smaller rooms where the cardtables were then untenanted and listened with becoming patience to stories she had often heard before she however found it a little difficult to laugh at the right places and at last the lad glanced reproachfully at her  it spoils everything when one has to show you where the point is he said and hetty looking up saw cheyne and flora schuyler in the doorway  miss newcombe is looking for you mr allonby said the latter  there was very little approval in the glance hetty bestowed upon miss schuyler and allonby seemed to understand it  she generally is and that is why im here he said i dont feel like hearing about any more lepidoptera tonight and you can take her captain cheyne instead he must have found out quite a lot about beetles and other things that bite you down in arizona  miss schuyler disregarding hetty laughed you had better go she said i see her coming in this direction now and she has something which apparently contains specimens in her hand  allonby fled but he turned a moment in the doorway do you think you could get me a real lively tarantula captain cheyne he said if a young lady with a preoccupied manner asks you anything about insects tell her you have one in your pocket its the only thing that will save you  he vanished with miss schuyler and hetty somewhat against her wishes found herself alone with cheyne he was deeply sunburned and his face thinner than it had been but the quiet smile she had once found pleasure in was still in his eyes  your young friend did his best and i am half afraid he had a hint he said  hetty blushed i am very pleased to see you she said hastily how did you like new mexico  as well as i expected cheyne answered with a dry smile it is not exactly an enchanting placedeformed mountains sun glare adobe houses loneliness and dust my chief trouble however was that i had too much time to think  but you must have seen somebody and had something to do  yes cheyne admitted there was a mining fellow who used to come over and clean out my whiskey and sing gruesome songs for hours together to a banjo that had i think two strings i stayed out all night quite frequently when i had reason to believe that he was coming then we killed a good many tarantulasand a few equally venomous pestsbut when all was done it left one hours to sit staring at the sagebrush and wonder whether one would ever shake off the dreariness of it again  it must have been horribly lonely hetty said  well said cheyne very slowly there was just one faint hope that now and then brightened everything for me i thought you might change perhaps i was foolishbut that hope would have meant so much to me i could not let it go  hetty turned and looked at him with a softness in her eyes for the little tremor in his voice had touched her  and i was hoping you had forgotten she said  no said cheyne quietly i dont think i ever shall you havent a grain of comfort to offer me  hetty shook her head and involuntarily one hand went up and rested a moment on something that lay beneath the laces at her neck no she said i am ever so sorry jake but i have nothing whatever to offer younow  then said cheyne with a little gesture of resignation i suppose it can be borne because it must beand i think i understand i know he must be a good manor you would never have cared for him  hetty looked at him steadily but the colour that had crept into her cheek spread to her forehead jake she said no doubt there are more but i have met two americans who are i think without reproach i shall always be glad i knew themand it is not your fault that you are not the right one  cheyne made her a little grave inclination then i hope we shall be good friends when i meet the other one i am going to stay some little time in the cattle country  i almost hope you will not meet just yet hetty said anxiously and you must never mention what i have told you to anybody  you have only told me that i was one of two good americans said cheyne with a quiet smile which the girl found reassuring now you dont want to send me away  no said hetty it is so long since i have seen you you have come to help us against our enemies  cheyne saw the girls intention and was glad to fall in with it but he betrayed a little embarrassment not exactly though i should be content if my duty amounts to the same thing he said we have been sent in to help to restore order and it is my business just now to inquire into the doings of a certain larry grant i wonder if you could tell me anything about him  he noticed the sudden intentness of hettys face though it was gone in an instant  what have you found out she asked  very little that one could rely upon everybody i ask tells me something different he seems a compound of the qualities of coleman the vigilante our first president and the notorious james boys as they were gentlemen of quite different character it seems to me that some of my informants are either prejudiced or mistaken  yes said hetty he is like none of them larry is just a plain american who is fearlessly trying to do what he feels is right though it is costing him a good deal you see i met him quite often before the trouble began  cheyne glanced at her sharply but hetty met his gaze i dont know he answered that one could say much more of any man  just then flora schuyler and miss allonby came in hetty said the latter everybody is waiting for you to sing  in the meanwhile allonby and his nephew sat with torrance and clavering and one or two of the older men in his office room clavering had just finished speaking when allonby answered torrances questioning glance  i have no use for beating round the bush he said dollars are getting scarce with me and like some of my neighbours i had to sell out a draft of stock the fact that im throwing them on the market now is significant  one of the men nodded allonby has put it straight he said i was over fixing things with the station agent and he is going to send the first drafts through to omaha in one lot if two of his biggest locomotives can haul the cars still if clavering has got hold of the right story how the devil did the homesteadboys hear of it  clavering glanced at torrance with a little sardonic smile on his lips i dont quite know but a good many of our secrets have been leaking out  youre quite sure you are right clavering somebody asked  yes the information is worth the fifty dollars i paid for it the homesteadboys mean to run that stock train through the bitter creek bridge as you know its a good big trestle and it is scarcely likely we would get a head of stock out of the wreck alive  there were angry ejaculations and the faces round the table grew set and stern some of the men had seen what happens when a heavy train goes through a railroad trestle  its devilish said allonby larry is in the thing  well said clavering drily it appears the boys cant do anything unless they have an order from their executive and the man who told me declared he had seen one signed by him still one has to be fair to larry and it is quite likely some of the foreign reds drove him into it any way if we could get that paperand i think i canit would fix the affair on him  torrance nodded now we have the cavalry here it would be enough to have him shot he said well this is going to suit us but there must be no fooling we want to lay hands upon them when they are at work on the trestle  the other men seemed doubtful and allonby made a protest it is by no means plain how its going to suit me to have my steers run through the bridge he said i cant afford it  clavering laughed you will not lose one of them he said now dont ask any questions but listen to me  there were objections to the scheme he suggested but he won over the men who raised them and when all had been arranged and allonby had gone back to his other guests clavering appeared satisfied and torrance very grim unfortunately however they had not bound christopher allonby to silence and when he contrived to find a place near miss schuyler and hetty he could not refrain from mentioning what he had heard this was however the less astonishing since the cattlebarons wives and daughters shared their anxieties and were conversant with most of what happened  you have a kind of belief in the homesteadboys hetty he said  yes but everybody knows who i belong to  of course well i guess you are not going to have any kind of belief in them now theyre planning to run our big stock train through the bitter creek bridge  hetty turned white they would never do that their leaders would not let them  no said allonby im sorry to mention it but it seems they have larrys order  a little flush crept into flora schuylers face but hettys grew still more colourless and her dark eyes glowed then she shook her shoulders and said with a scornful quietness larry would not have a hand in it to save his life there is not a semblance of truth in that story chris  allonby glanced up in astonishment but he was youthful and that hetty could have more than a casual interest in her old companion appeared improbable to him  it is quite a long time since you and larry were on good terms and no doubt he has changed he said any way his friends are going to try giant powder on the bridge and if we are fortunate cheyne will get the whole of them and larry too now well change the topic since it does not seem to please you  he changed it several times but his companions though they sat and even smiled now and then heard very few of his remarks  im going he said at last reproachfully i am sorry if i have bored you but it is really quite difficult to talk to people who are thinking about another thing it seems to me you are both in love with somebody and it very clearly isnt me  he moved away and for a moment hetty and miss schuyler did not look at one another then hetty stood up  i should have screamed if he had stayed any longer she said the thing is just too horriblebut it is quite certain larry does not know i have got to tell him somehow think flo     xxiii  hettys avowal   the dusk hetty had anxiously waited for was creeping across the prairie when she and miss schuyler pulled up their horses in the gloom of the birches where the trail wound down through the cedar bluff the weather had grown milder and great clouds rolled across the strip of sky between the branches overhead while the narrow track amidst the whitened trunks was covered with loose snow there was no frost and miss schuyler felt unpleasantly clammy as she patted her horse which moved restively now and then and shook off the melting snow that dripped upon her but hetty seemed to notice nothing she sat motionless in her saddle with the moisture glistening on her furs and the thin white steam from the spumeflecked beast floating about her staring up the trail and when she turned and glanced over her shoulder her face showed white and drawn  he must be coming soon she said and miss schuyler noticed the strained evenness of her voice yes of course hes coming it would be too horrible if we could not find him  jake cheyne and his cavalry boys would save the bridge said flora schuyler with a hopefulness she did not feel  hetty leaned forward and held up her hand as though to demand silence that she might listen before she answered her  there are some desperate men among the homesteadboys and if they found out they had been given away they would cut the track in another place she said if they didnt and cheyne surprised them they would fire on his troopers and larry would be blamed for it he would be chased everywhere with a price on his head and anyone he wouldnt surrender to could shoot him flo it is too hard to bear and im afraid  her voice failed her and miss schuyler who could find no words to reassure her was thankful that her attention was demanded by her restive horse the strain was telling on her too and with less at stake than her companion she was consumed by a longing to defeat the schemes of the cattlemen who had it seemed to her with detestable cunning decided not to warn the station agent and let the great train go that they might heap the more obloquy upon their enemies the risk the engineer and brakesmen ran was apparently nothing to them and she felt as hetty did that larry was the one man who could be depended on to avert bloodshed yet there was still no sign of him  if he would only come she said  there was no answer loose snow fell with a soft thud from the birch branches and there was a little sighing amidst the trees it was rapidly growing darker but hetty sat rigidly still in her saddle with her hand clenched on the bridle five long minutes passed then she turned suddenly exultation in her voice  flo she said hes coming  miss schuyler could hear nothing for another minute or two and then when a faint sound became audible through the whispering of the trees she wondered how her companion could be sure it was the fall of hoofs or that the horse was not ridden by a stranger but there was no doubt in hettys face and flora schuyler sighed as she saw it relax and a softness creep into the dark eyes she had seen that look in the faces of other women and knew its meaning  the beat of hoofs became unmistakable and she could doubt no longer that a man was riding down the trail he came into sight in another minute a shadowy figure swinging to the stride of a big horse with the line of a riflebarrel across his saddle and then as he saw them rode up at a gallop scattering the snow  hetty he said a swift flush of pleasure sweeping his face and miss schuyler set her lips as she noticed that he did not even see her  hetty gathered up her bridle and wheeled her horse ride into the bluffquick she said somebody might see us in the trail  larry did as he was bidden and when the gloom of the trees closed about them sprang down and looped his bridle round a branch then he stood by hettys stirrup and the girl could see his face white in the faint light the snow flung up she turned her own away when she had looked down on it  i have had an anxious day but this makes up for everything he said nowand it is so long since i have seen youcant we for just a few minutes forget our troubles  he held out his hand as though to lift her down but the girl turned her eyes on him and what he saw in them checked him suddenly  no she said with a tremor in her voice we cant get away from them you must not ask any question until you have heard everything  she spoke with a swift conciseness that omitted no point and made the story plain for there was a high spirit in the girl and a tangible peril that could be grappled with had a bracing effect on her grants face grew intent as he listened and hetty looking down could see the firmer set of his lips and the glint in his eyes the weariness faded out of it and once more she recognized the alert resourceful and quietly resolute larry she had known before the troubles came he turned swiftly and clasped her hand  i wonder if you know how much you have done for me  hetty smiled and allowed her fingers to remain in his grasp then you have heard nothing of this she said  no said the man but hetty  again the girl checked him with a gesture and i need not ask you whether you would have had a hand in it  grant laughed a little scornful laugh that was more eloquent than many protestations no he said you neednt i think you know me better than that hetty  yes said the girl softly you couldnt have had anything to do with that kind of meanness larry how was it they did not tell you  she felt the grasp of the mans fingers slacken and saw his arm fall to his side his face changed suddenly growing stern and set until he turned his head away when he looked round again the weariness was once more plain in it and she almost fancied he had checked a groan  you have brought me back to myself he said only a few seconds ago i could think of nothing but what you had done for me i think i was almost as happy as a man could be and now  hetty laid her hand on his shoulder and now tell me larry  no said the man you have plenty of troubles of your own  the grasp of the little hand grew tighter and when grant looked up he saw the girl smiling down on him halfshyly and yet as it were imperiously  tell me dear she said  larry felt his heart throb and his resolution failed him he could see the girls eyes and their compelling tenderness  well he said huskily what i have dreaded has come the men i have given up everything for have turned against me no you must not think i am sorry for what i have done and it was right then but they have listened to some of the crazy fools from europe and are letting loose anarchy i and the othersthe sensible americanshave lost our hold on them and yet it was we who brought them in we took on too big a contractand im most horribly afraid hetty  the light had almost gone but his face still showed drawn and white and hetty bent down nearer him  put your hand in mine larry she said softly i have something to tell you  the man obeyed her wondering while a thrill ran through him as the mittened fingers closed upon his own  hetty he said i have only brought trouble on everyone im not fit to speak to you  no said the girl with a throb in her voice you have only done what very few other men would have dared to do and many a better girl than i am would be proud to be fond of you now listen larry for years you were ever so good to me and i was too mean and shallow and selfish even to understand what you were giving me i fancied i had a right to everything you could do but come nearer larry  she drew him closer to her until his garments pressed the horses flank and the blanket skirt she wore and leaned down still further with her hand upon his shoulder  i found out dear and now i want you to forgive me and always love me  the grasp on her hand became compelling and she moved her foot from the stirrup as the mans arm reached upwards towards her waist had she wished she could not have helped herself as she slipped from the saddle the arm closed round her and it was several seconds before she and grant stood a pace apart with tingling blood looking at one another there was no sign of flora schuyler they were alone enfolded in the silence of the bluff  it is wonderful he said i cant even talk hetty i want to realize it  hetty laughed but there was a note in her voice that set the mans heart beating furiously yes it is wonderful it should come to me she said no you neednt look round larry there is nothing and nobody that counts now except you and me i am just beginning to understand your patience and how hard i must have been to you  i waited a long time he said it was worth while even the troubles i felt crushing me seem very little now if they were only over and there was nothing to come between you and me  larry the girl said very softly are you sure they need do that it has been so horrible lately and i cant even sleep at night for thinking of the risks that you are taking  grant closed one hand but it was too dark now for hetty to see his face and she was glad of it  you mean he said hoarsely and stopped  just this her voice almost a whisper i am frightened of it all and when you want me i will come to you no wait just a little i could never marry the man who was fighting against my father and the people i belong to while now i know what you are i could never ask him to go back on what he felt was right but larry the men you did so much for have turned against you and the things they are doing are not right and would never please you cant we go away and leave the trouble behind us nobody seems to want us now  there was a cold dew on the mans forehead the girl could not see and your father he said  i would never help anyone against him as i told you said the girl still there are times when his bitterness almost frightens me it is hard to admit it even to you but i cant convince myself that he and the others are not mistaken too i cant believe any longer that you are wrong dear besides though he says very little i feel he wants me to marry clavering  clavering said larry  yes said hetty with a shiver i dislike him bitterlyand i should be safe with you  grant held out his hands then you must come my dear one way or other the struggle will soon be over now and if i have to go out an outcast i can still shelter you  illustration there was a note in her voice that set the mans heart beating furiouslypage 267  the girl drew back a pace i cant turn against my own peoplebut yours have turned on you that makes it easier if you will take me dear we will go away  grant turned from her and ground his heel into the snow he had already given up almost everything that made life bright to him but he had never felt the bitterness he did at that moment when he realized that another and heavier sacrifice was demanded of him  hetty he said slowly cant you understand i and the others brought the homesteaders in this land has fed me and given me all i have and now i cant go back on it and them i would not be fit to marry you if i went away  the words were very simple but the mans voice betrayed what he felt hetty understood and the pride she had no lack of came to the rescue  yes she said with a little sob larry you are right you will forgive me dear for once more tempting you perhaps it will all come right by and by and now i must go  there was a crackle of brittle twigs and grant dimly saw miss schuyler riding towards them reaching out he took hettys hands and drew her closer  there is just one thing you must promise me my dear he said if your father insists on your listening to clavering you will let me know then i will come to cedar for you and there are still a few americans who have not lost confidence in their leader and will come with me nothing must make you say yes to him  no said hetty simply if i cannot avoid it any other way i will send for you i cant wait any longerand here is flo  larry stooped but before she laid her foot in the hand he held out for her to mount by hetty bent her head swiftly and kissed him  now she said softly do you think i could listen to clavering you will do what you have to and i will wait for you it is hard on us both dear but i cant help recognizing my duty too  larry lifted her to the saddle and she vanished into the gloom of the birches before he could speak to miss schuyler who wheeled her horse and followed her a few minutes more and he was riding towards fremont as fast as his horse could flounder through the slushy snow his face grown set and resolute again for he knew he had difficult work to do  i dont quite know what has come over you larry breckenridge said an hour or two later with a puzzled look at grant as he lifted his eyes from the writing pad on his knee i havent seen you so obviously contented for months and yet the work before us may be grim enough the most unpleasant point about it is that clavering must have got hold of one of your warrant forms it was a mistake to trust anybody with one not filled in  well i feel that way too grant confessed and at the same time im desperately anxious we are going to have trouble with the boys right along the line and there is no man living can tell what will happen if any of them go down in an affair with the cavalry  it wouldnt be difficult to guess what the consequences would be if they cut the track just before the stock train came through you are quite sure they have not changed their minds again  yes said larry quietly i bluffed it out of harper he would have taken a hand in and only kicked when it came to taking lives more of the others cleared out over that point too and as the rest were halfafraid of some of those who objected giving them away they changed their plans but it seems quite certain they mean to pull the rails up at the bend on the down grade by the bunch grass hollow it is fortunate any way cheyne and his cavalry will be watching the bridge you see but you had better get ready ill have the last instructions done directly and it will be morning before you are through  breckenridge poured himself out a big cup of coffee from the jug on the stove put on a black leather jacket and went out to the stable when he came back grant handed him a bundle of notes  you will see every man gets one and tell him all he wants to know i dare not put down too much in black and white they are to be round at the rise behind the depot at six thursday night  you believe they will come  yes grant said firmly they are good men and im thankful there are still so many of them because just now they are all that is standing between this country and anarchy  breckenridge smiled a little but his voice was sympathetic well he said i am glad on my own account too its nicer to have the chances with you when you have to reckon with men of the kind we are going to meet but i shall not be sorry when this troubles through it is my first attempt at reforming and a little of it goes a long way with me i dont know that there is a more thankless task than trying to make folks better off than they want or deserve to be  he went out with a packet of messages and grant sat still with care in his face staring straight in front of him     xxiv  the stock train   it was almost unpleasantly hot in the little ironroofed room at the railroad depot and the agent who flung the door open stood still a minute or two blinking into the darkness a big lamp that flickered in the wind cast an uncertain gleam upon the slushy whiteness under foot and the blurred outline of a towering watertank showed dimly through the sliding snow he could also just discern the great locomotive waiting on the sidetrack and the sibilant hiss of steam that mingled with the moaning of the wind whirling a white haze out of the obscurity beyond the track and showing only now and then the lights of the wooden town blinked fitfully on the other hand and behind the depot was an empty waste of snowsheeted prairie the temperature had gone up suddenly but the agent shivered as he felt the raw dampness strike through him and closing the door took off and shook his jacket and sat down by the stove again  he wore a white shirt of unusually choice linen with other garments of fashionable city cut for a station agent is a person of importance in the west and this one was at least as consequential as most of the rest he had finished his six oclock supper at the wooden hotel a little earlier and as the next train going west would not arrive for two or three hours he took out a rank cigar and placing his feet upon a chair prepared to doze the time away though he laid a bundle of accounts upon his knee in case anyone should come in unexpectedly this however was distinctly improbable on such a night  the stove flung out a drowsy heat and it was not long before his eyes grew heavy he could still hear the wailing of the wind and the swish of the snow that whirled about the lonely building and listened for a while with tranquil contentment for the wild weather he was not exposed to enhanced the comfort of the warmth and brightness he enjoyed then the sounds grew less distinct and he heard nothing at all until he straightened himself suddenly in his chair as a cold draught struck him a few flakes of snow also swept into the room and he saw that the door was open  hallo he called wait there a moment i guess this place doesnt belong to you  a man who looked big and shapeless in his whitened furs signed to somebody outside without answering and four or five other men in fur caps and snowsprinkled coats came in they did not seem to consider it necessary to wait for permission and it dawned upon the agent that something unusual was about to happen  we have a little business to put through said one  well said the agent brusquely i cant attend to you now you can come back laterwhen the train comes in  one of the newcomers smiled sardonically and the agent recognized two of his companions they were men of some importance in that country who had however joined the homestead movement and were under the ban of the companys chief supporters the cattlebarons there was accordingly no inducement to waste civility on them but he had an unpleasant feeling that unnecessary impertinence would not be advisable  it has got to be put through now said the first of them with a little ring in his voice we want a locomotive and a calaboose to take us to boynton and we are quite willing to pay anything reasonable  it cant be done we have only the one loco here and she is wanted to shove the westbound train up the long grade to the hills  i guess that train will have to get through alone tonight said another man  the agent got up with an impatient gesture now he said i dont feel like arguing with you you cant have the loco  no said the homesteader with a little laugh well i figure youre mistaken we have taken charge of her already and only want the bill if you dont believe me call your engineer  the agent strode to the door and there was a momentary silence after he called pete  then a shout came out of the sliding snow i cant come  it broke off with significant suddenness and the agent turned to the man who had first spoken you are going to be sorry for this mr grant he said and then tried to slip away but one of the others pulled the door to and stood with his back to it while grant smiling said im quite willing to take my chances have the stockcars passed perrys siding  i dont know said the agent  then hadnt you better call them up and see we are giving you the first chance of doing it out of courtesy but one of us is a good operator  i was on the baltimore and ohio road said one man you neednt play any tricks with me  the agent sat down at the telegraph instrument and looked up when it rapped out an answer to his message            stock train left birch hollow no sign of her yet  thats all right said the man who had served the b and o tell them to sidetrack her for half an hour anyway after your loco comes through its necessary dont worry bout any questions but tell them to keep us a clear road now  the agent who saw that the other man was prepared to do the work himself complied and the latter once more nodded when the instrument clicked out the answer  make out your bill said grant taking a wallet from his pocket  no said the agent were going to have the law of you  grant laughed it strikes me there is very little law in this country now and your company would a good deal sooner have the dollars than a letter telling them you had let us take one of their locomotives away from you  that said the agent reflectively sounds quite sensible well ill take the dollars it doesnt commit us to anything  the bills were counted over and as the men went out grant turned in the doorway it would not be advisable for you to wire any of the folks along the line to stop us he said we are going through to boynton as fast as your engineer can shove his loco along and if anybody switched us into a sidetrack it would only mean the smashing up of a good deal of the companys property  he had gone out in another moment and in a few more climbed into the locomotive cab while somebody coupled on a calaboose in the rear then he showed the engineer several bills and the agents receipt together  if you can hold your tongue and get us through to boynton five minutes under the mail schedule time the dollars are yours he said  the engineer looked doubtful for a moment then his eyes twinkling he took the bills  well he said youve got the agents receipt and the rest is not my business sit tight and well show you something very like flying tonight  another man flung open the furnace door a sudden stream of brightness flashed out as he hurled in coal the door shut with a clang and there was a whirr of slipping wheels as the engineer laid his hand on the lever the great locomotive panted and grant staring out through the glasses saw a blinking light slide back to them then the plates beneath him trembled the hammering wheels got hold and the muffled clanging and thudding swelled into a rhythmic din the light darted past them the filmy whiteness which had streamed down through the big headlamps glare now beat in a bewildering rush against the quivering glass and the fanshaped blaze of radiance drove on faster through the snow  five minutes passed and grant who held a watch in his hand glanced at the engineer as the blaze whirled like a comet along the cleancut edge of a dusky bluff  youll have to do better he said  wait till we have got her warmed up said the man who stood quietly intent his lean hand on the throttle then youll see something  grant sat down on a toollocker took out his cigarcase and passed it to breckenridge who sat opposite him breckenridges face was eager and there was an unusual brightness in his eyes for he was young and something thrilled within him in unison with the vibration of the great machine there was however very little to see just then beyond the tense motionless figure of the man at the throttle and the dampbeaded face of another forced up in the lurid glare from the furnace door a dim whiteness lashed the glasses and when breckenridge pressed his face to one of them the blaze of radiance against which the smokestack was projected blackly only intensified the obscurity they were speeding through  still there was much to feel and hearthe shrill wail of the wind that buffeted their shelter the bewildering throb and quiver of the locomotive which with its suggestion of titanic effort seemed to find a response in human fibre pounding and clashing with their burden of strain and the roar of the great drivers that rose and fell like a diapason perhaps breckenridge who was also under a strain that night was fanciful but it seemed to him there was hidden in the medley of sound a theme or motive that voiced mans domination over the primeval forces of the universe and urged him to the endurance of stress and great endeavour it was for the most part vague and elusive but there were times when it rang exultingly through the subtly harmonious din reminding him of wagnerian music  leaning forward he touched grants knee larry its bracing the last few months were making me a little sick of everythingbut this gets hold of one grant smiled but breckenridge saw how weary his bronzed face showed in the dim lantern light there was a time two or three years ago when i might have felt it as you seem to do he said i dont seem to have any feeling but tiredness left me now  you cant let go said breckenridge  no and grant sighed not until the state takes hold instead of me or the troubles through  breckenridge said nothing further and grant sat huddled in a corner with the thin blue cigarsmoke curling about him he knew it was possible he was taking a very heavy risk just then since the homesteaders might have changed their plans again and his task was a double one for he had not only to save the stock train but prevent an encounter between his misguided followers and the cavalry so there was silence between them while lurching rocking roaring the great locomotive sped on through the night until the engineer turning halfround glanced at grant  is she making good enough time to suit you perrys siding is just ahead and well be on the bitter creek trestle five minutes after that he said  grant rose and leaned forward close to the glasses he could see nothing but the radiance from the headlamp whirling like a meteor through the filmy haze but the fierce vibration of everything and the fashion in which the snow smote the glasses as in a solid stream showed the pace at which they were travelling he looked round and saw that breckenridges eyes were fixed upon him his comrades voice reached him faint and strained through the hammering of the wheels  you feel tolerably sure harper was right about the bridge  grant nodded i do  what if he was mistaken and they meant to try there after all there are eight of us  we have got to take the risk said grant very quietly and it is a big responsibility but if the boys got their work in and fell foul of cheyne we would have half the state ablaze  he signed for silence and breckenridge stared out through the glasses for he feared his face would betray him and fancied he understood the burden that was upon the man who because it seemed the lesser evil was risking eight mens lives  as he watched a blink of light crept out of the snow grew brighter and swept back to them others appeared in a cluster behind it a big watertank flashed by and the roar of wheels and scream of whistle was flung back by a snowcovered building then as breckenridge glanced to the opposite side the blaze of another headlamp dazzled his eyes and he had a blurred vision of a waiting locomotive and a long row of snowsmeared cars in another second cars and station had vanished as suddenly as they had sprung up out of the night and they were once more alone in the sliding snow breckenridge drew a breath of relief  theres the stock train any way and now for the bridge he said  that was the easiest half of it muller was therei saw himand he could have warned the agent at the last minute grant answered  neither of them said anything further but breckenridge felt his heart beat faster as the snow whirled by the miles were slipping behind them and he was by no means so sure as larry was that no attempt would be made upon the bridge his fancy would persist in picturing the awful leap into the outer darkness through the gap in the trestle and he felt his lips and forehead grow a trifle colder and his flesh shrink in anticipation of the tremendous shock he looked at grant the latters face was very quiet and had lost its grimness and wearinessthere was almost a suggestion of exaltation in it  we are almost on the bridge now he said  the engineer nodded and the next moment breckenridge who had been watching the light of the headlamp flash along the snow beside the track saw it sweep on as it were through emptiness then he heard a roar of timber beneath him and fancied he could look down into a black gulf through the filmy snow he knew it was a single track they were speeding over and that the platform of the calaboose behind them overhung the frozen river far below  he set his lips and held his breath for what seemed a very long time and then with a sigh of relief sank back into his seat as he felt by the lessening vibration that there was frozen soil under them but in spite of himself the hands he would have lighted a cigar with shook and the engineer who looked round glanced at him curiously  feeling kind of sick he said well its against the regulations but theres something that might fix you as well as tea in that can  breckenridge smiled feebly the fact is i have never travelled on a locomotive before and when i took on the contract i didnt quite know all i was letting myself in for he said  how far are we off the long down grade with the curve in it asked grant  we might get there in bout ten minutes said the engineer  slacken up before you reach the grade and put your headlamp out said grant i want you to stop just this side of the curve and wait for me five minutes  the engineer looked at him steadily now theres a good deal i dont understand about all this what do you want me to stop there for  i dont see why you should worry it does not concern you any way i have hired this special and i give you my word that nothing i am going to do will cause the least damage to any of the companys property i want you to stop lend me a lantern and sit tight in the cab until i tell you to go on we will make it two dollars a minute  the engineer nodded i dont know what you are after but i guess i can take your word he said you seem that kind of a man  ten minutes later the fireman vanished into the darkness and the blaze of the headlamp went out before he returned and the roar of the drivers sank the rhythmic din grew slack and became a jarring of detached sounds again the snow no longer beat on the glasses as it had done and rocking less the great locomotive rolled slowly down the incline until it stopped and grant taking the lantern handed him sprang down from the cab four other men were waiting on the calaboose platform and when grant hid the lantern under his fur coat they floundered down the side of the graded track which there crossed a hollow a raw wind whirled the white flakes about them and breckenridge could scarcely see the men behind him he was thankful when slipping sliding stumbling they gained the level  from there he could just distinguish the road bed as something solid through the whirling haze and he felt they were following a bend of it when grant stopped and a clinking sound came out of the obscurity above them it might have been made by somebody knocking out key wedges or spikes with a big hammer and in his haste striking the rail or chair  then grant said something breckenridge could not catch and they were crawling up the slope with the clinking and ringing growing a trifle louder breckenridges heart beat faster than usual but he was tolerably collected now he had a weapon he was not unskilled with in his pocket and the chance of a fight with even desperate men was much less disconcerting than that of plunging down into a frozen river with a locomotive he had also a reassuring conviction that if larry could contrive it there would be no fight at all  he crawled on with the man behind clutching at him now and then and the one in front sliding back on him until his arms were wet to the elbows and his legs to the knees but the top of the grade seemed strangely difficult to reach and he could see nothing with the snow that blew over it in his eyes suddenly larry rose up there was a shout and a flounder and though he did not quite know how he got there breckenridge found himself standing close behind his comrade and in the light of the lantern held up saw a man drop his hammer there were other men close by but they were apparently too astonished to think of flight  its larry somebody exclaimed  stop where you are said grant sharply as one man made a move i dont want to shoot any of you but i most certainly will if you make me are there any more of you  no said one of the men disgustedly  grant walked forward swinging his lantern until his eyes rested on one partly loosened rail and that is as far as you have got he said take up your hammer and drive the wood key in get hold of their rifles charley i guess they are under that coat  there was an angry murmur and a man started to speak but grant stopped him  hammer the wedges in he said it was pure foolishness made me come here to save you from the cavalry who had heard of what you meant to do because we have no use for men of your kind in this country you havent even sense enough to keep your rifles handy and there will be two or three less of you to worry decent folks if you keep us waiting  a man took up the hammer and then waited a moment looking at those who stood about larry he could see the faces of one or two in the lantern light and recognized that he need expect no support from them the men were resolute americans who had no desire for anything approaching anarchy  we are with larry and dont feel like fooling hadnt you better start in one of them said  the rail was promptly fastened and grant after examining it came back  go on in front of us and take your tools along it will not be nice for the man who tries to get away he said  the prisoners plodded dejectedly up the track until they reached the calaboose into which the others drove them then grant and breckenridge went back to the locomotive and the former nodded to the engineer  take us through to boynton as fast as you can  that is a big load off your mind breckenridge said as the panting engine got under way  but grant huddled in a corner neither moved nor spoke until half an hour later they rolled into a little wooden town and the men in the calaboose got down there was nobody about the depot to ask them any questions and they crossed the track to the straggling street apparently on good terms with each other though four of them knew that unpleasant results would follow any attempt at a dash for liberty in answer to grants knock a man let them into one of the stores  i guess well lock them in the back store until morning he said after a short conference apart with grant a little cooling down is not going to do them much harm and i dont think anyone could get out without an axe  the building looked secure and when food and hot coffee had been served them grant retired to rest he slept soundly and it was close on daylight when a pounding on the door awakened him  i guess you had better get up at once their host called  a few minutes later grant and breckenridge went downstairs with him and the storekeeper opening a door lifted the lamp he held and pointed to an open window in the roof a barrel with a box or two laid upon it stood suggestively beneath it  breckenridge glanced at larry and saw a curious little smile on his face yes he said its quite simple now i never saw that window where would they be likely to head for  pacific slope said the storekeeper wages are high just now and they seemed quite afraid of you the westbound fast freight stopped here for water about two hours ago and it was snowing that thick nobody would see them getting into a box car they heave a few dry goods out here occasionally  breckenridge turned to grant you seem relieved  yes said grant with a little shake of his shoulders if they have lit out of the country it will content me i have had quite enough hard things to do lately  a sudden thought struck breckenridge you didnt mean he said with a shudder  i didnt mean to let them go but im glad theyve gone grant answered we made a warning of one of the cattlebarons men and the man who takes the law into his own hands is doubly bound to do the square thing all round if he does less he is piling up a bigger reckoning than i would care to face     xxv  cheyne relieves his feelings   a blustering wind moaned outside the lonely building and the stove snapped and crackled as the chilly draughts swept into the hall at cedar range jackson cheyne had arrived on horseback in the creeping dusk an hour or two earlier after spending most of four nights and days in the slushy snow and was now resting contentedly in a big hide chair indeed notwithstanding the fact that hetty sat close by he was feeling pleasantly drowsy when she turned to him  you have only told us that you didnt find the trainwreckers and you know we are just dying with curiosity she said  cheyne looked up languidly wondering whether the halfindifferent inquisitiveness was assumed as he remembered the anxiety he had seen in hettys face when he first came in instead of answering directly he glanced round the little group sitting about the stovefor miss schuyler and christopher allonby and his cousin were there as well as hetty  one would scarcely fancy you were dying of anything he said in fact it would be difficult to imagine any of you looking better i wonder if you know that with the way that the light falls that dusky panelling forms a most effective background miss schuyler  flora schuyler laughed we are not to be put off tell us what you foundand you neednt have any diffidence we are quite accustomed to hearing the most astonishing things at cedar  the trouble is that i didnt find anything i spent several most unpleasant hours watching a railroadtrestle in blinding snow until the cattletrain went by in safety nobody seemed to have the slightest wish to meddle with it  without exactly intending it he allowed his eyes to rest on hetty a moment and fancied he saw relief in her face but it was flora schuyler who turned to him  what did you do then  i and the boys then decided it would be advisable to look for a ranch where we could get food and shelter and had some difficulty in finding one in the morning we made our way back to the depot and discovered that a gentleman you know had hired a locomotive a little while after the cattletrain started  larry of course ejaculated chris allonby i wanted to stake five dollars with clavering that he would be too smart for him again  cheyne looked at him inquiringly i dont quite understand  no and allonbys embarrassment was unmistakable well there is no great reason why you should i have a habit of talking at random occasionally there are quite enough sensible people in this country without me just now  then said cheyne i went on to an especially forlorn place called boynton and discovered with some difficulty that mr grant who hired the locomotive had stopped it at a dangerous curve and picked several men up he took them on to boynton and there they seem to have disappeared though it was suggested that they had departed for a place unknown either on the top of or underneath a fast freight train  chris allonby chuckled well he said we havent the least use for larry here but i am almost proud he was a friend of mine  cheyne glancing round at the others fancied there was a little glow in hettys eyes and a trace of warmer colour in flora schuylers face it was only just perceptible to him but he had less doubt when he saw that miss allonby was watching her companion covertly for he was quite aware that the perceptions of the average young woman were likely to be much keener than his own in such affairs  i cant help fancying you have a clue to what really happened miss torrance he said  yes said hetty quietly it is quite plain to me that larry saved the train  cheyne glanced at her sharply and then turned to allonby it strikes you that way too  of course said allonby unguardedly it is too bad of larry he has beaten us again though clavering fixed the thing quite nicely  cheynes face grew stern i am to understand that you did not warn the engineer or any of the railroad men  no said allonby with evident embarrassment we didnt it was necessary to make the thing as ugly for larrys friends as we could and we knew you would be at the bridge if you had caught them in the act with the train not far away it would have looked ever so much better for usand you  he stopped with an unpleasant feeling that he had blundered cheynes face had become grimmer miss schuylers lips were curled in a little scornful smile and there was a curious sparkle in hettys eyes  i wonder if you quite recognize the depth of mr grants iniquity yet flora schuyler asked  cheyne smiled i confess i should very much like to meet the man you see my profession prevents my being a partisan and the cleverness and daring of what he has evidently done appeals to me he took the chances of his own men turning on him to save them from an affray with us brought them off and sent your cattletrain through and what it seems to me was more than all disregarded the probability of his enemies associating him with the contriving of the outrage  wouldnt you have done that asked miss allonby  no said the soldier quietly i dont think i should a man who would do what this one has done would be very likely to take a hand in that kind of thing  again there was an almost embarrassing silence broken by miss allonby i wonder who could have told him  nobody spoke until cheyne felt it advisable to break the silence  you have no sympathy with grant miss allonby  no said the girl plaintively i dont go quite as far as mr clavering and my cousin dothough chris generally talks too muchbut larry is a nuisance and really ought to be crushed you see we had everything we wanted before he and the others made the trouble here  that is quite convincing cheyne said with somewhat suspicious gravity he looked at the others and fancied that hetty would have answered but that flora schuyler flashed a warning glance at her  one could almost fancy that most of us have too much now she said are we better braver stronger or of choicer stuff than those others who have nothing and only want the little the law would give them oh yes we are accomplishedvery indifferently some of usand have been better taught though one sometimes wonders at the use we make of it but was that education given us for our virtues or thrust upon us by the accident that our fathers happened to be rich  you will scarcely approve miss allonby said cheyne  the girls lips curled scornfully i never argue with people who talk like that it would not be any useand they would never understand me but everybody knows we were born different from the rabble it is unfortunate you and larry couldnt go up and down the country together convincing people flo  cheyne seeing the gleam in miss schuylers eyes wondered whether there had been malice in the speech and was not sorry that torrance and clavering came in just then  i have just come from newcombes and heard that you had failed said torrance if you will come along to my room i should like to hear about it  cheyne smiled as he rose i dont know that failed was quite the correct word my object was to protect the track and so far as i could discover no attempt was made to damage it  torrance glanced at him sharply as they moved away now we were under the impression that it was the capture of the man responsible for the affair  then said the soldier drily i am afraid you were under a misapprehension  he passed the next halfhour with torrance amicably and it was not until he was returning to the hall with clavering that he found an opportunity of expressing himself freely torrance he realized was an old man and quite incapable of regarding the question except from his own point of view  i am just a little astonished you did not consider it advisable to follow the thing up further when you must have seen what it pointed to said clavering  that said cheyne smiling is foolish of you i would like to explain that i am not a detective or a police officer  you were at least sent here to restore tranquillity  precisely said cheyne by the state to maintain peace and not further the cattlemens schemes i am for the present your leaders guest but i have no reason for thinking he believes that in any way constitutes me his ally in his case i could not use the word accomplice  clavering flashed an observant glance at him it should be evident which party is doing the most to bring about tranquillity  it is not said cheyne i dont know that it is my business to go into that question but one or two of the efforts you have made lately would scarcely impress the fact on me  you are frank any way with a disagreeable laugh  no said cheyne with a twinkle in his eyes im not sure that i am we occasionally talk a good deal more plainly in the united states cavalry  he passed on to the hall and clavering went back to torrances room we have got to get rid of that man sir he said if we dont larry will have him allonby had better go and worry the bureau into sending for another two or three squadrons under a superior officer  torrance sighed heavily im most afraid they are not going to take kindly to any more worrying he said in fact now its evident how the feeling of the state is going i have an idea theyd sooner stand in with the homestead boys still we can try it any way  it was about the same time that grant flung himself wearily into a chair in the great bare room at fremont ranch his face was haggard his eyes heavy for he had spent the greater part of several anxious days and nights endeavouring to curb the headstrong passions of his followers and riding through leagues of slushy snow  will you hurry tom up with the supper while i look through my letters he said  breckenridge went out and when he came back a little while later found grant with a strip of paper on his knee  more bad news he asked  grant made no answer but passed the strip of paper across to him and breckenridges pulses throbbed fast with anger as he read it is quite difficult to sit on both sides of the fence and the boys have no more use for you still there was a time when you did what you could for us and that is why i am giving you good advice sit tight at fremont and dont go out at nights  the consumed asses he said you see what he means they have gone after the herring clavering drew across the trail  the bronze grew darker in larrys face and his voice was hoarse yesthey figure the cattlemen have bought me over well there were points that would have drawn any mans suspicionsthe packet i would not give up to chiltonand as you mention miss torrances wallet still it hurts  breckenridge saw the veins swell up on his comrades forehead and the trembling of his hands dont worry about them they are beasts old man he said  grant said nothing for at least a minute and then clenched one lean brown hand i felt it would come and yet it has shaken most of the grit out of me i did what i could for themit was not easyand they have thrown me over that is hard to bear but theres more no man can tell now there is no one to hold them in how far they will go  breckenridges answer was to fling a cloth upon the table and lay out the plates grant sat very still his voice had been curiously even but his set face betrayed what he was feeling and there was something in his eyes that breckenridge did not care to see he also felt that there were troubles too deep for any blundering attempt at sympathy but the silence grew oppressive and by and by he turned to his companion again  well presume the fellow who wrote that means well he said what does his warning point to  grant smiled bitterly an attempt upon my homestead or my life and i have given them already rather more than either is worth to me he said  breckenridge was perfectly sensible that he was not shining in the rôle of comforter but he felt it would be something accomplished if he could keep his comrade talking he had discovered that verbal expression is occasionally almost a necessity to the burdened mind though larry was not greatly addicted to relief of that description  of course this campaign has cost you a good deal he said  probably five thousand dollarsall that seemed good in lifeand every friend i had  after all larry the thing may be no more than a joke or an attempt at bluff even admitting that it is not it probably only expresses the views of a few of the boys  grant shook his head no i believe it is quite genuine i saw how affairs were going even before i wouldnt give chilton the packet most of the boys were ready to break away then well one could scarcely blame them for not trusting me and i felt i was laying down my authority when i sent the stock train through  not blame them said breckenridge clenching his fist his eyes blazing where in the wide world would the crazy fools get another man like you but if you can take it quietly i ought to and the question is what are you going to do  what i can said grant hold the boys clear of trouble where it is possible there are still one or two who will stand behind me and what we cant do may be done for us when a man is badly wanted in this country he usually comes to the front and i will be glad to drop out when i see him  larry breckenridge said slowly i am younger than you are and i havent seen as much but it would be better for me if i had half your optimism still that was not quite what i was asking if the beasts actually mean to burn your place or attempt your life you are surely not going to give them the opportunity cant we fix up a guard among the few sensible men or send for the cavalry  grant smiled wearily as he shook his head no he said the one thing i cant do is to lift my hand against the men i brought here in a private quarrel  just then the cook came in with the supper and though the pair had eaten nothing since sunrise and ridden through soft snow most of that day it cost breckenridge an effort to clear the plate set before him grant scarcely touched the food and it was a relief to both when the meal was over and grants plate still halffilled was taken away after he had several times lighted a cigar and let it go out again breckenridge glanced at him deprecatingly  i cant keep it up any longer and i know how it is with you because i feel the thing myself he said now if you want me here ill stay but i have a notion the poor attempts at talk im making are only worrying you  grant smiled but breckenridge saw the answer in his face and went out hastily which was under the circumstances the wisest thing he could do then grant stretched his arms wearily above his head and a faint groan escaped him  it had to comebut it hurts he said     xxvi  larrys reward   late one night larry came home to fremont wet with rain and splashed with mire for it was thawing fast and he had ridden far he sloughed off his outer garments and turned to breckenridge who had been waiting him with a little weary smile  the dollars are safe any way and that is a big load off my mind he said gillot has them in his safe and nobody can touch them without a countersigned order from the executive  breckenridge heaved a sigh of relief for he knew that gillot who had a store in the railroad town was a determined man and quite capable of taking care of what had been entrusted him the dollars in question which had been raised by levy and sent by sympathizers had been placed in larrys hands to further the homesteaders objects in that district as he deemed advisable he had however for reasons breckenridge was acquainted with just relinquished the responsibility  i think you were wise said the lad it roused a good deal of feeling when you wouldnt let harper and his friends have what they asked for and the boys were very bitter at the meeting while you were away  well said grant drily i knew what they wanted those dollars for and if id had twice as many i would not have given them one  they could not have done much harm with the few they wanted and it would have saved you a good deal of unpleasantness i didnt like the way the boys were talking and it was quite plain the men who kept their heads were anxious in fact two or three of them offered to come over and sleep here until the dissatisfaction had simmered down  you did not accept their offer  no but i wish you would  grant shook his head it wouldnt suit me to own up that i was afraid of my friendsand i dont want to believe there are any of them who would injure me if there were i could not draw trigger on them in defence of my own property  then we will hope for the best said breckenridge somewhat doubtfully  grant who had had supper somewhere else presently retired and breckenridge who found the big room dreary without him followed a little later it was long before he slept for he had seen the temper of the more reckless spirits at the meeting he had attended and he could not shake off the memory of his comrades face larry had made no protest but breckenridge could understand what he was feeling the ranch was very quiet but he did not think his comrade slept in this however he was wrong for worn out by physical effort and mental strain larry had sunk into heavy slumber  two or three hours later breckenridge awakened suddenly he sat up listening still a little dazed with sleep but nothing disturbed the silence of the wooden building and it was a moment or two before the moan of the wind forced itself on his perceptions then he thought he heard the trampling of a horse and stealthy footsteps in the mire below and springing from his bed ran to the window the night was dark but he could dimly see a few shadowy figures moving towards the house in another minute he slipped into part of his clothing and hastening into grants room shook him roughly  get up there are men outside  larry was on his feet in a few seconds and struggling into his garments light the lamps downstairs he ordered  breckenridge stood still astonished that would give them an advantage they might be the sheriffs boys  no said larry with a laugh that sounded very bitter i dont think they are go down and do what i tell you  breckenridge went but his fingers shook so that he broke several sulphur matches in his haste before he had lighted one big lamp in the logbuilt hall then as he turned towards the living room there was a pounding on the door and while he stood irresolute grant partly dressed came running down the stairway two other men showed dimly behind him but breckenridge scarcely saw them for he sprang through the doorway into the unlighted room and the next moment fell over a table picking himself up with an objurgation he groped along the wall for the rack where the rifles stood and was making his way back towards the blink of light with two of them in his hands when a hoarse voice demanded admission and the door rattled under the blows showered upon it then as he came out into the hall grant turned to him  put those rifles down he said quietly  breckenridge stared at him but  put them down said grant with a little impatient gesture breckenridge let the weapons fall but he was pleased to see the cook who now stood at the foot of the stairway slip softly forward and pick up one of them grant was looking at the door and did not see the man move back halfway up the stairs as silently as he came  once more a hoarse shout rose from outside open that door before we break it in  for a moment or two as if to give point to the warning the door creaked and rattled as the axeheads beat upon it and then the din ceased suddenly for grant who recognized the voice raised his hand  open it for them he said so loudly that he could be heard outside  breckenridge was almost glad to obey it would have pleased him better to have taken his place rifle in hand with the cook on the stairway but since grant had evidently determined not to oppose the assailants entrance by violence it was a relief to do anything that would terminate the suspense still his heart throbbed painfully as he seized the bolt and he glanced round once more in what he felt was futile protest grant who evidently saw what he was thinking in his face only smiled a little and signed with his hand  breckenridge drew the bolt and sprang backwards as the door swung open men with axes and rifles showed up in the light but while here and there an axe flashed back a twinkling gleam or a face shone white the rest was blurred and shadowy and he could only see hazy figures moving against the blackness of the night his companion was standing alone in the middle of the hall motionless and impassive with nothing in his hands  now he said in a voice that jarred on breckenridges ears the door is open what do you want  we want you said one of the men outside  then ill come out and talk to you said grant  breckenridge laid a restraining hand upon his arm but he shook it off and moving forward stopped just outside the threshold the lad could not see his face but he noticed that he stood very straight with his head thrown back a trifle and that one or two of those without edged farther into the shadowy crowd glancing behind him he also saw the cook leaning forward on the stairway with the rifle glinting in his hands  well said grant and his voice rang commandingly  we have come for the dollars said a man we want them and theyre ours  then you must ask your committee for them they are not in my house  bluff said somebody and an angry clamour broke out  hand them out cried one voice before we burn the place for you  larry swung up one hand commandingly and breckenridge felt a thrill of pride when as if in tribute to his comrades fearlessness a sudden silence followed larry stood alone statuesque in poise with arm stretched out in the face of the hostile crowd and once more the respect the men had borne him asserted itself  you will listen to me boys and it may be the last time i shall speak to you he said you know that right back from the beginning i have done the best i could for you and now i feel it in me that if you will wait just a little longer the state will do more than i could ever do cant you understand that if you go round destroying railroadtrestles shooting cattle and burning ranches you are only playing into the hand of your enemies and the very men in the legislature who would if you kept your patience make your rights sure to you will be forced to turn the cavalry loose on you cant you sit tight another month or two instead of throwing all we have fought for away  the silence that followed the speech lasted for a space of seconds and then when breckenridge hoped grant might still impose prudence upon the crowd there were murmurs of doubt and suspicion they grew rapidly louder and a man stepped out from the rest  the trouble is that we dont believe in you larry he said you were with us solid one time but that was before the cattlebarons bought you  a derisive laugh followed and when grant turned a little breckenridge saw his face the bronze in it had faded and left paler patches that seemed almost grey while the lad who knew his comrades pride and uprightness fancied he could guess how that taunt made openly had wounded him  well he said very slowly i can only hope you will have more confidence in your next leader but i am on the list of the executive still and if the house was full of dollars i wouldnt give you one of them with which to make trouble that youll most surely be sorry for any way those i had are safe in a place where while your committee keep their heads you will not lay hands on them  a shout of disbelief was followed by uproar through which there broke detached cries pull him down he has them all the time pound them out of him burn the place down for a warning to the cattlemen  they died away when one of the men with emphatic gestures demanded attention moving out from the rest he turned to grant you have rifles and cartridges here and after all those are what we want the most nowand its your last chancehand them out  no said grant  the man made a little gesture of resignation boys he said you will have to go in and take them  grant still stood motionless and unyielding on his threshold but he had only a moments grace for the men outside surged on again and one swung a riflebutt over him breckenridge saw his comrade seize it and had sprung to his side when a rifle flashed on the stairway behind him and a man cried out and fell the next instant another riflebutt whirled and grant reeling sideways went down and was trampled on  breckenridge ran towards the rifle still lying in the hall but before he could reach it there was a roar of voices and a rush of feet and the men who poured in headlong were upon him something hard and heavy smote him in the face and as he reeled back gasping there was another flash on the stairway his head struck something and he was never sure of what happened during the next halfhour  when feeling very dizzy breckenridge raised himself in the corner where he had been lying the hall was empty save for two huddled figures in the doorway and while he blinked at them in a halfdazed fashion it seemed to him that a red glare which rose and fell shone in he could also smell burning wood and saw dim wreaths of smoke drive by outside his hearing was not especially acute just then but he fancied that men were trampling and apparently dragging furniture about all over the building then as his scattered senses came back to him he rose feebly to his feet and finding to his astonishment that he still possessed the power of locomotion walked unevenly towards the motionless objects in the doorway one of them as he expected was grant who was lying very white and still just as he had fallen  larry breckenridge said and shivered at the sound of his own voice larry  but there was no answer and breckenridge sat down by grants side with a little groan for his head swam once more and he felt a horrible coldness creeping over him how long he sat there while the smoke that rolled in from outside grew denser he did not know but by and by he was dimly conscious that the men were coming down the stairway they clustered about him and one of them stooping over the injured homesteader signed to his comrades  put him into the wagon and start off at once he said  three or four men came out from the rest and when they shuffled away with their burden the one who seemed to be leader pointed to grant as he turned to breckenridge  he would have it and the thump on the head he got would have put an end to most men he said still i dont figure you need worry about burying him just yet and i want a straight answer are those dollars in the house  breckenridge sat blinking at him a moment and then very shakily dragged himself to his feet and stood before the man with one hand clenched his face was white and drawn and there was a red smear on his forehead  if you would not believe the man who lies there will you take my word he said unevenly he told you they were not  i guess he spoke the truth said somebody any way we cant find them well what is to be done with him  breckenridge who was not quite himself laughed bitterly leave him where he is and go away you have done enough he said he gave you all he hadand i know as no other man ever will what it cost himand this is how you have repaid him  some of the men looked confused and the leader made a deprecatory gesture any way well give you a hand to put him where you want  breckenridge waved him back fiercely i am alone but none of you shall lay a hand on him while i can keep you off if you have left any life in him the touch of your fingers would hurt him more than anything  the other man seemed to have a difficulty in finding an answer and while he stared at breckenridge there was a trample of hoofs in the mire outside and a shout breckenridge could not catch its meaning but the men about him streamed out of the hall and he could hear them mounting in haste as the rapid beat of hoofs gradually died away looking up at a sound he saw the cook bending over his comrade the man seeing in his eyes the question he dared not ask shook his head  no i guess they havent killed him he said kind of knocked all the senses out of him and now ive let the rest out well get him to bed  the rest breckenridge asked bewildered  the man nodded yes he said i guess i got one or two of the homesteadboys and then charley and i lit out through a back window and slipped round to see why the stockboys werent coming it was quite simple the blame firebugs had put a man with a rifle at the door of their sleeping shed  three or four other men trooped in somewhat sheepishly though as the cook had explained it was not their fault they had arrived after the fight was over and while they carried their master upstairs breckenridge thought he heard another beat of hoofs he paid no great attention to it but when larry had been laid on the bed glanced towards the window at the streaks of flame breaking through the smoke that rolled about a birchlog building  what can be done he said  i dont know that we can do anything answered the cook the fire has got too good a holt but its not likely to light anything else the way the wind is it was one of them blame chicago rustlers put the firestick in  pshaw said breckenridge let it burn i mean what can be done for larry  we might give him some whiskeyonly we havent any still ive seen this kind of thing happen in the michigan lumbercamps and i guess hes most as well without it you want to give a mans brains time to settle down after theyve had a big shakeup  breckenridge sat down limply on the foot of the bed faint and dizzy and wondering if he really heard a regular rhythmic drumming through the snapping of the flame it grew louder while he listened and a faint musical jingling became audible with it  that sounds like cavalry the cook said they have been riding round and seen the blaze  and a few minutes later a voice rose sharply outside and some at least of the riders pulled up the cook at a sign from breckenridge went down and came back by and by with a man in bespattered blue uniform  captain cheyne united states cavalryat your service he said i am afraid i have come a trifle late to be of much use but a few of my men are trying to pick up the rustlers trail now how did that man get hurt and what is the trouble about  breckenridge told him as concisely as he could and cheynes bent over the silent figure on the bed  quietness is often good in these cases but there is such a thing as collapse following the shock and i guess by your friends face it might be well to try to rouse him he said have you any brandy  no said breckenridge it has been quite a time since we had that or any other luxuries in this house its owner stripped himself for the benefit of the men who did their best to kill him  cheyne brought out a flask this should do as well he said you can tell that man to boil some water and in the meanwhile help me to get the flask top into your partners mouth  it was done with some difficulty and breckenridge waited anxiously until a quiver ran through the motionless body then cheyne repeated the dose and larry gasped and slowly opened his eyes he said something the others could not catch and closed them again but breckenridge fancied a little warmth crept into his pallid skin  i guess that will do said cheyne in one or two of my stations we had to be our own field hospital but i dont know enough of surgery to take the responsibility of stirring up his circulation any further still when you can get them ready we will have hot bottles at his feet  my boys have got the fire under cheyne said coming in an hour later now i have been in the saddle most of the day and while your cook has promised to billet the boys ill have to ask you for shelter if you told me a little about what led up to this trouble it might pass the time  i dont see why i should breckenridge informed him  it could not hurt you any way suggested cheyne and it might do you good  breckenridge looked at him steadily and felt a curious confidence in the discretion of the quiet bronzefaced man as the result of it he told him a good deal more than he had meant to do when he commenced the story  i think you have done right cheyne said a little rough on him i had already figured he was that kind of a man well i hear the rest of the boys coming back and ill send up a sergeant who knows a good deal about these accidents to look after him  the sergeant came up by and by and kept watch with breckenridge for a while but after an hour or so breckenridges head grew very heavy and the sergeant taking his arm silenced his protests by nipping it and quietly put him out of the room when he awoke next morning he found that grant was capable at least of speech for cheyne was asking him questions and receiving very unsatisfactory answers  in fact said the cavalry officer you dont feel disposed to tell me who the men that tried to burn your place were or anything about them  no larry said feebly it would be pleasanter if you concluded i was not quite fit to talk just now  cheyne glanced at breckenridge who was watching him anxiously in that case i could not think of worrying you and have no doubt i can find out in the meanwhile i guess the best thing you can do is to go to sleep again  he drew breckenridge out of the room and shook hands with him if you are wanted ill send for you he said keep your comrade quiet and i should be astonished if he is not about again in a day or two  then he went down the stairway and swung himself into the saddle and with a rattle and jingle he and the men behind him rode away     xxvii  claverings last card   there was an impressive silence in hettys little drawingroom at cedar range when cheyne who had ridden there the day after he left fremont told his story he had expected attention but the effect his narrative produced astonished him hetty had softly pushed her chair back into the shadow where the light of the shaded lamp did not fall upon her but her stillness was significant he could however see miss schuyler and wondered what accounted for the impassiveness of her face now the colour that had flushed her cheek had faded the silence was becoming embarrassing when miss schuyler broke it  mr grant is recovering she asked  yes said cheyne he was coming round when i left him the blow might have been a dangerous one but i had a suspicion he had more than that to contend with  yes said hetty a little breathlessly  of course his affairs were not my business cheyne went on but it seemed to me the man had been living under a heavy strain and though we were strangers i could not help feeling a sympathy that almost amounted to a liking for him he must have found it trying when the men he had done his best for came round to burn his place but i understand he went out to speak to them with empty hands when they struck him down  what made them attack him asked miss schuyler  im not quite sure but i have an idea they were displeased because he did not countenance their attempt to wreck the cattletrain then i believe he held some dollars in trust for them and as they presumably wanted them for some fresh outrage would not give them up mr grant is evidently a man with a sense of responsibility  hetty looked up suddenly yes she said he would have let them tear him to pieces before he gave them one  cheyne noticed the faint ring in her voice and fancied it would have been plainer had she not laid a restraint upon herself a vague suspicion he had brushed away once more crept into his mind  well he said slowly watching hetty the while i fancy the efforts he made to save your friends stock will cost him a good deal the point is that a man of his abilities must have recognized it at the time  hetty met his glance and cheyne saw the little glow in her eyes do you think that would have counted for anything with such a man  cheyne made a little gesture of negation that in a curious fashion became him no that is i do not believe he would have let it influence him  that said miss schuyler is a very comprehensive admission  cheyne smiled i dont know that i could desire a higher tribute paid to me might one compliment you both on your evident desire to be fair to your enemies  he saw the faint flush in hettys face and was waiting with a curious expectancy for her answer when torrance came in he appeared grimly pleased at something as he signed to cheyne  his friends have burned the rascal out he said well i dont know that we could have hoped for anything better but i want to hear what you can tell me about it you will have to spare me captain cheyne for a little hetty  cheyne rose and went away with him while when the door closed behind them hettywho had seen the vindictive satisfaction in her fathers faceturned to her companion with a flash of imperious anger in her eyes  flo she said how can he its wicked of him  miss schuyler checked her with a gesture any way he is your father  hetty flushed but the colour faded and left her face white again well she said clavering isnt and it is he who has made him so bitter against larry flo its horrible they would have been glad if the boys had killed him and when hes ill and wounded they will not let me go to him  her voice broke and trembled and flora schuyler laid a hand restrainingly upon her arm of course but why should you hetty  hetty who shook off her grasp rose and stood quivering a little but very straight looking down on her with pride and a curious hardness in her eyes  you dont know she said then ill tell you because there is nobody like larry and never will be because i love him better than i ever fancied i could love anybody andthough its most wonderfulhe has loved me and waited ever so patiently now they are all against him im going to him flo they have most made me hate them the people i belong to and i think if i was a man i could kill clavering  flora schuyler sat very still a moment but it was fortunate she retained her composure whatever she may have felt for hetty was in a mood for any rashness stretching out her hand she drew the girl down beside her with a forceful gentleness  hetty she said i think i know how such a man as larry is would feel and you want him to be proud of you well there are things that neither he nor you could do and you must listen to me quietly  she reasoned with the girl for a while until hetty shook the passion from her  of course you are right flo she said and her voice was even if he could bear all that i can be patient too larry has had ever so many hard things to do but it is only because it would not be fair to him im not going to him now flo you will not leave me until the troubles through  miss schuyler turned and kissed her and then rising quietly went out of the room she had shown hetty her duty to larry which she felt would be more convincing just then than an exposition of what she owed her father and had reasons for desiring solitude to grapple with affairs of her own what she had done had cost her an effort but flora schuyler was fond of hetty and recognized the obligation of the bond she was contracting when she made a friend  some minutes had passed when hetty rose and took down her writingcase from a shelf she could at least communicate with larry for the maid who had more than one admirer among the cowboys had found a means by which letters could be conveyed but the girl could not command her thoughts and written sympathy seemed so poor and cold a thing two letters were written and flung into the stove for flora schuylers counsel was bearing fruit and she had commenced two more when there was a tapping at the door hetty looked up with a little flash in her eyes and swept the papers into the writingcase as clavering came in then she rose and stood looking at him very coldly  it was an especially unfortunate moment for the man to approach her in and though he did not know why it should be so he recognized it but there were reasons that made any further procrastination distinctly unadvisable  there is something i have been wanting to tell you for a long time hetty he said  it would be better for you to wait a little longer the girl said chillingly i dont feel inclined to listen to anything tonight  the trouble said clavering who spoke the truth is that i cant it has hurt me to keep silent as long as i have done already  he saw the hardening of hettys lips and knew that he had blundered but he was committed now and could only obey when she said with a gesture of weariness then go on  the abrupt command would probably have disconcerted most men and effectually spoiled the appeal they meant to make and claverings face flushed as he recognized its ludicrous aspect still he could not withdraw then and he made the best of a difficult position with a certain gracefulness which might under different circumstances have secured him a modicum of consideration as it was however hettys anger left her almost white and there was a light he did not care to see in her eyes when she turned towards him  i am glad you have told me this she said since nothing else would convince you it will enable me to talk plainly i dont consider it an honournot in the least cant you see that it is wholly and altogether out of the question that i should ever think in that way of you  clavering gasped and the darker colour that was in his cheek showed in his forehead too hetty reminded him very much of her father thenand he had witnessed one or two displays of the cattlebarons temper  i admit that i have a good many shortcomings but since you ask i must confess that i dont quite understand why my respectful offer should rouse your indignation  no said hetty coldly with the vindictive sparkle still in her eyes then arent you very foolish  clavering smiled though it was not easy well he said i was evidently too audacious but you have not told me yet why the proposal i ventured to make should appear quite preposterous  i think said hetty it would be considerably nicer for you if i didnt i can however tell you thisi would never under any circumstances marry you  clavering bent his head and took himself away with the best grace he could while hetty who perhaps because she had been under a heavy strain became suddenly sensible of a most illogical desire to laugh afterwards admitted that he really accomplished it becomingly but the laughter that would have been a relief to her did not come and after toying in a purposeless fashion with her writingcase she rose and slipped out of the room unfortunately leaving it open  a few minutes later clavering met the maid in the corridor that led to torrances room and the girl who saw his face and may have guessed what had brought the anger into his eyes stopped a moment it is also probable that being a young woman with quick perceptions she had guessed with some correctness how far his regard for hetty went  you dont seem pleased tonight she said  no said clavering with a little laugh which rang hollow well i should be it is quite a while since i had a talk with you  pshaw said the girl who failed to blush though she wished to watching him covertly now i wonder if what im going to tell you will make you more angry still suppose you heard miss torrance had been sending letters to larry grant  i dont know that i should believe it said clavering as unconcernedly as he could  well she has the girl said what is more she has been going out to meet him in the cedar bluff  claverings face betrayed him and for a moment the girl who saw his lips set was almost afraid he contrived however to make a light answer and was about to ask a question when a door creaked the next moment torrance came out into the corridor and claverings opportunity vanished with the maid torrance who had evidently not seen her kept him talking for a while  in the meanwhile the girl contrived an excuse for entering the room where she was quite aware hetty and clavering had met she did not find her mistress but as it happened noticed the writingcase and having a stake in affairs opened it inside she found two sheets of paper and after considering the probabilities of detection appropriated one of them on which was written larry dear  she had however no intention of showing it to clavering just then but deciding that such a paper might be worth a good many dollars to the person who knew how to make use of it she slipped it into her pocket and went out into the hall where she saw him talking to torrance as she watched they shook hands and clavering swung himself on to the back of a horse somebody led up to the door it was two or three weeks before he came back again and was led straight to the room where torrance and some of his neighbours were sitting clavering took his place among the rest and watched the faces that showed amidst the blue cigarsmoke some were intent and eager a few very grim but the stamp of care was on all of them save that of torrance who sat immobile and expressionless at the head of the table allonby was speaking somewhat dejectedly  it seems to me that we have only gone round he said it has cost us more dollars than any of us care to reckon and i for one am tolerably near the end of my tether  so are the homesteadboys we can last them out and we have got to said somebody  allonby raised his hand with a little hopeless gesture im not quite sure but what i want to show you is that we have come back to the place we started from when we first met here we decided that it was advisable to put down larry grant and though we have not accomplished it yet it seems to me more necessary than ever just now  i dont understand you said one of the younger men larrys boys have broken loose from him and he cant worry anybody much alone  torrance glanced at allonby with a sardonic twinkle in his eyes that sounds very like sense he said  well said allonby drily it isnt and i think you know it at least as well as i do it is because the boys have broken out we want to get our thumb on larry  there was a little murmur of bewilderment for men were present that night who had not attended many meetings of the district committee  you will have to make it plainer somebody said  allonby glanced at torrance who nodded and then went on now i know that what i am going to tell you does not sound nice and a year ago i would have had unpleasant thoughts of the man who suggested any course of that kind to me but we have got to go under or pull down the enemy the legislature are beginning to look at things with the homesteaders eyes and what we want is popular sympathy we lost a good chance of getting it over the stocktrain larry was too clever for us again and that brings me to the point which should be quite plain the homesteadboys have lost their heads and will cut their own throats if they are let alone they are ripe for ranchburning and firing on the cavalry and once they start the state will have to step in and whip them out for us  but where does larry come in asked somebody  that said clavering is quite easy so long as larry is loose he will have a following and somehow he will hear of and stop their wildest moves as most of you know i dont like him but larry is not a fool  to be quite plain we are to cut out the restraining influence and give the rabble a free hand to let loose anarchy said one man then you can strike me off the roll that is a kind of meanness that wouldnt suit me  there were murmurs of approval from one or two of the company but torrance checked them gentlemen he said we must win or be beaten and get no mercy you cant draw back and the first step is to put larry down if the state had backed us we would have made an end of the trouble and it is most square and fitting they should have the whipping of the rabble forced upon them now are we cavalry troopers or a sheriffs posse to do their work for them and be kicked by way of thanks they would not nip the trouble when they could and well sit tight and watch them try to crush it when its most too big for them  again there was a murmur of grim approval this time but one of the objectors rose with an ironical smile  you have made a very poor show at catching larry so far he said are you quite sure the thing is within your ability  i guess it is said torrance sharply he is living at his homestead and we need not be afraid of a hundred men with rifles coming to take him from us now  he has a few neighbours who believe in him one of the men said they are not rabble but levelheaded americans with the hardest kind of grit in them it wouldnt suit us to be whipped again  clavering stood up with his eyes fixed on torrance i agree with our leaderit can be done in fact i quite believe we can lay our hands on larry alone he said can i have a word with you mr torrance  torrance nodded and leaving allonby speaking led clavering into an adjoining room sit down and get through as quick as you can he said  for five minutes clavering spoke rapidly in a slightly strained voice and a dark flush spread across the old mans face and grew deeper on his forehead from which the veins swelled it had faded before he finished and there were paler patches in the cattlebarons cheeks when he struck the table with his fist  clavering he said hoarsely if you are deceiving me you are not going to find a hole in this country that would hide you  clavering contrived to meet his gaze though it was difficult i was very unwilling to mention it he said still if you will call miss torrances maid and the man who grooms her horses you can convince yourself it would be better if i was not present when you talk to them  torrance said nothing but pointed to the door and when the maid and man he sent for had gone sat for five long minutes rigidly still with a set white face and his hands clenched on the table  my daughterplaying the traitressand worse it is too hard to bear he said  then he stood up shaking the passion from him when clavering came in and holding himself very stiff and square turned to him  i dont know why you have told menowand do not want to hear he said still by the lord who made us both if you try to make use of this knowledge for any purpose or let a whisper get about ill crush you utterly  have i deserved these threats sir  torrance looked at him steadily did you expect thanks the man who grooms her horses would tell me nothinghe lied like a gentleman but they are not threats you found buying up mortgageswith our dollarsan easy game  but said clavering  torrance stopped him with a little scornful gesture i knew when i took this thing up i would have to let my scruples go and nowwhile i wonder whether my hands will ever feel clean againim going through you are useful to the committee and ill have to tolerate you  clavering turned away with pulses throbbing furiously and rage in his heart though he had known what the cost would be when he staked everything he hoped for on larrys destruction while his neighbours noticed a change in torrance when he once more sat down at the head of the table he seemed several years older and his face was very grim  i believe i can promise you that larry will make us no more trouble he said mr clavering has a workable scheme and it will only need the sheriff and a few men whom i will choose when i am ready  nobody seemed to consider it advisable to ask questions and the men dispersed but as they went down the stairway allonby turned to torrance  this thing is getting too big for you and me he said you have not complained but tonight one could fancy that its breaking you now im not made like you and when i think of what it has cost me i have got to talk  torrance turned and allonby shivered as he met his eyes  it has cost me what every dollar i ever made could not buy me back he said and the damp showed on his forehead as he checked a groan     xxviii  larry rides to cedar   a soft wind swept the prairie which was now bare of snow larry rode down the trail that led through the cedar bluff he was freely sprinkled with mire for spring had come suddenly and the frostbleached sod was soft with the thaw and when he pulled up on the wooden bridge to wait until breckenridge who appeared among the trees should join him the river swirled and frothed beneath it had lately burst its icy chains and came roaring down seamed by lines of foam and strewn with great fragments of halfmelted snowcake that burst against the quivering piles  running strong said breckenridge still the water has not risen much yet and as i crossed the big rise i saw two of torrances cowboys apparently screwing up their courage to try the ford  it might be done said larry we have one horse at fremont that would take me across the snow on the ranges is not melting yet and the ice will be tolerably firm on the deep reaches but its scarcely likely that we will want to swim the cedar now  no said breckenridge with a laugh the bridge is good enough for me by the way i have a note for you  a note said larry with a slight hardening of his face for of late each communication that reached him had brought him fresh anxieties  well said breckenridge drily i scarcely think this one should worry you from the fashion in which it reached me i have a notion its from a lady  there was a little gleam in larrys eyes when he took the note and breckenridge noticed that he was very silent as they rode on when they reached fremont he remained a while in the stable and when at last he entered the house breckenridge glanced at him questioningly  you have something on your mind he said what have you been doing larry  grant smiled curiously giving the big bay a rub down im riding to cedar range tonight  have you lost your head breckenridge stared at him muller saw the sheriff riding in this morning and its more than likely he is at the range you are wanted rather more badly than ever just now larry  grants face was quietly resolute as he took out the note and passed it to his companion i have tried to do my duty by the boys but i am going to cedar tonight  breckenridge opened the note which had been written the previous day and read in haste come to the bluff beneath the rangealonenine tomorrow night  then he stared at the paper in silence until grant who watched him almost jealously took it from him yes he said though his face was thoughtful of course you must go you are quite sure of the writing  grant smiled as it were compassionately i would recognize it anywhere  well said breckenridge significantly that is perhaps not very astonishing though i fancy some folks would find it difficult the in haste no doubt explains the thing but it seems to me the last of it does not quite match the heading  it is smearedthrust into the envelope wet larry said  breckenridge rose and walked with no apparent purpose across the room larry he said tom and i will come with you noyou wait a minute of course i know there are occasions on which ones friends company is superfluousdistinctly so but we could pull up and wait behind the bluffquite a long way off you know  i was told to come alone larry turned upon him sharply  breckenridge made a gesture of resignation then im not going to stay here most of the night by myself its doleful ill ride over to mullers now  will it be any livelier there  breckenridge wondered whether larry had noticed anything unusual in his voice and managed to laugh a little he said the fräulein is pretty enough in the lamplight to warrant one listening to a good deal about menotti and the franc tireurs she makes really excellent coffee too and he slipped out before grant could ask any more questions  darkness was just closing down when the latter rode away there was very little of the prairie broncho in the big horse beneath him whose sire had brought the best blood that could be imported into that country and he had examined every buckle of girth and headstall as he fastened them he also rode for lightness in a thin deerskin jacket which fitted him closely with a rifle across his saddle gazing with keen eyes across the shadowy waste when now and then a halfmoon came out once he also drew bridle and sat still a minute listening for he fancied he heard the distant beat of hoofs and then went on with a little laugh at his credulity the cedar was roaring in its hollow and the birches moaning in a bluff but as the damp wind that brought the blood to his cheeks sank there was stillness save for the sound of the river and grant decided that his ears had deceived him  it behooved him to be cautious for he knew the bitterness of the cattlemen against him and the sheriffs writ still held good but hetty had sent for him and if his enemies had lain in wait in every bluff and hollow he would have gone  while he rode troubled by vague apprehensions which now and then gave place to exultation that set his heart throbbing hetty sat with miss schuyler in her room at cedar range an occasional murmur of voices reached them faintly from the big hall below where torrance and some of his neighbours sat with the sheriff over their cigars and wine and the girls knew that a few of the most daring horsemen among the cowboys had their horses saddled ready hetty lay in a low chair with a book she was not reading on her knee and miss schuyler glancing at her now and then over the embroidery she paid almost as little attention to noticed the weariness in her face and the anxiety in her eyes she laid down her needle when torrances voice came up from below  what can they be plotting hetty she said horses ready that most unpleasant sheriff smiling cunningly as he did when i passed him talking to clavering and the sense of expectancy its there one could hear it in their voices even if one had not seen their faces and when i met your father at the head of the stairs he almost frightened me of course he was not theatricalhe never isbut i know that set of his lips and look in his eyes and have more than a fancy it means trouble for somebody i suppose he has not told you anythingin fact he seems to have kept curiously aloof from both of us lately  hetty turned towards her with a little spot of colour in her cheek and apprehension in her eyes  so you have noticed it too she said very slowly of course he has been busy and often away while i know how anxious he must be but when he is at home he scarcely speaks to meand then there is something in his voice that hurts me im most afraid he has found out that i have been talking to larry  miss schuyler smiled well she said thatalonewould not be such a very serious offence  the crimson showed plainer in hettys cheek and there was a faint ring in her voice flo she said dont make me angryi cant bear it tonight something is going to happeni can feel it isand you dont know my father even yet he is so horribly quiet and im afraid of as well as sorry for him it is a long while ago but he looked just as he does nowonly not quite so grimduring my mothers last illness oh i know there is something worrying him and he will not tell methough he was always kind before even when he was angry flo this horrible trouble cant go on for ever  hetty had commenced bravely but she faltered as she proceeded and miss schuyler who saw her distress had risen and was standing with one hand on her shoulder when the maid came in she cast a hasty glance at her mistress and appeared flora schuyler fancied embarrassed and desirous of concealing it  mr torrance will excuse you coming down again she said he may have some of the sheriffs men and one or two of the cowboys in and would sooner you kept your room are you likely to want me in the next halfhour  no said hetty no doubt you are anxious to find out what is going on  the maid went out and miss schuyler fixed anxious eyes on her companion what is the matter with the girl hetty she asked  i dont know did you notice anything  yes i think she had something on her mind any way she was unexplainably anxious to get away from you  hetty smiled somewhat bitterly then she is only like the rest everybody at cedar is anxious about something now  flora schuyler rose and flinging the curtains behind her looked out at the night the moon was just showing through a rift in the driving cloud and she could see the bluff roll blackly down to the white frothing of the river she also saw a shadowy object slipping through the gloom of the trees and fancied it was a woman but when another figure appeared for a moment in the moonlight the first one came flitting back again  i believe the girl has gone out to meet somebody in the bluff she said  hetty made a little impatient gesture it doesnt concern us any way  miss schuyler sat down again and made no answer though she had misgivings and five or ten minutes passed silently until there was a tapping at the door and the maid came in very white in the face she clutched at the nearest chairback and stood still apparently incapable of speech until with a visible effort she said somebody must go and send him away he is waiting in the bluff  hetty rose with a little scream but flora schuyler was before her and laid her hand upon the maids arm  now try to be sensible she said sternly who is in the bluff  the girl shivered it is not my faulti didnt know what they wanted until the sheriff came i tried to tell him but joe saw me go right now and send him away  hetty was very white and trembling but flora schuyler nipped the maids arm  keep quiet and answer just what we ask you she said who is in the bluff  mr grant said the girl with a gasp but dont ask me anything send him away theyll kill him oh you are hurting me  flora schuyler shook her how did he come there  i took miss torrances letter and wrote the rest of it i didnt know they meant to do him any harm but they made me write i had tohe said he would marry me  the maid writhed in an agony of fear but she stood still shivering when hetty turned towards her with a blanched face that emphasized the ominous glow in her dark eyes  you wicked woman she said how dare you tell me that  i mean mr clavering oh  the maid stopped abruptly for flora schuyler drove her towards the door go and undo your work she said slip down at the back of the bluff  i darenti tried and the girl quivered in miss schuylers grasp if i could have warned him i would not have told you but joe saw me and i was afraid i told him to come at nine  it was evident that she was capable of doing very little just then and flora schuyler drew her out into the corridor  go straight to your room and stay there she said and closing the door glanced at hetty it is quite simple this woman has taken your notepaper and written larry he is in the bluff now and i think she is right your friends mean to make him prisoner or shoot him  stop and go away said hetty hoarsely i am going to him  flora schuyler placed her back to the door and raised her hand no she said very quietly it would be better if i went in place of you sit down and dont lose your head hetty  hetty seized her arm you canthow could i let you larry belongs to me let me go every minute is worth ever so much  there are twenty of them yet he has come too early said flora schuyler with a glance at the clock any way you must understand what you are going to do it was clavering arranged this but your father knew what he was doing and i think he knows everything if you leave this house tonight hetty everybody will know you warned larry and it will make a great difference to you it will gain you the dislike of all your friends and place a barrier between you and your father which i think will never be taken away again  hetty laughed a very bitter laugh and then grew suddenly quiet  stand aside flo she said nobody but larry wants me now  miss schuyler saw that she was determined and drew aside then she said with a little quiver in her voice because i think he is in peril you must go my dear but we must be very careful and i am coming with you as far as i dare  she closed the door and then her composure seemed to fail her as they went out into the corridor and it was hetty who treading very softly took the lead flitting like shadows they reached the head of the stairway and stopped a moment there hettys heart beating furiously the passage beneath them was shadowy but a blaze of light and a jingle of glasses came out of the halfopened door of the hall where torrance sat with his guests and while they waited they heard his voice and recognized the vindictive ring in it hetty trembled as she grasped the bannister  flo she said they may come out in a minute we have got to slip by somehow  they went down the stairway with skirts drawn close about them in swift silence and hetty held her breath as she flitted past the door there was a faint swish of draperies as flora schuyler followed her but the murmur of voices drowned it and in another minute hetty had opened a door at the back of the building then she gasped with relief as she felt the cold wind on her face and with miss schuyler close behind her crept through the shadow of the house towards the bluff when the gloom of the trees closed about them she clutched her companions shoulder  no she said hoarsely not that way joe is watching there we must go right through the bluff and down the opposite side of it  they floundered forward sinking ankledeep in withered leaves and clammy mould tripping over rotting branches that ripped their dresses and stumbling into dripping undergrowth there was no moon now and it was very dark and more than once flora schuyler valiantly suppressed the scream that would have been a vast relief to her and struggled on as silently as she could behind her companion but it seemed to her that anybody a mile away could have heard them then a little trail led them out of the bluff on the opposite side to the house and the roar of the river grew louder as they hastened on still in the gloom of the trees until something a little blacker than the shadows behind it grew into visibility and when it moved a little flora schuyler touched hettys arm  yes she said it is larry if i didnt know the kind of man he is i would not let you go kiss me hetty  hetty stood still a second for she understood and then very quietly put both hands on flora schuylers shoulders and kissed her  it cant be very wrong and you have been a good friend flo she said  she turned and flora schuyler standing still saw her slim figure flit across a strip of frostbleached sod as the moon shone through     xxix  hetty decides   it was in a pale flash of silvery light that larry saw the girl against the gloom of the trees the moaning of the birches and roar of the river drowned the faint sound her footsteps made and she came upon him so suddenly statuesque and slender in her trailing evening dress and etherealized by the moonlight that as he looked down on the blanched whiteness of her upturned face emphasized by the dusky hair he almost fancied she had materialized out of the harmonies of the night for a moment he sat motionless with the rifle glinting across his saddle and a tightening grip of the bridle as the big horse flung up its head and then with a sudden stirring of his blood moved his foot in the stirrup and would have swung himself down if hetty had not checked him  no she said back into the shadow of the trees  larry seeing the fear in her face touched the horse with his heel and wheeled it with its head towards the house he could see the warm gleam from the windows between the birches then he turned to the girl who stood gasping at his stirrup  you sent for me dear and i have come cant you give me just a minute now he said  no said hetty breathlessly you must go the sheriff is here waiting for you  larry laughed a little scornful laugh and slackening the bridle sat still looking down on her very quietly  i dont understand he said you sent for me  no the girl again gasped oh larry go away clavering and the others who are most bitter against you are in the house  instinctively larry moved his hand on the rifle and glanced towards the building he could see it dimly but no sound from it reached him and hetty looking up saw his face grow stern  still he persisted with a curious quietness somebody sent a note to me  yes said hetty turning away from him it was my wicked maid clavering laid the trap for you  the man sat very still a moment and then bent with a swift resoluteness towards his companion  and you came to warn me he said hetty dear look up  hetty glanced at him and saw the glow in his eyes but she clenched her hand and would have struck the horse in an agony of fear if larry had not touched him with his heel and swung a pace away from her  oh she gasped why will you waste time larry they will kill you if they find you  once more the little scornful smile showed upon grants lips but it vanished and hetty saw only the light in his eyes  listen a moment dear he said i have tried to do the square thing but i think tonights work relieves me of the obligation hetty cant you see that your father would never give you to me and you must choose between us sooner or later i have waited a long while and would try to wait longer if it would relieve you of the difficulty but you will have to make the decision and it cant be harder now than it would be in the future promise me you will go back to new york with miss schuyler and stay with her until i come for you  hetty trembled visibly and the moonlight showed the crimson in her cheeks but she looked up at him bravely larry she said you are surequite sureyou want me and will be kind to me  the man bent his head solemnly my dear i have longed for you for eight weary yearsand i think you could trust me  then and hettys voice was very uneven though she still met his eyes larry you can take me now  larry set his lips for a moment and his face showed curiously white think my dear he said hoarsely it would not be fair to you miss schuyler will take you away in a week or two and i will come for you i dare not do anything you may be sorry for and they may find you are not in the house you must go home before my strength gives way  the emotion she had struggled with swept hetty away go home she said passionately they wanted to kill youand i can never go back now if i did they would know i had warned youand believecant you understand larry  then the situation flashed upon grant and he recognized as hetty had done that she had cast herself adrift when she left the house to warn him he knew the cattlebarons vindictiveness and that his daughter had committed an offence he could not forgive that left but one escape from the difficulty and it was the one his own passions which he had striven to crush down urged him to  then he said in a strained voice you must come with me we can be married tomorrow  hetty held up her hands to him i am ready oh be quick they may come any minute  larry swept his glance towards the house and saw a shaft of radiance stream out as the great door opened then he heard flora schuylers voice and leaning downwards from the saddle grasped both the girls hands  yes he said very quietly they are coming now spring when i lift you your foot on my footi have you  it was done hetty was active and slender the man muscular and both had been taught not only to ride but master the halfwild broncho by a superior daring and an equal agility in a land where the horse is not infrequently roped and thrown before it is mounted but larry breathed hard as with his arm about her waist he held the girl in front of him and felt her cheek hot against his lips the next moment he pressed his heels home and the big horse swung forward under its double burden  a shout rang out behind them and there was a crackling in the bluff then a rifle flashed and just as a cloud drove across the moon another cry rose up  quit firing he has the girl with him  larry fancied he could hear men floundering behind him amidst the trees and a trampling of hoofs about the house but as he listened another rifle flashed away to the right of them on the prairie and a beat of hoofs followed it that for a moment puzzled him he laughed huskily  breckenridge hell draw them off he said hold fast we have got to face the river  it was very evident that he had not a second to lose mounted men were crashing recklessly through the bluff and more of them riding at a gallop across the grassy slope but the darkness hid them as it hid the fugitives and the big horse held on until there was a plunge and a splashing and they were in the river larry slipped from the saddle and hetty saw him floundering by the horses head as she thrust her foot into the stirrup  slack your bridle he said sharply the beast will bring us through  the command came when it was needed for hetty was almost dismayed and its curtness was bracing there was no moon now but she could dimly see the white swirling of the flood and the gurgling roar of it throbbed about her hoarse and threatening suggesting the perils the darkness hid her light skirt trailed in the water and a shock of icy cold ran through her as one shoe dipped under larry was on his feet yet but there was a fierce white frothing about him and when in another pace or two he slipped down she broke into a stifled scream the next moment she saw his face again faintly white beneath her amidst the sliding foam and fancied that he was swimming or being dragged along the horse she felt had lost its footing and had its head up stream how long this lasted she did not know but it seemed an interminable time and the dull roar of the water grew louder and deafened her while the blackness that closed in became insupportable  larry she gasped larry are you there  a faintly heard voice made answer and grant appeared again shoulderdeep in the flood while the dipping and floundering of the beast beneath her showed that the hoofs had found uncertain hold but that relief only lasted a moment and they were once more sliding downstream until when they swung round in an eddy the head that showed now and then dimly beside her stirrup was lost altogether and in an agony of terror the girl cried aloud  there was no answer but after a horrible moment or two had passed a halfseen arm and shoulder rose out of the flood and the sudden drag on the bridle that slipped from her fingers was very reassuring the horse plunged and floundered and once more hetty felt her dragging skirt was clear of the water  through the worst a voice that reached her faintly said and they were splashing on again the water growing shallower all the time until they scrambled out upon the opposite bank then the man checking the horse stood by her stirrup pressing the water from the hem of her skirt rubbing the little open shoe with his handkerchief which was saturated even in that hour of horror hetty laughed  larry she said dont be ridiculous you couldnt dry it that way in a week lift me down instead  larry held up his hands to her for on that side of the river the slope to the level was steep and when he swung her down the girl kissed him lightly on either cheek  that was because of what we have been through dear she said there was a horrible moment when i could not see you anywhere  she stopped and held up her hand as though listening and larry laughed softly as a faint drumming of hoofs came back to them through the roar of the flood  breckenridge he must have muller or somebody with him and they are chasing him he said i didnt know he was following me but he is gaining us valuable time and we will push on again your friends will find out they are following the wrong man very soon but we should get another horse at mullers before they can ride round by the bridge  they scrambled up the slope and after hetty mounted larry ran with his hand on the stirrup for a while until once more he made the staunch beast carry a double load he was running again when they came clattering up to mullers homestead and the fräulein who was apparently alone stared at them in astonishment when she opened the door the water still dripped from larry and hettys light bedraggled dress clung about her while the moisture trickled from her little openfronted shoes she was hatless and loosened wisps of dusky hair hung low about her face which turned faintly crimson under the fräuleins gaze  miss torrance exclaimed the girl  well said larry quietly she will be mrs grant tomorrow if you will lend me a horse and not mention the fact that you have seen us when torrances boys come round where is your father  miss muller nodded with comprehending sympathy he two hours since with mr breckenridge go she said there is new horse in the stable and you on the rack a saddle for lady find  larry was outside in a moment and a smile crept into the fräuleins blue eyes he is of the one thing at the time alone enabled to think she said it is so with the man but a dress with the water soaked is not convenient to ride at night in  she led hetty into her own room and when larry who had spent some time changing one of the saddles came back he stared in astonishment at hetty who sat at the table she now wore among other garments that were too big for her a fur cap and coarse serge skirt there was a steaming cup of coffee in front of her  now that shows how foolish one can be he said i was clean forgetting about the clothes but we must start again  hetty rose up and with a little blush held out the cup you are wet to the neck larry and it will do you good she said if you dont mindwe neednt wait until miss muller gets another cup  larrys eyes gleamed i have run over most of europe but they grow no wine there that was half as nice as the tea we made in the black can back there in the bluff quite often in those days we hadnt a cup at all  he drank and forthwith turned his head away while a quiver seemed to run through him but when hetty moved towards him the fräulein laughed  it nothing is she said it is perhaps the effect tobacco have but the mouth is soft in a man  then as larry turned towards them she laid her hands on hettys shoulders and kissed her gravely you have trust in him she said it is of no use afraid to be i quick take a man like mr grant when he ask me  the next moment they were outside and when he helped her to the saddle hetty glanced shyly at her companion the fräulein is right she said but larry will you tell mewhere we are going  to windsor i have still good friends there that is the prosaic fact but there is ever so much behind it we cant see the trail just now dear but we are riding out into the future that has all kinds of brightness in store  a silvery gleam fell on the girl as a billow of cloud rolled slowly from a rift of blue and she laughed almost exultantly  larry she said it is coming true of course its a portent theres the darkness going and the moon shining through oh i have done with misgiving now  she shook the bridle and swept from him at a gallop and the thawsoftened sod was whirling in clods behind them when larry drew level with her he knew it was not prudent but the fever in his blood mastered his reason and he sent the stockriders cry ringing across the levels as they sped on through the night the damp wind screamed by them lashing their hot cheeks the beat of hoofs swelled into a roar as they swept through a shadowy bluff and driving cloud and rift of indigo flitted past above beneath the long frostbleached levels gleaming silvery grey now under the moon flitted back to the drumming hoofs while willow clump and straggling birches rose up and rushed by blurred and shadowy  they were young and the cares that must be faced again on the morrow had for a brief space fallen from them they had bent to the strain to the breaking point and now it had gone everything was forgotten but the love each bore the other all senses were merged in it and while the exaltation lasted there was no room for thought or fear it was however the man who remembered first for a few dark patches caught his eye when they went at a headlong gallop down the slope  pull him he cried hoarsely ware badger holes swing to the rightwide  the girl swerved but she still held on with loose bridle until larry swaying in his saddle clutched at it then as he swung upright half a length ahead with empty hands she flung herself a trifle backwards and there was a brief struggle but it was at a trot they climbed the opposite slope  now she said with a happy little laugh we are sensible once more but while i knew it couldnt last i wanted to gallop on for ever larry i wonder if we will ever feel just the same again there are enjoyments that cant come to anyone more than once  there are others one can have all the time and well think of them tonight said the man there are bright days before us and we can wait until they come  hetty smiled almost sadly of course she said but no bright day can be quite the same as this moonlight to me it shone down on us when i rode out into the night and darkness without knowing where i was going and only that you were beside me you will stay there always now  they held on across the empty waste while the hours of darkness slipped by and the sun was rising red above the great levels rim when the roofs of a wooden town rose in front of them as the frame houses slowly grew into form hetty painfully straightened herself her face was white and weary and it was by a strenuous effort she held herself upright the big horse limped a little and the mire was spattered thick upon her but she met the mans eyes and though her lips trembled smiled bravely  larry saw and understood and his face grew grave i have a good deal to make up to you hetty and i will try to do it faithfully he said still we will look forward with hope and courage nowit is our wedding day  hetty glanced away from him across the prairie and the man fancied he saw her fingers tremble on the bridle  it is hard to ask you larrythough i know it shouldnt bebut have you a few dollars that you could give me  the man smiled happily all that is mine is yours and as it happens i have two or three bills in my wallet is there anything you wish to buy  hetty glanced down flushing at the bedraggled dress larry she said softly i couldnt marry you like this i havent one dollar in my pocketand i am coming to you with nothing dear  the smile faded out of larrys eyes i scarcely dare remember all that you have given up for me and if you had taken clavering or one of the others you would have ridden to your wedding with a hundred men behind you as rich as a princess  hetty sitting jaded and bespattered on the limping horse flashed a swift glance at him and smiled out of slightly misty eyes  it happened she said that i was particular or fanciful and there was only one manthe one that would take me without a dollar in borrowed clotheswho seemed good enough for me  they rode on past a stockyard and into a rutted street of bare frame houses and hetty was glad they scarcely met anybody then larry helped her down and thrusting a wallet into her hands knocked at the door of a house beside a store the man who opened it stared at them and when larry had drawn him aside called his wife she took hettys chilled hand in both her own and the storekeeper smiled at larry  you come right along and put some of my things on he said then you are going with me to have breakfast at the hotel and talk to the judge i guess the women arent going to have any use for us  it was some time later when they came back to the store and for just a minute grant saw hetty alone she was dressed very plainly in new garments and blushed when he looked gravely down on her  that dress is not good enough for you he said it is very different from what you have been accustomed to  hetty glanced at him shyly you will have very few dollars to spare larry until the troubles through she said and you will be my husband in an hour or two     xxx  larrys wedding day   hetty was married in haste without benefit of clergy while several men with resolute faces kept watch outside the judges door and two who were mounted sat gazing across the prairie on a rise outside the town after the declarations were made and signed the judge turned to hetty who stood smiling bravely though her eyes were a trifle misty by larrys side  now i have something to tell your husband mrs grant he said you will have to spare him for about five minutes  hettys lips quivered for she recognized the gravity of his tone and it was not astonishing that for a moment or two she turned her face aside she had endeavoured to look forward hopefully and banish regrets but the prosaic sordidness of the little dusty office and the absence of anything that might have imparted significance or dignity to the hurried ceremony had not been without their effect she had seen other weddings in new york as well as in the cattle country and knew what pomp and festivities would have attended hers had she married with her fathers goodwill after all it was the greatest day in most womens lives and she felt the unseemliness of the rite that had made her and larry man and wife still the fact remained and brushing her misgivings away she glanced up at her husband  it must concern us both now she said may i hear  well said the judge who looked a trifle embarrassed i guess you are right and larry would have to tell you but its not a pleasant task to me it is just thiswe cant keep you and your husband any longer in this town  are you against us too hetty asked with a flash in her eyes i am not afraid  the judge made her a little respectful inclination you are torrance of cedars daughter and everyone knows the kind of grit there is in that family while i knew the cattlemen would raise a good deal of unpleasantness when i married you i did it out of friendliness for larry but it is my duty to uphold the law and i cant have your husbands friends and your fathers cowboys making trouble here  larry said the girl tremulously we must go on again  grants face grew stern no he said you shall stay here in spite of them until you feel fit to ride for the railroad  just then a man came in battersly saw torrance with the sheriff and clavering and quite a band of cowboys ride by the trail forks an hour ago he said they were heading for hamlins but theyd make this place in two hours when they didnt find larry there  there was an impressive silence hetty shuddered and the fear in her eyes was unmistakable when she laid her hand on her husbands arm  we must go she said it would be too horrible if you should meet him  mrs grant is right said the storekeeper we know torrance of cedar and if you stayed here larry you and she might be sorry all your lives now you could by riding hard make canada tomorrow  grant stifled a groan and though his face was grim his voice was compassionate as he turned to hetty  are you very tired he said gently it must be the saddle again  hetty said nothing but she pressed his arm and her eyes shone mistily when they went out together half an hour later they rode out of the town and grant turned to her when the clustering houses dipped behind a billowy rise and they were once more alone in the empty prairie with their faces towards canada  i am most ashamed to look at you but you will forgive me little girl he said there are brighter days before us than your wedding one and by and by i hope you will not be sorry you have borne so much for me  hettys lips quivered a little but the pride of the cattlebarons shone in her eyes i have nothing to forgive and am only very tired she said i shall never be sorry while you are kind to me and i would have ridden to canada if i had known that it would have killed me the one thing i am afraid of is that you and he should meet  they rode on speaking but seldom as the leagues went by for grant had much to think of and hetty was very weary indeed she swayed unevenly in her saddle while the long billowy levels shining in the sunlight rolled back as it were interminably to them and now and then only saved herself from a fall by a clutch at the bridle there were times when a drowsiness that would scarcely be shaken off crept upon her and she roused herself with a strenuous effort and a horrible fear at her heart knowing that if her strength failed her the blood of husband or father might be upon her head  the sky was blue above them the white sod warm below and already chequered here and there with green and advancing in long battalion crane and goose and mallard came up from the south to follow the sun towards the pole the iron winter had fled before it and all nature smiled but hetty who had often swept the prairie at a wild gallop with her blood responding to the thrill of reawakening life that was in everything rode with a set white face and drooping head and larry groaned as he glanced at her  late in the afternoon they dismounted and hetty lay with her head upon his shoulder while they rested amidst the grass the provisions the storekeeper had given them were scattered about but hetty had tasted nothing and grant had only forced himself to swallow a few mouthfuls with difficulty he had thrown an arm about her and she lay with eyes closed motionless  suddenly he raised his head and looked about him save for the sighing of the warm wind the prairie was very still and a low white rise cut off from sight the leagues they had left behind but though a man from the cities would have heard nothing at all larry straining his ears to listen heard a sound just audible creep out of the silence for a moment he sat rigid and intent wondering if it was made by a flight of cranes but he could see no dusky stain on the blue beyond the rise and his fingers closed upon the rifle as the sound grew plainer it rose and fell with a staccato rhythm in it and he recognized the beat of hoofs turning he gently touched the girl  hetty you must rouse yourself he said with a pitiful quiver in his voice  the girl slowly lifted her head and glanced about her in a halfdazed fashion then with an effort she drew one foot under her and again the fear shadowed her face  oh she said theyre coming lift me dear  larry gently raised her to her feet but it was a minute or two before she could stand upright and the mans face was haggard when he lifted her to the saddle  i think the end has come he said you can ride no farther  hetty swayed a little but she clutched the bridle and a faint sparkle showed in her halfclosed eyes  they want to take you from me we will go on until we drop she said  larry got into the saddle though he did not know how he accomplished it and looked ahead anxiously as he shook the bridle away on the rim of the prairie there was a dusky smear and he knew it was a birchbluff which would if they could reach it afford them shelter in the open he would be at the cowboys mercy but a desperate man might at least check some of the pursuers among the trees and he was not sure that torrance whose years must tell would be among them there was a very faint hope yet  they went on at a gallop though the horses obtained at windsor were already jaded and very slowly the bluff grew higher glancing over his shoulder grant saw a few moving objects straggle across the crest of the rise they seemed to grow plainer while he watched them and more appeared behind  we will make the bluff before them he said hoarsely ride  he drove his heels home but the beast he rode was flagging fast when knowing how torrances cowboys were mounted he glanced behind again he could see them distinctly now straggling with wide hats bent by the wind and jackets fluttering across the prairie here and there a riflebarrel glinted and the beat of their horses hoofs reached him plainly one riding furiously a few lengths ahead of the foremost he guessed was clavering and he fancied he recognized the sheriff in another but he could not discern torrance anywhere he turned his eyes ahead and watched the bluff rise higher though the white levels seemed to flit back to him with an exasperating slowness beyond it a faint grey smear rose towards the blue but the jaded horse demanded most of his attention for the sod was slippery here and there where the snow had lain in a hollow and the beast stumbled now and then  still the birches were drawing nearer and hetty holding ahead of him though the roar of hoofs behind him told that the pursuers were coming up fast he was not certain yet that he could reach the trees before they came upon him and was clawing with one hand at his rifle when hetty cried out faintly  there are more of them in front  grant set his lips as a band of horsemen swung out of the shadows of the bluff his eyes caught and recognized the glint of sunlight on metal but in another moment his heart leaped for through the drumming of their hoofs there came the musical jingle of steel and he saw the men were dressed in blue uniform he swung up his hat exultantly and his voice reached the girl hoarse and strained with relief  we are through they are united states cavalry  the horsemen came on at a trot until grant and the girl rode up to them then they pulled up and when grant had helped hetty down their officer who wheeled his horse sat gazing at them curiously grant did not at once recognize him but hetty gasped  larry she said faintly its jack cheyne  grant drew her hand within his arm and walked slowly forward past the wondering troopers then he raised his broad hat  i claim your protection for my wife captain cheyne he said  cheyne sat very still a moment looking down on him with a strained expression in his face and grant who saw it glanced at hetty she was leaning heavily upon him her garments spattered with mire but he could not see her eyes then cheyne nodded gravely  mrs grant can count upon it he said those men were chasing you  yes said grant one of them is the sheriff i believe he intends to arrest me  sheriff slocane  yes i shall resist capture by him but i heard that the civil law would be suspended in this district and if that has been done i will give myself up to you  cheyne nodded again give one of the boys your rifle and step back with mrs grant in the meanwhile you are on parole  he said something sharply and there was a trample of hoofs and jingle of steel as the troopers swung into changed formation they sat still as the cattlemen rode up and when clavering reined his horse in a few lengths away from them cheyne acknowledged his salute  we have come after a notorious disturber of this district who has i notice taken refuge with you he said i must ask you to give him up  im sorry said cheyne firmly it cant be done just yet  clavering glanced at the men behind himand there were a good many of them all without fear and irresponsible then he looked at the little handful of troopers and cheynes face hardened as he saw the insolent significance of his glance  hadnt you better think it over the boys are a little difficult to hold in hand and we cant go back without our man he said  cheyne eyed him steadily mr grant has given himself up to me if there is any charge against him it shall be gone into in the meanwhile draw your men off and dismount if you wish to talk to me  clavering sat perfectly still with an ironical smile on his lips be wise and dont thrust yourself into this affair which does not concern you or you may regret it he said here is a gentleman who will convince you  he backed his horse as another man rode forward and with an assumption of importance addressed cheyne now he said we dont want any unpleasantness but i have come for the person of larry grant and i mean to take him  will you tell me who i have the honour of addressing said cheyne  sheriff slocane i have a warrant for larry grant and you will put me to any inconvenience in carrying it out at your peril  cheyne smiled drily then as it is evidently some days since you left home i am afraid i have bad news for you you are superseded mr slocane  the sheriffs face flushed darkly claverings grew set and there was an angry murmur from the men behind them  boys said clavering are you going to be beaten by larry again  there was a trampling of hoofs as some of the cowboys edged their horses closer and the murmurs grew louder but cheyne flung up one hand  another word and ill arrest you mr clavering he said sling those rifles all of you i have another troop with horses picketed behind the bluff  there was sudden silence until the sheriff spoke boys he said dont be blamed fools when it isnt any use larry has come out on top again but i dont know that i am sorry i have done with him and the cattlemen  the men made no further sign of hostility and cheyne turned to the sheriff thank you he said now i have to inform you that this district is under martial law and i have been entrusted within limits with jurisdiction if you and mr clavering have any offences to urge against grant i shall be pleased to hear you in that case you can tell your men to picket their horses and follow me to our bivouac  the two men dismounted and while hetty sat trembling amidst the birches talked for half an hour in cheynes tent then clavering who saw that they were gaining little lost his head and stood up white with anger  we are wasting time he said still i warn you that the state will hold you responsible if you turn that man loose again our wishes can still command a certain attention in high places  cheyne smiled coldly i shall be quite prepared to account for whatever i do the state i fancy is not to be dictated to by the cattlemens committees it is of course no affair of mine but i cant help thinking that it will prove a trifle unfortunate for one or two of you that when you asked for more cavalry you were listened to  well said the sheriff dejectedly i quite fancy it will be but im not going to worry the cattlemen made it blamed unpleasant for me what was i superseded for any way  incapacity and corruption i believe cheyne said drily  clavering stood still a moment with an unpleasant look in his eyes but the sheriff who seemed the least disconcerted touched his arm  you come along before you do something you will be sorry for he said im not anxious for any unnecessary trouble and it would have been considerably more sensible if i had stood in with the homesteadboys  they went away and cheyne led larry who had been confronted with them back to where hetty was sitting  i understand the men left your father behind some distance back he said he was more fatigued than the rest and his horse went lame your husbands case will have consideration but i scarcely fancy he need have any great apprehension and i must try to make you comfortable in the meanwhile  hetty glanced up at him with her eyes shining and quivering lips thank you she said quietly larry i am so tired  cheyne called an orderly and ten minutes later led her to a tent your husband placed you in my charge and i must ask for obedience he said you will eat and drink what you see there and then go to sleep i will take good care of mr grant  he drew larry away and sat talking with him for a while then bade an orderly find him a waterproof sheet and rug larry was asleep within ten minutes and the moon was shining above the bluff when he awakened and moved to the tent where hetty lay drawing back the canvas he crept in softly and dropped almost reverently on one knee beside her he could hear her faint restful breathing and the little hand he felt for was pleasantly cool as he stooped and touched her forehead with his lips the fingers closed a trifle on his own and the girl moved in her sleep larry she said drowsily larry dear  grant drew his hand away very softly and went out with his heart throbbing furiously to find cheyne waiting in the vicinity his face showed plain in the moonlight and it was quietly grave but grant once more saw the expression in it that had astonished him now however he understood it and cheyne knew that he did so they stood quite still a moment looking into each others eyes  mrs grant is resting well cheyne asked  yes said larry i owe a good deal to you  it did not express what they felt but they understood each other and cheyne smiled a little you need not thank me yet your case will require consideration and if the new sheriff urges his predecessors charge i shall pass it on in the meantime i have sent to windsor for a buggy in which you can take mrs grant away tomorrow  it was early next morning when the buggy arrived and cheyne who ordered two troopers to lead the hired horses had a hasty breakfast served when the plates had been removed he turned to hetty with a smile  i have decided to release your husbandon condition that he drives straight back to his homestead and stays there with you he said the state has undertaken to keep order and give every man what he is entitled to now and if we find mr grant has a finger in any further trouble i shall blame you  he handed hetty into the buggy passed the reins to larry and stood alone looking after them as they drove away hetty turned to her husband with a blush in her cheek  larry she said softly i have something to tell you  grant checked her with a smile i have guessed it already and it means a new responsibility  i dont understand said hetty  again the little twinkle showed in larrys eyes well he said quietly that you should have taken me when you had men of his kind to choose from means a good deal i wouldnt like you to find out that you had been mistaken hetty     xxxi  torrance rides away   it was late at night and miss schuyler sitting alone in hettys room found the time pass very heavily she had raised her voice in warning when the cowboys mounted the night grant had ridden away with hetty and had seen the fugitives vanish into the darkness but since then she had had no news of them for while breckenridge had arrived at cedar the next day in custody of two mounted men nobody would tell him what had really happened her first impulse had been to ask for an escort to the depot and take the cars for new york but she was intensely anxious to discover whether hetty had evaded pursuit and her pride forbade her slipping away without announcing her intention to torrance who had not yet come back to the range she felt that something was due to him especially as she had not regained the house unnoticed when the pursuit commenced  rising she moved restlessly up and down the room but that in no way lessened the suspense and sitting down again she resolutely took up a book but she listened instead of reading it there was however no sound from the prairie and the house seemed exasperatingly still  you will have to shake this nervousness off or you will make a fool of yourself before that man she muttered  she felt that she had sat there a very long while though the clock showed that scarcely an hour had passed when at last there was a rattle of wheels and a trampling of hoofs outside the great door opened and after that there was an apparently interminable silence until hettys maid came in  if it is convenient mr torrance would like to speak to you she said  flora schuyler rose and followed the girl down the corridor but her heart beat faster than usual when the door of torrances room closed behind her the stove was no longer lighted and torrance stood beside the hearth which was littered with halfconsumed papers and miss schuyler who knew his precision in dress noticed that he still wore the bespattered garments he had ridden in but it was the grimness of his face and the weariness in his pose which seized her attention and aroused a curious sympathy for him he glanced at her sharply with stern dark eyes  i have to thank you for coming but i am going to talk plainly he said you connived at the meetings between my daughter and the rascally adventurer who has married her  they are married exclaimed miss schuyler in her eagerness and the next moment felt the blood rise to her face as she realized that she had blundered in admitting any doubt upon the subject i mean of course that i wondered whether mr grant could have arranged it so soon  you seem to attach a good deal of importance to the ceremony torrance said with a bitter smile marriage is quite easy in this country  miss schuyler was not deficient in courage of one kind and she looked at him steadily i came down to speak to you because it seemed your due she said but i have no intention of listening to any jibes at my friends  torrance made her a little halfrespectful and halfironical inclination then will you be good enough to answer my question  though most of the few meetings were accidental i went with hetty intentionally on two occasions because it seemed fitting  it seemed fitting that a girl should betray her father to the man who wanted to ruin him supply him with the dollars that helped him in his scheme and more than all warn him of each move we made well my standard is not very high but the most cruel blow i have had to bear was the discovery that my daughter had fallen so far  the hoarseness of his voice and the sight of the damp upon his forehead had a calming effect upon miss schuyler her anger against the old man had given place to pity for she decided that what had passed would have excited most mens suspicions and it was not in hettys defence alone she made an effort to undeceive him  i am going to answer you plainly and i think an examination of hettys chequebook and the money she left behind will bear me out she said once only did hetty give mr grant any dollarsfifty of them i think to feed some hungry children he would not take them until she assured him that they were a part of a small annuity left her by her mother and that not one of them came from you i also know that mr grant allowed his friends to suspect him of being bribed by you sooner than tell them where he obtained the dollars in question the adventurer dealt most honourably with you your daughter twice disclosed your plans once when clavering had plotted grants arrest and again when had she not done so it would most assuredly have led to the destruction of the cattletrain mr clavering came near making a horrible blunder on that occasion and but for hettys warning not a head of your stock would have reached omaha  her tone carried conviction with it as did the flash in her eyes but torrances smile was sardonic you would try to persuade me larry saved the train out of goodwill to us  he did it knowing what it was going to cost him to prevent the men he led starting on a course of outrage and lawlessness  and they have paid him for it  i fancy that is outside the question said miss schuyler twice when every good impulse that is in our kind laid her under compulsion hetty warned the man she loved but at no other time did a word to your prejudice pass her lips and if she had spoken it grant would not have listened hetty was loyal and he treated you with a fairness that none of you merited you sent the sheriff a bribe and an order for his arrest and by inadvertence it fell into his hands he brought it back here unopened at his peril  torrance looked at her in astonishment he brought back my letter to the sheriff  yes there was nothing else a man of that kind could have done  torrance stood silent for a space and then stooping picked up a halfburnt paper from the hearth glanced at it with a curious expression and flung it into the embers when it had charred away he turned to miss schuyler  you have shown yourself a good friend he said gravely still you may understand the other side of the question if you listen to me  he turned and pointed to an empty tin case and the charred papers in the hearth that is the end of the plans of half a lifetimeand they were all for hetty i had no one else after her mother was taken from me and i scraped the dollars together for her that she should have what her heart could wish for and the enjoyments her parents had never known and while i did so i and the others built up the prosperity of the cattle country we fed the railroads and built the towns and when we would have rested larry and his friends took hold you see what they have made of ita great industry ruined the country under martial law its commerce crippled and the proclamation that can only mean disaster to us hung out everywhere my daughter turned against meand nothing left me but to go out a wanderer larry has done his work thoroughly and you would have me make friends with him  miss schuyler made a little sympathetic gesture for he seemed very jaded and weary no she said one could not expect too much but hetty is your daughter the only one you have and for her mothers sake you will at least do nothing that would embitter her life  torrance looked at her with a curious smile there is nothing i could do larry and the rabble are our masters now but i will see her once before i go away is there any other thingthat would be a little easieri could do to please you  yes you could release mr breckenridge  torrance turned and struck a bell i had almost forgotten him will you wait and see me do what you have asked me  in a few minutes more breckenridge was ushered in he smiled at miss schuyler and made torrance a slight dignified salutation torrance acknowledged it courteously  you have yourself to blame for any inconvenience you have been put to mr breckenridge he said you conspired to assist your partner in an undertaking you could not expect me to forgive  no said breckenridge i offered to ride with larry and he would not have me i went without him knowing it and made my plans myself  this is the truth  breckenridge straightened himself and looked at torrance with a little flash in his eye you must take my wordi shall not substantiate it if you had had an army corps of cutthroats ready to do what you told them that night larry would have gone alone  torrance nodded gravely it is taken at least you bluffed us into following you  yes and breckenridge smiled i did i also prevented my companion shooting one of your friends as he seemed quite anxious to do i dont wish to hurt your feelings sir but i have not the least regret for anything i did that night  then you are still very bitter against me  breckenridge considered no sir the one man i am bitter against is clavering now it may sound presumptuous and not come very well from me but i believe that clavering for his own purposes forced your hand and i had a certain respect for you if only because of your thoroughness you see one cant help realizing that you can look at every question quite differently  torrance smiled drily then if you are not too proud to be my guest tonight i should be glad of your company and will find you a horse to take you back to fremont when it suits you  breckenridge for some reason that was not very apparent seemed pleased to agree but a faint smile just showed in torrances eyes when he went out again then he turned to miss schuyler  i wonder what mr clavering has done to win everybodys dislike he said you do not seem anxious to plead for him  flora schuylers face grew almost vindictive no she said i dont i can however mention one thing i find it difficult to forgive him when you promised him hetty he had found favour with her maid and made the most of the fact it was not flattering to your daughter or my friend he may not have told you that he promised to marry her  torrance stared at her a moment a dark flush rising to his forehead you are quite sure  ask the girl said flora schuyler  torrance struck the bell again and waited until the maid came in i understand mr clavering promised to marry you he said very quietly you would be willing to take him  the girls face grew a trifle pale and she glanced at miss schuyler who nodded encouragingly  yes she said  torrance smiled but miss schuyler did not like the glint in his eyes then he said with incisive distinctness if you are in the same mind in another week he shall  the girl went out and torrance who had watched her face turned to miss schuyler i guess that young woman will be quite equal to him he said well i am putting my house in order and i will ride over once and see hetty before i leave cedar you will stay here until she comes back to fremont any way  miss schuyler promised to do so and stayed two days as did breckenridge who eventually rode to fremont with her he was very quiet during the journey and somewhat astonished his companion by gravely swinging off his broad hat when they pulled upon the crest of a rise  i wonder if you would listen to something i wish to tell you he said the trouble is that it requires an explanation  flora schuyler glanced at him thoughtfully for she recognized the symptoms now breckenridge appeared unusually grave and there was a little flush on his forehead and a diffidence she had not hitherto seen there in his eyes  i can decide about the rest when i have heard the explanation she answered  well said breckenridge slowly i came out west so to speak because i was under a cloud now i had never done anything distinctly bad but my one ability seemed to consist in spending money and when i had got through a good deal of it my friends sent me here which was perhaps a little rough on your country well as it happened i fell in with men and women of the right kindlarry and somebody else who did more for me that made a difference and while i was realizing how very little i had got for the time and dollars i had wasted affairs began to happen in the old country and i should have the responsibility of handling a good many of them if i went back there now it sounds abominably egotistical but you see what it is leading to  miss schuyler who had no difficulty on that point regarded him thoughtfully breckenridge was a handsome young englishman and she had liked him from the first larry had fallen to another and that perhaps counted for more than a little to breckenridge but she had seen more than one friend of hers contented with the second best still she sighed before she met his gaze  i think you must make it a little plainer she said  well said breckenridge quietly it is just this you have done a good deal for me already and i almost dare to fancy i could be a credit to you if you would do a little more while it would carry conviction to my most doubting relatives if you went back to the old country with me they would only have to see you  flora schuyler smiled this is serious mr breckenridge  breckenridge made her a little inclination and while in a curious fashion it increased flora schuylers liking for him she recognized that he was no longer the lighthearted and irresponsible young englishman she had met a few months ago he too had borne the burden and there was a gravity in his eyes and a slight hardening of his lips that had its meaning  i never was more serious in my life madam he said i know that i might have spokennot more respectfully but differentlybut when i am too solemn everybody laughs at me  does it not strike you that you have only regarded the affair from one point of view so far  breckenridge nodded i understand but one feels very diffident when he knows the slight value of what he has to offer i should always love you whether you say yes or no for the rest there is a little land in the old country and an income which i believe should be enough for two it seems more becoming to throw myself on your charity  and what would larry do without you asked miss schuyler  the quick enthusiasm in breckenridges face pleased her larrys work is splendidly done already he said he asked nothing for himselfand got no more but now the state is offering every man the rights he fought for the proclamations are out and any citizen who wants it can take up his homestead grant it will be something to remember that i carried his shield but larry has no more need of an armourbearer  i am older than you are  ten years in wisdom and fifty in goodness but i scarcely fancy that more than six months separate our birthdays now i know i am not expressing myself very nicely but you see we cant all be eloquent and perhaps it should count for a little when i tell you that i never made an attempt of the kind before i am however most painfully anxious to convince you  miss schuyler recognized it and liked him the more for the diffidence which he wrapped in hasty speech then she said softly if in six months from now  breckenridge swayed in his saddle but the girls heel was quicker and as her horse plunged the hand he would have laid on her bridle fell to his side  no she said if in six months you are still in the same mind you can come to hastingsonthehudson and speak to me again then you may find me disposed to listen but we will go on to fremont in the meanwhile  breckenridges response was unpremeditated but the halfbroken horse provoked by his sudden movement rose with fore hoofs in the air and then whirled round in a circle its rider laughed exultantly swaying lithely with the big hat still in one hand that disdained the bridle but his face grew grave when there was quietness again and he turned towards the girl  i shall be in the same mind he said for ever and ever  they rode on to fremont and the next day breckenridge drove miss schuyler who was going back to new york the first stage of her journey to the depot a month had passed when one evening torrance rode that way the prairie lying still and silent with a flush of saffron upon its western rim was tinged with softest green but broad across the foreground stretched the broken chocolatetinted clods of the ploughing and the mans face grew grimmer as he glanced at them he turned and watched the long lines of crawling cattle that stretched halfway across the vast sweep of green and larry and his wife who stood waiting him outside the homestead understood his feelings raw soil rent by the harrows and seamed by the seeder and creeping bands of stock were tokens of the downfall of the old régime then torrance drawing bridle sat still in his saddle while hetty and her husband stood by his stirrup  i promised your friend hetty that i would see you before i went away he said i left cedar for the last time a few hours ago and i am riding in to the railroad now the stock you see there are mine and allonbys and the cars are waiting to take them to omaha i shall spend the years that may be left me on the pacific slope  hettys lips quivered and it was larry who spoke  was it necessary sir  torrance smiled grimly yes the state offered me a few paltry concessions and a little of what was all mine by right it didnt seem a fit thing to accept their charity well you have beaten us larry  grants face flushed a little only that the rest will gain more than the few will lose i could almost be sorry sir  torrance swung himself down from the saddle and laid his hand on hettys shoulder  you have chosen your husband among the men who pulled us down and nothing can be quite the same between you and me he said but i am getting an old man and may never see you again  hetty looked up at him with a faint trace of pride in her misty eyes there was nobody among our friends fit to stand beside him she said if you kiss me you will shake hands with larry  i can do both and torrance held out his hand when he turned to grant larry i believe now you tried to do the square thing and there might have been less trouble between us but for clavering i hope you will bear me no ill will and while we cant quite wipe out the bitterness yet by and by we may be friends again  i hope so sir said larry  torrance said nothing further but moving stiffly swung himself into the saddle and slowly rode away hetty watched him with a curious wistfulness in her eyes until he wheeled his horse on the crest of the rise and sat still a moment looking back on them a lonely dusky object silhouetted against the paling sky then he turned again and sank into the shadowy prairie hetty clung a little more tightly to her husbands arm and for a time they stood watching the crawling cattle and dim shapes of the stockriders slowly fade until the last pale flicker of saffron died out and man and beast sank into the night a little cold wind came sighing out of the emptiness and emphasized its silence  hetty shivered larry she said they will never come back  grant drew her closer to him it had to be my dear he said they blocked the way and nothing can stop the people you and iand theybelong to moving on well we will look forward and do what we can for we must be ready to step out when our turn comes and watch the rest go by
